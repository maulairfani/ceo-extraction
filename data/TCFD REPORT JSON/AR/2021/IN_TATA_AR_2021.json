Sustainable Future.\n\nIn our nearly 12-decade journey, we have demonstrated a spirit of resilience and an ability to grow in the face of an evolving environment. However, even after being witness to seminal world events, we were surprised by the speed and extent of change in the last two years and the intensity of its impact. Yet, our approach remained consistent as it stayed agile, re/flecting our philosophy of growing responsibly, growing together and ensuring a sustainable future.\n\nIn all respects, FY 2021-22 was a remarkable year - we reported our best ever /financial performance and demonstrated signi/ficant progress on all strategic priorities as well as our sustainability ambitions. Even as we focussed on improving production, e/fficiency, go-to-market strategy and share of value-added products, we continued to invest in technologies to reduce emissions, drive resource e/fficiency, aid the global transition to a low-carbon future, and build a safer workplace.\n\nWe have set ourselves a target of doubling our capacity during this decade. Strong cash /flows enable us to deleverage the balance sheet, invest in our ambitions and create a headroom for future growth. We are undertaking several initiatives aimed at de-risking the business, especially across procurement and supply chain, and continue to leverage digitalisation to unlock greater value for all stakeholders.\n\nThat is how we build a sustainable future.\n\nWe remain committed to our purpose, building a better future through world-class steel products, in a responsible and sustainable way.\n\nOur best ever year is thus only a beginning, even after so many years.\n\nTo us, that is responsible growth.\n\n## FY 2021-22, a record year for Tata Steel\n\n## 31.03 MnT\n\nCrude steel production\n\nI 2,43,959 crore\n\nTurnover\n\nI 41,749 crore\n\nPro/fit After Tax\n\nI 15,232 crore\n\nDebt repaid\n\n## Contents\n\nReport pro/file\n\n02\n\nPerformance snapshot FY 2021-22\n\n04\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## About Tata Steel\n\n| Corporate portrait       |   08 |\n|--------------------------|------|\n| Operational expanse      |   10 |\n| Product portfolio        |   12 |\n| Introducing our capitals |   16 |\n| Business model           |   18 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Leadership\n\nBoard of Directors\n\n22\n\nChairman's message\n\n24\n\nManagement speak\n\n28\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategy\n\nValue creation imperatives\n\n36\n\nStrategy planning\n\n38\n\nStrategic objectives\n\n40\n\nOur ESG goals\n\n42\n\nContribution to UN SDGs\n\n44\n\nOpportunities\n\n50\n\nRisk management\n\n52\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Stakeholders & Materiality\n\nStakeholder engagement Materiality\n\n56\n\n60\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Value creation\n\nFinancial capital\n\n68\n\nManufactured capital\n\n74\n\nIntellectual capital\n\n78\n\nHuman capital\n\n84\n\nNatural capital\n\n94\n\nSocial and Relationship capital\n\n108\n\nCompliance and ethics\n\n124\n\nAwards and recognition\n\n126\n\nESG indicators factsheet\n\n128\n\nStatutory Reports\n\nBoard's Report\n\n138\n\nAnnexures\n\n158\n\n## Financial Statements\n\nFinancial highlights\n\n270\n\nStandalone\n\n274\n\nConsolidated\n\n390\n\nNotice of AGM\n\n520\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n137",

The Indian economy too, quickly overcame the pandemic's headwinds. India's GDP is estimated to have expanded 8.7% in FY 2021-22 against a contraction of 6.6% in FY 2020-21.\n\nAs we continued to navigate through the pandemic with resilience, the war in Ukraine has triggered another crisis that has brought before us numerous other challenges in the form of strained geopolitical and trade relations.\n\nThe ongoing geopolitical con/flict, re-imposition of lockdown in China on account of fresh COVID-19 cases, global in/flation and continuing supply shortages are expected to adversely impact global GDP growth in 2022. The World Bank expects global growth to decelerate from an estimated 5.5% to 3.2% Commodity and energy prices are expected to remain high in the wake of the con/flict and sanctions, thereby resulting in an increase in global in/flation.\n\nWhile there exist risks of high input costs, the growth of the Indian steel industry is likely to remain stable as domestic demand is expected to remain robust and global supply-demand dynamics may present export opportunities.\n\nFY 2021-22 was a pivotal year for the Company. We demonstrated extraordinary resilience, agility and adaptability, which allowed us to record best-ever EBITDA performance despite continued uncertainties. The Company was able to accelerate business restructuring, innovation and growth.\n\nDuring the /financial year, the Company achieved the highest ever consolidated EBITDA of /uni20B963,830 crore, a growth of 107%, translating into an EBITDA per tonne of /uni20B921,626 and a healthy EBITDA margin of 26%. The Company generated free cash /flow of /uni20B927,185 crore and reduced its net debt by 32% to /uni20B951,049 crore in FY 2021-22.\n\nOn the back of this performance, I am happy to report that the Board of Directors have recommended a dividend of /uni20B951/-/uni00A0per fully paid up equity share and /uni20B912.75 per partly paid-up equity share of the Company, which translates to a highest ever dividend payout of 510% per share. The Board of Directors has also recommended a sub-division of the equity shares in the ratio of 10:1.\n\nBandra Worli Sea Link, Mumbai (Tata Steel's state-of-the-art durable LRPC strands and Tiscon reinforcement bars were used in the construction)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This proposed acquisition is expected to provide signi/ficant opportunity for Tata Steel to develop a state-of-the-art long products complex in the next few years that will leverage synergies with the shared infrastructure of Tata Steel in that area. Some of the other acquisitions during the year were in the areas of mining, ferro alloys and advanced ceramics. The year also saw the Company successfully amalgamate Bamnipal Steel Limited and Tata Steel BSL Limited into and with Tata Steel.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe continued steel cycle upswing saw the Company scaling its business, by way of both organic capital expansion and inorganic acquisitions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs part of its business restructuring exercise, the Company successfully divested its stake in NatSteel Holdings Pte Limited, Singapore for an equity value of /uni20B91,275 crore.\n\nMeanwhile, the Company continued to accelerate its capex allocation for the 6 MnTPA Pellet Plant, the 2.2 MnTPA Cold Roll Mill Complex along with the 5 MnTPA expansion at Kalinganagar. The 6 MnTPA Pellet plant will be commissioned in Q3 FY23, followed by the Cold Roll Mill Complex and the 5/uni00A0MnTPA expansion, which will drive cost savings and product mix enrichment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBenches made of Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composites\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Company has also made progress in the New Materials Business. Tata Steel has the objective to build its business in knowledge and intellectual property intensive and non-cyclical new materials. The Company is exploring Composites, Graphene and Advanced Ceramics as areas of growth. During the year, the Company, through its subsidiary, started working towards building a world-class facility to produce medical materials with a focus on healthcare.\n\nIn Europe, Tata Steel achieved a complete separation of its UK and Netherlands operations in October 2021. Under the new structure, Tata Steel UK and Tata Steel Netherlands will operate as two independent companies pursuing separate strategic paths.\n\nTata Steel continues to invest signi/ficantly in new technologies for digital transformation, with the objective to render a more agile organisation that better responds to changing market dynamics and to make our businesses more resilient.\n\nThe pandemic has acted as a catalyst for accelerating our digital transformation e/fforts across various spheres of our business to ensure workforce safety, business continuity, sustainability and agile decision-making.\n\nTowards this end, this year, we piloted digitising our factories by creating 'Digital Twins', a simulated digital replica of factories through real-time data analytics, thereby opening up possibilities for data-driven 'Smart Factories' in the future.\n\nThe Company has also taken signi/ficant strides to adopt e/fficient clean energy technologies and circular economy projects which underpin our transition to becoming a climate neutral organisation. The most notable project in this area was the commissioning of the 5 TPD CO 2 capture plant at Jamshedpur to extract CO 2 directly from blast furnace gas, a/uni00A0/first in India by a steel company.\n\n5 MnTPA expansion work underway at Tata Steel Kalinganagar\n\nIn acknowledgement of Tata Steel's e/fforts and commitment towards principles of sustainability, the World Steel Association has once again recognised Tata Steel and Tata Steel Europe as Sustainability Champions for the /fifth consecutive year. Tata Steel was also inducted as a member of worldsteel's New Sustainability Charter which looks to generate positive impacts on people, planet and the prosperity of society.\n\nOur CSR initiatives and outreach activities continued to re/flect our endeavour to operate as a socially conscious and responsible organisation which strives to build resilient and empowered communities.\n\nTowards ful/filling these aspirations, Tata Steel's programs across the thematic areas of Education, Nutrition, Health, Livelihood, Water resource management and Women & Youth empowerment reached 2.87 million lives and our employees contributed to over 51,000 hours of volunteering work.\n\nDuring the repeated waves of the pandemic, Tata Steel made every possible e/ffort to serve the community by providing sustenance supplies, counselling and livelihood support. Tata/uni00A0Steel supplied over 80,000 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen, provided vaccination at doorstep and distributed masks and Rapid Antigen Testing (RAT) kits to communities where it operates.\n\nThe Company introduced the Social Security COVID-19 Family Protection Scheme for the families of all the employees, who lost their lives due to the pandemic to ensure an honourable standard of living for their families.\n\nWith the bulk of our population covered by vaccination, the risk of large-scale infections and mortality appears\n\nlow. However, with ramped up health and medical oxygen infrastructure and institution of comprehensive safety measures, Tata Steel remains prepared to ensure e/ffective and rapid response to any fresh surge.\n\nIn conclusion, the Indian economy is expected to remain resilient despite the ongoing geopolitical con/flict which is likely to undermine the world GDP growth. India is expected to remain one of the world's fastest growing large economies. The government's resolve towards faster infrastructure development through supportive policy reforms is expected to catalyse growth.\n\nBest ever /financial performance and a dominant market position provides Tata Steel solid foundations to capitalise on improved infrastructure activity, simplify and transform its business structure, accelerate digital and green innovations and embark on the next level of sustained growth.\n\nI would like to thank Dr. Peter Blauwho/ff and Mr. Aman Mehta for their contributions to the Board of the Company. I also welcome Ms. Farida Khambata, Mr. David Crane and Mr. Noel N. Tata on the Board of the Company.\n\nI thank all our employees for their commitment and engagement towards building a strong, agile and responsible organisation.

How did Tata Steel approach the challenges?\n\nIndeed, the world witnessed signi/ficant volatility and vulnerability on a broad range of issues covering the second wave of the pandemic, the commodity upcycle and the Russia-Ukraine war. All of these have had an impact on people, planet, supply chains and business uncertainties across all corporations globally. The way we have looked at it is to enhance our risk management systems and scenario planning processes, stick to the fundamentals, build agility around our decision-making process, focus on our business and community priorities especially during the pandemic, with COVID care and vaccinations.\n\n## Q. Last year was a year of remarkable performance for Tata Steel. Can you provide an overview of the performance of Tata Steel in FY 2021-22?\n\nWell, in a manner of speaking, the performance for FY 2021-22 re/flected at one level the many years of hard work put in by all our colleagues driving continuous improvement, cost take-out, agile decision-making, restructuring, inorganic growth and downstream focus on value-added products. All of this made us /fit for the upcycle and in spite of huge volatility of raw materials and steel prices, geopolitical uncertainties and supply chain disruptions, we were able to register our best ever /financial performance. So, it's a tribute to all the employees of the Company across all geographies, and to all our stakeholders of the Company who have always supported and been with the Company at all times.\n\nIt is indeed gratifying to report that Tata Steel's consolidated revenue surged 56% to ' 2,43,959 crore and pro/fit after tax increased 410% to ' 41,749 crore. The consolidated crude steel\n\nDriving Excellence at Tata Steel Kalinganagar\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nproduction was at 31.03 MnT, while the total deliveries stood at 29.52 MnT.\n\nIn India, the steel business including Tata Steel Long Products generated revenues of ' 1,35,823 crore, up 53% Y-o-Y. The EBITDA margin for our India operations was around 39% with an EBITDA per tonne of ' 28,863. The crude steel production crossed 19 MnT for the /first time, increasing ~13% on a Y-o-Y basis.\n\nOur Europe business delivered its best ever yearly performance since the acquisition. As European economies recovered from the pandemic, the supply-demand conditions improved, and with improved operating performance, implementation of cost take-out and improvement programs, the business reported strong /financial performance with the EBITDA well in excess of a billion pounds. Revenues from our Europe operations for the year were at ' 90,023 crore and the business generated its highest ever EBITDA since its acquisition of ' 12,164 crore.\n\nConsidering the year's /financial performance and based on the overall review of the business, the Tata Steel Board has recommended a dividend of /uni20B951/- per fully paid-up equity share (510% of face value) and proportionate /uni20B912.75 per partly paid-up equity share, making it the highest ever dividend pay-out in any year for Tata Steel. As part of the overall value creation for the shareholders, the Board has also approved a share sub-division in the ratio of 10:1.\n\n## Q. Deleveraging continued to be your focus area for FY 2021-22. Will this continue in FY 2022-23 as well?\n\nRe-shaping the balance sheet has been an enterprise strategy and priority for the Company in the last four years. We had publicly stated that we will de-lever at least one billion dollars per annum and post the acquisition of Bhushan Steel and the Usha Martin Steel Business, we prioritised the de-leveraging ahead of capital allocation on capex and growth. It was a very critical strategic agenda for the Company and in the last two years, we have reduced our net debt by over ' 50,000 crore. Tata Steel's free cash /flow was ' 27,185 crore in FY 2021-22 ( ' 23,748 crore in FY 2020-21) after taking into account the increase in working capital by ' 9,618 crore due to signi/ficant increase in the value of both raw material and /finished products, consolidated capex spend of ' 10,522 crore and income tax paid of ' 11,902 crore.",

        "page_content": "We were able to achieve our deleveraging target of US$1 bn within the /first six months and prepaid nearly ' 15,000 crore of debt during the year. We reduced our consolidated net debt from ' 75,389 crore at the start of the year to ' 51,049/uni00A0crore as at March 2022. Consequently, our credit metrics have touched some critical milestones, for example, the net debt to EBITDA was lower than 1x (0.8x at the year end) and the net debt to equity was at 0.52x on a consolidated basis. This was well acknowledged by the rating agencies and we have been upgraded to investment grade 'BBB-' credit rating with a positive outlook by S&P.\n\nMoving forward, Tata Steel is committed to balancing its priorities of allocating signi/ficant capital towards value-accretive projects and businesses while also continuing to strengthen its balance sheet through deleveraging. A/uni00A0strong balance sheet with healthy cash /flows will enable us to fuel our future growth ambitions and weather any economic uncertainties.\n\n## Q. What are your capex plans for the Company in FY 2022-23?\n\nOur long-term vision is to grow in India, keeping pace with the growth of demand in the country. Based on our assessment of the opportunities in the Indian market, we will calibrate our growth plans and timing for implementation. We are currently focussed on completing our expansion project in Kalinganagar to create a state-of-the-art 8 MnTPA site. During FY 2022-23, we will be commissioning the Pellet Plant, which is 70% complete, and the phase-wise commissioning of the Cold Rolling Mill Complex, starting with the pickling line and the cold rolling mill. Both are margin expansionary projects as part of the overall expansion project in Kalinganagar. This expansion in Kalinganagar is focussed on higher value-added products including plates, coated products, advanced high strength steels and products for newer applications.\n\nDuring FY 2022-23, Tata Steel will focus on growing its steelmaking capacity in India, adding to our downstream value-added products, strengthening our supply chain through necessary investments in logistics and infrastructure, investments in newer ventures and services & solutions, and de/fining a de-carbonised future for our Europe business. Apart from the above, we are working on a number of downstream projects which will continue adding value to our product portfolio. We are ready to commission the /first phase of doubling our ductile iron pipes facilities in Tata Metaliks in Kharagpur. Some of the other notable ones where we will be allocating capital spend includes setting up a 0.5 MnTPA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring FY 2022-23, one of the largest capital allocations will be on the acquisition of Neelachal Ispat Nigam/uni00A0Limited/uni00A0(NINL), within the /first quarter of the /financial year. NINL is particularly important given its proximity to Tata Steel's Kalinganagar site and its potential to become the long products business hub in the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSpecial Bar and Wire Rod-Combi Mill in Jamshedpur which is focussed on the automotive market. We are also starting capital spend on doubling the tinplate capacity by expanding the plant by 0.3 MnTPA.\n\nDuring FY 2022-23, one of the largest capital allocations will be on the acquisition of Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited (NINL), within the /first quarter of the /financial year. NINL is particularly important given its proximity to Tata Steel's Kalinganagar site and its potential to become the long products business hub in the future. Although the plant has been non-operational for some time, we expect to start operations in about six months from the transaction closure in a phased manner and will endeavour to ramp-up to its rated billet making capacity of 1.1 MnTPA within 12 months, subject to receiving regulatory clearances.\n\nOur strategy and timing of expansion of steel capacity in India will be based on the underlying demand projections, regulatory conditions, balance sheet prudence and value enrichment of the product portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Q. Tata Steel has also ventured into New Materials Business. How do you see the future of this business?\n\nIn the New Materials business, we are diversifying our product o/ffering beyond steel by introducing new materials in three major verticals - Composites, Graphene and Medical Materials & Devices. We have already put in place a/uni00A0graphene production capacity of 100 TPA and now we are investing in the production of medical materials at scale, which has signi/ficant market opportunity in India. The /first medical material of choice is Hydroxyapatite - a/uni00A0calcium phosphate-based ceramic-used in orthopaedic coating on implants, dental implants, bone /fillers, cosmetics as well as consumer products. We believe that our strengths of strong materials research and development, branding and marketing & sales reach, provide us an opportunity to deliver world-class quality of bio-ceramics through a reliable supply chain to customers at a competitive cost and scale.\n\n## Q. How do you see the Russia-Ukraine con/flict impact Tata Steel's overall business?\n\nThe war has certainly created supply constraints of steel, especially in Europe as Russia and Ukraine were among the largest exporters of /finished steel to Europe before the con/flict. Till recently, Russia has been the second largest\n\nIntegrated Sinter Plant Operations Centre (iSPOC) initiative to enable remote operations of Sinter Plant at Jamshedpur Works\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsupplier of PCI (Pulverised Coal Injection) coal globally after Australia. It is well-known that Russia represented the largest share of energy (thermal coal and natural gas) exports to Europe. As a result of the con/flict, therefore, there have been signi/ficant supply disruptions and upward price pressures and volatility in steel prices, coking coal, iron ore, freight and natural gas. As the con/flict lingers, it will have second order macro-economic e/ffects on growth rates, in/flation and monetary policy in various countries.\n\n## Q. What is Tata Steel doing to advance its Corporate Sustainability Practices?\n\nFor Tata Steel, sustainability is the core of its corporate DNA since inception 115 years ago. It has become more formalised in recent years. We also work on prioritising the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We have prioritised 15 SDGs based on how we impact them and, in turn, how these SDGs/uni00A0impact us.\n\nWithin the SDGs, we are focussed on the targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, speci/fic fresh-water consumption and circular economy. We are also striving to enhance our green product portfolio. Last year, our products under Rebar and Tube categories earned their GreenPro Ecolabel Certi/fication.\n\nIn the thought leadership space, we are active in a number of global platforms including in the TCFD and the recently launched Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), working towards improvement of disclosure practices and nature positive outcomes. As a responsible corporate, we support the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and strive to integrate its 10 principles in all facets of our business. Tata Steel has also earned the distinction of becoming the /first steel producer in the world to join the Sea Cargo Charter (SCC) to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions in ocean trade.\n\nIn pursuance of our decarbonisation targets, Tata Steel commissioned the 5 tonnes per day (TPD) CO 2 capture plant to extract CO 2 directly from blast furnace gas and introduced electric vehicles in our /fleet for transportation of steel. Addressing water sustainability through Reduce, Reuse, Recycle framework, Tata Steel commissioned a 3,000 KLD water treatment plant at Noamundi mines to ensure clean water for the community.\n\nTata Steel's commitment to investing in circular economy saw us fully commission a 0.5 MnTPA steel recycling plant at Rohtak, Haryana which will contribute to conserving valuable resources and reducing land/fills.",

The global reporting landscape is rapidly evolving with investors and regulators looking for deeper insights on sustainability related risks and opportunities of companies. How is Tata Steel responding to this need?\n\nTata Steel has been an early adopter of sustainability reporting. We were the /first company in India to start publishing Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) based Sustainability Report in 2001, and in FY 2015-16 we adopted the International Integrated Reporting Framework as one of the /first companies in India to do so.\n\nWe have also been participating in Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) assessment since 2012, where we feature amongst the top 10 steel companies in the world. We have also been participating in CDP's Climate Change, Supply Chain and Water disclosures since 2006, 2012 and 2014 respectively.\n\nGoing forward, Tata Steel fully recognises that investors increasingly consider /financial and ESG information in their investment decision-making. The global reporting landscape is also rapidly evolving with alignment of various disclosure standards globally under the IFRS Foundation and we recognise the importance of the newly set up International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) that will harmonise non-/financial reporting globally. We are fully engaged in supporting the development of national and global disclosure regime and their adoption in due course. Tata Steel will stay committed to enhancing transparency in non-/financial reporting in the future.\n\n## Q. You have always shared that People and Community are your foremost priority. How do you demonstrate your commitment towards them?\n\nYes, our people are indeed our most valuable resource and will remain the topmost priority. At Tata Steel, our vision is to build a workplace where we embrace di/fferences in individuals and create an inclusive culture. In our journey towards equity, inclusion and diversity, we are working across our processes of recruitment, sensitisation, retention, and development, besides making relevant investments in infrastructure. Our endeavour is to create an environment that fosters a culture of trust, integrity, empathy and respect for every individual.\n\nIn a landmark initiative, we onboarded transgender persons as Heavy Earth Moving Machinery and Crane operators at our\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmines.

Last year, we contributed ' 406 crore towards CSR expenditure and our programmes reached about 2.87/uni00A0million bene/ficiaries. We continued our work in the areas of healthcare, education, livelihood and providing access to drinking water. We revamped the medical care infrastructure across our operating locations to better deal with health emergencies in the future.\n\nOur signature healthcare program, Maternal and Newborn Survival Initiative (MANSI) bagged the BRICS Solutions for SDGs Award under Good Health and Wellbeing category/uni00A0(SDG/uni00A03).\n\nWe also developed and adopted a business and human rights policy which recognises individuals and communities as holders of human rights and con/firmed our commitment towards upholding human rights as an integral aspect of doing business.\n\nThe community continues to be at the core of our enterprise strategy. The scale of our community engagement throughout the various waves of the pandemic is a testament to our commitment to always working with society, local stakeholders and the region or countries we work in, as a responsible corporate citizen.

        "page_content": "## OPPORTUNITIES\n\n## Attractive growth potential\n\nThe Indian economy is likely to become the third largest economy by 2030, and the steel industry will play a pivotal role in this growth journey. With large raw material reserves, a strong base of technically skilled workforce and one of the fastest growing markets globally, India o/ffers visible structural advantages for the steel industry to /flourish. The country's low per capita steel consumption versus global average provides signi/ficant headroom for growth.\n\n## Well positioned to capitalise on opportunities\n\nThe National Steel Policy 2017 seeks to create a globally competitive steel industry in India with 300 MnTPA steelmaking capacity and 158 kg per capita steel consumption by FY 2030-31. Government-led investment in infrastructure, rapid urbanisation, rising preference for personal mobility, growth in capital goods sector and the government's focus on making India 'Atmanirbhar' are expected to stimulate steel demand in India. With a leadership position in key market segments, world-class production facilities and cost leadership, we plan to double our capacity to 40 MnTPA by 2030, to capitalise on this vast opportunity and contribute towards the nation's development agenda.\n\n## Addressing evolving customer needs\n\nCustomer needs are evolving and the channel deployed to reach the customer is changing. Digital platforms are gaining more traction even in the industrial sectors such as steel. Growing urbanisation will see demand for steel focussed on modularisation, amenable to the fast pace of construction and better aesthetics. With changing demographics and higher a/ffordability, the nature of steel consumption in automotive, white goods and other consumer goods industries is fast evolving. We aspire to be the supplier of choice for discerning customers, driven by a culture of customer-obsession and ability to provide the best products and service experience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustainability driving new business models\n\nClimate change is a challenge for a 'hard-to-abate' sector such as steel. However, it also provides opportunities. With sustainability gaining centre stage globally, and signi/ficant investments being directed towards green technology, we have identi/fied focussed intervention across hydrogen fuel technology, carbon capture and use, and reduction in speci/fic water consumption, among others. Tata Steel Jamshedpur is a national benchmark in CO 2 emission, with other sites improving every year. Speci/fic plans are in place to improve sustainability performance across locations. We also ventured into steel recycling with the /first plant commissioned in Rohtak, to capitalise on increased scrap availability and demand in India, and move towards circular steel manufacturing models.\n\n## CO 2 emission intensity\n\nNational benchmark  - Created by Tata Steel Jamshedpur (as per worldsteel methodology)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Adopting technologies of tomorrow\n\nTata Steel strives to be a technology and innovation leader in the steel industry, leveraging in-house capabilities and building external ecosystems. Through VIVA (Ventures, Innoventure and Alliances), we have been able to build on opportunities provided by the external ecosystem and accelerate our journey towards achieving technology leadership. The Innovent Team focusses on innovation for customers with a deep understanding of their emerging needs. Our collaborations with start-ups have resulted in pilots in carbon capture and use. We plan to engage on more such opportunities across the steel value chain.\n\n## Carbon capture\n\nPilot projects are being driven in collaboration with start-ups\n\n## Creating new revenue streams with adjacent businesses\n\nTechnology and megatrends are creating market opportunities for new materials and applications in existing and emerging sectors. Tata Steel with its portfolio of adjacent businesses is best suited to leverage this trend and, in the process, create new revenue streams that complement the steel business. We are building new businesses in high-potential and technology intensive new materials such as, /fibre reinforced polymer composites, medical materials, and graphene. Our Services and Solutions portfolio includes Pravesh and Nest-In, which provide home solutions and steel-based modular construction solutions, respectively.\n\n## Nest-In\n\nUnique modular construction solutions o/ffered by Tata Steel\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Digitalisation strengthening competitive edge\n\nThe future of work and the future of consumption are evolving, accelerated by the pandemic. Remote operations and digital commerce are the new normal. Digital is no longer just an enabler but is key for creating and unlocking value. Tata Steel is also taking steps to scale Industry 4.0 technologies in its operations. During FY 2021-22, three operating sinter plants in Jamshedpur were merged into a far-site single operation control centre, a /first in India. On the D2C front, we have signi/ficantly scaled up the Aashiyana and DigEca platforms for our individual home builders and small businesses, respectively.\n\n## Three sinter plants\n\nat Jamshedpur merged into far-site single operational control centre\n\n## Becoming future-ready culturally\n\nAt Tata Steel, we have undertaken several 'industry/first initiatives' over the past decades to inculcate a culture of ethics, safety, continuous improvement, environment consciousness and giving back to the community. Our focus on diversity and LGBTQ+ policies are /first-of-its kind. We are also fostering a culture of agility, innovation, health and wellness. Building environmental consciousness is another culture element which we are actively working towards.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The /findings have been indicative of the future trends, potential business risks, and new business opportunities, and have been collated with inputs from stakeholders viz. customers, investors, suppliers, shipping and logistics partners, media, industry associations, government and regulatory bodies, employees including contract employees and union leaders and community representatives.\n\nThe /findings of our materiality exercise have  been classi/fied into 'Focus' (high priority), 'Track' (medium priority) and 'Discuss' (low priority) categories, based on stakeholder impact and contribution to business success in the short, medium, and long terms. The senior leadership has revisited the material economic issues through various stakeholder engagement processes and business reviews. These ESG priorities are integral to our vision of being the 'global steel industry benchmark in value creation and corporate citizenship'.\n\n## Addressing 'Focus' issues\n\nTata Steel's strategic planning process incorporates the economic, environmental, social, and governance material issues relevant for the long-term growth and /financial success of the Company. These issues are critical in de/fining and executing our strategic objectives. We strengthen stakeholder engagement and maintain a comprehensive track of their opinions and business concerns. Strategies and progress against these issues are reviewed periodically by the respective owners, senior management and the Board.\n\nOur material issues along with linked Strategic Objectives/Strategic Enablers and Capitals are mentioned in the tables below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Economic SO1   | Economic SO1                     | Economic SO1

In line with past strategies, the Company aims to balance its growth ambitions while keeping a healthy balance sheet.\n\n## Managing capital inputs and liquidity\n\nThe year under review witnessed stability in the economic condition with fewer business interruptions, improvement in market sentiments as the economy progressed on the path of recovery after severe interruptions due to the pandemic in FY 2020-21. Major inputs to the /financial capital were as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Internal accruals generated a free cash /flow of /uni20B930,516 crore (after considering capex and dividend) which was primarily utilised for investments in Group companies, for funding NINL acquisition and for working capital support to our European operations\n- Short-term funds were raised from banks to the tune of /uni20B94,800 crore to support working capital and economise on interest costs\n\nGain recognised in /financial statements from the amalgamation of Tata Steel BSL Limited with Tata Steel Limited - capital reserve of /uni20B91,761 crore (non-cash)\n\nThe operational improvement programs (Shikhar 25) have earned bene/fits to the business to the tune of /uni20B95,463 crore\n\n## /uni20B950,307 crore\n\nCash Operating Pro/fit (Tata Steel Standalone)\n\n## /uni20B965,900 crore\n\nCash Operating Pro/fit (Tata Steel Consolidated)\n\nBlast Furnace, Tata Steel Meramandali Works\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Managing capital outcomes\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in FY 2020-21 necessitated a sharp focus on cash /flows. The cash /flow focus in our business processes has helped in optimising our working capital through better inventory management, faster collection from debtors and extended credit period from suppliers.\n\n- \u203a The debt levels reduced marginally by the end of FY 2021-22. The Company had gross debt outstanding of /uni20B937,065 crore as on March 31, 2021 which has now reduced to /uni20B936,525 crore as on March 31, 2022. The cash generated was used for funding inorganic growth opportunities along with internal growth funding for capex.\n- \u203a The Company has restarted its capital expenditure program across various business units like the Cold Rolling Mill and Pellet Plant in Tata Steel Kalinganagar, which are expected to be operationalised shortly and will be margin-accretive to the existing business. The Company incurred a capital expenditure of about /uni20B96,288 crore from the cash generated from the business.\n- \u203a The acquisition of NINL is being /financed through a combination of internal accruals and bridge loans which are expected to be paid down through internal generation of cash in Tata Steel over the next few quarters.\n- \u203a Financing the acquisition of Rohit Ferro-Tech Limited by Tata Steel Mining Limited (TSML) with ~/uni20B9617 crore, through equity investment and inter-corporate loan to TSML.\n- \u203a The Company entered into Asset Transfer Agreement with Stork Ferro and Mineral Industries Private Limited for a cash consideration of /uni20B9155 crore (excluding applicable/uni00A0taxes).\n- \u203a In FY 2021-22, international rating agency S&P upgraded Tata Steel's Corporate Family Rating multiple times to 'BBB-' from 'BB'. With these upgrades, Tata Steel has become investment grade rated entity in the international market. Moody's also upgraded the rating by one notch to 'Ba1'. All the domestic rating agencies also upgraded Tata Steel's rating by one notch to 'AA+'.\n- \u203a Higher declaration of dividend to the shareholders and sub-division of 1 equity share of /uni20B910 each into 10 equity shares of /uni20B91 each for better stock liquidity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## /uni20B9 9, 381 crore\n\nRepayment of long-term borrowings (Tata Steel Standalone)\n\nControl Room, Hot Strip Mill, Tata Steel Kalinganagar Works\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategic focus\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDriving to achieve the best synergies and bene/fits from the acquisitions\n\n- China has been contracting its steel capacities to reduce carbon emissions. This has led to structural changes in the steel industry, giving rise to more regional production and consumption, thereby reducing export capacities and increasing international prices. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments across the world rolled out large stimulus packages, also by way of developing infrastructure projects. The combination of lower supplies and strong stimulus by the economies have taken steel prices higher across the world. Taking advantage of the upcycle, we have continued the pace of deleveraging in FY 2021-22\n\nStrategic cash war room for strict ground-level monitoring of the cash, targeted at /fixed cost reduction and monitoring of working capital\n\nThe key emphasis of the Company's /financial policy continues to be on balancing growth ambitions and maintaining a healthy balance sheet\n\n<!-- image -->",

Multiple interventions for skill building of employees were undertaken during the year. Nine new schools of excellence were launched in the prioritised areas and a new batch for an evening diploma program was also introduced. Almost 1,000 cadre trainees spent signi/ficant time at SNTI, learning and developing themselves to become industry-ready. Mechanisms have been put in place to ensure relevance of curriculum to the changing business needs. Focus was given to upskill/reskill the large pool of vendor employees through speci/fic initiatives like 'VSD 2.0' and 'Super 40'. Imbibing the mantra of 'agility', the Learning and Development (L&D) team could ensure that the pandemic did not impact the learning of individuals. In fact, adoption and optimum use of digital technologies helped accelerate anytime-anywhere learning mechanisms. This is manifested in the fact that in FY 2021-22, the 'Training Days Per Employee' KPI jumped to 11.51 (~80% increase over the FY 2020-21 /figure of 6.38). L&D assets and services could also be monetised to the tune of ' 15 crore in FY 2021-22.\n\n## Employee productivity\n\nImproving productivity is crucial for remaining competitive. Overcoming the challenges posed by subsequent waves of COVID-19, we continued our productivity improvement journey through various focussed initiatives. We strived to achieve benchmark performance with initiatives such as 'Sunehre Bhavishya Ki Yojana 2.0 (SBKY 2.0)' and 'Internal Talent Bank' for managing redundancy. Agility and technology continued to play a central role in improving organisational performance with our productivity reaching 854 tonnes/employee/year.

The Safety Excellence Journey (SEJ) Committee, under the guidance of the Apex Safety Council, works for policy formulations. Their directives are cascaded through the six Apex Safety sub-committees, which further cascades to Divisional Implementation Committees and Area Implementation Committees. Execution of leadership directives is ensured through robust review mechanism across the organisation. We have been working on six safety strategies - build safety leadership capability at all levels to achieve Zero Harm, strengthen deployment of contractor safety management standards, improve competency and capability for hazard identi/fication and risk management, improve road and rail safety, excellence in process safety management, and establish industrial hygiene and improve occupational health. Leveraging digital and technology in safety has also been identi/fied as a key long-term initiative. The enablers of di/fferent strategies are embedded with the executive's annual performance contract and are linked with remuneration. The overall objective is to achieve global benchmark levels by FY 2024-25 and Zero Harm by FY 2029-30, ushering a new way of working through data-driven decision-making.\n\nDriving a culture of Safety\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key enablers and initiatives in FY 2021-22\n\nSafety Leadership Development Centre, Tata Steel Jamshedpur Works\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Building safety leadership capability at all levels to achieve Zero Harm\n\nTo bring a holistic approach towards the adoption of digital and technology and enable Tata Steel's Safety Excellence Journey to achieve the overall objective of Zero Harm, an apex Digital and Technology Safety Sub-committee was formulated with a two-pronged approach:\n\nMaximise leverage of current digital initiatives\n\nDesign new initiatives to bolster our key strategies\n\nFocus on the dissemination of learning from safety standards continued during the year, with a total of 44 safety standards simpli/fied, and e-learning modules developed, inculcating knowledge about safety standards among the workforce. In FY 2021-22, the organisation-wide deployment of the learning and recommendations from fatalities over the past 15 years was continued with an endeavour towards achieving Tata Steel's Safety vision of Zero Harm. As many as 100 recommendations generated from the past fatal incidents have been implemented at 5,325 identi/fied locations.\n\nThe second cycle of 'SHE Excellence Awards' was/uni00A0held through virtual platforms to reinforce positive safety behaviour.\n\nAt our UK operations, we carried out over 140 leadership tours to focus on machinery and workplace equipment safety across our sites and o/ffices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Improving competency and capability for hazard identi/fication and risk management\n\nThe need to deploy competent workforce for its technology-driven operations also requires Tata Steel to constantly enhance their competency and capability on various safety standards. A workforce of 41,292 (employees-4,152, contractors-37,140) was trained on various safety standards at the Safety Leadership Development Centre (SLDC) during the year.\n\nAlso, 71% of Tata Steel's employees have been trained on the simpli/fied safety standards in Phase-1 e-learning assignment, and 55% in Phase-2 e-learning assignment.\n\nCross-functional assessment on 5S and Visual Workplace Management (VWM) across Tata Steel was rolled out to mitigate shop/floor risks and create awareness among workforce about the importance of organising spaces so that work can be performed e/fficiently, e/ffectively, and safely.\n\nGoing forward, Tata Steel will train and certify its entire workforce at SLDC at all major manufacturing locations and upgrade facilities at its Safety Excellence Centre by introducing practical safety training modules.\n\nCommitted to Zero Harm\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nValue\n\nCreation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Contractor Safety Risk Management\n\nContractor Safety Management Standard (CSMS), which governs contractor safety at Tata Steel, has established guiding policies and procedures on safety responsibilities for contractors and their employees. The deployment of CSMS now includes within its scope all stockyards, Steel Processing Centres (SPCs) and Tata Steel Group Companies.\n\nA total of 1,257 high risk job vendors were assessed across locations; 62 of them were approved for 4-star rating, and one for the most stringent 5-star rating\n\n1,150 high risk job supervisors were covered in pro/ficiency upgradation program (Vendor Upskilling 2.0), of which 491 were certi/fied in platinum category\n\nThis year, a behaviour-based safety program, 'GHAR SE GHAR TAK,' has been designed and developed to improve behaviour and discipline of contract workforce, as families play an important role for the employees to work stress-free and behave safely at the workplace as well as outside or at home.\n\nIn the past year, over 150 skill sets were identi/fied for certi/fication, and classroom modules and e-learning modules were developed, through which 100% deployment of skill certi/fied workforce entering Tata Steel Jamshedpur, Tata Steel Kalinganagar and Raw Material locations was ensured. This skill certi/fication program has also been extended to Tata Steel Meramandali.\n\nUpgrading skills of contract workmen from Silver and Gold to Platinum, and development of model CSM workplaces across locations including SPCs/Business partners, are intended to improve the contractor safety management within Tata Steel. Strengthening the contractor safety management standards at Tata Steel Meramandali and Tata Steel Long Products Limited will be one of the imperative focus areas. Specialised training programmes for vendor employees on identi/fied equipment and processes (Vendor skilling 2.0 and multiskilling) are aimed at creating ubiquity in safety standards across the organisation and universalisation of best practices.

        "page_content": "## Excellence in Process Safety Management (PSM)\n\nProcess Safety Management focusses on eliminating incidents with the potential to result in multiple injuries/ fatalities, as well as causing substantial economic, property and environmental damage, both within the steel manufacturing units and across surrounding communities. The endeavour to make it a 'way of life' was initiated in 2016 with the Centre of Excellence (CoE) framework being embedded in two manufacturing units at Jamshedpur. It has been rolled out in 43 departments and the existing Maintenance Management System has been benchmarked to Tata Steel Europe's Asset Management System to develop and roll out an integrated Asset Management Framework for Tata Steel.\n\nA tableau-based, online Process Safety Performance Indicators (PSPI) dashboard was introduced in 2020, incorporating all process safety-related lag and lead indicators. All available IT systems (SAP, ENSAFE, Process Data, L1/L2 systems) with their various process safety parameters were integrated into the common dashboard, business rules formulated against them, and real time alerts were made key components. The online PSM dashboard has induced timely maintenance of Process Safety Critical Equipment (PSCEs), leading to reductions in failure of critical equipment. It has not only helped reduce Red and Yellow category process incidents, but also injected a cultural change in the way line managers think about managing deviations in process parameters. The Process Safety School of Excellence, a 3-tier capability development (learner, practitioner, expert) system, has been developed to enhance process safety competency of employees.\n\n9% (FY 2020-21 - 86    FY 2021-22 - 78) High potential process incidents over FY 2020-21\n\n5% (FY 2020-21 - 81   FY 2021-22 - 85)\n\n36% (FY 2020-21 - 25 FY 2021-22 - 16) Approval cycle time of management of technological change\n\nOverall PSM maturity assessment score\n\nPSM will be rolled out in the remaining high hazard departments of Tata Steel Meramandali and Tata Steel Long Products Limited along with a PSM audit process to check\n\nmaturity of its deployment. An IT system will be developed for predictive/prescriptive model for process safety incidents, which will enable real time visualisation of risk movement through active barrier's health assessment. Competency development through the Safety School of Excellence will be continued for employees at all locations.\n\nAt our UK operations, we have created a safety app to increase engagement. We now use drone technology, virtual reality and fatigue testing in critical process safety areas to help reduce risk.\n\n## Elimination of road and rail incidents\n\nSafe and e/fficient movement of raw materials and /finished goods via both rail and road is the mainstay of inbound and outbound logistics. While initiatives in the past focussed on improving road and rail safety processes, in FY 2021-22, the focus was on implementation of technological initiatives for road and rail safety improvement along with continued implementation of COVID-19 standard operating guidelines for business continuity. Modi/fied seating arrangements in mass transport facilities were reintroduced during the onset of the second and third wave of COVID-19. Sanitation of public transport within the plant was ensured after each trip as well as IT-enabled alerts were triggered through CCTV feeds, enabling proactive action through the Safety Surveillance Centre.\n\nAmong planned improvements undertaken during the year, digital interventions for real-time monitoring and recording of unsafe acts/conditions on roads through an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (APNR) System, achieved the desired improvement in behavioural issues of road users. Training modules, focussed on competency development of heavy vehicle operators and loco pilots, were introduced with the support of the learning and development team. The Drivers Fatigue Monitoring System (DFMS) was extended to all locations including Tata Steel Meramandali, which again, yielded positive results in heavy vehicle safety management at night. Risks associated with overturning of heavy vehicles, derailments of wagons and dumper toppling, are being addressed through deployment of anti-tilt switch, smart signalling system and e/ffective interlocks for raised dala condition in dumpers; 100% implementation of locking mechanism for Safe Load Indicator (SLI) in pick and carry mobile cranes has been done to prevent crane toppling incidents across locations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nValue\n\nCreation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSafety is a way of life at Tata Steel\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAuto track changing and early warning systems have been installed at 102 strategic locations at Tata Steel Jamshedpur\n\n97 CCTV cameras have been installed for e/ffective video surveillance of road and rail\n\nThe key to enhance road safety and be future-ready is deployment of technological interventions such as anti-tilt switches, e/ffective interlock system for dumpers in dala-raised condition along with strengthening the deployment of DFMS across locations of Tata Steel. Planned improvements in road infrastructure at Tata Steel Jamshedpur, Tata Steel Long Products Limited and Tata Steel Meramandali are to continue along with behavioural safety training programs for heavy vehicle operators.\n\n## Establishing industrial hygiene and/uni00A0improving occupational/uni00A0health\n\nTata Steel implemented a comprehensive industrial hygiene program which included identi/fication of occupational health hazards and risk analysis, assessment of actual exposure through hazard quanti/fication, and implementation of hazard control measures to maintain minimum exposure level and to reduce occupational health-related risks. We also conducted ergonomics risk assessment and implemented related control measures at Jamshedpur Works, in order to achieve the best mutual adjustments of employees and work. We have conducted regular COVID health screenings of employees, contract employees, truck drivers and food handlers, to mitigate the e/ffect of the pandemic at workplace.\n\n56.4% of high-risk cases were transferred to moderate or low risk related lifestyle diseases\n\nHealth index improved from 12.83 (FY 2020-21) to 13.05 (FY 2021-22) (on a scale of 16)\n\nIndustrial hygiene assessment conducted in 20 departments of Tata Steel Jamshedpur, Tata Steel Kalinganagar and Raw Material locations for identi/fication of occupational health-related hazards and risk analysis\n\n516\n\nAwareness sessions on health and well-being organised across Tata Steel India for employees and contract employees\n\nAt our Thailand operations, we supported employees, their families and the contractors with COVID-19 vaccines during the year with >97% of employees and contractors vaccinated with a minimum of 3 doses.\n\nTata Steel intends to implement a comprehensive physical and mental well-being digital program across locations, reducing and controlling lifestyle diseases and mitigating ergonomic risk factors via assessments and control measures. Our focus on COVID-19 testing and raising awareness regarding the virus, remains undeterred.\n\nFor information on our performance in Human Capital, please refer to 'ESG Factsheet'\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "we are conducting Source Apportionment studies in the steel plant and surrounding area (20-kilometer radius) to identify key sources of air pollution, their contribution to the overall ambient air quality in the region and thereby develop air quality management plans to improve the ambient air quality of Jamshedpur. Going forward, we seek to enhance our capability to assess real-time impact and introduce predictive analysis of environment pollution. We are developing Process Environment Management (PEM), a/uni00A0/first-of-its-kind framework, to integrate process parameters with environment performance indicators, thus enabling agile business decision-making.\n\nAt our UK operations, we pursue targeted investment in environmental control technology to achieve reductions in our impact. In the summer of 2021, we commissioned a new emissions control unit at our Port Talbot sinter plant after an investment of more than \u00a320 million in new /filtration systems. These are now delivering a substantially reduced level of particulate emissions.\n\nAt our Netherlands operations, we launched the 'Roadmap Plus' programme in December 2020 (worth ~\u20ac300 million) intended to improve local environmental performance between 2020 and 2025 by addressing the concerns of the surrounding community on areas such as dust, noise and odour.\n\nDust suppression at Noamundi Mine through water sprinkling\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe expected results of Roadmap Plus are mentioned below:\n\n- \u203a By 2022, a 50% reduction in the emission of Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)\n- \u203a By 2023, a signi/ficant reduction of several emissions including:\n- -  Reduction of approximately 65% of dust depositions in the immediate community around the site compared to 2021 levels\n- - Reduction of approximately 85% odour emissions experienced by the surrounding community\n- - Reduction in emissions of heavy metals by 55%, lead emissions by 70%, as well as the spreading of particulate matter by 35%\n- \u203a Expected reduction of 30% in the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 2025\n\nThrough Roadmap Plus, Tata Steel Netherlands has already made signi/ficant improvements in reducing emissions in recent years. We have /finalised a new facility for processing iron residues and installed new noise walls at the scrap yard. Odour emissions from multiple sources like furnaces at Coking Plant 2 and heating of steel pans at the steel plant have already been reduced by 50%.\n\nOver the next year, we plan to take up >20 measures to ensure the realisation of the environmental targets set for the programme. A major project that we are taking up under this programme is a new high-tech environmental installation at the Pelletising Plant, that will signi/ficantly contribute towards reduction of emission of heavy metals and particulate matter using a new technology that has not yet been applied on this scale elsewhere in the steel industry.\n\nWe are committed to taking care of the environment and the community in close consultation with the community, province and other stakeholders. We are undertaking concrete actions in the short term, while continuing to invest in sustainable solutions to produce climate-neutral steel in the long term.\n\n## Water management\n\nWater is a key material issue for Tata Steel as most of our operations in India are located near rivers (Jamshedpur and Gamharia plants near the Subarnarekha river, and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKalinganagar and Meramandali plants near Brahmani river). These plants fall in low-medium water stress areas as per the WRI (World Resources Institute) Aqueduct. We are taking a holistic approach to water management by adopting the water conservation philosophy, based on 4R principles of reduce, reuse, recycle and recover, with continuous e/fforts to transform steelmaking into a more water e/fficient business.\n\nSteel plants use a large amount of water for a variety of purposes, including cooling, dust suppression, cleaning, and temperature control (heat treatment). Pertaining to this, we use the approach of reduction at source as much as practically possible, by identifying the root of the problem, debottlenecking and reducing discharge into outfalls.\n\nUse of large amount of water also generates huge quantity of e/ffluents, which contain suspended solids, dissolved substances and chemicals. We reuse these e/ffluents after minimal treatment for low-end applications like coke quenching, blast furnace slag quenching, steel melting shop slag quenching, sinter/pellet mixing, gas cleaning plant, horticulture, dust suppression, etc. To minimise the withdrawal of fresh water from rivers and to make Jamshedpur a zero-sewage discharge city, we are reusing the treated municipal wastewater from two sewage treatment plants (STPs) of 45 and 16 MLD (million litres per day) capacities into our operations. We have collaborated with Ecolab to assess the water use e/fficiency in an integrated manner.\n\nAll our sites are continuously taking actions to prevent the risk of contaminating local water resources and achieving zero e/ffluent discharge. The following new technologies have been adopted by Tata Steel for the prevention of water pollution:\n\nRemoval of chloride by synergy with hybrid membrane and chemo dialysis from coke plant wastewater at Hooghly Met Coke, Haldia\n\nNew technology developed and implemented for removal of /fluoride from wastewater at Meramandali\n\nNew Ultraviolet (UV)-Oxidation technology has been developed and implemented for cyanide removal from coke oven wastewater at Meramandali\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring the last year, we have successfully completed the rejuvenation project at the Cold Rolling Mill (CRM) Bara (Jamshedpur) resulting in the creation of larger rainwater harvesting facility, improvement in the water table of the local area and increase in biological diversity.\n\nThe speci/fic freshwater consumption of our Jamshedpur Works (@2.18 m 3 /tcs in FY 2021-22) is one of the lowest in the steel industry in India. Also, upgradation of the common e/ffluent treatment plant (CETP) is on track at Jamshedpur Works to make it a zero e/ffluent discharge facility.\n\nWater treatment plant at Noamundi, Jharkhand\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Circular economy\n\n## Ferrous scrap recycling\n\nProducing steel from the in/finitely recyclable ferrous scrap has a lower carbon footprint, as opposed to producing it from iron ore. India is a net-importer of scrap and de/ficient in producing high quality shredded scrap, which improves productivity in steelmaking. Tata Steel is the /first company to set up a scrap collection and shredding facility at Rohtak (Delhi-NCR) and has plans to replicate such facilities across India. The Steel Recycling Business completed the /first year of operation from its Rohtak Plant. The shredder was commissioned virtually under challenging conditions of COVID-19. The plant clocked ~112 KT dispatch with a revenue of ~/uni20B9460 crore in FY 2021-22.\n\nThe scrap is procured through the digital FerroHaat app, a /first-of-its-kind in the world. Over 180 vendors have been registered on the app for supply of scrap.",

        "page_content": "There has been a dedicated e/ffort to increase scrap charging in our steel melting shops, which is one of the key enablers for reduction in carbon footprint. In FY 2021-22, we increased clean scrap charging in Tata Steel India steel melting shops to 6.6% as compared to 4.8% in FY 2020-21. We are continually investing in augmenting the infrastructure for scrap management and charging in our India operations to reach the internal benchmark of our European steelmaking facility at IJmuiden. Our Thailand facilities use 100% steel scrap as primary raw material.\n\n## Solid waste management\n\nTata Steel has been pioneering in value creation from waste and by-products in its quest to contribute to a sustainable ecosystem in the iron and steel industry. Tata Steel aims for a 'Zero Waste' goal using the 3R (Reduce, Reuse & Recycle) principles of circular economy. We handle ~15 MnTPA of by-products spanning across 25+ product categories comprising more than 250+ Stock Keeping Units (SKUs). These value-added by-products serve as key raw materials for various industries like cement, chemical, construction, etc. In FY 2021-22, Tata Steel Jamshedpur and Tata Steel Kalinganagar achieved 100% solid waste utilisation and horizontal deployment of best practices in Tata Steel Meramandali helped to achieve 97% solid waste utilisation.\n\nSteel Scrap Recycling Plant at Rohtak, Haryana\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Solid waste utilisation\n\n## 100%\n\nSolid waste utilisation at Tata Steel Jamshedpur and Tata Steel Kalinganagar\n\n## 97%\n\nSolid waste utilisation at Tata Steel Meramandali\n\nWe have been investing in research to develop technologies for reuse of iron and steel slags. Our journey can be comprehended through the pioneering and materialised technologies as well as the innovation pipeline pertaining to slag-based products. Through an in-house developed process of accelerated weathering of steel slag (basic oxygen furnace slag), we developed manufactured aggregates branded as Tata Aggreto. This is India's /first steel slag-based branded product, extensively used in the construction of national highways, which has helped in conserving natural aggregates and minimising our environmental footprint. Tata Nirman, another product based on steel slag /fines, has been established as a raw material of choice for the brick manufacturing industry. Through innovative initiatives aimed at supporting the farming sector, a multi-nutrient soil enhancer Dhurvi Gold, has been developed, which serves to provide low-cost soil conditioning solutions. Besides steel slag, various downstream products have been developed from blast furnace slag, such as ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) and activated GGBS, which can be used as partial replacement of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) for making concrete, thereby positively impacting the carbon footprint of cement manufacturers.\n\nTata Steel has been adjudged winner of 'Indian Circular Economy Award 2021' under the large enterprise category during the Circular Economy Symposium organised by FICCI. The award recognises Tata Steel's practices to accelerate its business towards a circular model as the most innovative and impactful. The Company has also won the 'Excellence in 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle)' Award by CII during the International Conference on Waste to Worth, for the second consecutive year, for demonstrating innovative 3R initiatives in managing own wastes.\n\nThe Company is committed to achieving 100% material e/fficiency while sustaining solid waste utilisation at 100% level across all its locations and increasing EBITDA by 2.4x from by-products business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategy\n\n## Biodiversity management\n\nTata Steel has been actively working with several organisations to enhance its performance in biodiversity conservation and signi/ficantly reduce its impact on the ecosystem. Our Indian operations are not located in any of the identi/fied biodiversity hotspots or protected areas. During FY 2021-22, we developed the Biodiversity Management Plans (BMP) for Khopoli and Gamharia. We have developed BMPs for 13 locations and plan to cover 100% sites to assess the impact and dependency of direct operations on biodiversity by 2024. We have planted over 5.6 lakh saplings of native species across locations. We have also established a tree bank for sapling supply at Jugsalai Muck Dump (JMD) with a capacity of ~ 2 lakh per year and conducted a plantation drive in 4.8-hectares area at Cold Rolling Mill (CRM) Bara complex at Jamshedpur. Spread over an area of 43.25 hectares and housing 465 animal species, Tata Steel Zoological Park Jamshedpur aims to preserve wild /flora and fauna and help them propagate in natural captivity. During the pandemic, the zoo leveraged digital media (virtual tours, online webinars, theme-based posters, online quiz, etc.) for wildlife awareness creation and conservation programmes. During the year, we developed the Miyawaki Forest at Khopoli operations, taking the overall forest area cover to ~10/uni00A0acres in the past three years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt our UK operations, we are guardian to large areas of natural habitat, including several Sites of Special Scienti/fic Interest (SSSI). In addition to meeting our responsibilities for protected sites, we also look for opportunities to encourage biodiversity on other landholdings and thereby contribute to protecting the natural heritage of UK's landscape. Former blast furnace cooling lagoons at our Shotton site are now a haven for wildlife. Attracting 12 nesting pairs of common tern in 1970 with the creation of a small raft on the lagoon, the area has become home to one of the UK's largest colonies of this vulnerable bird species and has seen over 20,000 chicks /fledge successfully. The site has been a nature reserve for 50 years and a designated SSSI since 1990. In 2021, a project team of apprentices, volunteers and supply partners refurbished the colony, creating new tern islands on the lagoon, connected by a new steel walkway. The project, assisted by a Welsh government grant, involved the donation of steel for a base and moving 130 tonnes of shingle from the shore onto the nesting islands by helicopter to refurbish the islands, creating a nesting site that the migratory birds will return to, for years to come.\n\nRejuvenated CRM Bara Pond at Jamshedpur, Jharkhand\n\n<!-- image -->",

Taking the initiative forward of increasing the coverage of manufacturing sites and products under LCA, this year, we completed the LCA study for all the products manufactured at Meramandali, CRM Bara (Jamshedpur) and TSLPL Gamharia, covering a total of eight di/fferent product categories. We also carried out the LCA study for our structural tubes and hollow section products (sold under the brand Tata Structura) covering seven di/fferent production units. During the year, we also carried out an LCA study for one of our Fibre Reinforced Polymer products to understand its life cycle environmental impact. Accordingly, we are embedding LCA in the products of our new businesses to understand and improve their environmental performance.\n\nIn continuation of our comparative LCA between HabiNest and Conventional Reinforced Cement Concrete structure, we found that the HabiNest installations have made signi/ficant environmental savings of 18-64% when analysed over six di/fferent LCA categories in comparison to the conventional structure. During the year, the HabiNest comparative LCA study carried out for a project installed in FY 2019-20 got critically reviewed by a third party, which was found compliant as per ISO 14071:2014, ISO 14040:2006 and ISO 14044:2006. The review statement of the same is published under the Product Sustainability page of Tata Steel's website.\n\nAs the /first steel manufacturer to become an approved Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) programme operator in Europe, Tata Steel now has the ability to create product speci/fic EPDs that comply with EN 15804 and ISO 14025 standards. Being able to supply product speci/fic Type/uni00A0III externally veri/fied EPDs, along with BES 6001 responsible sourcing certi/fication, enables us to help our construction supply chains to accrue points under building certi/fication schemes, such as LEED and BREEAM, on their building projects. In addition, the level of transparency and reporting a/fforded by the operatorship allows optimum resource decisions to be made and demonstrates the sustainability of steel and our steel building products.\n\nIn FY 2021-22, we became the /first steel rebar manufacturing company to receive GreenPro certi/fication for our Tata Tiscon TMT rebars. Under this ecolabel certi/fication, all TMT rebar manufacturing facilities have been certi/fied for all grades by CII-Green Business Centre (CII-GBC). GreenPro certi/fied products are recognised in the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) rating system as well as by various government institutions (Chennai Metro, Delhi Metro, etc.).  In Europe, we have produced over 50 Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) for our construction sector customers - a milestone in environmental impact transparency and reporting.\n\nDuring the year, we have ensured timely support to our customers who had requested product-related sustainability information. In the coming years, our focus will be to obtain eco-labels (GreenPro and EPD) for our key products as well as to maximise the coverage of our products across sites under LCA to support our customers with product-related sustainability information.\n\nCommissioned India's /first plant for CO 2 capture from Blast Furnace gas at Jamshedpur\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategy\n\nAt our European operations, providing sustainable solutions is at the heart of our new product development. In the past /five years, we have launched 85 new products for the automotive, engineering and construction sectors, and many of these come with speci/fic sustainable properties to make them lighter and long lasting. Our industry-leading sustainability assessment pro/filer helps us evaluate our new product development portfolio by considering environmental, social and economic issues over the complete product life cycle. The pro/filer guides our teams at each stage of product development, alerting them to key sustainability issues and trends, tracking progress and identifying value-creating sustainable product attributes. We have held over 100 working sessions with our automotive Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and their customers in recent years and have been able to develop jointly agreed roadmaps for decarbonisation, circularity and responsible sourcing. We are working with several stampers and motor manufacturers on future Electric Vehicle (EV) launches and are involved in a collaborative, UK government-funded (Innovate UK) project, which is looking at the use of electrical steels in EV motors. The CompETe project aims to deliver electric drive units with class-leading e/fficiency for increased vehicle range, coupled with high power and torque density,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nall within a lightweight and compact envelope. Tata Steel R&D and its construction business at Shotton are engaged in identifying and evaluating sustainable alternatives to current organic coated (pre-painted) steel (OCS) coatings that are mainly originating from petroleum-based raw materials. This work will provide opportunities for product improvement and/or new product development for di/fferentiated OCS products using sustainable coatings, e.g., waterbased coatings, that are processable, using novel curing technologies and renewable energy.\n\nTata Steel in the UK is a consortium member of Seismic II, a UK Research and Innovation (UKRI)-funded project to streamline the construction of public sector buildings, such as schools and health facilities, meeting the government's industrial strategy of reducing costs by a third, delivering buildings in half the time and with a 50% reduction in carbon emissions from the sector. With the aim of creating a standardised process for construction, the project uses data to enable a whole-life carbon assessment of the construction platform and has a focus on how components, such as /floors, roo/fing and entire steel frames can be dismantled and reused. A demonstrator building at the BRE in Watford was completed in March 2022.\n\nR&D building, Tata Steel Jamshedpur Works\n\n<!-- image -->",

Steel is the world's most important and cost-e/ffective engineering and construction material. Steel remains an integral part of the solution to climate change because of its unique properties like strength to weight ratio, ductility, longevity and, most importantly, in/finite recyclability. These properties make steel the material of choice for industries like construction, infrastructure, automotive, white goods, and general application. Steel is also playing an important role in the transition to clean energy with its application in solar panels, wind turbines, hydroelectric dams, and EVs.\n\nAs per International Energy Agency (IEA), the steel sector emits 2.6 Gt CO 2 annually, which accounts for 7-9% of global sectors for GHG emissions because of  hard-to-abate metallurgical coal being used as a reductant in the iron\n\n## Climate Action Governance\n\n## Board and Apex level Governance\n\nAt Tata Steel, climate action is an integral part of business strategy and risk management and is driven by the Company's Board, with implementation through an organisation-wide governance structure. The CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) & Sustainability Committee of the Board is responsible for providing directional oversight on our Climate Strategy, setting targets and reviewing progress periodically throughout the year. Additionally, the Risk Management Committee of the Board reviews Tata Steel Group level climate change-related risks periodically. The Chief Executive O/fficer and Managing Director (CEO&MD) along with the Executive Director and Chief Financial O/fficer (ED&CFO) are members of both these Board Committees.\n\nTata Steel Group's CEO&MD drives the climate action programme for Tata Steel across all geographies, including its subsidiaries and reviews the same quarterly as Chairman of Apex Environment & Sustainability Committee. The CEO&MD also chairs the Technology & Innovation Management Committee, which drives the adoption of deep decarbonisation technologies like Hydrogen based steelmaking and Carbon Capture and Utilisation.\n\nmaking process through the Blast Furnace. The Blast FurnaceBasic Oxygen Furnace (BF-BOF) route accounts for 70% of global steel production currently.\n\nTata Steel is committed towards reducing its carbon footprint in production and through the life cycle of the product. We are one of the /first companies in India to have endorsed the recommendations of Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), with our Executive Director and Chief Financial O/fficer (ED&CFO) being a member of the Task Force. We are continually strengthening our production processes, supply chains, internal governance, disclosures, and policy advocacy to facilitate a transition to a low-carbon future.\n\n## Operational level Governance\n\nIn 2018, a Centre of Excellence for GHG reduction and mitigation (cross-functional team with members from Operations, Technology and R&D, Sustainability, Finance and Engineering) was constituted under the leadership of Vice President Safety, Health & Sustainability to develop a climate change response roadmap, suggest policy level interventions, align our expansion/growth plans to a lowcarbon pathway and review implementation of projects.\n\nThe Company has also formed a Carbon Impact Centre (CIC) that is responsible for formulating carbon abatement projects. We use the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) tool for prioritisation of projects and Internal Carbon Price (ICP) in India (in line with the EU Emission Trading Scheme) to ensure that new projects adequately re/flect their intrinsic carbon price and also bene/fits of any carbon reduction.\n\nClimate Change risks are part of the enterprise risk register and quarterly updates of these risks on likelihood, impact and status of mitigation strategies are reviewed by the Risk Management Committee of the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate Action Strategy\n\nWe have identi/fied four Strategic Objectives with long-term goals and action plans for each of them. Our Strategic Objective/uni00A0#4 is focussed on 'Leadership in Sustainability' wherein we have set speci/fic long-term goals on carbon emissions along with a decarbonisation roadmap. Based on global scenarios on technology, government policy, consumer behaviour and Company's asset con/figuration, our decarbonisation strategy is set out in three-time horizons, as mentioned below:\n\n## Short-term (by 2025): Shifts in business models\n\n- \u203a Entry into Steel Recycling Business to create a formal circular economy for steel in India; a  0.5 MnTPA scrap processing unit (/first shredding unit in India) was commissioned in FY 2020-21 and multiple units across di/fferent regions are in the pipeline\n- \u203a Utilisation of higher scrap charge in the steelmaking process in India\n- \u203a Adoption of best available technologies and improvement in existing processes to maximise waste heat recovery, use of by-product cases, and dehumidi/fication of hot blast in Blast Furnaces\n- \u203a Improving quality of raw material (Iron ore and Coking coal) to reduce emissions in Blast Furnace in India operations (reducing ash in metallurgical coke from domestic coking coal and reducing alumina content in domestic iron ore)\n- \u203a Increase share of renewable energy generation; 150 MW projects being implemented in a phased manner across\n\nour Indian sites, plan to commission 11.8 MW of solar power plants by FY 2022-23 at our Thailand facilities\n\n- \u203a Internal Carbon Pricing: To boost the carbon abatement projects appraisal in India, we have increased the internal carbon pricing from US$15 to US$40/tonne CO 2 e in FY 2021-22, which we plan to review in FY 2022-23\n- \u203a Tata Steel Nederland: In line with our ambition to produce CO/two.inferior neutral steel by 2050 in Europe, we have announced our ambition to switch to hydrogen-based steelmaking. We plan to gradually phase out our Blast Furnaces by replacing them by a combination of DRI (Direct Reduced Iron) technology and electric furnaces. By 2026, we expect to have completed detailed engineering, placement of orders and commencement of construction on the project\n- \u203a Finalisation of decarbonisation roadmap for Tata Steel UK, focussing on utilisation of locally available steel scrap (UK is the second highest producer in the world) in consultation with the UK Government\n\nCompleted the maiden multi-modal shipment, pioneered the use of inland waterways for transportation of steel products and machinery\n\n<!-- image -->",

The process identi/fies and assesses business risks through bottom up, top down and outside in perspectives so as to ensure comprehensive risk identi/fication and minimise blind spots. Likelihood, impact, and velocity scores are assigned for each of the risks post a due-diligence process including scenario. Appropriate early warning indicators and mitigation strategies are identi/fied for review, including by the Apex Risk Committee and Risk Management Committee (RMC) of the Board.\n\nWe are cognisant of the fact that both transition and physical risks associated with climate change will have an impact on our organisation's operations, supply chain and /financial planning. Stringent climate laws and regulations for accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy, technology disruptions and shifting customer preferences to alternative materials may adversely impact pro/fit margins, more so if our performance in abatement is inferior to our peers. Also, extreme weather events have become more frequent and severe in the recent years. On the other side, climate change also poses opportunities which include improved resource e/fficiency resulting in monetary savings, development of new products & services and access to newer markets, earnings from voluntary carbon markets, access to larger markets/customers requiring steel of low-carbon intensity.\n\nIn FY 2018-19 we conducted a third-party assessment to arrive at potential climate change risks and opportunities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand estimate the likely impact of the risks on the Company's strategy and /financial planning. This assessment involved a holistic approach comprising internal stakeholder consultation, literature review, peer comparison and scenario analysis. We envisage that the way in which these risks and opportunities will play out in the future will depend on two fundamental factors, viz. Global Policy Response and Technology Innovation. Hence, we developed four scenarios based on these two factors considering various global warming temperature ranges to assess impact of these risks on our business strategy and /financial planning. The four scenarios are - 'India Role Model', 'Late Forced Transition', 'Climate Emergency' and 'Technology Breakthrough'. Out of the four scenarios, we believe 'India Role Model' (where there will be strong policy enablement and extensive innovation & technology advancement) is an ambitious scenario that outlines a technologically, industrially and economically possible way forward to restrict increase in global average temperature rise to below 1.5\u00b0C. It forms our base scenario for /financial modeling and strategic considerations.\n\n## Transition Risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nIntroduction of carbon pricing in India due to climate related regulations, leading to loss in pro/fitability\n\n- Strengthening of climate risk management by the international /financial community due to regulatory changes and societal pressures reducing access to capital and increasing the cost of funding\n- Non-compliance to meeting 2\u00b0C pathway requirements due to delay or failure in adopting low-carbon technologies impacting pro/fitability\n- Pace of technological development at Tata Steel not matching with pace of demand for low-carbon embodied steel products, leading to loss of market share",

They not only lead to loss of lives and property but also cause business disruption and /financial losses. Mitigation strategies are put in place to avoid signi/ficant delays in project execution.\n\nThese risks are site speci/fic and are dealt as per site speci/fic 'disaster scenario' planning. Our risk register covers climate change induced physical risks in the form of supply chain disruption (potential delays in vessel placements and loading/ unloading at ports/ sites/ stock yards due to adverse weather conditions) as well as capital project delays including unplanned costs and loss of production.\n\nTata Steel undertook several design-strengthening initiatives during the construction phase after 2013 cyclone during the erection of the Kalinganagar Plant. The severe cyclonic storm Yaas, ravaged the coastal states of Eastern India (where our major operations reside) with peak wind speeds of 140km/h. Our plants at Kalinganagar, Meramandali and Gopalpur in Odisha remained stable and without production cuts as the cyclone passed.\n\nTo future proof our key assets and proposed future capital projects, we have completed Natural Hazard and Climate Change Hotspot Analysis for key operating locations covering major upstream mining sites, steelmaking facilities and ports that are part of our major supply chain networks. The potential threats from di/fferent natural hazards, extreme events, and climate change were assessed based on globally accepted Climate Change Scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) for a timeframe of 2030 and 2050.\n\nTo further build resilience in our planning and action on climate change adaptation, we are currently working on identifying, assessing, and quantifying long-term physical risks to the business as part of our third-party climate risk assessment.\n\nOver the last few years, planning and budgeting of our R&D programmes have been increasingly dedicated to prioritising projects keeping climate related risks and opportunities and customer needs in focus.\n\nAutomotive Segment: Developed high strength steels with lighter weight for use in passenger and commercial vehicle automotive components requiring higher formability. In past three years, we have developed new grades of steel with strength > 600 million Pascals which help in reducing the weight and thus use phase GHG emission\n\nIndividual Home Building segment: The requirement of lighter and stronger steel grades present new opportunities and these high strength grades result in signi/ficant carbon emission, saving over conventional grades, e.g. Tata TISCON launched Fe550SD grade of steel reinforcement bars replacing the lower strength Fe500D grade.

        "page_content": "## Responsible Supply Chain Policy\n\nIn our materiality assessment in 2018, supply chain sustainability emerged as one of the key material issues for Tata Steel, which resulted in the formulation of a Tata/uni00A0Steel Responsible Supply Chain Policy (RSCP) in 2020. The Policy aims to encourage supply chain partners to share Tata Steel commitment on embedding sustainable business practices and has four principles on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) parameters, namely:\n\nFair Business Practices (G)\n\nHuman Rights (S)\n\nHealth & Safety (S)\n\nEnvironmental Protection (E)\n\nOur focus is to sensitise the supply chain partners, viz. suppliers, distributors and SPCs on the need for adhering to sustainable business practices and inculcate the same culture in their own supply chain. We have included introduction of RSCP in our 'Swagat' Program (a program conducted for newly registered vendors) and Vendor Meet. News feed on Tata Steel's e-Procurement platform has been sent for e/ffective communication and awareness building on the policy.\n\nWe have identi/fied ~450 critical suppliers (out of a supplier base of >6,000 suppliers) across all categories of\n\nProcurement, viz. Raw Materials, Process Consumables, MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Operations), Services and Transportation. These critical suppliers were identi/fied based on a decision matrix broadly encompassing decision factors like spend value, criticality to business, actual/potential ESG risks in partner operations etc. We have initiated the sustainability assessment for our supply chain partners based on RSCP through an independent third party. In FY 2021-22, 258 suppliers were assessed. Additionally, 31 SPCs and 106 distributors, which are a part of our downstream value chain, have also been assessed on RSCP. Corrective actions have been identi/fied and communicated for all supply chain partners to address their gaps. The overall governance, oversight and review of the RSCP deployment and assessment process are handled by apex councils led by the Senior Leadership Team.\n\nPort Talbot Harbour\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supply chain analysis (Tata Steel Standalone)\n\nThe below mentioned charts depict our supplier geographical spread and procurement spend analysis for FY 2021-22.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n~92% Suppliers are based out of India\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) programme\n\nThe SRM programme is aimed at building collaborations with strategic vendors for managing and enhancing value delivery through supplier-led innovation. During FY 2021-22, multiple technology sessions were conducted on new and emerging technologies and processes across various improvement areas such as quality, delivery, productivity, safety and sustainability with our strategic vendor partners, which helped in creating value for both Tata Steel and supplier partners and also creating a value pipeline for future.\n\n## CEO to CEO connect with strategic suppliers\n\nThe structured program of CEO to CEO connect, which started in FY 2020-21, has continued in FY 2021-22 and we have conducted 16 interactions with strategic partners and the ideas generated are being driven through the SRM programme and CCTs (Category/uni00A0Competence/uni00A0Teams).\n\n## Focussed engagement with raw material suppliers\n\nDeveloping supplier partnerships through long-term projects in the imported coal value chain is critical for reducing the overall cost of production in the long term. Understanding strategic plans of key suppliers and creation of mutually bene/ficial products have helped maximise the supply of coal that has higher Value-in-Use (VIU) suitable to our plant requirements. We have ensured supply security by developing new relationships in Canada, US and Indonesia. We have also created alternative supply chain models for coking coal enabled by vendor-managed inventory at Indian ports. This has facilitated supply chain security, credit enhancement and optimisation of inventory, which have led to e/fficient management of complex multi-site operations.\n\n## Indigenisation and localisation\n\nIn FY 2021-22, we have increased the e/fforts and focus on indigenisation and localisation across multiple categories of buy like raw material, spares, and process consumables to mitigate macroeconomic risks. Indigenisation for spend of ' 235 crore across di/fferent categories of MRO, Bulk and Raw Material was completed in FY 2021-22. Going forward, a detailed roadmap for indigenisation has been created for the next three years.\n\nStatutory\n\nReports\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Vendor development\n\nVendor Development Programme and Vendor Capability Advancement Program (VCAP) primarily aim to partner and support suppliers to enhance their capability through combined identi/fication of necessary initiatives and continuous improvement, thereby creating a competitive vendor base across Tata Steel. In FY 2021-22, we initiated 43 (cumulative) vendor development programmes, for improving vendor capability. In addition, the safety performance of suppliers has also improved as we intend to inculcate safety as a culture for our vendor partners. A total of 450 suppliers were covered by vendor capability and skill development training programmes. Over 12,000 contract workforce personnel were trained under the skill certi/fication programme, resulting in 100% coverage.\n\nTo support local communities and encourage the inclusion of marginalised sections of the society, we help develop their entrepreneurial capabilities by creating positive di/fferentiation through our A/ffirmative Action (AA) programme. Nearly 33% of our supply chain partners are locals, of which 71 are AA suppliers and displaced persons vendors (displaced due to green/field project).\n\nTata Steel ensured that no pay cut was in practice by the local service providers and contract workforce was paid as per emoluments promised. Assistance was provided at every level to vendor partners supplying material to Tata Steel from across India by ensuring availability of vehicles, racks and issuing letters for seamless transportation.\n\n## Sustainability in logistics\n\n## Measurement and Governance\n\nTata Steel is one of the few companies to measure end-to-end Scope 3 emissions in all modes of transportation, giving it an equal focus as Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. We have implemented many sustainability initiatives in the supply chain such as idle freight reduction resulting in reduction of CO 2 emissions, increasing rail coe/fficient as against road movement, greener modes of transport like shift to coastal movements and have deployed energy e/fficient vessels to reduce the carbon footprint for imported raw materials.",

Compliance is integral to our value system and Tata Steel takes its compliance obligations with utmost seriousness, as part of its e/fforts to establish even stronger relationships of trust with society, customers, and stakeholders. The Company endeavours to manage its businesses responsibly and in compliance with the statutory requirements of the locations in which it operates, and the Management envisages to serve as the anchor and play a pivotal role in implementing the compliance interventions.\n\nWith Tata Steel set to achieve 40 MnTPA by 2030, the focus is on establishing an integrated compliance programme which will enable us to review business risk to strategy and its execution not just from operations standpoint, but also from compliance perspective. The function has adopted a 10-step holistic Compliance Framework , which brings about a paradigm shift, from monitoring compliance based on compliances listed in the compliance tool, to a business process-driven approach for ensuring compliances. The Compliance Framework is designed to bring forth advanced compliance infrastructure, compliance content that is par excellence, sector speci/fic insights, global trends on managing compliances and keeping the Compliance Management Framework future-ready.\n\nThe function is headed by the Company Secretary & Chief Legal O/fficer (Corporate & Compliance), who is primarily responsible for overseeing and managing regulatory compliances. The function is adequately sta/ffed with compliance managers who are responsible for establishing business and industry-speci/fic standards in all units across the organisation. Adherence to compliance obligations is among the subjects covered in audits by the Tata Steel Internal Audit function. Observations from such audits are placed before the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\n## 10-step holistic Compliance Framework\n\nOverarching framework towards achieving Compliance Assurance\n\n## Corporate Ethics\n\nTata Steel strives for global leadership in standards of ethics. We are laying a future-ready culture based on the strong foundation of Tata Values, Tata Code of Conduct (TCoC) and its principles that enable excellence. This involves cultural transformation, focussing on people, digitalisation, innovation, and driving excellence through a performance focus bringing agility at every level for faster decision-making, and strengthening of deployment through e/ffective implementation. TCoC is deployed through a formalised Management of Business Ethics (MBE) framework that re/flects our commitment to shared values and principles.\n\nLeadership Engagement\n\nCompliance Structure\n\nPillars of MBE framework\n\nCommunication & Training\n\nMeasurement of E/ffectiveness\n\n## Deployment methods\n\nWell-de/fined vigil mechanism\n\nGuidelines and policy formulation Awareness through communication Training Extensive use of IT tools and platforms Feedback-based actions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Leadership Engagement\n\nThe Chief Ethics Counsellor has the overall responsibility of driving MBE initiatives and reports to the CEO & MD, who is also the Principal Ethics O/fficer. Apart from the dedicated ethics department, the extended arms of the Chief Ethics Counsellor include Divisional Ethics Coordinators, Departmental Ethics Coordinators (DECs), and Ethics Champions. Tata Ethics Torch Bearers (TETB) have been identi/fied at TSM and local POSH representatives have been introduced as extended arms of Internal Committee (IC) members. The Senior Leadership Team (SLT) leads in communicating from the front in various forums, addressing di/fferent stakeholders across divisions and ensuring open and transparent culture.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Communication & Training\n\nInnovative and diverse approaches/ tools used for communicating policies/ guidelines including Neeti Katha / Neeti Sanchaar snippet stories, quizzes and polls, campaigns, speaker sessions and celebrations. Violation cases are circulated to SLT and open forum discussions are regularly held. Collaborative approach with other teams such as Safety and HRM is also undertaken for communication and Training.\n\n## Steel O Sphere\n\nA pan-India distributor meet on ethics and sustainability organised\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Compliance Structure\n\n\u203a\n\n\u203a\n\n- A robust vigil mechanism, where deployment of policies is tracked and reviewed digitally\n- 'Speak Up' - a third-party whistle blowing helpline, root cause analysis of identi/fied concerns, and robust Consequence Management Framework (CMF) to ensure stakeholder con/fidence in the whistle blowing process\n- \u203a Mobile-enabled Ethics Compliance Register with annual disclosures questionnaire to mitigate associated risks, declaration of gifts (giving and receiving), hospitality, and travel\n\n\u203a\n\n- Onboarding of third party (a subject matter expert) has been done for due diligence of business associates (BA)\n\n## The GoodnessXchange\n\nTata Steel's /first-ever, internal, online auction for charity, auctions gifts received by employees that are beyond the acceptable criteria\n\n## Kashmakash\n\nAn online platform to resolve ethical dilemma where one may choose to remain anonymous and remain connected for response\n\n## Measurement of E/ffectiveness\n\nThe e/ffectiveness of the ethics programme is measured by the number of concerns reported, poll surveys, MBE survey, benchmarking exercises and internal MBE assessments. The feedback is incorporated into the annual plan for MBE deployment.\n\n## Samman\n\nInitiative launched to address feedback on perceptions of ethics deployment at Tata Steel consisting of various programs and communications.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To mitigate the risks and challenges faced by the Company during the pandemic, the Company enhanced safety and hygiene norms at offices, implemented work from home, staggered shift timings for safety of employees and leveraged digital platforms for its day-to-day operations. The Company, in collaboration with state governments and hospitals, contributed immensely towards maintaining dedicated covid-care units, providing of liquid oxygen & maintaining oxygen processing plants and undertaking vaccination drives. Further, the Company's three pronged communication strategy - awareness, engagement and reinforcement helped spreading awareness amongst various communities.\n\nDuring  the  challenging  times,  the  Company  maintained its  liquidity  position  by  minimizing  cash  outflows  and maintaining a judicious mix of funding instruments to ful/fil its operational requirements.\n\nFurther details on various initiatives taken by Tata Steel in addressing the challenges posed by COVID-19 pandemic forms part of the Management Discussion and Analysis forming part of this Report.",

Risk Management\n\nTata Steel's Enterprise Risk Management ( 'ERM' ) process is based on international standards like Committee of Sponsoring Organization  of  the  Treadway  Commission  ( 'COSO' )  and ISO 31000.\n\nRisk Management Committee ( 'RMC' ) of the Board provides oversight  and  sets  the  tone  for  implementing  the  ERM framework across the organization. It reviews the status of key risks, progress of ERM implementation across locations and any exceptions as /flagged to it, on quarterly basis.\n\nThe risk appetite of the organization was approved by the RMC and the Board during FY 2020-21. The risk appetite is aligned to the Vision of the organization and is an important metric governing all business actions and strategic decisions. The Risk Appetite is driven by the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate are our prime concern and our operating strategy is focused on the above objective;\n- \u00b7 All  business  decisions  are  aligned  to  the  Tata  Code of Conduct;\n- \u00b7 Management  actions  are  focused  on  continuous improvement;\n- \u00b7 Environment and Climate Change impacts are assessed on a continuous basis and business decisions support systems including capital allocation consider impact of climate change through the internal carbon pricing framework; and\n- \u00b7 The long-term strategy of the Company is focused on generating pro/fitable growth and sustainable cash/flows that creates long-term stakeholder value.\n\nRisk Owners may accept risk exposure to their annual and long-term  business  plans,  which  after  implementation of  mitigation  strategies,  is  aligned  to  our  risk  appetite. The risk appetite has been cascaded across the organization including the Tata Steel Group Companies through focused communication during the Annual Business Plan cycle.\n\nFor better focus on Risk Governance and ERM implementation, the Company has set up a Management Committee called Apex Risk Committee ( 'ARC' ). ARC has the primary responsibility of implementing the Risk Management Policy of Tata Steel",

ARC reviews include detailed discussions on key risk themes, progress of mitigation plans, exceptions as /flagged to it and new initiatives related to ERM.\n\nCentral ERM is a dedicated business vertical that has been set  up  to  ensure  deployment  of  the  5  Step  bottom-up process across the organization. The team is led by Vice President - Corporate Finance, Treasury & Risk Management who acts as the Chief Risk O/fficer of the Company. The ERM team  continuously  scans  the  external  environment  for developments which may throw up risks for the organization. The risk /flags and risk insights are shared with the Business Units ( 'BUs' ). These form inputs to the BUs for identi/fication and management of bottom-up risks, which are periodically reviewed as per de/fined ERM Governance mechanism. The risks are escalated and aggregated for reporting to ARC and RMC. This is complemented by a top-down process, which helps in identi/fication of strategic, enterprise level risks.\n\nThe Company follows coordinated risk assurance and the ERM process is integrated with Corporate Audit, Strategy & Business Planning, Corporate Legal, Ethics & Compliance functions. The two-way communication with these functions brings further rigor in driving the process across the organization and the Tata Steel Group Companies. The ERM process being data intensive, an in-house built IT system has been developed across the organization for real time management of risks through live dashboards. The IT system supports risk analytics and helps in developing a uniform risk culture as the ERM framework is used while identifying, assessing, evaluating, monitoring & reviewing risks.\n\nTata Steel was conferred with the 'RIMS India ERM Award for Distinction', the only company to receive this award in India in 2021. The Risk and Insurance Management Society (RIMS) Global  ERM  Award  of  Distinction  honors  organizations that create and retain value through their Enterprise Risk Management programs and ERM excellence that demonstrates ERM innovation in creating and preserving organizational value, and the program's ability to build sustaining risk management capabilities. The Company has also been adjudged 'Masters of Risk in Metals & Mining' and 'Risk Technology' categories, at the 8 th edition of 'The India Risk Management Awards' for the sixth time in a row.\n\nRisk intelligent culture of Tata Steel has established ERM as an enabler to proactively manage the uncertainties in an unprecedented and volatile business environment and achieve business objectives. During the year under review, with the resurgence of COVID-19 pandemic, 'Scenario-based risk assessment' was revisited across Tata Steel to understand the change in best-case and worst-case scenarios. The focus was on identi/fication of 'Early Warning Indicators' for proactive Risk Management. Real-time digital dashboard was developed and reviewed by the Senior Leadership Team periodically for\n\ndecision making. The Company continues its focus on creating sustainable value for building resilience amidst dynamic and uncertain business environment.\n\nDuring the year under review, the Company continued to be vigilant of the evolving pandemic situation to proactively manage  risks.  Health  and  safety  of  employees  and  the communities in the vicinity of the Company's operations remained  the  top-most  priority  for  the  Company,  whilst simultaneously ensuring continuity of our business operations.\n\nImplementation of focused risk mitigation strategies coupled with  improvement  in  the  global  and  domestic  macro environment has signi/ficantly improved Tata Steel's risk pro/file for FY 2021-22. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Company has been able to deleverage beyond the target set in the past two years.\n\n## 13. Vigil Mechanism\n\nTata Steel always believes in promoting a culture of trust and transparency. The vigil mechanism in Tata Steel resonates with the same values. The Company has a Vigil Mechanism that provides a formal channel for all its Directors, employees and business associates including customers to approach the Chairman of the Audit Committee or Chief Ethics Counsellor and make protective disclosures about the unethical behaviour, actual or suspected fraud or violation of the Tata Code of Conduct ( 'TCoC' ). No person is denied access to the Chairman of the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Vigil Mechanism includes policies viz. the Whistleblower Policy for Directors & Employees, the Whistleblower Policy for Business Associates, the Whistleblower Protection Policy for Business Associates (vendors/customers), the Gift and Hospitality Policy, the Con/flict of Interest Policy for Employees, the  Anti-Bribery  &  Anti-Corruption  ( 'ABAC' )  Policy,  and Anti-Money Laundering ( 'AML' ) Policy.\n\nThe Whistleblower Policies for Directors & Employees and Business  Associates  and  TCoC  encourage  every  Director, employee, and Business Associate to promptly report any actual or possible violation of the TCoC or any event that he or she becomes aware of that could a/ffect the business or reputation of the Company. The Company ensures protection for the whistleblowers and any attempts to intimidate the whistleblower would be treated as a violation of the TCoC. This Policy includes 'reporting of incidents of leak or suspected leak of Unpublished Price Sensitive Information ( 'UPSI' )' as required in terms of the provisions of the SEBI Listing Regulations.\n\nThe Whistleblower Protection Policy for Business Associates including vendors and customers provides protection to Business Associates from any victimization or unfair trade practices by the Company.

Overview\n\nThe objective of this report is to convey the Management's perspective on the external environment and steel industry, as well as strategy, operating and /financial performance, material developments in human resources and industrial relations, risks and opportunities and internal control systems and their adequacy in the Company during the FY 2021-22. This should be read in conjunction with the Company's /financial statements, the  schedules  and  notes  thereto  and  other  information included elsewhere in the Integrated Report. The Company's /financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards ( 'Ind AS' ) complying with the requirements of the Companies Act, 2013, as amended and regulations issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( 'SEBI' ) from time to time.\n\n## II. External Environment\n\n## 1. Global Economy\n\nThe global economy enters 2022 in a weaker position than previously expected. As the new Omicron COVID-19 variant spreads, countries have reimposed mobility restrictions. Rising energy prices and supply disruptions have resulted in higher and more broad-based in/flation than anticipated, notably in the United States and many emerging market and developing economies. Further, the ongoing retrenchment of China's real estate sector and slower-than-expected recovery of private consumption and the ongoing tension between Russia and Ukraine have limited the growth prospects.\n\n## Outlook\n\nGlobal growth is projected to slow-down from an estimated 6.1% in 2021 to 3.6% in 2022-0.8 percentage-point lower than what was envisioned in the last World Economic Outlook (WEO) of January 2022, largely re/flecting forecast markdowns in USA and China. In USA, a revised assumption of removing the Build Back Better /fiscal policy package from the baseline, earlier withdrawal  of  monetary  accommodation,  and  continued supply shortages have induced a downgrade in the outlook by 1.2 percentage-points. In China, pandemic-induced disruptions related to the zero-tolerance COVID-19 policy and protracted /financial stress among property developers have induced a 0.8 percentage-point downgrade. Global growth is expected to slow down to 3.6% in 2023.\n\nElevated in/flation is expected to persist longer, with ongoing supply chain disruptions and high energy prices continuing in 2022. Risks to the global baseline are tilted to the downside which is primarily brought by the new COVID-19 variant which\n\nmay prolong the pandemic and induce renewed economic disruptions. Moreover, supply chain disruptions, energy price volatility, and localized wage pressures have enhanced the uncertainty around in/flation and policy paths. Other global risks may crystallize with the surging geopolitical tensions, and the ongoing adverse climate conditions leading to the probability for natural disasters.\n\nWith  the  pandemic  continuing  to  maintain  its  grip,  the emphasis on an e/ffective global health strategy is more salient than ever. Worldwide access to vaccines, tests, and treatments have become essential to mitigate the risks posed by new variants of COVID-19. Monetary policy in many countries will need to curb in/flationary pressures, while /fiscal policy will need to prioritize health and social spending.\n\n## 2. Indian Economy\n\nAmidst the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic leading to disruptions in supply chain and surging in/flation rate, the Indian Government introduced various policies to cushion the impact on the domestic economy and in speci/fic vulnerable sections of society and the business sector. Through its policies, the Government signi/ficantly increased capital expenditure on infrastructure projects to build back medium-term demand and aggressively implemented supply-side measures to prepare the economy for a sustained long-term expansion. With the vaccination programme having covered the majority of the population, recovering economic momentum and the likely long-term bene/fits of supply-side reforms in the pipeline, the Indian economy is in a good position to witness GDP growth of around 8.0%-8.5% in 2022-23.\n\n## III. Steel Industry\n\n## 1. Global Steel Industry\n\nThe global steel industry has partially recovered with increase in global steel production by 3.7% during 2021, compared to 2020. This is primarily due to economies opening up after wide scale vaccinations, gradual commencement of economic activity, and signi/ficant change in retail consumer behaviour mainly in automotive and construction sectors. Further, increase in raw material prices mainly concerning coking coal, iron ore and oil & fuel have pushed the market prices of steel. Global crude steel production reached at 1,951 MnT in 2021, which was higher by 70 MnT than 2020. While China continued to be the largest global crude steel producer, there were moderate growth in steel production in countries such as India, Japan, USA, Germany and Brazil, amongst others, signifying normalcy in operations during the pandemic.",

Demand Outlook\n\nThe Short-Range Outlook ( 'SRO' ) by worldsteel had forecasted that steel demand will grow by 4.5% in 2021 and reach 1,855.4 MnT. It is expected that in 2022, the steel demand will see a further increase of 2.2% to 1,896.4 MnT. The current forecast assumes that, with the progress of vaccinations across the world, the spread of variants of the COVID -19 virus will be less damaging and disruptive than seen in previous waves. Strong manufacturing activity bolstered by pent-up demand will remain as a signi/ficant contributor. The developed economies have outperformed the expectations by a larger margin than the developing economies, re/flecting the positive bene/fit of higher vaccination rates and government support measures. In the emerging economies, especially in Asia, the recovery momentum was interrupted by the resurgence of pandemic.\n\nWhile the manufacturing sector's recovery remained more resilient to the new waves of infection than expected, supplyside constraints led to a levelling o/ff the recovery in the second half of the year thereby preventing a stronger recovery in 2021. However, with high backlog orders combined with a rebuilding of inventories and further progress in vaccinations in developing countries, we expect steel demand will continue to recover in 2022. Persistent rising in/flation, continued slow vaccination progress in developing countries and further growth deceleration in China continues to pose threat to this forecast.\n\n## 3. Steel Consuming Sectors\n\nThe construction sector has remained more resilient than the manufacturing sector to the pandemic shock. However, in many developing economies, construction activity was severely disrupted by a total stoppage of projects. However, in 2021, backed with domestic policies, the global construction sector remained resilient to the impact of pandemic. The sector saw robust recovery backed by low interest rates and domestic governments focusing on infrastructure projects. However, the recovery plans were a/ffected by two con/flicting forces. While\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfew governments, specially in developing nations, pumped in funds in infrastructure sector making it a recovery tool aligned with green initiatives, on the other side, governments were hit with poor /fiscal standing due to the pandemic, thereby a/ffecting the ability towards /financing infrastructure projects.\n\nThe residential sector has bene/fited from accumulated savings during the lockdown and the spread of working from home, which has resulted in rising demand for home space. However, the non-residential sector will see a sluggish recovery due to reduced demand for o/ffice space.\n\nThe automotive sector, which saw the sharpest decline among the steel using sectors during the /first phase of pandemic saw a strong recovery subsequently. Although supply chain disruption is still evident in some markets, the recovery is driven by pent-up demand and increased household savings. The disruption in the supply chain is signi/ficantly undermining the  global  automotive  industry's  recovery.  With  pent-up demand dissipating, the growth in auto production in 2022 will decelerate, though high order backlogs will provide some support.\n\n## 4. World Steel Price Trends\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine con/flict has caused panic in the market about supply shortage with the result that prices have moved north radically, be it iron ore or coking coal. Prices of steel have also responded to the crisis but its northward movement so far has been limited. Increasing risk of procurement, constraints of /financial approval, non-accessibility due to port blockage, growing  uncertainty  about  availability,  rising  safety  and security concerns are among the major factors that have driven sentiments in the commodity markets around the world. To what extent, steel prices would be impacted hinges signi/ficantly on the extent of aggravation of the Russia-Ukraine crisis and its longevity.\n\n## 5. Global Raw Material Market (Iron Ore and metallurgical coal)\n\nThe raw materials market in the FY 2021-22 was markedly volatile driven by policy changes and a shift in global trade /flows primarily in the coal markets.\n\n## i) Demand & Supply\n\nTotal global crude steel production for 2021 stood at 1.033Bt, or 3% lower on the year. However, in second half of 2021, production was up by 11.6% compared to the same period in 2020. Chinese steel production mainly led this increase due to a continually recovering economy post COVID -19. However, in the later half of 2021, Chinese steel production declined due to e/fforts on decarbonisation.\n\nChina's iron ore imports ended 3.9% weaker on the year to 1.12Bt, largely due to the lower overall steel production. Additional factors were also that major miners faced several",

        "page_content": "port and mining disruptions, like Rio Tinto's /five-week Dampier port maintenance and Vales' mine stoppages at Timbopeba and Alegria in second half of 2021.\n\nGlobal trade /flows in coking coal saw major shifts from a year prior, post China's informal ban on Australian coking coal till October 2020. China's coking coal imports were down ~25% on the year at 54.7Mt, with fresh Australian imports e/ffectively at zero compared to 35Mt the year prior.\n\nThe result led to a surge in demand for Atlantic coals, with Chinese mills willing to pay high premiums for seaborne PLV. The rise in CFR China sentiment had supportive impacts on Australian FOB prices as Ex-China buyers were replacing lost Atlantic tonnages with Australian material. Australian coking coal exports in 2021 were at the same time 2.5% lower on the year at 166.1Mt.\n\nChina had also embarked on an aggressive coal production regime towards the end of 2021 due to peaking import prices. This saw production volumes on a steady uptrend from August 2021, eventually hitting record highs of 384Mt in December 2021. The government has held a similar focus on improving domestic supply in 2022, with production hitting a new record high of 395Mt in March 2022.\n\nAustralian  iron  ore  exploration  spending  surged  41%  to $557.5mn in 2021, as cost of exploration got elevated due to higher fuel costs and a shortage of skilled labour. Record high iron ore prices in 2021 had also encouraged sellers to look at growth options, boosting spending on iron ore exploration.\n\nMeanwhile, spending on Australian coal plunged to 3-yearlow at $225.4mn in 2021, down 22.7% on year, as /financing on coal projects thinned out with major banks and coal importing countries such as China, Japan and South Korea adopting carbon neutrality goals.\n\n## ii. Prices\n\nSeaborne Iron ore prices hit historically high levels in 2021. 62% Fe CFR China prices ranged between $87.20/t and $233.1/t. Average iron ore prices stood at ~$160.1/t for the year, an increase from ~$109/t for 2020.\n\nRecord high iron ore prices were noted in May 2021 as crude steel production was on an uptrend and also hitting its highest monthly levels of 99.5MnT in the same month. Prices in the later half of 2021 however declined sharply as the government began to enforce strict production curbs to cap 2021 output at 2020 levels.\n\nIron ore prices started to recover in Q1 FY 2022, as Chinese steel production recovered q-o-q due to the refreshing of a new steel quota. On the supply end, Brazil faced extreme wet weather in the south eastern regions, which caused shipments to fall 13.5% y-o-y.\n\nInto 2022, Iron ore prices stand near yearly highs as market participants  hold  optimism  on  downstream  recovery,\n\nconsidering government focus on sustaining economic growth. Upside potential however has been curbed by several factors viz., i) Re-emergence of COVID variants in China, ii) Sluggish real estate and auto sector, iii) government intention to further reduce 2022 crude steel production y-o-y.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSeaborne Coking coal prices were largely /firm for 2021. PHCC FOB Australian prices ranged between $102/t and $408.5/t in 2021. Average coking coal prices stood at $313.4/t for the year, up from $117.1/t the year prior.\n\nFOB Australian prices were largely driven by an unprecedented rally in China's domestic coal prices, as the nation struggled with tight local and seaborne supply. This saw CFR China PLV prices skyrocketing 203% from start of 2021 to peak at $615/t mid-October 2021. Prices however started to tumble 45% till the end-December 2021 to $337.5/t CFR China as China's NDRC stepped into intervene and stabilize coal prices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn second half of 2021, persistent tight availability of spot cargoes from major miners led Ex-China buyers to contend for material. BHP had several maintenances during July-December 2021 for its PHCC mines like Grosvenor and Peak Downs, which caused overall production to be 8.8% lower y-o-y.\n\nMeanwhile,  global  steel  production  and  demand  for raw materials recovered swiftly in 2021, which created a disequilibrium between supply and demand dynamics.",

Prices however are likely to cool from the record highs of ~$670/t seen in the January-March quarter 2022, with Australian supply expected to improve in coming quarters. Market participants are also becoming less anxious of supply tightness, with Russian coal expected to be rediverted to markets like China and India.\n\n## Initiatives by Tata Steel\n\nThe  Company  took  several  key  initiatives  in  its  raw material procurement.\n\n- \u00b7 Tata  Steel's  strategic  engagement  and  relationship management with Raw Material suppliers has led to e/fficient inventory control thereby managing/avoiding any adverse e/ffect due to major global events such as Indonesia's ban on coal exports.\n- \u00b7 Tata Steel invested in developing a predictive analytics tool for forecasting coking coal prices incorporating 13,000+ data inputs. This has been integrated with the Company's customised e-auction tool to mainly execute metallurgical coal  spot  trades  and  better  adjust  Laycan  timing  of term cargoes.\n- \u00b7 As a result of China's ban on Australian coal, stranded Australian cargoes were available at attractive prices. This opportunity was utilised to procure ex-China cargoes.\n- \u00b7 The Company continued to reduce its working capital requirement on account of raw materials. This was through implementation of Vendor Managed Inventory at Indian ports for coal and supplier credit enhancement.\n- \u00b7 Group synergies through centralized procurement, technical optimization and knowledge sharing continued to result in substantial savings and e/fficiency improvement.\n- \u00b7 Discussions have been initiated with leading coal suppliers on sustainability which is expected to introduce various technologies in reducing carbon footprint.\n\n## IV. Tata Steel Group Operations\n\n## Major Highlights\n\nDuring the year under review, the consolidated crude steel production for Tata Steel Group ( 'TSG' ) was 31.03 MnT as against 28.54 MnT of FY 2020-21, an increase of 9% primarily due to better steel demand. The production increased at Tata Steel (Standalone) to 18.38 MnT which was higher by 13% (FY 2020-21: 16.28 MnT), Tata Steel Europe produced 10.11 MnT, higher by 6% (FY 2020-21: 9.56 MnT), Tata Steel Long Products\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nproduced 0.68 MnT (FY 2020-21: 0.65 MnT), partly o/ffset by lower production at South-East Asia by 10% at 1.86 MnT (FY 2020-21: 2.06 MnT) due to disposal of Singapore operations of NatSteel Holdings Pte.

NMB has three material verticals - Composites, Graphene and Medical Materials & Devices.\n\n## Fibre Reinforced Polymer ('FRP') Composites\n\nComposites industry in India is dominated by institutional businesses and is largely dependent on infrastructure, industrial and railway sectors.\n\nFY 2021-22 was challenging for the composites business not only due to the immediate disruptions and uncertainty caused by repeated waves of pandemic but also due to the steep increase in cost of raw materials including crude oil-based resins and glass /fiber.\n\nOne of the key initiatives of the business was to convert to FRP many applications where steel is currently being used. Value proposition of this is the lower life cycle cost of FRP because of its higher corrosion resistance and lower maintenance cost. With this initiative, sales to the industrial sector grew by 5X over\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe previous year. Railways has been a promising customer for the division. The division has been leveraging group synergies for the railway business by o/ffering integrated solutions jointly with other Tata Group companies. The composites division has registered a substantial growth in business revenues in FY 202122 over previous year.\n\n## Graphene\n\nDuring FY 2021-22, the graphene business had an overall 7X growth over the last year. Graphene business has signi/ficant number of applications under development as 'Design in the pipe-line'. However, it has successfully established Graphene enriched poly vinyl chloride and high-density polyethylene pipes in the market, branded as 'WONDRA'. Industrial products from range of Elastomers & Polymers enriched with graphene are under market validation. Applications of graphene in the areas of energy, lifestyle and well-being are under evaluation.\n\n## Medical Material and Devices\n\nDuring  the  year  under  review,  the  division  consolidated its position in the import dominated Advanced Ceramics material market with a dedicated bio-ceramic production facility.

The Company is also working on the opportunities arising out of climate change with speci/fic projects to leverage.\n\n## l) Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nThe utmost priority for Tata Steel at the very start of the global pandemic, was to ensure accurate and timely communication with all its stakeholders and collaborating with our extended stakeholder network, in order to ensure that both the internal and external communication channels were regularly updated, in the interest of safety and business continuity.\n\nTo provide an overview of the measures within its plant gates at Tata Steel, an empowered committee of the senior leadership team was immediately set up to facilitate agile decision-making and quick deployment of preventive initiatives, across the organisation. Immediately thereafter, the Company introduced manpower modulisation via PODs, to protect the health and safety of its employees.\n\nTata  Steel  also  designed  and  deployed  a  tableau-based manpower monitoring system, called 'Digital COVID Safety Tracks',  created  a  'COVID  Impact  Centre'  and  formulated 'Standard  Operating  Guidelines',  that  were  widely communicated across internal and external stakeholders. These broad e/fforts with their multiple levels of initiatives helped the Company immensely to create a capacity to sustain operations, at a business-as-usual level.\n\nTata  Steel's  past  investments  in  digital  technology  for  a 'Connected Workforce, Connected Assets and Connected Operations' platforms, enabled it to seamlessly respond to COVID-19 impacts.\n\nSome of the interventions that were introduced during the period are:\n\nTeam Support: 'Speak Up', a Coronavirus Guidelines Violation Reporting Helpline was established and used extensively to report violations of quarantine rules.\n\nTata Steel set up a COVID-19 Medical Task Force, to augment and constantly review the preparedness of its hospitals and related infrastructure that were set up to cater to the needs of its employees, as well as the communities. The /five key initiatives launched for the communities, in the aftermath of the lockdown, are as follows:\n\n#DigitalBridges  Gram  Panchayats  &  2.0: By  creating  an empathetic network to solve pressing challenges of stranded migrant workers across India.\n\n#ThoughtForFood and #HopeSprings: Mobilisation by Tata Steel Foundation ensured that at least one warm wholesome meal a day was made available to the most vulnerable sections during the lockdown and that no migrant labourer passing through Jamshedpur remained hungry, thirsty or lonesome. This resulted in 27 lakh such meals being served across locations.\n\n#StitchInTime: Local capacity was created to produce 1,00,000 three-ply cloth masks across our operational areas, catering to communities most exposed to the outbreak.",

Tata Steel Long Products Limited (TSLP)\n\nTSLP's current product portfolio is unique in nature and complementary to Tata Steel product basket. It primarily deals in two products viz. DRI (Direct Reduced Iron/ Sponge Iron) and Special Steel. DRI on the one hand is highly commoditized in nature and used as a Raw material (substitute to the steel scrap) in the electric arc furnaces or induction furnaces. While on the other hand, special steel is used for hi-end and critical applications such as forging, bearings, fasteners, spring etc. This enabled Tata Steel to complete its o/ffering in the Automotive sector for critical long products-based components apart from  being  a  dominant  leader  for  Flat  products-based parts/ components.\n\nThe turnover and pro/fit/(loss) of TSLP for the FY 2021-22 are as follows:\n\n|                                               | FY 22   | (/uni20B9 crore) FY 21   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------------|\n| Turnover                                      | 6,802   | 4,750                    |\n| EBITDA                                        | 1,288   | 1,154                    |\n| Pro/fit before tax (PBT), before  exceptional | 885     | 615                      |\n| Pro/fit before tax (PBT)                      | 858     | 615                      |\n| Pro/fit after tax (PAT), before  exceptional  | 657     | 572                      |\n| Pro/fit after tax (PAT)                       | 630     | 572                      |\n\nThe production and sales performance is given below:\n\n|                |   FY 22 |   FY 21 |   (mn tonnes) Change (%) |\n|----------------|---------|---------|--------------------------|\n| Crude Steel    |    0.68 |    0.65 |                        6 |\n| Saleable Steel |    0.67 |    0.53 |                       25 |\n| Sales          |    0.65 |    0.64 |                        2 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTSLP continues its journey of operational excellence through Shikhar program. While operational robustness was visible in the company's performance in FY 2021-22. The company has undertaken numerous customer facing and operational initiatives to improve performance.\n\n## Key Business Highlights:\n\n- \u00b7 Twenty new trials were conducted across the plant to establish  new  operating  paradigm  (Polymer  usage  to reduce coal blend cost and usage of alternate /fluxes in Blast Furnaces for improved productivity.\n- \u00b7 In by-products, few campaigns to make the departments free from plastic and E-waste were successfully launched and driven to generate revenue for the company.\n- \u00b7 Undertaken impactful actions to make its quality control process robust and reduce customer claims, launched customer satisfaction team for key customers to enhance engagement and provide quick resolution of the complaints.\n\nThe Shikhar program has achieved improvement savings of /uni20B9503 crore in FY 2021-22, which contributed to improvement of EBITDA which had been pivotal in staging a successful turnaround of the /financials of the company.\n\nThe company has embarked upon digitally enabled business transformation  journey  -  Digital  Twin  for  DRI  which  has been initiated to improve process e/fficiency by multivariate optimization, predictive modelling for loss detection, process optimization to maximize throughput and improve yield.\n\nDuring the year, the company had developed 29 new products out of which the 3 /first time products in India viz., Lead free steel, PC300k - Alloy LRPC and Grade 3 cable wire for horseshoe nails and DTH cables.\n\nDuring  FY  2021-22,  TSLP  had  produced  839  k  tonnes  of sponge and 684 k tonnes of steel as against 797 k tonnes of sponge and 648 k tonnes of steel in FY 2020-21, whereas deliveries of FY 2021-22 for sponge was 594 k tonnes as against 632 k tonnes FY 2020-21, due to lower demand for sponge and steel deliveries was 652 k tonnes as against 639 k tonnes FY 2020-21 in view of higher demand. The turnover of FY 2021-22 had increased over FY 2020-21 by /uni20B92,052 crore primarily due to increase in average net realisation of sponge iron and of steel while the steel deliveries were marginally higher. The Pro/fit before tax of FY 2021-22 was higher by /uni20B9243 crore over FY 2020-21 primarily due to increased EBITDA and reduction in /finance cost on account of repayment of loan.\n\n## Strategic growth in Long Products through Acquisition of Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd.\n\nDepartment of Investment and Public Asset Management ( 'DIPAM' ), Ministry of Finance had invited bids for strategic divestment of Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited ( 'NINL' ).

Tata Steel Europe (TSE)\n\nEconomic growth recovered in all regions of the world in 2021 after the economy was strongly impacted in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic. The recovery was strong despite continuing supply chain issues and COVID waves. Global GDP growth increased by 5.9% (2020: -3.4%). In China GDP growth accelerated to 8.1% (2020: 2.2%). Whilst China achieved strong GDP growth of 12.7% in the /first half-year of 2021, the Chinese economy decelerated sharply in the second half, recording only 4.0% growth in the fourth quarter of 2021. The deceleration was mainly due to the weak real estate market and stagnant infrastructure investment, together with continued COVID waves. The EU economy grew by 5.3% (2020: -6.1%) and the UK economy by 7.4% (2020: -9.3%). The EU and UK economies recovered as vaccination allowed a progressive opening of the economies. In the /first part of 2021, the economies rebounded strongly  from  the  recession  of  2020,  but  GDP  growth decelerated in the second half due to increasing energy prices, in/flation and supply chain issues.\n\nGlobal steel demand increased by 2.7% in 2021 in line with the improving macroeconomic conditions (2020: 0.5%). Demand in China decreased by -5.4% (2020: 10.4%) as growth in the construction sector slowed down. Demand in the EU recovered by 16.8% (2020: -11.6%). In CY2021 the steel-using industries in the EU experienced a strong rebound in output, which peaked in the second quarter. The recovery of automotive was particularly strong. However, issues with the supply chain (especially shortage of semiconductors) negatively a/ffected output in the automotive sector in the second half of the year. In 2021 global steel production increased by 3.6% (2020: -0.1%). Steel production in China decreased by -3.1% (2020: 6.9%) and equated to 54% of global steel production. In the EU production was increased by 15.4% (2020: -12.0%) as the idled Blast Furnaces were brought back online.\n\nThe market reference price for iron ore /fines (China CFR 62%) increased in FY 2021-22 to US$154/t (+$26/t). The price was particularly high in the /first half of the year with an all-time high in June 2021 of US$215/t as demand from Chinese mills was strong. The hard coking coal spot price (Australia FOB) increased to US$313/t (+$196/t). The price increased during the year due to a combination of strong seaborne demand from India, Japan, South Korea and Europe as industrial output improved, high demand for non-Australian coals from China and limited\n\nsupply in the spot market. The price was at an all-time high of 594 US$/t in March due to the loss of supply from Russia as a result of the war in the Ukraine. The German benchmark scrap price (Sorte 2/8) increased to \u20ac437/t (+\u20ac196/t) compared to the previous /financial year. The price of CO 2 increased in 2021-22 to \u20ac65/t (+\u20ac36/t), reaching an all-time high in February 2022 at \u20ac91/t. Increasing industrial output and reforms of the EU Emissions Trading System, reducing the supply of permits, have caused the price to rise. The European steel spot Hot Rolled Coil price (Germany, parity point) increased in 2021-22 to \u20ac1,055/t (+\u20ac520/t). The price increased strongly as demand for steel was high whilst supply was limited. In March 2022 the steel price was at an all-time high of \u20ac1,240/t due to the loss of supply from Ukraine and Russia.\n\nFor 2022 the outlook is highly uncertain due to the war in the Ukraine. The war in the Ukraine has a major impact on the EU due to its reliance on Russian energy and its geographic proximity to the con/flict area. There are further downside risks from COVID virus infections and rising interest rates. The World Steel Association predicts that steel demand will increase 0.4% globally. Demand in the EU is expected to decline by -1.3%.\n\nThe turnover and pro/fit/(loss) /figures of TSE are given below:\n\n(/uni20B9 crore)\n\n|                                               | FY 22   | FY 21   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Turnover                                      | 90,023  | 56,051  |\n| EBITDA                                        | 12,164  | (618)   |\n| Pro/fit before tax (PBT), before  exceptional | 8,362   | (4,565) |\n| Pro/fit before tax (PBT)                      | 8,114   | (5,907) |\n| Pro/fit after tax (PAT), before  exceptional  | 9,235   | (6,155) |\n| Pro/fit after tax (PAT)                       | 8,986   | (7,497) |\n\nThe production and sales performance of TSE is given below:\n\n|              | FY 22   | FY 21   | (mn tonnes) Change (%)   |\n|--------------|---------|---------|--------------------------|\n| Liquid Steel | 10.11   | 9.55    | 6                        |\n| Production   |         |         |                          |\n| Deliveries   | 9.02    | 8.82    | 2                        |\n\nTSE's production in FY 2021-22 was up 0.6 MnT (6%) compared to the previous year due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on demand in FY 2020-21 on the Group's steel products.

TSE reported positive EBITDA of /uni20B912,164 crore during FY 2021-22 as against operating loss of /uni20B9618 crore in FY 2020-21 mainly due to signi/ficantly higher steel margin and improved market conditions partly o/ffset by increase in energy and maintenance expenditures. Improved operating pro/fits led to pro/fit before tax of /uni20B98,114 crore in FY 2021-22 against a loss of /uni20B95,907 crore in FY 2020-21. Exceptional charge was lower than that of the previous year mainly due to lower impairment on PPE.\n\n## Strategic Actions\n\nTSE started the FY 2021-22 operating in a much improved steel market which, along with many other industries, was severely a/ffected in FY 2020-21 following the restrictions imposed on the economy to contain the COVID-19 health crisis. TSE was well placed to serve the strong demand from the market following the economic recovery once restrictions were lifted because, whilst production was reduced in FY 2020-21, no permanent capacity reductions were made. TSE's focus during the year was to improve operational stability and respond to demand whilst managing the signi/ficant pressures on working capital arising from increases in input costs.\n\nThrough the /first half of the year, TSE progressed with its plans to separate its businesses in the UK and the Netherlands into two 'Value Chains', with their own governance structures to allow each businesses to pursue di/fferent strategic paths and give them greater agility and focus, while still bene/fiting from operating together under the Tata Steel brand to provide a coordinated approach to customers. The separation took e/ffect from October 1, 2021.\n\nDuring the year Tata Steel announced plans to pursue a fully sustainable future for its steelworks in Ijmuiden by adopting a hydrogen route which would involve the introduction of direct reduced iron (DRI) technology which can make iron using natural gas or hydrogen before it is converted to steel in one or more electric furnaces to be invested in the future. TSE is pursuing with its ambition in IJmuiden to reduce CO 2 emissions by five million tonnes a year by 2030 and had been exploring various technological options to achieve this, including the capture and storage of CO 2 or a hydrogen route. With the announcement, the company is now undertaking a detailed assessment of the hydrogen route in IJmuiden and is in discussions with all stakeholders involved to further develop this route. In the UK, Tata Steel continues to have discussions with the UK government to seek support for the transition to low-carbon steelmaking, which is a vital part of securing a longterm sustainable future for the business.\n\nThe principal activities of TSE in the FY 2021-22 comprised the manufacture and sale of steel products. TSE's operations produced carbon steel by the basic oxygen steelmaking method  at  its  integrated  steelworks  in  the  Netherlands\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nat  IJmuiden  and  in  the  UK  at  Port  Talbot.  During  the FY 2021-22, these plants produced 10.1 MnT (previous year: 9.6 MnT) of liquid steel. Whilst TSE seeks to increase its di/fferentiated / premium business, which is less dependent on market price movements, it still retains focus in both the UK and Netherlands on improving its operations, consistency, and taking measures to protect against unplanned interruptions and property damage.\n\nTata Steel Netherlands ('TSN') - Liquid steel production at IJmuiden Steel Works, Netherlands during FY 2021-22 at 6.6MnT was - despite some operational issues - 0.4MnT higher than the previous year re/flecting the easing of the COVID-19 impact. Market demand was robust, although some weakness was noticeable in the automotive sector due to the global chip shortages. During FY 2021-2022 TSN continued with the Transformation Programme which is targeting improvements to delivery and yield performance, commercial mix, and reducing operating costs and unplanned downtime. Further progress was also achieved in its 'Strategic Asset Roadmap' (STAR) capital investment programme to support the strategic growth of di/fferentiated, high value products in the automotive, lifting and excavating, and energy and power market sectors. Continuous Caster 23, the largest investment scheme within the STAR-programme, was commissioned in October 2021. The other main items within the STAR-programme will be realised in FY 2023 and the preparations have started to operationalise the Blast Furnace#6 in 2023. Furthermore, signi/ficant progress was achieved in 'Roadmap Plus', which contains a series of measures to eliminate the environmental impact (noise, dust, odour) of the IJmuiden Steel Works.\n\nTata  Steel  UK  ( 'TSUK' )  -  Liquid  steel  production  at  Port Talbot Steel Works, Wales during the FY 2021-22 at 3.5 MnT was 0.2 MnT higher than the previous year which was partly impacted by demand reductions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. During FY 2021-22 TSUK commissioned a new turbine within the power plant with capability of 30Mwe internal power generation helping to reduce the reliance on external energy purchases. During the year, the Transformation programme continued to deliver bene/fits and TSUK broke a number of operational records including weekly production on the Hot Strip Mill and monthly production on the Zodiac galvanising line.\n\n## New Products\n\nIn TSE, 13 new products were launched during the FY 2021-22. These launches include major developments for the Automotive, Construction and Engineering end markets.\n\nIn  the  Automotive  sector,  TSE  continued  to  maintain  its leadership position in the outer panel full /finish segment. It has further improved the chemistry and product performance of  its  Serica\u00ae  range  offering  premium  surface  finish  for market-leading paint appearance for Automotive outer body",

The basic and diluted earnings for the Financial Year 2021-22 were at /uni20B9270.33 per share and /uni20B9270.13 per share respectively (previous year: basic and diluted: /uni20B9145.00 per share and /uni20B9144.99 per share respectively).\n\nThe analysis of major items of the financial statements is given below:\n\n## a) Revenue from operations\n\n|                                | (/uni20B9 crore)   | (/uni20B9 crore)   | (/uni20B9 crore)   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                                | FY 22              | FY 21              | Change (%)         |\n| Sale of products               | 126,070            | 81,361             | 55                 |\n| Sale of power and  water       | 1,611              | 1,467              | 10                 |\n| Other operating  revenue       | 1,340              | 1,305              | 3                  |\n| Total revenue from  operations | 129,021            | 84,133             | 53                 |\n\nDuring the year under review, sale of products was higher as compared to that of the previous year, primarily due to signi/ficant increase in realisations in domestic as well as export markets along with higher deliveries as previous year was impacted due to COVID-19. Ferro Alloys and Mineral Division ( 'FAMD' ) registered lower revenue owing to lower volumes of Ferro Chrome due to transfer of Ferro Chrome business to one of the Group entities. Sale of power and water increased due to higher demand.\n\n## b) Purchases of stock-in-trade\n\n|                              | FY 22   | FY 21   |   (/uni20B9 crore) Change (%) |\n|------------------------------|---------|---------|-------------------------------|\n| Purchases of stock-in- trade | 4,089   | 1,689   |                           142 |\n\nDuring the year under review, Purchases of stock-in-trade was signi/ficantly higher as compared to that of the previous /financial year primarily due to higher purchases of scrap for reducing carbon emissions along with higher scrap prices. Purchases also increased at other sustainable businesses.\n\n## c) Cost of materials consumed\n\n|                             | FY 22   | FY 21   |   (/uni20B9 crore) Change (%) |\n|-----------------------------|---------|---------|-------------------------------|\n| Cost of materials  consumed | 35,257  | 20,757  |                            70 |\n\nDuring the year under review, cost of materials consumed increased primarily due to higher imported coal prices, along with higher consumption of coal, purchased pellet, ferro alloys and other raw materials due to higher prices and higher production during the year.\n\n## d) Employee bene/fits expense\n\n|                             | FY 22   | FY 21   |   (/uni20B9 crore) Change (%) |\n|-----------------------------|---------|---------|-------------------------------|\n| Employee bene/fits  expense | 6,366   | 5,742   |                            11 |",

Rates and Taxes increased in line with higher royalty and higher electricity duty due to increase in rates. Higher freight and handling charges due to increase in deliveries. Higher purchase of power and fuel along with higher repairs to machinery owing to higher production during the year. Consumption of stores and spares increased primarily on account of charging of project expenses for Kalinganagar Phase-II, majorly eliminated through transfer to capital account.

The cash in/flow from operating pro/fit before working capital changes and direct taxes during the current year was /uni20B950,307 crore as compared to in/flow of /uni20B927,227 crore during the previous year due to higher operating pro/fits. Cash in/flow from working capital changes in FY 2021-22 is mainly due to increase in Non-current/current financial  and  other  liabilities/provisions  by  /uni20B911,112  crore primarily due to increase in trade payables on account of coal purchases, partly offset by increase in inventories by /uni20B97,073 crore due to increase in rates, along with increase in Non-current/Current /financial and other assets by /uni20B91,119 crore, in trade receivables and other advances with public bodies.

Tata Steel Limited (Consolidated)\n\nThe consolidated pro/fit after tax of the Company was /uni20B941,749 crore as against /uni20B98,190 crore in the previous year. The increase was mainly due to higher operating pro/fits attributable to improvement in steel prices across geographies during the year along with decrease in /finance cost due to repayment of loans and lower exceptional charge as compared to that of the previous year, partly o/ffset by increase in raw material prices and higher tax expenses during the year due to higher pro/fits.\n\nThe analysis of major items of the financial statements is given below.\n\nNote: Consequent to the re-classi/fication of South East Asian ( 'SEA' ) operations from 'Held for Sale' during the year ended March 31, 2021, results from 'Continuing Operations' for the",

Ltd. ( 'NSH' ) during the year.\n\nOthers primarily include increase at TS Global Procurement which are majorly eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## b) Purchases of stock-in-trade\n\n|                                    | FY 22    | FY 21   | (/uni20B9 crore) Change (%)   |\n|------------------------------------|----------|---------|-------------------------------|\n| Tata Steel (Standalone)            | 4,089    | 1,689   | 142                           |\n| TSE                                | 4,883    | 2,540   | 92                            |\n| TSLP                               | 0        | 0       | N.A.                          |\n| South East Asia                    | 7,425    | 6,702   | 11                            |\n| Others                             | 9,733    | 5,106   | 91                            |\n| Eliminations &  Adjustments        | (10,817) | (6,229) | (74)                          |\n| Total purchases of  stock-in-trade | 15,313   | 9,808   | 56                            |\n\nExpense  was  higher  mainly  at  Tata  Steel  (Standalone) attributable to increase in purchases of scrap owing to higher quantities coupled with higher prices. Increase at TSE was mainly due to increase in external steel purchases consistent with increase in deliveries along with adverse exchange impact on translation. South East Asia ( 'SEA' ) increased despite the divestment of Singapore operations at NSH, due to increase in billet production at TSTH along with increase in input metallic prices.\n\nOthers primarily include transactions at TCIL, TSDPL which are majorly eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## c) Cost of materials consumed\n\n|                                   | (/uni20B9 crore)   | (/uni20B9 crore)   | (/uni20B9 crore)   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                                   | FY 22              | FY 21              | Change (%)         |\n| Tata Steel (Standalone)           | 35,257             | 20,757             | 70                 |\n| TSE                               | 35,306             | 22,121             | 60                 |\n| TSLP                              | 3,930              | 2,182              | 80                 |\n| South East Asia                   | 1,248              | 341                | 266                |\n| Others                            | 62,082             | 29,274             | 112                |\n| Eliminations &  Adjustments       | (62,059)           | (29,382)           | (111)              |\n| Total cost of materials  consumed | 75,764             | 45,293             | 67                 |\n\nConsumption was higher across all major entities mainly due to higher cost of consumption of imported coal & other raw materials owing to higher prices and higher consumption due to higher production. TSE reported increase in GBP terms primarily due to increase in production along with higher coal and coke prices, higher iron ore and scrap prices and adverse exchange impact on translation. Increase at South East Asia was mainly on account of re-grouping of certain expenses from purchases during the year.\n\nOthers primarily re/flects increase in transactions at T S Global Procurement which are majorly eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## d) Employee bene/fits expense\n\n|                                   | (/uni20B9 crore)   | (/uni20B9 crore)   | (/uni20B9 crore)   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                                   | FY 22              | FY 21              | Change (%)         |\n| Tata Steel (Standalone)           | 6,366              | 5,742              | 11                 |\n| TSE                               | 14,879             | 12,314             | 21                 |\n| TSLP                              | 216                | 215                | 1                  |\n| South East Asia                   | 554                | 573                | (3)                |\n| Others                            | 1,171              | 1,008              | 16                 |\n| Eliminations &  Adjustments       | 78                 | 57                 | 36                 |\n| Total employee  bene/fits expense | 23,264             | 19,909             | 17                 |\n\nIncrease in expenses was mainly at Tata Steel (Standalone) owing to increase in bonus provision on account of increased pro/fitability, along with the higher sta/ff welfare expenses.\n\nIncrease at TSE was mainly due to increase in bonus provision due to increased pro/fitability along with adverse exchange impact on translation.\n\nMarginal decrease at SEA was mainly due to divestment of Singapore operations at NSH in Q2 FY 2022, partly o/ffset by higher bonus provisions at Thailand.",

E/ffect of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Company\n\nDuring FY 2020-21, the outbreak of novel Corona Virus has impacted the economy and businesses not only in India, but across the globe. The rapid spread of the infection amongst the Indian population forced Government of India to announce the imposition of nation-wide lockdowns from March, 2020, later followed by partial lockdowns by the states, during FY 202122, depending on the infection spread. The nation-wide lockdown brought business and economy to a complete halt barring exemption noti/fied by the Government and subject to following the hygiene standards and social distancing norms as noti/fied by health ministry.\n\nBased on strict interventions of the governments of various countries and scienti/fic research, vaccines were developed for commercial usage during later part of FY 2020-21. While Indian government launched a nationwide rapid vaccination drive for its citizens (to reduce the mortality rate) during FY 2021-22, the second wave of the pandemic hit the nation during the /first quarter of FY 2021-22. India was amongst the worst hit nations in the world with high fatalities. During the second wave, the operations of the Company continued at normal levels following the Covid protocols without much of disruptions as was experienced in the /first wave of the pandemic. The Engineering and Projects division of the Company overcame the challenges posed by the pandemic by ensuring immunization and following appropriate protocols at all project sites. The impact of supply chain disruptions and steep increase in input prices were mitigated to a large extent by close cooperation with key vendor partners.\n\nThe Company continued to support the society and served communities  across  many  locations  through  its  threepronged communication strategy - awareness, engagement and reinforcement, via real-time and focussed communication in di/fferent languages through traditional and new media, to achieve maximum reach and impact across all stakeholders. Few of the Company's initiatives are:\n\n- \u00b7 Introduced platforms for leadership engagement and short audio capsules such as audiograms of doctors' interviews were developed in-house for circulation. To address the scale of queries and concerns on COVID-19, a 24x7 employee helpline assistance called People Care was set up.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Large  Scale  Testing:  The  Company  shouldered  the responsibility  of  facilitating  COVID-19  testing  for  its workforce, so as to isolate individuals who were infected. The Tata Main Hospital (TMH) Jamshedpur was the /first private hospital in Jharkhand to be certi/fied by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for RT-PCR diagnostic test for COVID-19. The Company's medical services has conducted ~3.3 lakh COVID-19 tests (RT-PCR, TruNat, Antigen) during past two years.\n- \u00b7 Augmenting Healthcare Consumables: 3,78,000 testing kits, ~50,000 home isolation kits, 10 ventilators and oxygen concentrators were provided by the Company.\n- \u00b7 Dedicated COVID Care Facilities: The Company coordinated with state governments and the local administration to establish COVID Care facilities across its operating locations. The 1,000-bed TMH at Jamshedpur in Jharkhand has 450 oxygen  beds  and  78  ventilator  beds  dedicated  solely to COVID care. In addition, 100 oxygen beds have been provided to two of its subsidiary's hospitals and a 150-bed COVID Care Centre, set up for asymptomatic patients, or those with mild symptoms. In Odisha, the Tata Medica Super Specialty Hospital in Kalinganagar dedicated 120 beds with oxygen support and ventilators to COVID Care, including a 15-bed ICU facility. In a coordinated e/ffort with the Odisha Government and district administration, at Jajpur, 200-bed COVID Care Centre was developed. Similar, facilities were developed at erswhile Tata Steel BSL's plant in Dhenkanal, raw material and other locations across Jharia, West Bokaro and Noamundi in Jharkhand, as well as Joda and Gopalpur in Odisha.\n- \u00b7 Liquid Medical Oxygen and Oxygen Plants: All steel plants in the country, throughout both waves of the pandemic, collaborated with the Central and State Governments to augment the supply of Liquid Medical Oxygen ( 'LMO' ). All three manufacturing locations of the Company in Jharkhand and Kalinganagar and Dhenkanal in Odisha, were sources of LMO. During /first half of FY 2021-22, more than 60,000 tons of liquid oxygen had been supplied for medical purposes. The Company has already commissioned 19 state-of-the-art Pressure Swing Adsorption ( 'PSA' ) oxygen plants at various locations to maintain the oxygen supply.\n- \u00b7 Vaccinations: The Company purchased adequate doses from the Government and administered these to its employees and their families. This also included health workers and frontline workers across Company-owned hospitals. More than 3 lakh COVID-19 vaccines have been administered by TMH till date.\n\n## VII.

Supported by a buoyant commodity market, Tata Steel recorded its best-ever performance in FY 2021-22.\n\nDuring the /first quarter of FY 2021-22, when India was hit by the second wave of pandemic, the Company dealt with COVID-19 with agility and determination, keeping its employees and the community at the core of its response. Medical infrastructure in Jharkhand and Odisha was ramped up, creating more isolation beds. More than 80,000 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen was supplied to multiple states to support the community. In  the  year  gone  by,  the  Company  achieved  significant strategic milestones. The balance sheet was significantly deleveraged with net debt-to-EBITDA at 0.8 times at the end of FY 2021-22. Further, the Company received investment-grade credit rating. The Company continues its focus on strengthening the balance sheet and executing the growth plans in India. Simpli/fication of portfolio continues with completion of the amalgamation of Tata Steel BSL Limited into and with Tata Steel, divestment of its stake in NatSteel Holdings and segregation of TSE into TSN and TSUK. In Q4 FY 2021-22, the Russia-Ukraine war strained raw material prices globally, especially coking coal prices. In the year ahead, the Company will stay focused on execution of its strategic priorities including growth projects, achieve excellence at all touch points and enhance agility.\n\nThe Company remains committed to execute the following Long Term Plans by 2030:\n\n## Leadership in India:\n\nCompany's  focus  on  domestic  markets  aligns  with  the increasing prominence of India in the global economy and steel industry. During the year under review, Tata Steel through its subsidiary Tata Steel Long Products Limited, acquired Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd to increase its market share in long products business. The Company aspires to increase its production capacity to reach 40 MnTPA by FY 2030. The Company also aims to be the most respected and preferred steel supplier to discerning customers in Indian markets. Company's leadership aspirations establishes the need to be ahead of the curve on digital disruptions, changing consumer behaviour, and building a culture of customer obsession throughout the organisation. Key attributes of leadership includes delivering innovative products & services, serving existing and emerging customer needs and providing the best customer experience.\n\n## Consolidate position as global cost leader:\n\nThe  ongoing  Russia-Ukraine  conflict  along  with  the China-Australia trade war has resulted in extreme swings in the raw material and steel prices in the International market. To make the Company's performance more resilient, the Company is focussing on both operational and structural cost improvement initiatives. Several initiatives like Aspire, Shikhar 25 have led Tata Steel to operate at global / Indian benchmark levels on multiple KPIs. Cost leadership can be achieved through execution of structural cost reduction initiatives such as investments in augmenting the raw material portfolio to\n\nmeet increasing demand, strengthening logistics networks and /fixed cost reduction among others.\n\nAttain leadership position in adjacent businesses: It is important to explore and lead in adjacent businesses that leverage the Company's capabilities and market opportunities. The Company's approach is to di/fferentiate from its competitors, through deep understanding of customer needs, technology and knowledge. Adjacent businesses where the Company aspires to attain leadership position are:\n\n- 1) Services  &  Solutions  ('S&S') : Leveraging  the Company's  deep  knowledge  and  expertise  in  steel applications to create solutions for construction and household applications such as doors, windows, and housing solutions.\n- 2) New Materials Business ('NMB') : Taking advantage of growth in non-steel materials driven by megatrends (such as light-weighting, cleaner environment), NMB will create technology-driven businesses in identified materials. The business is focusing on composites, graphene, and advanced ceramics for medical materials.\n- 3) Commercial  Mining  (through  its  wholly  owned subsidiary  Tata  Steel  Mining  Ltd.): The  Company aspires  to  leverage  the  opportunities  arising  from the  Government's  'Atmanirbhar  Bharat'  Programme and regulatory changes to meet captive raw material requirements beyond 2030 by creating a sustainable mining business.\n\nLeadership in sustainability: Sustainability is a key issue for steel industry. Tata Steel aspires to achieve leadership in the following areas of sustainability: reduction in speci/fic carbon emission intensity across the value chain, reduction in speci/fic water consumption, reduction of specific dust emissions, enhancing circular economy as a business model, and enriching the biodiversity in areas of our operations. The Company has taken aspirational targets in each of these areas. Use of technology and innovation in existing processes and business models will be critical to achieve the targets.\n\nIn pursuit of its strategic objectives, the Company remains committed towards working on four key strategic enablers. Building a workforce which is future ready along with enabling policies and infrastructure to support future of work and workplace will be critical to attain and retain the best talent in the industry. To create a safe and healthy environment for all employees, the Company is focusing on reducing unsafe incidents at the workplace through process and technology interventions. Connected platforms with analytics and system generated insights and alerts play a pivotal role in our safety journey.  Digital  has  significant  potential  of  creating  and unlocking value in existing processes. Tata Steel has made signi/ficant progress on the digital journey and has three World Economic Forum Industry 4.0 lighthouse sites. Tata Steel aspires to be a digital leader in the steel industry globally. The Company",

Fostering a culture towards agility, innovation, digital, environment, diversity, and safety will be critical for the Company to achieve its strategic objectives and be future ready.\n\n## VIII. Human Resource Management and Industrial Relations\n\nHuman resources have always been one of the most valued stakeholders and employee centric culture has been a key di/fferentiator for Tata Steel. The Company's goal of becoming the 'Best Workplace in Manufacturing' has led us on a path of new world of possibilities, requiring us to work on new set of challenges for future ready workforce.\n\nTata Steel has a culture of working together through joint consultation between Union and Management and has a very strong commitment towards community development. Its people practices have enabled the Company in creating an environment of collaboration and connect which has aided Tata Steel to achieve industrial harmony for over 93 years. Continuing its people centric philosophy, the Company has successfully completed the human resource integration of Tata Steel Meramandali during the year under review.\n\nDespite the pandemic bringing new challenges before the Company,  it  continued  to  evolve  its  people  practices  in supporting its employees through the challenging times. The Company pursued vaccination of its workforce and their family members and achieved the vaccination coverage of over 99% of own and contract employees across all location and businesses. COVID-19 Family Protection Scheme was introduced to support the family of employees who succumbed to death due to COVID. COVID-19 brought digitalization into sharp focus with many projects being implemented to ensure employee safety & wellbeing and new way of working.\n\nTo remain competitive, improving employee productivity is of utmost importance to the organization and Tata Steel strive to achieve benchmark performance in this area by undertaking initiatives like revised 'Sunehere Bhavishya Ki Yojana 2.0' and Internal Talent Bank for redundancy management. During FY 2021-22, the overall Employee Productivity for the Company increased from 745 tonnes to 854 tonnes of crude steel/ employee/year.\n\nDuring the year under review, the Company implemented some major initiatives to promote inclusion and diversity. The Company deployed the batch of 14 transgender trainees as heavy machinery operators at West Bokaro Coal Mines and 12 transgender trainees at Kalinganagar Plant. 'Women@\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMines' coverage was extended to West Bokaro location and 16 female trainees were onboarded. Tata Steel has rolled out various sensitization initiatives for inclusion of LGBTQ+ workforce. E/fforts have also been taken on creating digital infrastructure for diverse workforce as well as retaining and developing women leaders to create a pool of diverse talent in the organization. Our continuous e/fforts were recognized and we were declared IWEI GOLD Employer for LGBT Inclusion 2021 and amongst 100 Best Companies for Women 2021 by AVTAR & Working Mother.\n\nTata Steel continues to be focussed on employee well-being. 'Take Care' - An employee well-being initiative was introduced to sensitize the workforce on mental well-being. 'Moment that Matters' was introduced to celebrate key moments in employee's journey.\n\nTata Steel is committed to improving the quality of life of the communities it serves through long-term stakeholder value creation based on the ethos of the Tata Group - 'Leadership with Trust'. Respecting and upholding human rights of all stakeholders is integral to this commitment. Tata Steel have adopted the 'Tata Steel Business and Human Rights Policy' in FY 2021-22 which sets out its commitment towards respecting and upholding human rights of various stakeholders. This policy has six commitments on human rights, viz establishing governance,  integration  in  strategy  &  risk  management, sensitization,  advocacy,  grievance  redressal  and  public disclosure. The Senior Management has an oversight on protection of human rights in Tata Steel and an Apex Business & Human Rights Committee has been established for deployment of this Policy within the company.\n\nMultiple  initiatives  for  skill  building  of  employees  were undertaken during the year. Step Up - An AI Based Talent Marketplace was rolled out to enable employees to get exposure in various cross functional projects of their preference. 8 new school of excellence were launched in the prioritized area and evening diploma program was introduced for the employees.\n\nTata Steel was once again certi/fied as Great Place to Work\u00a9 in the Great Place to Work study and was declared as one of the top 30 'India's Best Workplaces in the Manufacturing sector' by Great Place to Work\u00a9 for the 5th time. Tata Steel was also recognized India's Best Employer's Among Nation builders by Great Place To Work\u00a9. This year, Tata Steel was also adjudged as amongst Top 5 Employer Brand by Randstad Employer Brand Research. Tata Steel was also recognized as Best Companies to Work for in India by Business Today's BT-Taggd survey and also held the top rank in Manufacturing Sector in the survey.\n\n## IX. Digital Transformation\n\nWith the onset of COVID-19, the rate of digital transformation has only accelerated with enablement of digital technologies.

        "page_content": "been substantially blurred by a fusion of technologies that are enabling the 4th Industrial Revolution.\n\nData is fueling the 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) - The ability to generate, store, process and consume data has grown exponentially. Proliferation of smart sensors, digital apps, high speed & inexpensive connectivity, near-unconstrained computing  capacity  &  human  ingenuity  are  propelling humankind towards an era that will be integrated across time & space, eliminate information & knowledge asymmetry and underpinned by sustainable living. The Company made a commitment to Cloud, Data and Arti/ficial Intelligence as the building blocks of the digital transformation journey as it moved ~85% of its servers to cloud over the last four years.\n\nThe second critical component of the transformation is talent - The Company undertook major step for retaining talent is bringing work to talent irrespective of work location in the form of work from home, virtual command centers for manufacturing and mining, simulation training in mills. Digital skills are essential for transformation and their need is here to stay, so the Company is continuously providing various online training initiatives and platforms for upskilling, reskilling including training on blockchain technology and judiciously purchasing talent with these skills.\n\nOne of the most critical component of the transformation is business centricity. Though technological advancement is a component of intelligent and agile behavior, business transformation shall always keep its primary focus on the strategic goals of the Company. Towards this, the leadership team shall encourage ideation & innovation. Further, concepts like Reverse Mentoring, which was recognized as an Industry best practice by the World Economic Forum, can help stimulate leadership thinking. Under this program a Senior Leader is mentored by a Millennial / Zoomer (Gen Z) on the possibilities of how digital technologies can be used in the business functions. Additionally, a robust program governance brings in the required amount of time & mind share of the leadership to build and sustain the momentum for change. Organizations would need to get their Technology, Talent and Governance strategies right to be able to ride the ensuing wave of Industry 4.0 and reap timely and handsome bene/fits. The key to success for any business is the ability to make timely decisions and for that to happen it is imperative that the decision makers across levels have access to the right information & insights at the right time. Digital technologies enhances the /flow of real time information sharing for better decision making. Quality and quantity of data coupled with Data Science techniques provide decision makers with insights from the past which enables them to take realistic decisions. Hence, the differentiator for businesses today and way forward will be their ability to harness the latent strength of Data. Robust use of digital technology has the potential to signi/ficantly uplift operational e/fficiency, productivity, throughput & organizational agility to\n\ndeliver seamless & hyper-personalized experience to all their stakeholders through their products and services.\n\nAs Tata Steel continue to leverage the power of Data and ride the 4th wave of Industrial Revolution, it is increasingly becoming apparent as to the steps businesses need to take going forward to stay relevant and be more conscious in their business processes and dealings. Whether it is environmental sustainability or people centricity, a sustainable and pro/fitable business would need to assimilate further into the conscience of the community they operate in, all of which are possible through the application of Industry 4.0 technologies. These aspects of sustainability & community centricity coupled with harmonized human-machine interface and responsible usage of digital technologies together forms part of 5th Industrial Revolution.  This  is  expected  to  bring  greater  economic prosperity and better standards of living.\n\n## X. Corporate Finance\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has estimated that the global economy is projected to grow at 4.9% in 2022. Beyond 2022 global growth is projected to moderate to about 3.3% over the medium term. Advanced economy output is forecasted to exceed pre-pandemic medium-term projections largely reflecting  sizeable  policy  support  in  USA.  By  contrast, persistent output losses are anticipated for the emerging market and developing economies due to slower vaccine rollouts and generally less favorable policy support compared to advanced economies.\n\nOn the domestic front, GDP is expected to grow by 7.2% in FY 2022-23. Further in FY 2023-24, assuming a normal monsoon, and no major exogenous or policy shocks, the GDP growth is estimated at 6.3% with quarterly growth rates in the range of 5.9%-6.8%.\n\nThe GDP growth estimates are subject to certain upside and downside risks. Upside risks could emanate from stronger and sustained expansion in domestic demand. Domestic demand is expected to be led by the government's thrust on capital expenditure, healthier corporate balance sheets leading to private investments and re-start of contact intensive services. On the contrary, the heightened geopolitical tensions leading to high commodity prices including crude oil and the loss of momentum in global trade and demand pose sizeable downside risks to the baseline growth path. Renewed COVID-19 infections, pandemic-related global supply bottlenecks and advanced economies' monetary policy normalization also add to the downside risks.\n\n## Financial Markets:\n\nGlobal /financial markets experienced dramatic swings from buoyancy  to  a  whirlpool  of  volatility  amidst  heightened uncertainties over Delta and Omicron variant in Q1 and Q3 of FY 2021-22. Imminent tapering of asset purchases and rate hikes",

During Q4 FY 2021-22, the sharp escalation of geopolitical tensions culminating  in  military  intervention  in  Ukraine  stunned global markets across asset classes. Global oil and commodity prices spiked to multiyear highs, equity markets in several economies experienced sharp declines, sovereign bond yields in large economies like US fell as investors looked for safety. The US dollar also strengthened on safe-haven demand while emerging market currencies weakened.\n\nOn the domestic front, /financial markets remained volatile because of the outbreak of new variants of COVID-19, domestic in/flation, bearishness about the large government borrowing programme and, existing geopolitical conflicts. Domestic equities witnessed sharp sell-o/ffs in the second half of February 2022 over Ukraine-Russia tensions but recovered in the second half of March 2022. Overall, the BSE Sensex scaled above 60K in January 2022 compared to previous year, a growth of 20%. However, the geopolitical event led correction in the stock prices, coupled with higher corporate earnings, led to the price-to-earnings ratio (of BSE Sensex) falling to 25.1 by endMarch 2022 from 27.6 in end-September 2021, moderating the valuation premium over its long-term average.\n\nIn the bond markets, interest rate tightening is visible with ten years of G-sec yields hardening in the second half of the year by 63 bps. Higher than expected state govt/UT borrowings, rise in US yields, increase in international crude oil and other commodity prices over escalating geopolitical tensions have pushed G-Sec yields higher. Tracking G-sec yields, Corporate bond yields also moved higher and risk premia compressed amidst moderation in new issuances due to lower demand as the capex cycle still remains at a nascent stage. Corporates resorted to increased overseas issuances and bank loans to take advantage of lower prices resulting in lesser bond issuances in domestic market.\n\n## Central Banks and Monetary Policy:\n\nCOVID-19 saw an unprecedented policy response mounted by governments and central banks. The IMF estimates that US$16.9 trillion or 16.4% of global GDP had been pledged as /fiscal support in response to the pandemic, with US$14.5 trillion by advanced economies and US$2.4 trillion by emerging economies, including the low-income developing countries. However, post-vaccination recovery, the demand rush and supply gaps have pushed in/flation higher with the Bloomberg commodity price index hitting 8 year high in early March. With the Russia-Ukraine war propelling outright supply losses, Crude Oil has hit 133$/barrel in March 2022 which has remained in the $110/barrel range. Food prices also hit an all-time high with a 20.7% year on year increase since February 2021.\n\nIn the US, headline in/flation hit 40 years high at 7.9%. With its alarming increase, Fed raised the target range for the Federal Funds rate by 25 bps to 0.25%-0.5% in March 2022, the /first-rate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhike since December 2018. Similarly, in the Euro area also, CPI in/flation scaled a historical high of 7.5% in March 2021. UK also struggled with high in/flation at 6.4% - the highest in the last 25 years. Bank of England, raised rates by 15bps in December 2021, 25 bps in February 2022 and 25 bps again in March 2022, clearly suggesting that interest rates are headed higher.\n\nCloser home, the upper tolerance limit for CPI inflation of 6% was breached in February 2022. Though, the MPC of the RBI noted that the domestic recovery needed to be nurtured assiduously through all policy channels and decided unanimously to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4%. However, in the latest action, it has incentivized banks to park funds with RBI by increasing Standing Deposit Facility rates. This is aimed at decreasing liquidity in the system and will also propel higher overnight rates. This indicates RBI's focus is moving towards controlling in/flation rather than nurturing growth.\n\n## Financing:\n\nCOVID/hyphen.cap19 pandemic in FY 2020-21 necessitated a sharp focus on cash /flows. The cash /flow focus in the Company's business processes has helped in optimizing its working capital through better inventory management, faster collection from debtors and extended credit period from suppliers.\n\nChina has been contracting its steel capacities to reduce carbon emissions. This has led to structural changes in the steel industry giving rise to higher regional production and consumption, thereby reducing export capacities and increasing international prices. In response to the pandemic, governments across the world rolled out large stimulus packages including by way of developing infrastructure projects. The combination of lower supplies and strong stimulus by the economies have taken steel prices higher across the world. Taking the advantage of the upcycle, Tata Steel continues the pace of deleveraging in FY 2021-22.\n\nDuring the FY 2021-22, debt levels of the Company were signi/ficantly reduced as the Company repaid its debt of /uni20B915,232 crore on a consolidated basis. The Company had outstanding Gross Debt of /uni20B988,501 crore as at March 31, 2021 which has now reduced to /uni20B975,561 crore as at March 31, 2022. The deleveraging has signi/ficantly strengthened the balance sheet and cash /flow planning of the Company.\n\nThe Company has restarted its capital expenditure program across various business units. The Cold Rolling Mill and Pellet Plant in Kalinganagar is expected to be operationalized shortly which will be margin accretive to the existing business.\n\n## Credit Ratings:\n\nDuring the year under review, international rating agency S&P Global Ratings upgraded Tata Steel's Corporate Family Rating by four notches to 'BBB-' Outlook: Stable from 'B+' Outlook: Stable. With the upgrade, Tata Steel has become an investmentgrade rated entity in the international markets. Further, Moody's",

CARE Ratings upgraded Tata Steel's longterm credit rating by one notch to 'AA+' Outlook: Stable from 'AA' Outlook: Negative'. Brickwork Ratings also upgraded Tata Steel's long-term credit rating to 'AA+' Outlook: Stable from 'AA' Outlook: Stable.\n\n## XI. Risks and Mitigation Strategy\n\nTata Steel operates in an interconnected world with stringent regulatory  and  environmental  requirements,  increased geopolitical risks and fast-paced technological disruptions that could have a material impact across the value chain of the organisation. Tata Steel has implemented an Enterprise Risk Management ( 'ERM' ) process to provide a holistic view of aggregated risk exposures as well as to facilitate more informed decision-making.\n\nIn its journey towards risk intelligence, a robust governance structure has been developed across the organisation. The Board of Directors has constituted a Committee of the Board called Risk Management Committee. At the Senior Management level, an Apex Risk Committee ( 'ARC' ) has been constituted to drive the ERM process across the Tata Steel Group.\n\nInformation regarding key risks facing Tata Steel and their mitigation strategies is given here:\n\n## Financial Risks\n\nIn/flation concerns have been mounting globally particularly in the US and Europe.  The recent war in eastern Europe has also disrupted supply chains and led to heightened volatility in /financial markets which has further exacerbated the in/flation concerns. Central banks throughout the world have begun hiking rates in response.\n\nAs the Company is on a growth path and has large capital requirements, the cost of /financing may be adversely a/ffected by the rising rate environment.\n\nThe Company is also exposed to currency volatility given the  import  requirements,  foreign  currency  debt  and o/ffshore operations.\n\nDevelopment in climate change regulation and disclosure standards  reduces  access  to  capital  and  increases  cost of funding.\n\n## Mitigation strategies\n\nThe Company has been generating strong cash/flows on the back of strong operating performance and focused working capital management. It has been aggressively deleveraging over the last few years which has improved its credit metrics\n\nsigni/ficantly and reduced its vulnerability to /financial market volatility and rising interest rates.\n\nThe Company endeavors to strike a balance between growth and deleveraging and to optimize its /financial plan to meet this objective. It has a robust capital allocation strategy which prioritizes margin accretive projects with shorter payback periods. In line with this policy, the Company has also exited its operations in Singapore.  Our 5 MnTPA TSK phase - II expansion has been /financed largely by internal cash/flows. Our subsidiary, TSLP was selected as preferred bidder for NINL, a 1 MnTPA long product's steel plant.  The acquisition is being /financed by Tata Steel through a combination of internal accruals and bridge loans which are expected to be paid down through internal cash generation over the next few quarters.\n\nAt the start of this financial year, we had set a target of achieving  investment  grade  level  financial  metrics  and we were able to achieve the same within 6 months of this /financial year. In October 2021, S&P upgraded Tata Steel to investment grade level 'BBB-'.\n\nThe Company has a robust hedging policy which defines the risk management framework and the risk appetite of the Company.   Based on this policy, a dedicated and experienced Treasury team manages the currency and interest rate exposure on operating and project /flows and on o/ffshore debt.  The Company is also actively de-risking its currency exposure by prioritizing repayment of o/ffshore debt.  During FY 2021-22, US$ 2.1 Bn of o/ffshore debt was reduced.\n\nTo keep ourselves ahead of the climate change risks, we intend to reduce our carbon footprint and have set our decarbonisation targets. We also continue to improve upon our disclosure of environmental, social and governance factors.  We are also driving monitoring and compliance towards various emission parameters as per the guidelines of global /financial institutions.\n\n## Regulatory Risks\n\nThe steel sector is subject to an extensive, complex and evolving regulatory framework that may have material impact on operations.\n\nAny deviation in compliance and adherence has the potential to not only impact the Company's operating performance but also impact its reputation adversely.\n\nGlobal disruptions, emerging trade patterns and evolving environmental & sustainability policies, etc. could in/fluence business decisions and market footprint. The aim is to protect and enable business to generate value.\n\n## Mitigation strategies\n\nThe  Company  is  constantly  monitoring  the  regulatory landscape to proactively assess the impact of changing laws and policies and evolving government mindset on matters a/ffecting Company's operations.",

It is an integral part of our culture and operating philosophy.\n\nThe Company has a robust compliance management system to ensure awareness and compliance. The Company has invested in benchmark systems and processes that are accessible to all to steer compliance across the organization. The roles and responsibilities have been clearly de/fined for providing due focus and ensuring compliance.\n\nPolicy Advocacy is undertaken to advocate best available practices, simplify guidelines to reduce cost of doing business and improve ease of doing business in a manner that promotes the best interest of the industry and the country.\n\nTechnology is being utilised to track compliance, timelines with suitable escalations, action plans and reviews. Investments needed to comply with regulatory requirements are prioritized within the capital expenditure approval framework.\n\n## Macroeconomic and Market risks\n\nSteel demand is a/ffected by high in/flation, especially for energy and commodities, trade barriers and protectionist policies. Re-imposition of mobility restrictions amidst spread of new variants may also a/ffect demand and supply chains potentially impacting sales. Fast-paced technological changes and shifting customer preferences may necessitate adoption of newer grades of steel and alternate materials.\n\n## Mitigation strategies\n\nThe  Company  undertook  numerous  steps  to  deal with  the  challenges  in  the  operating  as  well  as  the macro-environment  arising  out  of  the  COVID-19  second wave  and  the  ensuing  localized  restrictions  imposed  by the  state  governments.  Scenario-based  risk  assessment was conducted to assess and plan for a range of outcomes. In periods of softness in domestic demand, Tata Steel opted for higher proportion of exports. This year, we focused on diversi/fication of exports in terms of geographies and products (downstream). As the restrictions eased out and domestic demand  improved,  domestic  deliveries  were  increased. A real-time digital dashboard was also put up during the COVID-19  second  wave  for  monitoring  and  updates  of the  risks  arising  out  of  the  resurgence  of  the  pandemic and  mitigations  were  pursued  accordingly.  We  remain vigilant of the evolving market conditions and its impact on steel-intensive sectors. There was increase in cold rolled and coated market share across key OEMs and ancillaries. The Company also focused on enhancing channel capacity (reach) and capability. TISCON is the /first Indian rebar to be awarded GreenPro certi/ficate. In our endeavor to enhance footprint in India, we have built a diversified portfolio of product o/fferings for customers from a range of industries to leverage the growing opportunities in these segments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDedicated marketing and sales teams service customers and build deep customer engagement by customizing products, improving reliability and providing value added services. Tata  Steel  has  invested  in  building  a  strong  marketing franchise with well-regarded brands and a large network of  distributors  and  dealers  across  the  country.  This helps  in  increasing  the  stickiness  of  sales  and  reduces the exposure to business cycles. It has also built distribution channels  internationally  to  enable  exports  as  and  when desired. Steel is a cyclical industry and the only way to beat this cyclicality is by o/ffering solutions. We have forayed into ready-to-use steel for construction industry and introduced products  such  as  steel  doors  and  windows,  furniture  to enhance our retail customer base. Sustainable coated products such as GalvaRoS, & Colornova and customized solutions help meet unique requirements of our discerning customers. We are also diversifying our product o/ffering beyond steel by introducing new materials such as Composites, Fiber Reinforced Products, etc.\n\n## Operational Risks\n\nDisruption to Tata Steel's manufacturing processes caused due to various factors such as equipment failures, natural disasters, epidemics or pandemics or extreme weather events,  etc. could adversely a/ffect its operations and customer service levels.\n\n## Mitigation strategies\n\nThe Company is focused on adopting advanced maintenance practices to improve plant availability and reliability. There is  a  dedicated  team  that  analyses  benchmark  practices for formulation and execution of advanced maintenance practices. The Maintenance Technology Roadmap is well in  progress  for  transitioning  to  Predictive  Maintenance based practices. This is helping in improved asset reliability across  the  steel  value  chain.  Robust  digital  ecosystem to  enable  leveraging  data  science  and  IoT  for  real-time shutdown  management  continues  to  be  operational  for ensuring optimal coordination.\n\nRecognition of Tata Steel's Jamshedpur Plant along with Kalinganagar  Plant  in  India  and  the  IJmuiden  Plant  in the  Netherlands  as  'Advanced  4th  Industrial  Revolution Lighthouse' by World Economic Forum is a testimony to the e/ffectiveness of the organization's investments in state-of the-art equipment and processes. Digital initiatives have been undertaken to optimize inventory and improve process e/fficiencies to achieve benchmark availability at optimal cost. Focused drive towards indigenization of spares has helped in self-reliance and is also aligned to 'Make-in-India' concept. Accordingly, several vendor partners are being developed to supply benchmark quality spares with optimum lead time. We remain vigilant of the volatile pandemic situation and have taken several measures towards employee health and safety while ensuring continuity of business operations. We also",

The implications of the risks increase manifold with the growth and diversi/fication of our business and operations at multiple locations that subjects the Company to various stringent safety laws and regulations.\n\nCOVID-19 contagion poses risk to workforce health and safety and may lead to business disruptions.\n\n## Mitigation strategies\n\nWith the motto of 'Committed to Zero', we have remained steadfast to our belief of safeguarding people. To meet this target, the Company has continuously forti/fied the Safety Management and governance mechanism and built a safety focused culture across business operations. Risk reduction at the workplace and improvement in the risk perception of the workforce has been the focus area in last /financial year. A robust risk management framework is in place and continuous e/fforts have been put to improve the risk visualization among workforce. Improving the behavior of the workforce through experiential learning and focus on dissemination of safety standards  has  been  the  key  to  improve  risk  perception. Reinforcing this culture through rewards & recognition as well as sensitising the workforce to the extent of reaching out to their families through programs such as 'Ghar se Ghar tak' have gone hand in hand. Various campaigns such as 'National Road Safety Month' and those related to mitigation of risks associated with top hazards were undertaken. The employees are provided awareness and engaged through online quizzes, mass mailers and SMS, message by senior executives, various competitions etc. Further, Tata Steel stresses upon the capability development of all stakeholders such as employees, vendor & business partners and trainees at regular intervals.\n\nTata  Steel  has  institutionalized  business  continuity management through development of tactical center for response to any major onsite emergency and developed CoE (Centre of Excellence) in Process Safety Management to deploy standardized process safety management across the organization.  Workplace Safety & Process Safety Management in Tata Steel have matured over the years through adoption of various robotic and technological solutions. Digital platforms have been continuously enhanced to address and mitigate key concerns.\n\nTata Steel launched POD system - a multi-layer protection to break the transmission circuit of COVID-19 virus at the workplace in August 2020. During the second and third waves also, the workforce has been modalized into 5,000 PODs and inter-POD movement is restricted to prevent contamination\n\namong majority of the workforce in case someone tests positive. POD breaches and deviations are well tracked in the IT system. POD members maintain social distance and frequently sanitize their equipment, making for a more secure tomorrow.\n\nTata Steel has been recognized for e/fficiently handling COVID-19 by the World Steel Association for its application on 'Ensuring Workforce Safety & Business Continuity by mitigating COVID-19 Risk'.\n\n## Community Risks\n\nOur operations foster a shared societal context with communities proximate to our locations and are guided by an aspiration of significant and lasting betterment in the well-being of the region. This is fostered through continuous dialogue, understanding of vulnerabilities, recognition of aspirations and appreciation of cultural nuances leading to a relationship based on trust. An erosion of trust with communities will slow down societal impact and lead to consequent loss of reputation or business continuity for us.\n\n## Mitigation strategies\n\nTata Steel anchors one of the deepest and most diverse societal development efforts based on a combination of programmes and platforms reaching more than 2.8 million lives, including more than 1.8 million people reached through #CombatCovid19 programmes. The Company adopts a Boardled strategic approach to deepening trust and commits talent and resources through the Tata Steel Foundation towards enabling dialogue with and impact for the least served and most silent. The key impact programmes, each being large scale change models for core development challenges in India, span rural & urban education, household health & nutrition, tribal cultural heritage, livelihoods, agriculture, water resources, dignity for disabled, grassroot rural governance, grassroot sports, women & youth empowerment, public infrastructure etc. are closely aligned to the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 agenda. These have yielded significant long-term results including  more  than  2,400  habitations  being  declared child labor free zones, 40% decline in maternal and child mortality  rates  in  remote  tribal  regions,  more  than  9 million  cubic  feet  of  water  conserved  annually  through watershed led programmes, more than 25,000 learners of tribal languages et al while curating positive social capital and  effective  leadership  amongst  communities.  The  key driver of this approach are multiple structured forums for dialogue with communities which are convened periodically to discuss and co-create a shared impact agenda.\n\nThe Company, also, has a portfolio of products which is aimed at addressing societal challenges such as a/ffordable housing and farm income enhancement, while key business processes are also designed to have a clear diversity and a/ffirmative action perspective.

Tata Steel Europe's Community Partnership Programme 'Future Generations', with sub-themes of education, environment, health and well-being, works across the UK, assisting job and wealth creation by supporting small and medium businesses with /finance and business premises.\n\nOur  efforts  have  been  recognized  across  national  and global  platforms  including  Government  of  India,  Dun & Bradstreet, Confederation of Indian Industry and BRICS Business Council.\n\n## Commodity Risks\n\nVolatility in raw material prices (mainly coal and iron ore) significantly impacts the input costs in steelmaking and therefore, pro/fitability.\n\nDependence on global supply chains as well as geo-political events  requires  close  tracking  of  potential  risks.  China's continued ban on Australian coal, Indonesia's ban on coal exports in January 2022 and ongoing Russia-Ukraine con/flict have already resulted in a shift in global metallurgical coal trade /flows.\n\nSuch political events in combination with other events such as changing weather patterns, COVID/hyphen.cap19 related production issues, long wall moves or maintenance in various mines, increasing  financialization  of  commodities  markets  etc. have  led  to  demand-supply  gap  and  elevated  prices  of these commodities.\n\n## Mitigation strategies\n\nSteel prices have a signi/ficant correlation with raw material prices. Changing prices of coal and iron ore generally re/flect through adjustments in steel prices, which in e/ffect acts as a natural hedge against volatility. However, there may be a lead and lag factor involved and hence several steps are being taken to manage the price volatility. For iron ore buy from external market, we hedge the spread between the bought-out ore and con/firmed steel orders. For metallurgical coal, we use predictive analytics tool to have advance information on price direction and optimize the timing of our spot buys through Reverse auctions.\n\nCaptive/domestic raw materials provide another avenue to guard against volatility as they have relatively stable cost/ price. Risk assessment for key vendors is also undertaken to assess the capability of vendors in meeting the supply requirements. We proactively engage on assessing the risk of single geography/ proprietary sourcing and mitigations have been put in place to diversify sourcing (with focus on indigenisation) and/ or /finding alternate materials.\n\n## Supply Chain Risks\n\nTata Steel has one of the most complex integrated value chains extending from mining to customers (/finished steel products and downstream processing). The continuous growth\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nstrategy through inorganic and organic routes has added to the complexities and expanse of the Supply Chain. Our raw materials are sourced from diverse geographies while some requirements are also concentrated in speci/fic geographies, thus any weather disruptions or geopolitical instability puts a threat on the material availability. The political instability coupled with intermittent waves of pandemic is not only a threat to the raw material supplies but also has an adverse impact  on  ship  and  container  freights  and  availability. Further, 40% of the steel capacity is concentrated in Eastern India, whereas the consumption points are largely in North, South and Western part of India. Thus, the common logistics infrastructure resources such as ports and Indian Railways are constrained in terms of capacity and our dependency on these poses a risk to supply chain disruptions especially during circumstances such as power crisis which has now become a regular event. The statutory norms are getting more stringent and there is an emerging need to address Environmental and Social Governance issues to be able to sustain business in the long run.\n\n## Mitigation strategies\n\nAlthough the Tata Steel supply chain is complex, it provides opportunities for value maximisation through global optima, the  need  for  which  is  more  apparent  and  obvious  with operations getting multi-site and multi-locational. Thus, to bring an integrated approach and achieve global optima, 'One Supply Chain division' was formed. One Supply Chain works in synergy with various divisions with an overall focus on enhancement of supply chain performance for all sites. Digitalisation  and  Optimization  are  the  key  levers  being used to enhance visualisation and bring about integration. This  is  helping  Tata  Steel  to  take  proactive  decisions, keeping  system  view  in  mind  and  achieving  integrated margin management. Tata Steel continues to work towards diversification  in  sourcing  and  expansion  of  the  vendor base to manage the supply chain disruptions. In order to mitigate the impact of market volatilities on our cost, Supply Chain has adopted hedging as a strategy in Shipping and Bunkers  in  addition  to  the  long-term  contracts  already in place. In order to keep up with the production growth strategy, Tata Steel is developing its own port- Subarnarekha Port  Private  Limited  to  de-risk  the  import  supply  chain. To improve reliability of supplies Tata Steel has invested in private freight train schemes-GPWIS (General Purpose Wagon  Investment  Scheme)  and  SFTO  (Special  Freight Train Operator) and deployed its own rakes which is further being increased. Tata Steel is making all endeavors to keep itself ahead of statutory sustainability norms and moving towards a greener Supply Chain. Tata Steel is one of the few companies to measure end to end scope 3 emissions in all modes of transportation giving it an equal focus as scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. Tata Steel became the /first steel producing signatory and 24 th organization to join the Sea Cargo Charter to measure and reduce environmental impacts",

As a /first mover to deploy electric vehicles in freight segment, Tata Steel has tied up with an Indian start-up and deployed four electric trailers for last mile delivery. Tata Steel has onboarded its partners for steel processing in the journey of Responsible Supply Chain Policy for identifying gap and deploying action plan to ensure minimum standards in fair business practices, health and safety, human rights and environmental performance.\n\nThus,  Tata  Steel  is  adopting  a  three-pronged  strategy of  Service  Reliability,  Infrastructure  Resilience  and  Cost Optimisation for a future-ready Green Supply Chain.\n\n## Information Security Risks\n\nThe Company focuses on enhancing our digital footprint through  our  value  chain,  including  customers,  suppliers and  other  stakeholders  of  the  Company.  Transition  to remote working models and accelerated adoption of digital technologies has increased vulnerability to cyber-attacks.\n\nNon-compliance to IT legislations and regulations may lead to business disruption and imposition of penalties.\n\n## Mitigation strategies\n\nOver the years, the Company has made several investments for digital transformation. SAP and other Corporate systems which were On-Premise have been migrated to Cloud. We have a distributed Hybrid Multi Cloud Environment with SAP and other Corporate Applications on IBM cloud, Analytics applications on GCP (Google cloud), Data Visualization Platform on AWS and Collaborations Platform on Azure. The Edge Computing systems such as MES (Mill Execution Systems) are by design kept On-Premise.\n\nOur Network Topology is a multi-layered & ring-fenced network architecture. The Company is evaluating SDWAN (Software De/fined Wide Area Network) to build capacity and resilience in network.\n\nAdoption of next Generation SOC controls and technologies has resulted in proactive detection of unwarranted system breach and timely mitigation of the same, ensuring business continuity which is being planned for roll out in Tata Steel Group Companies. These controls are being continuously updated and reviewed to take care of new vulnerabilities such as Supply chain attacks and cyber threats arising out of current geopolitical situations (e.g., Russia-Ukraine con/flict). The Company has engaged with best-in-class service providers for SOC services with maker and  checker  concept  for  implementation  of  security safeguards & controls and subsequent identi/fication of security deployment gaps.\n\nEnd-Of-Life ( ' E O L' ) Systems are being replaced with new systems as part of refresh. Over the years, the Company is continuously building enough resiliency & capacity in Network. Significant efforts have been made to increase awareness amongst workforce with respect to cybersecurity. This ensured seamless migration of our work processes to remote working models across the Company locations during the pandemic. The Company has also implemented Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) for protecting from Phishing/Spam mails, Data Leak Prevention (DLP) over internet connections via cloud proxy and WFH (work from home) seamless and secure connectivity over zero-trust architecture.\n\nThe Company has enacted various policies and procedures to ensure data privacy. Proactive software asset management is being carried out to ensure compliance.\n\n## XII. Internal Financial Control Systems and Internal Audit\n\nThe  Company  has  an  Internal  Financial  Controls  ( 'IFC' ) framework, commensurate with the size, scale, and complexity of the Company's operations. The Board of Directors of the Company is responsible for ensuring that Internal Financial Controls (IFC) have been laid down by the Company and that such controls are adequate and operating e/ffectively. The internal control framework has been designed to provide reasonable assurance with respect to recording and providing reliable /financial and operational information, complying with applicable laws, safeguarding assets from unauthorized use, executing transactions with proper authorization and ensuring compliance with corporate policies.\n\nThe  Company's  internal  financial  control  framework  is commensurate with the size and operations of the business and is in line with requirements of the Companies Act, 2013. The Company has laid down Standard Operating Procedures and policies to guide the operations of each of its functions. Business heads are responsible to ensure compliance with these policies and procedures. Robust and continuous internal monitoring mechanisms ensure timely identi/fication of risks and issues. To make the controls more robust and comprehensive, IFC standardization & rationalization project was undertaken in FY 2020-21 which has ensured comprehensive coverage cutting across all functions of the company. In order to reduce manual time and e/fforts involved in control testing, improve con/fidence in testing results, increase the frequency of testing and resort to full checking of the data as compared to sample testing, automation of controls was also undertaken in FY 202122 whereby around 30% of the controls have been automated and will be tested in automated fashion going forward. The management, statutory auditors and internal auditors have also carried out adequate due diligence of the control environment of the Company through rigorous testing.",

We encourage investors to visit our website for reading the documents and for availing the above facilities at www.tatasteel.com\n\n## Legal proceedings in respect of title of shares\n\nThere are certain pending cases related to disputes over title to shares in which the Company has been made a party. However, these cases are not material in nature.\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nCommodities are essential inputs to the manufacturing of steel. These commodities have global supply chains and their prices get significantly impacted by various factors such as geo-political landscape, supply-demand imbalance, weather patterns, policy interventions by governments in key sourcing/consuming countries (especially China), increasing /financialization of commodities markets etc. This is an inherent market risk for the Company. However, steel prices follow the trend of commodity prices over a period and provide a natural hedge to the business.\n\nThe Company meets 100% of its iron ore requirements in India, through its captive iron ore mines and about one-sixth of its coking coal requirements from its coal mines. These captive mines provide a structural hedge to the price risk of these commodities.\n\nThe Company has a dedicated commodity sourcing team which engages with key raw material producers across the globe and the commodity market at large to optimize sourcing. The team proactively engages on assessing the risk of single geography and proprietary sourcing. Risk assessment for key vendors is undertaken to assess the capability of vendors in meeting the supply requirements. Mitigations have been put in place to diversify sourcing with focus on indigenization and/or identi/fication of alternate materials. The company manages the price risk through reverse auction and predictive analysis. The dynamic value-in-use (VIU) mapping with imported coal pricing is undertaken for advance planning and value maximization.\n\nFY  2021-2022  has  been  a  year  of  significant  volatility  in commodity prices particularly post the Russia-Ukraine war. The lockdown in China added to the complexity of sourcing the inputs in a timely and cost-e/fficient manner. The Company conducted  periodic  assessment  of  the  supply  chain  and undertook various measures to proactively identify and assess sourcing related risks. Risks were revisited considering multiple risk scenarios to arrive at focused mitigation plans.\n\nTo  address  the  short-term  price  volatility,  the  Company also hedges certain commodities in the derivatives market. Exposure of the Company to commodity and commodity risks faced by the Company throughout the year:\n\n- 1. Total exposure of the listed entity to commodities (including commodities based on materiality): /uni20B922,734 crore.\n- 2. Exposure to the listed entity to various commodities (based on materiality):\n\n|                | Exposure in                 | Exposure in quantity           | % of such exposure hedged through commodity derivatives   | % of such exposure hedged through commodity derivatives   | % of such exposure hedged through commodity derivatives   | % of such exposure hedged through commodity derivatives   | % of such exposure hedged through commodity derivatives   |\n|----------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Commodity Name | INR towards  the particular | terms towards the              | Domestic Market                                           | Domestic Market                                           | International Market                                      | International Market                                      | Total                                                     |\n|                | Commodity ( '  crore)       | particular commodity  (Tonnes) | OTC                                                       | Exchnage                                                  | OTC                                                       | Exchange                                                  | Total                                                     |\n| Coal           | 17,275                      | 1,24,30,000                    | Nil                                                       | Nil                                                       | Nil                                                       | Nil                                                       | Nil                                                       |",

As a sustainable solution to sinter return /fines generated at Blast Furnace stock house, the /finer fraction (<3.15 mm) of the return /fines are being utilized in the preparation of a new agglomerate\n\n'ASRF', through pressure briquetting technique followed by natural curing. The feasibility trial was conducted at E BF in July'2020 and based on its success a plant of capacity 300 tpd was installed and till date 20,000 tons of ASRF was consumed in C&E BFs. It has resulted in carbon rate reduction by 1.8 kg/thm for 1% of ASRF charged. In order to use this material on continuous basic, installation another machine of 250 tpd capacity is under progress. It is planned to increase the production overall capacity to 1000 tpd by FY 2023-24.\n\nEstablishment  of  revert  granules  for  sinter  making: Reverts  (by-products  containing  Fe,  Carbon  &  /flux  values) generated  inside  steel  works  are  recycled  through  sinter making.  The  reverts  are  /finer  in  size  (minus  1mm  is  67%) hence it has negative impact on sinter bed permeability and sinter productivity. Pilot scale campaigns of pre-granulation technique  with  a  drum  setup  is  established  to  produce granules (minus 1 mm <10%) from reverts. The pilot setup was installed, the usage of reverts granules in sintering shows productivity improvement by 0.8%.\n\n## Kalinganagar\n\nRaw Material Handling System and Logistics Operation:\n\n- \u00b7 Improvement in Reclaiming rate of stacker reclaimer by programming bench mode and LT mode reclaiming\n- \u00b7 Reliability of conveyor operation through installation of suspended magnet in tripper conveyor",

However, the accounting   treatment pursuant to the Scheme has been given e/ffect to from the date required under Ind AS 103 - Business Combinations, which is the beginning of the preceding period presented i.e. April 1, 2020. Accordingly, the /figures for the year ended March 31, 2021 have been restated to give e/ffect to the aforesaid merger. Our opinion is not modi/fied in respect of this matter.",

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signi/ficance in our audit of the standalone /financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone /financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Assessment of litigations and related disclosure of contingent liabilities\n\n[Refer to Note 2 (c) to the Standalone /financial statements'Use of estimates and critical accounting judgements Provisions and contingent liabilities', Note 36 (A) to the Standalone Financial Statements - 'Contingencies' and Note 37 to the Standalone /financial statements - 'Other signi/ficant litigations'].\n\nAs at March 31, 2022, the Company has exposures towards litigations relating to various matters as set out in the aforesaid Notes.\n\nSigni/ficant management judgement is required to assess such matters to determine the probability of occurrence of material out/flow of economic resources and whether a provision should be recognised or a disclosure should be made. The management judgement is also supported with legal advice in certain cases as considered appropriate.\n\nAs the ultimate outcome of the matters are uncertain and the positions taken by the management are based on the application of their best judgement, related legal advice including those relating to interpretation of laws/regulations, it is considered to be a Key Audit Matter.\n\nOur audit procedures included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 We understood, assessed and tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls surrounding assessment of litigations relating to the relevant laws and regulations;\n- \u00b7 We  inquired  with  the  management  for  recent developments and the status of the material litigations which were reviewed and noted by the Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 We performed our assessment on a test basis on the underlying  calculations  supporting  the  contingent liabilities/other signi/ficant litigations disclosed in the Standalone Financial Statements;\n- \u00b7 We  used  auditor's  experts/specialists  to  gain  an understanding and to evaluate the disputed tax matters;\n- \u00b7 We considered external legal opinions, where relevant, obtained by management;\n- \u00b7 We  evaluated  management's  assessments  by understanding  precedents  set  in  similar  cases  and assessed  the  reliability  of  the  management's  past estimates/judgements;\n- \u00b7 We evaluated management's assessment around those matters that are not disclosed or not considered as contingent liability, as the probability of material out/flow is considered to be remote by the management; and\n- \u00b7 We assessed the adequacy of the Company's disclosures.\n\nBased  on  the  above  work  performed,  the  assessment in respect of litigations and related disclosures relating to  contingent  liabilities/other  significant  litigations  in the  Standalone  Financial  Statements  is  considered  to be reasonable.",

In case of certain investments, cost is considered as an appropriate estimate of fair value since there is a wide range of possible fair value measurements and cost represents the best estimate of fair value within that range as permitted under Ind AS 109.\n\nThe accounting for investments is a Key Audit Matter as the  determination  of  recoverable  value  for  impairment assessment/fair valuation involves signi/ficant management judgement and estimates.\n\nThe impairment assessment and fair valuation for such investments have been carried out by the management in accordance with Ind AS 36 and Ind AS 113 respectively. The key inputs and judgements involved in the impairment/ fair valuation assessment of unquoted investments include:\n\n- \u00b7 Forecast cash /flows including assumptions on growth rates\n- \u00b7 Discount rates\n- \u00b7 Terminal growth rate\n\nEconomic  and  entity  specific  factors  incorporated  in the valuation.\n\nOur audit procedures included the following:\n\nWe obtained an understanding from the management, assessed and tested the design and operating e/ffectiveness of  the  Company's  key  controls  over  the  impairment assessment and fair valuation of material investments.\n\n- \u00b7 We  evaluated  the  Company's  process  regarding impairment assessment and fair valuation by involving auditor's valuation experts, where considered necessary, to assist in assessing the appropriateness of the valuation model including the independent assessment of the underlying assumptions relating to discount rate, terminal value etc.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the carrying value/fair value calculations of all individually material investments, where applicable, to determine whether the valuations performed by the Company were within an acceptable range determined by us and the auditor's valuation experts.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the cash /flow forecasts (with underlying economic  growth  rate)  by  comparing  them  to  the budgets and our understanding of the internal and external factors.\n- \u00b7 We  checked  the  mathematical  accuracy  of  the impairment  model  and  agreed  the  relevant  data with the latest budgets, actual past results and other supporting documents.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the sensitivity analysis and evaluated whether any reasonably foreseeable change in assumptions could lead to impairment or material change in fair valuation.\n- \u00b7 We discussed with the component auditors of certain entities to develop an understanding of the operating performance and outlook used in their own valuation model and to assess consistency with the assumptions used in the model.\n- \u00b7 We  had  inquired  with  management  to  obtain  an understanding of the relevant factors in respect of certain investments carried at fair value where a wide range of fair values were possible due to various factors such as absence of recent observable transactions, restrictions on transfer of shares, existence of multiple valuation techniques,  investee's  varied  nature  of  portfolio  of investments for which signi/ficant estimates/judgements are required to arrive at fair value.\n- \u00b7 We have discussed the key assumptions and sensitivities for certain investments with those charged with governance.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures made in the Standalone Financial Statements.\n\nBased on the above procedures performed, we did not identify any signi/ficant exceptions in the management's assessment in relation to the carrying value of investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures and fair value of other investments.",

The other information comprises the information included in the Integrated Report, Board's Report along with its Annexures and Financial Highlights included in the Company's Annual Report (titled as 'Tata Steel Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2021-22') but does not include the standalone /financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the standalone /financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the standalone /financial statements,  our  responsibility  is  to  read  the  other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the /financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the standalone /financial statements\n\n- 7. The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone /financial statements that give a true and fair view of the /financial position, /financial performance, changes in equity and cash /flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards speci/fied under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and  for  preventing  and  detecting  frauds  and  other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal /financial controls, that were operating e/ffectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n- 8. In  preparing  the  standalone  financial  statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern,  disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting  unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or\n\nto cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company's /financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the standalone /financial statements\n\n- 9. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone /financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone /financial statements.\n- 10. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal /financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements in place and the operating e/ffectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty  exists  related  to  events  or  conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the standalone /financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.",

We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to /financial statements of Tata Steel Limited ('the Company') as of March 31, 2022 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone /financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.\n\n## Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls\n\n- 2. The  Company's  management  is  responsible  for establishing and maintaining internal /financial controls based on the internal control over /financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting ('the Guidance Note') issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ('ICAI'). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal /financial controls that were operating e/ffectively for ensuring the orderly and e/fficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable /financial information, as required under the Act.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibility\n\n- 3. Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the Company's internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing deemed to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act to the extent applicable to an audit of internal /financial controls, both applicable to an audit of internal /financial controls and both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated e/ffectively in all material respects.\n- 4. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal /financial controls system with reference to /financial statements and their operating e/ffectiveness. Our audit of internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n- 5. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls system with reference to /financial statements.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to /financial statements\n\n- 6. A company's internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of /financial reporting and the preparation of /financial statements for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable detail, accurately and fairly re/flect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of /financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material e/ffect on the /financial statements.",

Because of the inherent limitations of internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal /financial controls with  reference  to  financial  statements  may  become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Opinion\n\n- 8.

Company information\n\nTata Steel Limited ('the Company') is a public limited Company incorporated in India with its registered o/ffice in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. The Company is listed on the BSE Limited (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE).\n\nThe Company has presence across the entire value chain of steel manufacturing from mining and processing iron ore and coal to producing and distributing /finished products. The Company offers a broad range of steel products including a portfolio of high value added downstream products such as hot rolled, cold rolled, coated steel, rebars, wire rods, tubes and wires.\n\nThe functional and presentation currency of the Company is Indian Rupee ('/uni20B9') which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.\n\nAs on March 31, 2022, Tata Sons Private Limited owns 32.46% of the Ordinary Shares of the Company, and has the ability to in/fluence the Company's operations.\n\nThe /financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022 were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on May 3, 2022.\n\n## 2. Signi/ficant accounting policies\n\nThe  significant  accounting  policies  applied  by  the Company in the preparation of its /financial statements are listed below. Such accounting policies have been applied consistently to all the periods presented in these /financial statements, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n## (a) Statement of compliance\n\nThe /financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (referred to as 'Ind AS') prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, as amended from time to time and other relevant provisions of the Act.\n\n## (b) Basis of preparation\n\nThe /financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of certain assets and liabilities that are required to be carried at fair value by Ind AS.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\n## (c) Use of estimates and critical accounting judgements\n\nIn the preparation of /financial statements, the Company makes  judgements  in  the  application  of  accounting policies; and estimates and assumptions which a/ffects carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may di/ffer from these estimates.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods a/ffected.\n\nKey source of estimation of uncertainty at the date of /financial statements, which may cause material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next /financial year, is in respect of impairment, useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, valuation of deferred tax assets, provisions and contingent liabilities, fair value measurements of /financial instruments and retirement bene/fit obligations as discussed below:\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe Company estimates the value in use of the cash generating unit (CGU) based on future cash /flows after considering current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results and growth rates and anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions. The estimated cash /flows are developed using internal forecasts. The cash /flows are discounted using a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. Further details of the Company's impairment review and key assumptions are set out in note 3, page 310, note 4, page 314, note 5, page 316 and note 6, page 318.\n\n## Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nThe Company reviews the useful life of property, plant and  equipment  and  intangible  assets  at  the  end  of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation and amortisation expense in future periods. The policy has been detailed in note 2(i), page 301.\n\n## Valuation of deferred tax assets\n\nThe Company reviews the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period. The policy has been detailed in note 2(v), page 307 and its further information are set out in note 10, page 331.",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\n## Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nA provision is recognised when the Company has a present obligation as result of a past event and it is probable that the out/flow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to re/flect the current best estimates. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the /financial statements. Further details are set out in note 21, page 351 and note 36A, page 367.\n\n## Fair value measurements of /financial instruments\n\nWhen the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities  recorded  in  the  balance  sheet  cannot  be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including  Discounted  Cash  Flow  Model.  The  inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of  judgement  is  required  in  establishing  fair  value. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risks, credit risks and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could a/ffect the reported fair value of /financial instruments. Further details are set out in note 39, page 374.\n\n## Retirement bene/fit obligations\n\nThe Company's retirement bene/fit obligations are subject to number of assumptions including discount rates, in/flation and salary growth. Signi/ficant assumptions are required when setting these criteria and a change in these assumptions would have a signi/ficant impact on the amount recorded in the Company's balance sheet and the statement of pro/fit and loss. The Company sets these assumptions based on previous experience and third party actuarial advice. Further details on the Company's retirement bene/fit obligations, including key assumptions are set out in note 35, page 360.\n\n## Estimation of uncertainties relating to COVID-19\n\nThe  Company  has  assessed  the  possible  impact  of COVID-19 on its /financial statements based on the internal and external information and concluded no adjustments are required in these standalone /financial statements. The Company continues to monitor changes in future economic conditions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (d) Property, plant and equipment\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an asset if it is probable that future economic bene/fits associated with the item will /flow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. This recognition principle is applied to costs incurred initially to acquire an item of property, plant and equipment and also to costs incurred subsequently to add to, replace part of, or service it. All other repair and maintenance costs, including regular servicing, are recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss as incurred. When a replacement occurs, the carrying value  of  the  replaced  part  is  de-recognised.  Where an item of property, plant and equipment comprises major components having di/fferent useful lives, these components are accounted for as separate items.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost applied on transition to Ind AS, less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost includes all direct costs and expenditures incurred to bring the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use. Trial run expenses are capitalised. Borrowing costs incurred during the period of construction is capitalised as part of cost of qualifying asset.\n\nThe gain or loss arising on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the di/fference between sale proceeds and carrying value of such item, and is recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## (e) Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources\n\nExpenditures associated with search for speci/fic mineral resources are recognised as exploration and evaluation assets. The following expenditure comprises cost of exploration and evaluation assets:\n\n- \u00b7 obtaining of the rights to explore and evaluate mineral reserves and resources including costs directly related to this acquisition\n- \u00b7 researching and analysing existing exploration data\n- \u00b7 conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling\n- \u00b7 examining and testing extraction and treatment methods\n- \u00b7 compiling pre-feasibility and feasibility studies\n- \u00b7 activities  in  relation  to  evaluating  the  technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\nAdministration and other overhead costs are charged to the cost of exploration and evaluation assets only if directly related to an exploration and evaluation project.\n\nIf  a  project  does  not  prove  viable,  all  irrecoverable exploration and evaluation expenditure associated with the project net of any related impairment allowances is written o/ff to the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nThe Company measures its exploration and evaluation assets  at  cost  and  classifies  as  property,  plant  and equipment or intangible assets according to the nature of the assets acquired and applies the classification consistently.  To  the  extent  that  a  tangible  asset  is consumed in developing an intangible asset, the amount re/flecting that consumption is capitalised as a part of the cost of the intangible asset.\n\nAs the asset is not available for use, it is not depreciated. All exploration and evaluation assets are monitored for indications of impairment. An exploration and evaluation asset is no longer classi/fied as such when the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable and the development of the  deposit  is  sanctioned  by  the  management.  The carrying value of such exploration and evaluation asset is reclassi/fied to mining assets.\n\n## (f) Development expenditure for mineral reserves\n\nDevelopment is the establishment of access to mineral reserves  and  other  preparations  for  commercial production. Development activities often continue during production and include:\n\n- \u00b7 sinking shafts and underground drifts (often called mine development)\n- \u00b7 making permanent excavations\n- \u00b7 developing passageways and rooms or galleries\n- \u00b7 building roads and tunnels and\n- \u00b7 advance removal of overburden and waste rock\n\nDevelopment  (or  construction)  also  includes  the installation of infrastructure (e.g. roads, utilities and housing), machinery, equipment and facilities.\n\nDevelopment expenditure is capitalised and presented as part of mining assets. No depreciation is charged on the development expenditure before the start of commercial production.\n\n## (g) Provision for restoration and environmental costs\n\nThe Company has liabilities related to restoration of soil and other related works, which are due upon the closure of certain of its mining sites.\n\nSuch liabilities are estimated case-by-case based on available information, taking into account applicable local legal requirements. The estimation is made using existing technology, at current prices, and discounted using an appropriate discount rate where the e/ffect of time value of money is material. Future restoration and environmental costs, discounted to net present value, are capitalised and the corresponding restoration liability is raised as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. Future restoration and environmental costs are capitalised in property, plant and equipment or mining assets as appropriate and are depreciated over the life of the related asset. The e/ffect of time value of money on the restoration and environmental costs liability is recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## (h) Intangible assets\n\nPatents, trademarks and software costs are included in the balance sheet as intangible assets when it is probable that associated future economic bene/fits would /flow to the Company. In this case they are measured initially at purchase cost and then amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. All other costs on patents, trademarks and software are expensed in the statement of pro/fit and loss as and when incurred.\n\nExpenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Costs incurred on individual development projects are recognised as intangible assets from the date when all of the following conditions are met:\n\n- (i) completion of the development is technically feasible.\n- (ii) it is the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it.\n- (iii) ability to use or sell the intangible asset.\n- (iv)   it is clear that the intangible asset will generate probable future economic bene/fits.\n- (v) adequate technical, /financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset are available.\n- (vi) it is possible to reliably measure the expenditure attributable  to  the  intangible  asset  during its development.",

Hence the useful lives for these assets are di/fferent from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n## (j) Impairment\n\nAt each balance sheet date, the Company reviews the carrying value of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable through continuing use. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is reviewed in order to determine the extent of impairment loss, if any. Where the asset does not generate cash /flows that are independent from other assets, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.\n\nRecoverable  amount  is  the  higher  of  fair  value  less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash /flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re/flects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci/fic to the asset for which the estimates of future cash /flows have not been adjusted. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss as and when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.\n\nWhere an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying value of the asset (or cash generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount so that the increased carrying value does not exceed the carrying value that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss immediately.\n\n## (k) Leases\n\nThe  Company  determines  whether  an  arrangement contains a lease by assessing whether the ful/filment of a transaction is dependent on the use of a speci/fic asset and whether the transaction conveys the right to control the use of that asset to the Company in return for payment.",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\n## The Company as lessee\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  each  lease  component within the contract as a lease separately from nonlease components of the contract and allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative stand-alone price of the lease component and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease components. The Company recognises rightof-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease commencement date. The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception comprises of the amount of initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date.\n\nCertain lease arrangements include options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. The right-of-use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that such options would be exercised.\n\nThe right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment  losses,  if  any  and  adjusted  for  any  remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset.\n\nRight-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nLease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the  Company  uses  incremental  borrowing  rate.  The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to re/flect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to re/flect any reassessment or lease modi/fications. The Company recognises the amount of the re-measurement of lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Company\n\nrecognises any remaining amount of the re-measurement in statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nVariable lease payments not included in the measurement of the lease liabilities are expensed to the statement of pro/fit and loss in the period in which the events or conditions which trigger those payments occur.\n\nIn  a  sale  and  lease  back  transaction,  the  Company measures right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback as the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the right-of-use retained. The gain or loss that the company recognises in the statement of pro/fit and loss is limited to the proportion of the total gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer.\n\n## The Company as lessor\n\n- (i) Operating lease Rental income from operating leases is recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss on a straight- line basis over the term of the relevant lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic bene/fits from the leased asset is diminished. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying value of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n- (ii) Finance lease When assets are leased out under a  finance  lease,  the  present  value  of  minimum lease payments is recognised as a receivable. The di/fference between the gross receivable and the present value of receivable is recognised as unearned /finance income. Lease income is recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method before tax, which re/flects a constant periodic rate of return.\n\n## (l) Stripping costs\n\nThe Company separates two di/fferent types of stripping costs that are incurred in surface mining activity:\n\n- \u00b7 developmental stripping costs and\n- \u00b7 production stripping costs\n\nDevelopmental stripping costs which are incurred in order to obtain access to quantities of mineral reserves that will be mined in future periods are capitalised as part of mining assets. Capitalisation of developmental stripping costs ends when the commercial production of the mineral reserves begins.",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\nA mine can operate several open pits that are regarded as separate operations for the purpose of mine planning and production. In this case, stripping costs are accounted for separately, by reference to the ore extracted from each separate pit. If, however, the pits are highly integrated for the purpose of mine planning and production, stripping costs are aggregated too.\n\nThe determination of whether multiple pit mines are considered separate or integrated operations depends on each mine's specific circumstances. The following factors normally point towards the stripping costs for the individual pits being accounted for separately:\n\n- \u00b7 mining of the second and subsequent pits is conducted consecutively  with  that  of  the  first  pit,  rather than concurrently\n- \u00b7 separate investment decisions are made to develop each pit, rather than a single investment decision being made at the outset\n- \u00b7 the pits are operated as separate units in terms of mine planning and the sequencing of overburden and ore mining, rather than as an integrated unit\n- \u00b7 expenditures for additional infrastructure to support the second and subsequent pits are relatively large\n- \u00b7 the pits extract ore from separate and distinct ore bodies, rather than from a single ore body.\n\nThe relative importance of each factor is considered by the management to determine whether, the stripping costs should be attributed to the individual pit or to the combined output from the several pits.\n\nProduction stripping costs are incurred to extract the ore in the form of inventories and/or to improve access to an additional component of an ore body or deeper levels of material. Production stripping costs are accounted for as inventories to the extent the bene/fit from production stripping activity is realised in the form of inventories.\n\nThe Company recognises a stripping activity asset in the production phase if, and only if, all of the following are met:\n\n- \u00b7 it  is  probable  that  the  future  economic  benefit (improved access to the ore body) associated with the stripping activity will /flow to the Company\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 the Company can identify the component of the ore body for which access has been improved and\n- \u00b7 the  costs  relating  to  the  improved  access  to  that component can be measured reliably.\n\nSuch costs are presented within mining assets. After initial recognition, stripping activity assets are carried at cost/deemed cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. The expected useful life of the identi/fied component of the ore body is used to depreciate or amortise the stripping asset.\n\n## (m)   Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are carried at cost/deemed cost applied on transition to Ind AS, less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of investment is assessed and an impairment provision is recognised, if required immediately to its recoverable amount. On disposal of such investments, difference between the net disposal proceeds and carrying amount is recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## (n) Financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and /financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions  of  the  instrument.  Financial  assets  and liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of /financial assets and /financial liabilities (other than /financial assets and /financial liabilities at fair value through pro/fit and loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on initial recognition of /financial asset or /financial liability. The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and /financial liabilities at fair value through pro/fit and loss are immediately recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## E/ffective interest method\n\nThe e/ffective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial instrument and of allocating interest income or expense over the relevant period. The e/ffective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the /financial instrument, or where appropriate, a shorter period.",

Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nTrade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method where the time value of money is signi/ficant.\n\nInterest bearing bank loans, overdrafts and issued debt are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest rate method. Any di/fference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## De-recognition of /financial liabilities\n\nThe  Company  de-recognises  financial  liabilities when, and only when, the Company's obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.\n\n## Derivative /financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company uses  certain  derivative  financial  instruments  to reduce business risks which arise from its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate /fluctuations. The instruments are con/fined principally to forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency swaps, interest rate swaps and collars. The instruments are\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nemployed as hedges of transactions included in the /financial statements or for highly probable forecast transactions//firm contractual commitments. These derivatives contracts do not generally extend beyond six months, except for certain currency swaps and interest rate derivatives.\n\nDerivatives are initially accounted for and measured at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period.\n\nThe Company adopts hedge accounting for forward foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate  contracts wherever possible. At inception of each hedge, there is a formal, documented designation of the hedging relationship. This documentation includes, inter alia , items such as identi/fication of the hedged item and transaction and nature of the risk being hedged. At inception, each hedge is expected to be highly e/ffective in achieving an o/ffset of changes in fair value or cash /flows attributable to the hedged risk. The e/ffectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated with the exposure being hedged is assessed and measured at the inception and on an ongoing basis. The ine/ffective portion of designated hedges is recognised immediately in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## When hedge accounting is applied:\n\n- \u00b7 for fair value hedges of recognised assets and liabilities, changes in fair value of the hedged assets and liabilities attributable to the risk being hedged,  are  recognised  in  the  statement  of pro/fit and loss and compensate for the e/ffective portion of symmetrical changes in the fair value of the derivatives.\n- \u00b7 for cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ine/ffective portion is recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss. If the cash /flow hedge of a /firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of a non/financial asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.

At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.

The service cost and net interest on the net defined benefit liability/(asset) are recognised as an expense within employee costs.\n\nPast service cost is recognised as an expense when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs or when any related restructuring costs or termination bene/fits are recognised, whichever is earlier.\n\nThe retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance  sheet  represents  the  present  value  of  the de/fined bene/fit obligations as reduced by the fair value of plan assets.\n\n## Compensated absences\n\nCompensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related service are recognised based on actuarial valuation at the present value of the obligation as on the reporting date.\n\n## (p) Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is ascertained on a weighted average basis. Costs comprise direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value is the price at which the inventories can be realised in the normal course of business after allowing for the cost of conversion from their existing state to a /finished condition and for the cost of marketing, selling and distribution.\n\nProvisions are made to cover slow-moving and obsolete items based on historical experience of utilisation on a  product  category  basis,  which  involves  individual businesses  considering  their  product  lines  and market conditions.\n\n## (q) Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised in the balance sheet when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, which is expected to result in an out/flow of resources embodying economic bene/fits which can be reliably estimated. Each provision is based on the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. Where the time value of money is material, provisions are measured on a discounted basis.\n\nConstructive obligation is an obligation that derives from an entity's actions where:\n\n- (i) by an established pattern of past practice, published policies or a su/fficiently speci/fic current statement, the entity has indicated to other parties that it will accept certain responsibilities and;\n- (ii) as a result, the entity has created a valid expectation on the part of those other parties that it will discharge such responsibilities.",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\n## (r) Onerous contracts\n\nA provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected bene/fits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.\n\n## (s) Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised at its fair value, where there is a reasonable assurance that such grants will be received and compliance with the conditions attached therewith have been met.\n\nGovernment grants related to expenditure on property, plant and equipment are credited to the statement of pro/fit and loss over the useful lives of qualifying assets or other systematic basis representative of the pattern of ful/filment of obligations associated with the grant received. Grants received less amounts credited to the statement of pro/fit and loss at the reporting date are included in the balance sheet as deferred income.\n\n## (t) Business combination under common control\n\nBusiness combinations involving entities or businesses under common control are accounted for using the pooling of interest method. Under pooling of interest method, the assets and liabilities of the combining entities or businesses are re/flected at their carrying amounts after  making  adjustments  necessary  to  harmonise the accounting policies. The financial information in the /financial statements in respect of prior periods is restated as if the business combination had occurred from  the  beginning  of  the  preceding  period  in  the /financial statements, irrespective of the actual date of the combination. The identity of the reserves is preserved in the same form in which they appeared in the /financial statements of the transferor and the di/fference, if any, between the amount recorded as share capital issued plus any additional consideration in the form of cash or other assets and the amount of share capital of the transferor is transferred to capital reserve.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (u) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups classi/fied as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.\n\nAssets and disposal groups are classi/fied as held for sale if their carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is only met when the sale is highly probable and the asset, or disposal group, is available for immediate sale in its present condition and is marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. The Company must also be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classi/fication.\n\nWhere a disposal group represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, or is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, then it is treated as a discontinued operation. The post-tax pro/fit or loss of the discontinued operation together with the gain or loss recognised on its disposal are disclosed as a single amount in the statement of pro/fit and loss, with all prior periods being presented on this basis.\n\n## (v) Income Taxes\n\nTax expense for the year comprises of current and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on taxable pro/fit for the year. Taxable pro/fit di/ffers from net pro/fit as reported in the statement of pro/fit and loss because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\nDeferred  tax  is  the  tax  expected  to  be  payable  or recoverable on di/fferences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the /financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable pro/fit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised  for  all  taxable  temporary  differences.  In contrast, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro/fits will be available against which the temporary di/fferences can be utilised.",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\nThe carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that su/fficient taxable pro/fits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets re/flects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying value of its assets and liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are o/ffset to the extent that they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority and there are legally enforceable rights to set o/ff current tax assets and current tax liabilities within that jurisdiction.\n\nCurrent and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in the statement of pro/fit and loss, except when they relate to items credited or debited either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\n## (w)  Revenue\n\nThe Company manufactures and sells a range of steel and other products.\n\n## Sale of products\n\nRevenue  from  sale  of  products  is  recognised  when control of the products has transferred, being when the products are delivered to the customer. Delivery occurs when the products have been shipped or delivered to the speci/fic location as the case may be, the risks of loss has been transferred, and either the customer has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, or the Company has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satis/fied. Sale of products include related ancillary services, if any.\n\nGoods are often sold with volume discounts based on aggregate sales over a 12 months period. Revenue from these sales is recognised based on the price speci/fied in the contract, net of the estimated volume discounts. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts, using the most likely method, and\n\nrevenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. A liability is recognised for expected volume discounts payable to customers in relation to sales made until the end of the reporting period. No element of /financing is deemed present as the sales are generally made with a credit term of 30-90 days, which is consistent with market practice. Any obligation to provide a refund is recognised as a provision. A receivable is recognised when the goods are delivered as this is the point in time that the consideration is unconditional because only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.\n\n## Sale of power\n\nRevenue from sale of power is recognised when the services are provided to the customer based on approved tariff  rates  established  by  the  respective  regulatory authorities. The Company doesn't recognise revenue and an asset for cost incurred in the past that will be recovered.\n\n## (x) Foreign currency transactions and translations\n\nThe /financial statements of the Company are presented in Indian Rupees ('/uni20B9'), which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the /financial statements.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, transactions in currencies other than the Company's functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated.\n\nExchange  differences  arising  on  the  re-translation or settlement of monetary items are included in the statement of pro/fit and loss for the period.\n\n## (y) Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowings costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for the intended use or sale.",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\nInvestment income earned on temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n- Discounts or premiums and expenses on the issue of debt securities are amortised over the term of the related securities and included within borrowing costs. Premiums payable on early redemptions of debt securities, in lieu of future /finance costs, are recognised as borrowing costs.\n\nAll other borrowing costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which it is incurred.\n\n## (z) Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing pro/fit or loss for the year attributable to equity holders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Partly paid-up shares are included as fully paid equivalents according to the fraction paid-up.\n\nDiluted  earnings  per  share  is  computed  using  the weighted average number of shares and dilutive potential shares except where the result would be anti-dilutive.\n\n## (aa)  Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n## Amendment to Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments' and Ind AS 107 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' - Interest rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2\n\nThe  amendment  focuses  on  the  potential  financial reporting  issues  that  may  arise  when  interest  rate benchmarking reforms are either reformed or replaced. The key reliefs provided by the Phase 2 amendments are:\n\n- \u00b7 Changes to contractual cash /flows - When changing the basis for determining contractual cash /flows for /financial assets and liabilities (including lease liabilities), the reliefs have the e/ffect that the changes that are required by an interest rate benchmark reform will not result in an immediate gain or loss in the pro/fit and loss statement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Hedge accounting - The hedge accounting reliefs will allow most Ind AS 39 or Ind AS 109 hedge relationships that are directly a/ffected by IBOR reform to continue. However, additional ineffectiveness might need to be recorded.\n\nThe amendments do not have signi/ficant impact on the financial statements. The disclosures as required are presented in note 39, page 374.\n\n## Amendment to Ind AS 103 'Business Combination' - Reference to Conceptual Framework\n\nThe amendments specify that to qualify for recognition as part of applying the acquisition method, the identi/fiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed must meet the definitions of assets and liabilities in the Conceptual Framework  for  Financial  Reporting  under  Indian Accounting Standards (Conceptual Framework) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India at the acquisition date. These changes do not signi/ficantly change the requirements of Ind AS 103 - Business Combinations. The Company does not expect the amendment to have any signi/ficant impact in its /financial statements.\n\n## Amendment to Ind AS 16 'Property, Plant and Equipment' - Proceeds before intended use\n\nThe amendment clari/fies that excess of net sale proceeds of items produced over the cost of testing, if any, shall not be recognized in the pro/fit or loss but deducted from the directly attributable costs considered as part of cost of an item of property, plant, and equipment. The Company does not expect the amendments to have any impact in its recognition of its property, plant and equipment in its /financial statements.",

Post-acquisition, the Company's net debt at a consolidated level had increased considerably.\n\nGiven the Company's strategic priority to deleverage balance sheet consequent to increase in net debt levels ahead of incurring further planned investments in organic growth projects, capital expenditure during last few years have been lower than the original phasing of spend approved by the Board of Directors of the Company. This was further exacerbated by the onset of the COVID19 pandemic towards the close of /financial year 2020, wherein business & supply chain disruptions, health and safety concerns across the globe coupled with travel restrictions globally impacted the pace of project execution over the last 2 years.\n\nFollowing the rebalancing of capital structure post signi/ficant reduction in the debt levels and the Company attaining an investment grade credit rating, the capital allocation for organic growth projects has been increased and the Company expects to commission these facilities in line with their revised completion schedules.",

Majority of the extension and termination options held are exercisable based on mutual agreement of the Company and the lessors.\n\nWith the exception of short-term leases and leases of low-value underlying assets, each lease is re/flected on the balance sheet as a right of- use asset and a lease liability. Payments made for short-term leases and leases of low value are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nVariable lease payments which do not depend on an index or a rate are excluded from the initial measurement of the lease liability and asset.\n\nFor leases recognised under long-term arrangements involving use of a dedicated asset, non-lease components are excluded based on the underlying contractual terms and conditions. A change in the allocation assumptions may have an impact on the measurement of lease liabilities and the related right-of-use assets.\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2022, the Company has recognised the following in the statement of pro/fit and loss:\n\n- a) expense in respect of short-term leases and leases of low-value assets /uni20B9 4.18 crore (2020-21: /uni20B98.20 crore) and Nil (2020-21: /uni20B90.34 crore) respectively.\n- b) expense in respect of variable lease payments not included in the measurement of lease liabilities /uni20B9 6.89 crore (2020-21: /uni20B960.96 crore).\n- c) income in respect of sub-leases of right-of-use assets /uni20B9 0.35 crore (2020-21: /uni20B90.53 crore).\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2022, total cash out/flow in respect of leases amounted to /uni20B9 1,008.91 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B91,123.77 crore).\n\nAs at March 31, 2022, commitments for leases not yet commenced was Nil (March 31, 2021: /uni20B9230.94 crore).\n\n- (iii) Lease deeds of all right-of-use assets are held in the name of the Company, except for the following:\n\n| Description of property                  | Gross carrying  value ( '  crore)   | Held in the  name of                                     | Whether promoter,  director or their  relative or employee   | Period held (i.e. dates of  capitalisation provided  in range) #   | Reason for not being held in the  name of the Company                                |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Right-of-use Land                        | 523.65 - ^                          | Erstwhile Tata Steel  BSL Limited (TSBSL)                | No                                                           | April, 2020                                                        | through amalgamation/merger,  the name change in the name of  the Company is pending |\n| Right-of-use Land                        | 179.40                              | Bhushan Steel  Limited                                   | No                                                           | April, 2020                                                        | through amalgamation/merger,  the name change in the name of  the Company is pending |\n| Right-of-use Land                        | 179.40 139.93                       |                                                          | No                                                           | April, 2020                                                        | through amalgamation/merger,  the name change in the name of  the Company is pending |\n| Right-of-use Land                        | 139.93                              | Bhushan Steel &  Strips Limited                          |                                                              | April, 2020                                                        | through amalgamation/merger,  the name change in the name of  the Company is pending |\n| Right-of-use Land                        | 3.28 3.28                           | Jawahar Metal  Industries Private  Limited               | No                                                           | April, 2020                                                        | through amalgamation/merger,  the name change in the name of  the Company is pending |\n| Right-of-use Buildings Right-of-use Land | 11.73 - ^ 0.15 0.15                 | Erstwhile Tata Steel  BSL Limited (TSBSL) Not Applicable | No No                                                        | April, 2020 to  October, 2021 Not Available                        | Lease Deed not available with  the Company                                           |\n\n# In case of immovable properties acquired from Tata Steel BSL Limited which got merged with the Company pursuant to National Company Law Tribunal Order dated October 29, 2021, dates have been considered with e/ffect from the merger set out in Note 44, page 385 to the /financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures (Contd.)\n\n[Item No. I(f), Page 292]\n\n- (v) During the year ended March 31, 2022, the Company considered indicators of impairment such as operational losses in previous years, changes in outlook of future pro/fitability among other potential indicators for investments held in steel, mining and other business operations either directly or indirectly.\n\nThe recoverable value of investments held in T Steel Holdings Pte. Ltd. (TSH), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company is dependent on the operational and /financial performance of Tata Steel Europe (TSE) and net assets of the other underlying businesses. The recoverable amount of TSE is higher of the value in use (VIU) of the underlying businesses or the fair value less cost to sell of those businesses which inter-alia considers impact of switching the heavy end and other relevant assets to a more 'green steel' capex base. The VIU computation uses cash /flow forecasts based on most recently approved /financial budgets and strategic forecasts which cover a period of three years and future projections taking the analysis out into perpetuity based on a steady state, sustainable cash /flow re/flecting average steel industry conditions between successive peaks and troughs of pro/fitability. Key assumptions for the value in use computations are those regarding the discount rates, exchange rates, market demand, sales volume and sales prices, cost to produce etc. The projections are based on both past performance and the expectations of future performance and assumptions therein. The Company estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that re/flect the current market rates adjusted to re/flect the way the European union steel market would assess the speci/fic risk. The weighted average pre-tax discount rates used for discounting the cash /flows projections is in range of 8.40 % -9.30 % (March 31, 2021: 8.10% to 8.70%). Beyond the speci/fically forecasted period, a growth rate of 1.80 % (March 31, 2021: 1.25%) is used to extrapolate the cash /flow projections. This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.\n\nTSE is exposed to climate risks through the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) which is applicable to all steel plant within Europe. Further, the Netherlands' government has enacted legislation for a local additional carbon tax (linked to the EU ETS scheme CO 2 allowances and traded prices). Given that most European steel producers have not been heavily a/ffected by CO 2 compliance costs to date, TSE's estimate is that such CO 2 emission costs, Netherland's EU ETS costs and speci/fic carbon tax costs will majorly be passed on to end customers from FY 2025. Further, given the aim to be carbon neutral by 2050, TSE is considering its future strategy on operating processes while continuing to serve its customers. The technology transition and investments will be dependent on national and international policy which is evolving.\n\nThe outcome of the assessment as on March 31, 2022 did not result in recognition of any impairment for investments held in T Steel Holdings Pte. Ltd. The Company has also conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment tests including sensitivity in respect of discount rate. The management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions used in the assessment would cause the carrying value of such investment to exceed its recoverable amount.",

Employee bene/fits\n\n## A. De/fined contribution plans\n\nThe Company participates in a number of de/fined contribution plans on behalf of relevant personnel. Any expense recognised in relation to these schemes represents the value of contributions payable during the period by the Company at rates speci/fied by the rules of those plans. The only amounts included in the balance sheet are those relating to the prior months contributions that were not due to be paid until after the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe major de/fined contribution plans operated by the Company are as below:\n\n## (a) Provident fund and pension\n\nThe Company provides provident fund bene/fits for eligible employees as per applicable regulations wherein both employees and the Company make monthly contributions at a speci/fied percentage of the eligible employee's salary. Contributions under such schemes are made either to a provident fund set up as an irrevocable trust by the Company to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees or to state managed funds.\n\nBene/fits provided under plans wherein contributions are made to state managed funds and the Company does not have a future obligation to make good short fall if any, are treated as a de/fined contribution plan.\n\n## (b) Superannuation  fund\n\nThe Company has a superannuation plan for the bene/fit of its employees. Employees who are members of the superannuation plan are entitled to bene/fits depending on the years of service and salary drawn.\n\nSeparate irrevocable trusts are maintained for employees covered and entitled to bene/fits. The Company contributes up to 15% of the eligible employees' salary or /uni20B91,50,000, whichever is lower, to the trust every year. Such contributions are recognised as an expense as and when incurred. The Company does not have any further obligation beyond this contribution.\n\nThe contributions recognised as an expense in the statement of pro/fit and loss during the year on account of the above de/fined contribution plans amounted to /uni20B9 169.61 crore (2020-21: /uni20B9179.97 crore).",

De/fined bene/fit plans\n\nThe de/fined bene/fit plans operated by the Company are as below:\n\n## (a) Provident fund and pension\n\nProvident fund bene/fits provided under plans wherein contributions are made to an irrevocable trust set up by the Company to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees are treated as a de/fined bene/fit plan as the Company is obligated to provide the members a rate of return which should, at the minimum, meet the interest rate declared by Government administered provident fund. A part of the Company's contribution is transferred to Government administered pension fund. The contributions made by the Company and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as an expense in pro/fit and loss under employee bene/fits expense.\n\nIn accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund liabilities based on guidance issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, there is no de/ficiency in the interest cost as the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected amount to be credited to the individual members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered provident fund.\n\nKey assumptions used for actuarial valuation are as below:\n\n(%)\n\n|                                       |   Year ended   March 31, 2022 |   Year ended   March 31, 2021 |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Discount rate                         |                           7   |                           6.5 |\n| Guaranteed rate of return             |                           8.1 |                           8.5 |\n| Expected rate of return on investment |                           8   |                           8   |\n\n## (b) Retiring gratuity\n\nThe Company has an obligation towards gratuity, a de/fined bene/fit retirement plan covering eligible employees. The plan provides for a lump- sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death while in employment or on termination of employment of an amount equivalent to 15 to 30 days salary payable for each completed year of service. Vesting occurs upon completion of /five years of service. The Company makes annual contributions to gratuity funds established as trusts or insurance companies. The Company accounts for the liability for gratuity bene/fits payable in the future based on a yearend actuarial valuation.\n\n## (c) Post-retirement medical bene/fits\n\nUnder this unfunded scheme, employees of the Company receive medical bene/fits subject to certain limits on amounts of bene/fits, periods after retirement and types of bene/fits, depending on their grade and location at the time of retirement. Employees separated from the Company under an early separation scheme, on medical grounds or due to permanent disablement are also covered under the scheme. The Company accounts for the liability for post-retirement medical scheme based on a year-end actuarial valuation.\n\n## (d) Other de/fined bene/fits\n\nOther bene/fits provided under unfunded schemes include post-retirement lumpsum bene/fits, pension payable to directors of the Company on their retirement, farewell gifts and reimbursement of packing and transportation charges to the employees based on their last drawn salary.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## NOTES\n\nforming part of the /financial statements\n\n## 35.  Employee bene/fits (Contd.)\n\nThe de/fined bene/fit plans expose the Company to a number of actuarial risks as below:\n\n- (i) Investment  risk: The present value of the de/fined bene/fit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to government bond yields. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will create a plan de/ficit.\n- (ii) Interest  risk: A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability. However, this will be partially o/ffset by an increase in the value of plan's debt investments.\n- (iii) Salary risk: The present value of the de/fined bene/fit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants.\n- As such, an increase in salary of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.\n- (iv) Longevity risk: The present value of the de/fined bene/fit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.\n\n## C.

Contingencies\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company faces claims and assertions by various parties. The Company assesses such claims and assertions and monitors the legal environment on an on-going basis, with the assistance of external legal counsel, wherever necessary. The Company records a liability for any claims where a potential loss is probable and capable of being estimated and discloses such matters in its /financial statements, if material. For potential losses that are considered possible, but not probable, the Company provides disclosure in the /financial statements but does not record a liability in its accounts unless the loss becomes probable.\n\nThe following is a description of claims and assertions where a potential loss is possible, but not probable. The Company believes that none of the contingencies described below would have a material adverse e/ffect on the Company's /financial condition, results of operations or cash /flows.\n\nIt is not practicable for the Company to estimate the timings of the cash out/flows, if any, pending resolution of the respective proceedings. The Company does not expect any reimbursements in respect of the same.\n\n## Litigations\n\nThe Company is involved in legal proceedings, both as plainti/ff and as defendant. There are claims which the Company does not believe to be of a material nature, other than those described below:\n\n## Income tax\n\nThe Company has ongoing disputes with income tax authorities relating to tax treatment of certain items. These mainly include disallowance of expenses, tax treatment of certain expenses claimed by the Company as deduction and the computation of, or eligibility of the Company's use of certain tax incentives or allowances.\n\nMost  of  these  disputes  and/or  disallowances,  being repetitive in nature, have been raised by the income tax authorities consistently in most of the years.\n\nAs at March 31, 2022, there are matters and/or disputes pending in appeal amounting to /uni20B9 3,544.68 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B92,360.77 crore).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe details of signi/ficant demands are as below:\n\n- (a) Interest expenditure on loans taken by the Company for acquisition of a subsidiary has been disallowed in assessments with tax demand raised for /uni20B9 1,641.64 crore (inclusive of interest) (March 31, 2021: /uni20B91,551.10 crore).\n- (b) Interest expenditure on 'Hybrid Perpetual Securities' has been disallowed in assessments with tax demand raised for /uni20B9 484.78 crore (inclusive of interest) (March 31, 2021: /uni20B9170.54 crore)\n\nIn respect of above demands, the Company has deposited an amount of /uni20B9 1,255.63 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B91,250.54 crore) as a precondition for obtaining stay. The Company expects to sustain its position on ultimate resolution of the said appeals.\n\n## Customs, excise duty, service tax and GST\n\nAs at March 31, 2022, there were pending litigations for various matters relating to customs, excise duty, service tax and GST involving demands of /uni20B9 310.63 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B9304.48 crore).\n\n## Sales tax/VAT\n\nThe total sales tax demands that are being contested by the Company amounted to /uni20B9 776.08 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B9823.37 crore).\n\nThe details of signi/ficant demands are as below:\n\n- (a) The Company stock transfers its goods manufactured at Jamshedpur works plant to its various depots/ branches located outside the state of Jharkhand across the country and these goods are then sold to various customers outside the states from depots/ branches. As per the erstwhile Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, these transfers of goods to depots/branches were made without payment of Central sales tax and F-Form was submitted in lieu of the stock-transfers made during the period of assessment. The value of these sales was also disclosed in the periodical returns /filed as per the Jharkhand Vat Act, 2005. The Commercial Tax Department has raised demand of Central Sales tax by levying tax on the di/fferences between value of sales outside the states and value of F-Form submitted for stock transfers. The amount involved for various assessment years beginning 2011-2012  to  2016-2017  as  on  March  31,  2022 is amounting to /uni20B9 142.00 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B9188.65 crore).",

The Company has not acknowledged this claim and has instead /filed a claim of /uni20B9 141.23 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B9141.23 crore) on the party. The matter is pending before the Calcutta High Court.\n- (b) The  State  Government  of  Odisha  introduced 'Orissa Rural Infrastructure and Socio Economic Development Act, 2004' with e/ffect from February 2005 levying tax on mineral bearing land computed on the basis of value of minerals produced from the mineral bearing land. The Company had /filed a writ petition in the Odisha High Court challenging the validity of the Act. The High Court held in December 2005 that the State does not have authority to levy tax on minerals. The State of Odisha /filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court and the case is pending in Supreme Court. The potential liability, as at March 31, 2022 is /uni20B9 11,023.93 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B99,709.73 crore).\n- (c) The Company pays royalty on iron ore on the basis of quantity removed from the leased area at the rates based on noti/fication issued by the Ministry of Mines, Government of India and the price published by Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM) on a monthly basis.\n\nDemand of /uni20B9411.08 crore has been raised by Deputy Director of Mines, Joda, claiming royalty at sized ore rates on despatches of ore /fines. The Company has /filed a revision petition on November 14, 2013, before the Mines Tribunal, Government of India, Ministry of Mines, New Delhi, challenging the legality and validity of the demand and to grant refund of royalty paid in excess by the Company. Mines Tribunal has granted stay on the total demand with directive to Government of Odisha not to take any coercive action for realisation of this demanded amount.\n\nThe Hon'ble High Court of Odisha in a similar matter held the circulars based on which demands were raised to be valid. The Company has challenged the judgment of the High Court by a separate petition in the Hon'ble Supreme Court on April 29, 2016.\n\nOn July 16, 2019, the Company has /filed rejoinders to the reply /filed by State of Odisha against the revision petition. The State pressed for rejection of revision applications citing the judgment of the High Court. The Company represented before the authorities and explained that the judgment was passed under a particular set of facts and circumstances which cannot have blanket application on the Company considering the case of the Company is factually different. On August 7, 2019, the Mines Tribunal decided  to  await  the  outcome  of  Special  leave petition pending before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and adjourned the matter.\n\nLikely demand of royalty on /fines at sized ore rates as on March 31, 2022 is /uni20B9 2,859.97 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B92,207.31 crore).\n\n- (d) Demand notices were originally issued by the Deputy Director of Mines, Odisha amounting to /uni20B93,827.29 crore  for  excess  production  over  the  quantity permitted under the mining plan, environment clearance  or  consent  to  operate,  pertaining  to 2000-01 to 2009-10. The demand notices have been raised under Section 21(5) of the Mines & Minerals (Development and Regulations) Act, 1957 (MMDR). The Company filed revision petitions before the Mines Tribunal against all such demand notices. Initially, a stay of demands was granted, later by order dated October 12, 2017, the issue has been remanded to the state for reconsideration of the demand in the light of Supreme Court judgement passed on August 2, 2017.\n\nThe  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  pronounced  its judgement in the Common Cause case on August 2,  2017  wherein  it  directed  that  compensation equivalent to the price of mineral extracted in excess of environment clearance or without forest clearance from the forest land be paid.\n\nIn pursuance to the Judgement of Hon'ble Supreme Court, demand/show cause notices amounting to /uni20B93,873.35 crore have been issued during 2017-18 by the Deputy Director of Mines, Odisha and the District Mining O/ffice, Jharkhand.",

Other signi/ficant litigations\n\n- (a) Odisha Legislative Assembly issued an amendment to Indian Stamp Act, 1889, on May 09, 2013 and inserted a new provision (Section 3A) in respect of stamp duty payable on grant/renewal of mining leases. As per the amended provision, stamp duty is levied equal to 15% of the average royalty that would accrue out of the highest annual extraction of minerals under the approved mining plan multiplied by the period of such mining lease. The Company had /filed a writ petition challenging the constitutionality of the Act on July 5, 2013. The Hon'ble High Court, Cuttack passed an order on July 9, 2013 granting interim stay on the operation of the Amendment Act, 2013. Because of the stay, as on date, the Act is not enforceable and any demand received by the Company is not liable to be proceeded with. Meanwhile, the Company received demand notices for the various mines at Odisha totalling to /uni20B9 5,579.00 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B95,579.00 crore). The Company has concluded that it is remote that the claim will sustain on ultimate resolution of the legal case by the court.\n\nIn April 2015, the Company has received an intimation from  Government  of  Odisha,  granting  extension  of validity period for leases under the MMDR Amendment Act, 2015 up to March 31,2030 in respect of eight mines and up to March 31, 2020 for two mines subject to execution of supplementary lease deed. Liability has been provided in the books of accounts as on March 31, 2020 as per the existing provisions of the Stamp Act 1899 and the Company had paid the stamp duty and registration charges totalling /uni20B9413.72 crore for supplementary deed execution in respect of eight mines out of the above mines.\n\n- (b) Noamundi Iron Ore Mine of the Company was due for its third renewal with e/ffect from January 1, 2012. The application for renewal was submitted by the Company within the stipulated time, but it remained pending consideration with the State and the mining operations were continued in terms of the prevailing law.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy a judgement of April 2014 in the case of Goa mines, the Supreme Court took a view that second and subsequent renewal of mining lease can be e/ffected once the State considers the application and decides to renew the mining lease by issuing an express order. State of Jharkhand issued renewal order to the Company on December 31, 2014. The State, however, took a view on interpretation of Goa judgement that the mining carried out after expiry of the period of second renewal was 'illegal' and hence, issued a demand notice of /uni20B93,568.31 crore being the price of iron ore extracted. The said demand has been challenged by the Company before the Jharkhand High Court.\n\nThe mining operations were suspended from August 1, 2014. Upon issuance of an express order, Company paid /uni20B9152.00 crore under protest, so that mining can be resumed.\n\nThe Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation (MMDR) Amendment Ordinance, 2015 promulgated on January 12, 2015 provides for extension of such mining leases whose applications for renewal have remained pending with the State(s). Based on the new Ordinance, Jharkhand Government revised the Express Order on February 12, 2015 for extending the period of lease up to March 31, 2030 with the following terms and conditions:\n\n- \u00b7 value  of  iron  ore  produced  by  alleged  unlawful mining during the period January 1, 2012 to April 20, 2014 for /uni20B92,994.49 crore to be decided on the basis of disposal of our writ petition before Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand.\n- \u00b7 value of iron ore produced from April 21, 2014 to July 17, 2014 amounting to /uni20B9421.83 crore to be paid in maximum 3 instalments.\n- \u00b7 value of iron ore produced from July 18, 2014 to August 31, 2014 i.e. /uni20B9152.00 crore to be paid immediately.",

The Company on March 20, 2015 replied that since the lease has been extended by application of law till March 31, 2030, the above demand is not tenable. The Company, has paid /uni20B950.00 crore under protest on July 27, 2015, because the State had stopped issuance of transit permits.\n\nThe company /filed another writ petition before the Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand which was heard on September 9, 2015. An interim order was given by the Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand on September 17, 2015 wherein the Court has directed the Company to pay the amount of /uni20B9371.83 crore in 3 equal instalments, /first instalment by October 15, 2015, second instalment by November 15, 2015 and third instalment by December 15, 2015.\n\nIn view of the interim order of the Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand /uni20B9124.00 crore was paid on September 28, 2015, /uni20B9124.00 crore on November 12, 2015 and /uni20B9123.83 crore on December 14, 2015 under protest.\n\nThe case is pending before the Hon'ble High court for disposal. The State issued similar terms and conditions to other mining lessees in the State rendering the mining as illegal.

Subsequently,  the Government of India has issued the Coal Mines (Special Provision) Act 2015, which inter-alia deal with the payment of compensation to the affected parties in regard to investment in coal blocks. The receivable in respect of de-allocated coal block amounts to /uni20B9414.56 crore (net of provision of /uni20B9138.74 crore). The Company has /filed its claim for compensation with the Government of India, Ministry of Coal. Pursuant to letter dated November 22, 2019, Ministry of Coal ('MoC') informed that all statutory license, consent approvals, permission required for undertaking of Coal mining operations in New Patrapara Coal Mine now vested to Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. MoC /Union of India, /filed supplementary a/ffidavit dated February 11, 2020 before Delhi High Court vide which it has informed that payment of compensation can be paid to prior allottee after the mine is successfully allotted and compensation is deposited by successful allottee, following the sequence mentioned in section 9 of Coal Mine (Special Provisions) Act, 2015. It has been informed that New Patrapara Coal Mine has been allocated to Singareni Collieris Company Ltd  (SCCL,  a  state  Government  Undertaking)  and compensation to the prior allottee to be released. MoC vide order dated May 17, 2021 has directed SCCL to pay aforesaid compensation to TSBSL (entity merged with the Company).",

Disclosures on /financial instruments (Contd.)\n\n## (d) Transfer of /financial assets\n\nThe  Company  transfers  certain  trade  receivables under discounting arrangements with banks//financial institutions. Some of such arrangements do not qualify for de-recognition due to recourse arrangements being in place. Consequently, the proceeds received from transfer are recorded as short-term borrowings from banks and /financial institutions. As at March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021, there has been no such transfer of trade receivables.\n\n## (e) Financial risk management\n\nIn the course of its business, the Company is exposed primarily to /fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, liquidity and credit risk, which may adversely impact the fair value of its /financial instruments. The Company has a risk management policy which not only covers the foreign exchange risks but also other risks associated with the /financial assets and liabilities such as interest rate risks and credit risks. The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors. The risk management framework aims to:\n\n- (i) create a stable business planning environment by reducing the impact of currency and interest rate /fluctuations on the Company's business plan.\n- (ii) achieve  greater  predictability  to  earnings  by determining the financial value of the expected earnings in advance.\n\n## (i) Market risk:\n\nMarket risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings, in realising fair values or in future cash /flows that may result from a change in the price of a /financial instrument. The value of a /financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity price /fluctuations, liquidity and other market changes. Future speci/fic market movements cannot be normally predicted with reasonable accuracy.\n\n## (a) Market risk - Foreign currency exchange rate risk:\n\nThe /fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have a potential impact on the statement of pro/fit and loss and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets/ liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company.\n\nThe Company, as per its risk management policy, uses foreign exchange forwards and other derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate exposure. Any weakening of the functional currency may impact the Company's cost of imports and cost of borrowings and consequently may increase the cost of /financing the Company's capital expenditures.\n\nA  10%  appreciation/depreciation  of  foreign currencies with respect to functional currency of the Company would result in an increase/decrease in the Company's net pro/fit/equity before considering tax impacts by approximately /uni20B9 3,103.46 crore for the year ended March 31, 2022 (March 31, 2021: /uni20B9832.49 crore).\n\nThe foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by assuming a simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the functional currency of the Company.\n\nThe  sensitivity  analysis  has  been  based  on  the composition of the Company's /financial assets and liabilities as at March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021 excluding trade payables, trade receivables, other derivative and non-derivative /financial instruments not forming part of debt and which do not present a material exposure. The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the average balance outstanding during the period.\n\n## (b) Market risk - Interest rate risk:\n\nInterest rate risk is measured by using the cash /flow sensitivity for changes in variable interest rates. Any movement in the reference rates could have an impact on the Company's cash /flows as well as costs. The Company is subject to variable interest rates on some of its interest bearing liabilities. The Company's interest rate exposure is mainly related to debt obligations.\n\nBased on the composition of debt as at March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021 a 100 basis points increase in  interest  rates  would  increase  the  Company's /finance costs (before considering interest eligible for capitalisation) and consequently reduce net profit/equity before considering tax impacts by approximately /uni20B9 127.94 crore for the year ended March 31, 2022 (2020-21: /uni20B9170.61 crore).",

Disclosures on /financial instruments (Contd.)\n\nThe risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves. This calculation also assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet date and has been calculated based on risk exposures outstanding as at that date. The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the period.\n\n## (c) Market risk - Equity price risk:\n\nEquity price risk is related to change in market reference price of investments in equity securities held by the Company.\n\nThe fair value of quoted investments held by the Company exposes the Company to equity price risks. In general, these investments are not held for trading purposes.\n\nThe fair value of quoted investments in equity, classi/fied as fair value through other comprehensive income as at March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021 was /uni20B9 1,182.53 crore and /uni20B9537.85 crore, respectively.\n\nA 10% change in equity prices of such securities held as at March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021, would result in an impact of /uni20B9 118.25 crore and /uni20B953.79 crore respectively on equity before considering tax impact.\n\n## (ii) Credit risk:\n\nCredit risk is the risk of /financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms or obligations. Credit risk encompasses both the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of credit worthiness as well as concentration risks.\n\nThe Company has a policy of dealing only with credit worthy counter parties and obtaining su/fficient collateral, where appropriate as a means of mitigating the risk of /financial loss from defaults.\n\nFinancial  instruments  that  are  subject  to  credit  risk and concentration thereof principally consist of trade receivables,  loans  receivables,  investments  in  debt securities and mutual funds, balances with bank, bank deposits, derivatives and /financial guarantees provided by the Company. None of the /financial instruments of the Company result in material concentration of credit risk except investment in preference shares made by the Company in its subsidiary companies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe carrying value of financial assets represents the maximum credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk was /uni20B9 53,622.75 crore and /uni20B922,851.57 crore, as at March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021 respectively, being the total carrying value of trade receivables, balances with bank, bank deposits, investments in debt securities and mutual funds, loans, derivative assets and other /financial assets.\n\nThe risk relating to trade receivables is presented in note 13, page 334.\n\nThe Company's exposure to customers is diversi/fied and no single customer, other than a subsidiary contributes to more than 10% of outstanding trade receivables as at March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021.\n\nIn  respect  of  financial  guarantees  provided  by  the Company to banks//financial institutions, the maximum exposure  which  the  Company  is  exposed  to  is  the maximum amount which the Company would have to pay if the guarantee is called upon. Based on the expectation at the end of the reporting period, the Company considers that it is more likely than not that such an amount will not be payable under the guarantees provided.\n\n## (iii) Liquidity  risk:\n\nLiquidity risk refers to the risk that the Company cannot meet its /financial obligations. The objective of liquidity risk management is to maintain su/fficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements.\n\nThe Company has obtained fund and non-fund based working capital lines from various banks. Furthermore, the Company have access to undrawn lines of committed and uncommitted borrowing/facilities, funds from debt markets  through  commercial  paper  programs,  nonconvertible debentures and other debt instruments. The Company invests its surplus funds in bank /fixed deposits and in mutual funds, which carry no or low market risk.\n\nThe Company also constantly monitors funding options available in the debt and capital markets with a view of maintaining /financial /flexibility.",

We have audited the accompanying consolidated /financial statements of Tata Steel Limited (hereinafter referred to as the 'Holding Company') and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as 'the Group'), its associate companies and jointly controlled entities  (refer  Note  1  to  the  attached  consolidated /financial statements), which comprise the consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2022, and the consolidated Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss  (including  Other Comprehensive Income), the consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity  and the consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated /financial statements, including a summary of signi/ficant accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as 'the consolidated /financial statements').\n- 2. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid consolidated /financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act') in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of a/ffairs of the Group, its associate companies and jointly controlled entities  as  at  March  31,  2022,  of  consolidated  total comprehensive income (comprising of pro/fit and other comprehensive income), consolidated changes in equity and its consolidated cash /flows for the year then ended.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n- 3. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) speci/fied under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Group, its associate companies and jointly controlled entities in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated /financial statements in India in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of  Chartered  Accountants  of  India  and  the  relevant provisions of the Act, and we have ful/filled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in sub-paragraph 14 of the Other Matters section below, other than the unaudited financial statements/ financial information as certi/fied by the management and referred to in subparagraph 15 and /financial information not available as referred to in paragraph 16 of the Other Matters section below, is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.",

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signi/ficance in our audit of the consolidated /financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated /financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Assessment of litigations and related disclosure of contingent liabilities\n\n[Refer to Note 2 (c) to the Consolidated /financial statements'Use of estimates and critical accounting judgements Provisions and contingent liabilities', Note 38 (A) to the Consolidated /financial statements - 'Contingencies' and Note 39 to the Consolidated /financial statements - 'Other signi/ficant litigations']\n\nAs at March 31, 2022, the Holding Company has exposures towards litigations relating to various matters as set out in the aforesaid Notes.\n\nSigni/ficant management judgement is required to assess such matters to determine the probability of occurrence of material out/flow of economic resources and whether a provision should be recognised, or a disclosure should be made. The management judgement is also supported with legal advice in certain cases as considered appropriate. As the ultimate outcome of the matters are uncertain and the positions taken by the management are based on the application of their best judgement, related legal advice including those relating to interpretation of laws/regulations, it is considered to be a Key Audit Matter.\n\nOur audit procedures included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 We understood, assessed and tested the design and operating e/ffectiveness of the Holding Company's key controls surrounding assessment of litigations relating to the relevant laws and regulations;\n- \u00b7 We discussed with management the recent developments and the status of the material litigations which were reviewed  and  noted  by  the  Holding  Company's Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 We performed our assessment on a test basis on the underlying  calculations  supporting  the  contingent liabilities/other  significant  litigations  disclosed  in relation  to  the  Holding  Company's  Standalone Financial Statements;\n- \u00b7 We  used  auditor's  experts  /  specialist  to  gain  an understanding and to evaluate the disputed tax matters;\n- \u00b7 We considered external legal opinions, where relevant, obtained by management;\n- \u00b7 We  evaluated  management's  assessments  by understanding  precedents  set  in  similar  cases  and assessed  the  reliability  of  the  management's  past estimates/judgements;\n- \u00b7 We evaluated management's assessment around those matters that are not disclosed or not considered as contingent liability, as the probability of material out/flow is considered to be remote by the management; and\n- \u00b7 We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures.\n\nBased on the above work performed, the management's assessment in respect of Holding Company's litigations and related disclosures relating to contingent liabilities/ other signi/ficant litigations in the Consolidated Financial Statements is considered to be reasonable.\n\nAlso refer to the Key Audit Matters included by us in our audit report of even date on the standalone /financial statements of the Holding Company.",

The other information comprises the information in the Integrated Report, Board's Report along with its Annexures and Financial Highlights included in the Holding Company's Annual Report (titled as 'Tata Steel Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2021-22') but does not include the consolidated /financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.\n- Our opinion on the consolidated /financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated /financial statements,  our  responsibility  is  to  read  the  other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated /financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed and the reports of the other auditors as furnished to us (Refer paragraph 14 below), we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n- 6. The Holding Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated /financial statements in term of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance and consolidated cash /flows, and changes in equity of the Group including its associate companies and jointly controlled entities in accordance with the accounting principles  generally  accepted  in  India,  including  the Accounting Standards speci/fied under Section 133 of the Act. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associate companies and jointly controlled entities are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that  are  reasonable  and  prudent;  and  the  design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated /financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated /financial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.\n\n- 7. In preparing the consolidated /financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associate companies and jointly controlled  entities  are  responsible  for  assessing  the ability of the Group and of its associate companies and jointly controlled entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n- 8. The  respective  Board  of  Directors  of  the  companies included in the Group and of its associate companies and jointly controlled entities are responsible for overseeing the /financial reporting process of the Group and of its associate companies and jointly controlled entities.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n- 9. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated /financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated /financial statements.\n- 10. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements in place and the operating e/ffectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.",

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated /financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our  conclusions  are  based  on  the  audit  evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report.

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal /financial controls that were operating e/ffectively for ensuring the orderly and e/fficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable /financial information, as required under the Act.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibility\n\n- 3. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding Company's internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing deemed to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal /financial controls, both applicable to an audit of internal /financial controls and both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated e/ffectively in all material respects.\n- 4. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal /financial controls system with reference to consolidated /financial statements and their operating e/ffectiveness. Our audit of internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating e/ffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n- 5. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Holding Company's internal /financial controls system with reference to consolidated /financial statements.",

A company's internal /financial control with reference to consolidated /financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of /financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated /financial statements for external purposes in accordance with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A company's internal /financial control with reference to consolidated /financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly re/flect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material e/ffect on the consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements\n\n- 7. Because of the inherent limitations of internal /financial controls  with  reference  to  consolidated  financial statements,  including  the  possibility  of  collusion  or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal /financial control with reference to consolidated /financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Opinion\n\n- 8. In our opinion, the Holding Company, its subsidiary companies, its associate companies and jointly controlled entities, which are companies incorporated in India, have,  in  all  material  respects,  an  adequate  internal /financial controls system with reference to consolidated /financial statements and such internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated  financial statements were operating e/ffectively as at March 31, 2022, based on the internal control over /financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.\n\n## Other Matters\n\n- 9. Our aforesaid reports under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements insofar as it relates to nine subsidiary companies, and two jointly controlled entities, which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies incorporated in India. Our opinion is not modi/fied in respect of this matter.\n\n## For Price Waterhouse & Co Chartered Accountants LLP\n\nFirm Registration Number: 304026E/ E-300009\n\n## Russell I Parera\n\nPartner Membership Number: 042190 UDIN: 22042190AIIFFO6226\n\nPlace: Mumbai\n\nDate: May 3, 2022",

Company Information\n\nTata Steel Limited ('the Company') is a public limited Company incorporated in India with its registered o/ffice in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. The Company is listed on the BSE Limited (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE).\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as 'the Group') have presence across the entire value chain of steel manufacturing from mining and processing iron ore and coal to producing and distributing /finished products. The Group o/ffers a broad range of steel products including a portfolio of high value-added downstream products such as hot rolled, cold rolled, coated steel, rebars, wire rods, tubes and wires.\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements as at March 31, 2022 present the /financial position of the Group as well as its interests in associate companies and joint arrangements. The list of entities consolidated is provided in note 55, page 512.\n\nThe functional and presentation currency of the Company and the presentation currency of the Group is Indian Rupee ('/uni20B9').\n\nAs on March 31, 2022, Tata Sons Private Limited owns 32.46 % of the Ordinary Shares of the Company, and has the ability to in/fluence the Group's operations.\n\nThe /financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022 were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on May 3, 2022.\n\n## 2. Signi/ficant accounting policies\n\nThe signi/ficant accounting policies applied by the Group in the preparation of its consolidated /financial statements are listed below. Such accounting policies have been applied  consistently  to  all  the  periods  presented in  these  consolidated  financial  statements,  unless otherwise indicated.\n\n## (a) Statement of compliance\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (referred to as 'Ind AS') prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, as amended from time to time and other relevant provisions of the Act.\n\n## (b) Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of certain assets and liabilities that are required to be carried at fair values by Ind AS.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\n## (c) Use of estimates and critical accounting judgements\n\nIn the preparation of the consolidated /financial statements, the  Group  makes  judgements  in  the  application  of accounting policies; and estimates and assumptions which a/ffects carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may di/ffer from these estimates.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods a/ffected.\n\nKey source of estimation of uncertainty at the date of consolidated financial statements, which may cause material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next /financial year, is in respect of  impairment,  useful  lives  of  property,  plant  and equipment and intangible assets, valuation of deferred tax assets, provisions and contingent liabilities, fair value measurements of /financial instruments, retirement bene/fit obligations and non-current assets classi/fied as held for sale as discussed below:\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe Group estimates the value in use of the cash generating unit (CGU) based on future cash /flows after considering current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results and growth rate and anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions. The estimated cash /flows are developed using internal forecasts. The cash /flows are discounted using a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. Further details of the Group's impairment review and key assumptions are set out in note 3, page 422 , note 4, page 428, note 5, page 431and note 6, page 433.",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\n## Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nThe Group reviews the useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at the end of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation and amortisation expense in future periods. The policy has been detailed in note 2(n), page 413.\n\n## Valuation of deferred tax assets\n\nThe Group reviews the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period. The policy has been detailed in note 2(y), page 419 and its further information are set out in note 12, page 442.\n\n## Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nA provision is recognised when the Group has a present obligation as result of a past event and it is probable that the out/flow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to re/flect the current best estimates. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the /financial statements. Further details are set out in note 25, page 468 and note 38(A), page 488.\n\n## Fair value measurements of /financial instruments\n\nWhen the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities  recorded  in  the  balance  sheet  cannot  be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including  Discounted  Cash  Flow  Model.  The  inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risks, credit risks and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could a/ffect the reported fair value of /financial instruments. Further details are set out in note 43, page 497.\n\n## Retirement bene/fit obligations and assets\n\nThe Group's retirement bene/fit obligations are subject to a number of assumptions including discount rates, in/flation, salary growth and mortality rate. Signi/ficant assumptions are required when setting these criteria and a change in these assumptions would have a signi/ficant impact on the amount recorded in the Group's balance sheet and the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss. The Group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsets these assumptions based on previous experience and third party actuarial advice. Further details on the Group's retirement bene/fit obligations, including key assumptions are set out in note 37, page 476.\n\n## Non-current assets held for sale\n\nThe  recognition  of  non-current  assets  (or  disposal groups) as held for sale is dependent upon whether its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Signi/ficant judgement is required to assess whether the sale of the assets (or disposal group) is highly probable.\n\n## Estimation of uncertainties relating to COVID-19\n\nThe Group has assessed the possible impact of COVID-19 on its /financial statements based on the internal and external  information  available  and  concluded  no adjustment is required in these consolidated /financial statements. The Group continues to monitor changes in future economic conditions.\n\n## (d) Basis of consolidation\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  incorporate the /financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company i.e. its subsidiaries. It also includes the Group's share of profits, net assets and retained post acquisition reserves of joint arrangements and associates that are consolidated using the equity or proportionate method of consolidation, as applicable.\n\nControl is achieved when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to the variable returns of the entity and the ability to a/ffect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity.\n\nThe  results  of  subsidiaries,  joint  arrangements  and associates acquired or disposed o/ff during the year are included in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss from the e/ffective date of acquisition or up to the e/ffective date of disposal, as appropriate.\n\nWherever  necessary,  adjustments  are  made  to  the /financial statements of subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates to bring their accounting policies in line with those used by other members of the Group.\n\nIntra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identi/fied separately from the Group's equity.  The  interest  of  non-controlling  shareholders may be initially measured either at fair value or at the",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\nnon-controlling interests' proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree's identi/fiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-byacquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying value of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests' share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if it results in the non-controlling interests having a de/ficit balance.\n\n## (e) Business combinations\n\nAcquisition of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in each business combination is measured at the aggregate of the acquisition date fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.\n\nAcquisition related costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nGoodwill  arising  on  acquisition  is  recognised  as  an asset and measured at cost, being the excess of the consideration transferred in the business combination over the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable  assets  acquired,  liabilities  assumed  and contingent liabilities recognised. Where the fair value of the identi/fiable assets and liabilities exceed the cost of acquisition, after re-assessing the fair values of the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is recognised as capital reserve on consolidation.\n\nOnce  control  has  been  achieved,  any  subsequent acquisitions where the Group does not originally hold hundred percent interest in a subsidiary are treated as an acquisition of shares from non-controlling shareholders. The identi/fiable net assets are not subject to further fair value adjustments and the di/fference between the cost of acquisition of the non-controlling interest and the net book value of the additional interest acquired is adjusted in equity.\n\nBusiness combinations arising from transfer of interests in entities that are under common control are accounted for using the pooling of interest method. The di/fference between any consideration transferred and the aggregate historical carrying values of assets and liabilities of the acquired entity are recognised in shareholders' equity.\n\n## (f) Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nFor  the  purpose  of  impairment  testing,  goodwill  is allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to bene/fit from the synergies of the combination. Cashgenerating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit's value may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated /first to reduce the carrying value of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit in proportion to the carrying value of each asset in the unit.\n\nAn impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of pro/fit or loss on disposal.\n\n## (g) Investment in associates\n\nAssociates are those enterprises over which the Group has signi/ficant in/fluence, but does not have control or joint control.\n\nInvestments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost from the date signi/ficant in/fluence commences until the date that signi/ficant in/fluence ceases. Subsequent changes in the carrying value re/flect the post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of net assets of the associate and impairment charges, if any.\n\nWhen the Group's share of losses exceeds the carrying value of the associate, the carrying value is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has incurred obligations in respect of the associate.\n\nUnrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest  in  the  associates,  unrealised  losses  are  also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred and where material, the results of associates are modi/fied to con/firm to the Group's accounting policies.",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\n## (h) Interest in joint arrangements\n\nA  joint  arrangement  is  a  contractual  arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic  activity  where  the  strategic  financial  and operating policy decisions relating to the activities of the joint arrangement require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nWhere Group entity undertakes its activities under joint arrangements as joint operations, the Group's share of jointly controlled assets and any liabilities incurred jointly with other parties are recognised in its /financial statements  and  classified  according  to  their  nature. Liabilities and expenses incurred directly in respect of interests in joint operations are accounted for on the accrual basis. Income from the sale or use of the Group's share of the output of joint operations, and its share of joint arrangements expenses, are recognised when it is probable that the economic bene/fits associated with the transactions will /flow to the Group and their amount can be measured reliably.\n\nJoint arrangements that involve the establishment of a separate entity in which each venturer has an interest are referred to as joint ventures. The Group reports its interests in joint ventures using the equity method of accounting whereby an interest in joint venture is initially recorded at  cost  and  adjusted  thereafter  for  post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of net assets of the joint venture. The consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss re/flects the Group's share of the results of operations of the joint venture.\n\nWhen the Group's share of losses exceeds the carrying value of the joint venture, the carrying value is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has incurred obligations in respect of the joint venture.\n\nUnrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the joint venture, unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred and where material, the results of joint ventures are modi/fied to conform to the Group's accounting policies.\n\n## (i) Property, plant and equipment\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an asset if it is probable that future economic bene/fits associated with the item will /flow to the Group and its\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncost can be measured reliably. This recognition principle is applied to costs incurred initially to acquire an item of property, plant and equipment and also to costs incurred subsequently to add to, replace part of, or service it. All other repair and maintenance costs, including regular servicing, are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss as incurred. When a replacement occurs, the carrying value of the replaced part is de-recognised. Where  an  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment comprises major components having di/fferent useful lives, these components are accounted for as separate items.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost applied on transition to Ind AS, less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost includes all direct costs and expenditures incurred to bring the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use. Trial run expenses are capitalised. Borrowing costs incurred during the period of construction is capitalised as part of cost of qualifying asset.\n\nThe gain or loss arising on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the di/fference between sale proceeds and carrying value of such item, and is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## (j) Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources\n\nExpenditures associated with search for speci/fic mineral resources are recognised as exploration and evaluation assets. The following expenditure comprises the cost of exploration and evaluation assets:\n\n- \u00b7 obtaining of the rights to explore and evaluate mineral reserves and resources including costs directly related to this acquisition\n- \u00b7 researching and analysing existing exploration data\n- \u00b7 conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling\n- \u00b7 examining and testing extraction and treatment methods\n- \u00b7 compiling pre-feasibility and feasibility studies\n- \u00b7 activities  in  relation  to  evaluating  the  technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource.\n\nAdministration and other overhead costs are charged to the cost of exploration and evaluation assets only if directly related to an exploration and evaluation project.",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\nIf  a  project  does  not  prove  viable,  all  irrecoverable exploration and evaluation expenditure associated with the project net of any related impairment allowances is written o/ff to the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nThe Group measures its exploration and evaluation assets at cost and classi/fies as property, plant and equipment or intangible assets according to the nature of the assets acquired and applies the classi/fication consistently. To the extent that a tangible asset is consumed in developing an intangible asset, the amount re/flecting that consumption is capitalised as a part of the cost of the intangible asset.\n\nAs the asset is not available for use, it is not depreciated. All exploration and evaluation assets are monitored for indications of impairment. An exploration and evaluation asset is no longer classi/fied as such when the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable and the development of the  deposit  is  sanctioned  by  the  management.  The carrying value of such exploration and evaluation asset is reclassi/fied to mining assets.\n\n## (k) Development expenditure for mineral reserves\n\nDevelopment is the establishment of access to mineral reserves  and  other  preparations  for  commercial production. Development activities often continue during production and include:\n\n- \u00b7 sinking shafts and underground drifts (often called mine development)\n- \u00b7 making permanent excavations\n- \u00b7 developing passageways and rooms or galleries\n- \u00b7 building roads and tunnels and\n- \u00b7 advance removal of overburden and waste rock.\n\nDevelopment  (or  construction)  also  includes  the installation of infrastructure (e.g., roads, utilities and housing), machinery, equipment and facilities.\n\nDevelopment expenditure is capitalised and presented as part of mining assets. No depreciation is charged on the development expenditure before the start of commercial production.\n\n## (l) Provision for restoration and environmental costs\n\nThe Group has liabilities related to restoration of soil and other related works, which are due upon the closure of certain of its mining sites.\n\nSuch liabilities are estimated case-by-case based on available information, taking into account applicable local legal requirements. The estimation is made using existing technology, at current prices, and discounted using a appropriate discount rate where the e/ffect of time value of money is material. Future restoration and environmental costs, discounted to net present value, are capitalised and the corresponding restoration liability is raised as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. Future restoration and environmental costs are capitalised in property, plant and equipment or mining assets as appropriate and are depreciated over the life of the related asset. The e/ffect of time value of money on the restoration and environmental costs liability is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## (m)  Intangible assets\n\nPatents, trademarks and software costs are included in the consolidated balance sheet as intangible assets when it is probable that associated future economic bene/fits would /flow to the Group. In this case they are measured initially at purchase cost and then amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. All other costs on patents, trademarks and software are expensed in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss as and when incurred.\n\nExpenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Costs incurred on individual development projects are recognised as intangible assets from the date when all of the following conditions are met:\n\n- (i) completion of the development is technically feasible.\n- (ii) it is the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it.\n- (iii) ability to use or sell the intangible asset.\n- (iv)   it is clear that the intangible asset will generate probable future economic bene/fits.\n- (v) adequate technical, /financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset are available.\n- (vi) it is possible to reliably measure the expenditure attributable  to  the  intangible  asset  during its development.\n\nRecognition of costs as an asset is ceased when the project is complete and available for its intended use, or if these criteria are no longer applicable.",

Hence the useful lives for these assets are di/fferent from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n## (o) Impairment\n\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying value of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable through continuing use. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is reviewed in order to determine the extent of impairment loss, if any. Where the asset does not generate cash /flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount  of  the  cash  generating  unit  to  which  the asset belongs.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash /flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re/flects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci/fic to the asset for which the estimates of future cash /flows have not been adjusted. An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss as and when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.\n\nWhere an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying value of the asset (or cash generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount,  so  that  the  increased  carrying  value  does not exceed the carrying value that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss immediately.",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\n## (p) Leases\n\nThe Group determines whether an arrangement contains a lease by assessing whether the ful/filment of a transaction is dependent on the use of a speci/fic asset and whether the transaction conveys the right to control the use of that asset to the Group in return for payment.\n\n## The Group as lessee\n\nThe Group accounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease components of the contract and allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative  stand-alone  price  of  the  lease  component and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease components. The Group recognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease commencement date. The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception comprises of the amount of initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date.\n\nCertain lease arrangements include options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. The right-of-use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that such options would be exercised.\n\nThe right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment  losses,  if  any,  and  adjusted  for  any  remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset.\n\nRight-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nLease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to re/flect interest on the lease liability, reducing the  carrying  amount  to  reflect  the  lease  payments\n\nmade and remeasuring the carrying amount to re/flect any reassessment or lease modifications. The Group recognises the amount of the re-measurement of lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Group recognises any remaining amount  of  the  re-measurement  in  the  consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nVariable lease payments not included in the measurement of the lease liabilities are expensed to the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss in the period in which the events or conditions which trigger those payments occur.\n\nIn a sale and lease back transaction, the Group measures right-of-use  asset  arising  from  the  leaseback  as  the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the right of use retained. The gain or loss that the Group recognises in the consolidated statement of profit and loss is limited to the proportion of the total gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer.\n\n## The Group as lessor\n\n- (i) Operating lease Rental income from operating leases is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic bene/fits from the leased asset is diminished. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying value of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n- (ii) Finance lease When assets are leased out under a  finance  lease,  the  present  value  of  minimum lease payments is recognised as a receivable. The di/fference between the gross receivable and the present value of receivable is recognised as unearned /finance income. Lease income is recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method before tax, which re/flects a constant periodic rate of return.\n\n## (q) Stripping costs\n\nThe Group separates two di/fferent types of stripping costs that are incurred in surface mining activity:\n\n- \u00b7 developmental stripping costs and\n- \u00b7 production stripping costs",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\nDevelopmental stripping costs which are incurred in order to obtain access to quantities of mineral reserves that will be mined in future periods are capitalised as part of mining assets. Capitalisation of developmental stripping costs ends when the commercial production of the mineral reserves begins.\n\nA mine can operate several open pits that are regarded as separate operations for the purpose of mine planning and production. In this case, stripping costs are accounted for separately, by reference to the ore extracted from each separate pit. If, however, the pits are highly integrated for the purpose of mine planning and production, stripping costs are aggregated too.\n\nThe determination of whether multiple pit mines are considered separate or integrated operations depends on each mine's specific circumstances. The following factors normally point towards the stripping costs for the individual pits being accounted for separately:\n\n- \u00b7 mining of the second and subsequent pits is conducted consecutively  with  that  of  the  first  pit,  rather than concurrently\n- \u00b7 separate investment decisions are made to develop each pit, rather than a single investment decision being made at the outset\n- \u00b7 the pits are operated as separate units in terms of mine planning and the sequencing of overburden and ore mining, rather than as an integrated unit\n- \u00b7 expenditure for additional infrastructure to support the second and subsequent pits are relatively large\n- \u00b7 the pits extract ore from separate and distinct ore bodies, rather than from a single ore body.\n\nThe relative importance of each factor is considered by the management to determine whether, the stripping costs should be attributed to the individual pit or to the combined output from the several pits.\n\nProduction stripping costs are incurred to extract the ore in the form of inventories and/or to improve access to an additional component of an ore body or deeper levels of material. Production stripping costs are accounted for as inventories to the extent the bene/fit from production stripping activity is realised in the form of inventories.\n\nThe Group recognises a stripping activity asset in the production phase if, and only if, all of the following are met:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 it  is  probable  that  the  future  economic  benefit (improved access to the ore body) associated with the stripping activity will /flow to the Group\n- \u00b7 the Group can identify the component of the ore body for which access has been improved and\n- \u00b7 the costs relating to the improved access to that component can be measured reliably.\n\nSuch costs are presented within mining assets. After initial recognition, stripping activity assets are carried at cost/deemed cost, less accumulated amortisation and impairment. The expected useful life of the identi/fied component of the ore body is used to depreciate or amortise the stripping asset.\n\n## (r) Financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and /financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions  of  the  instrument.  Financial  assets  and liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of /financial assets and /financial liabilities (other than /financial assets and /financial liabilities at fair value through pro/fit and loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on initial recognition of /financial asset or /financial liability. The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and /financial liabilities at fair value through pro/fit and loss are immediately recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## E/ffective interest method\n\nThe e/ffective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial instrument and of allocating interest income or expense over the relevant period. The e/ffective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the /financial instrument, or where appropriate, a shorter period.\n\n## (I) Financial assets\n\n## Cash and bank balances\n\nCash and bank balances consist of:\n\n- (i) Cash and cash equivalents which include cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term deposits which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash, are subject to an insigni/ficant risk of change in value and have original",

Such an election is made by the Group on an instrument by instrument basis at the time of initial recognition of such equity investments. These investments are held for medium or long-term strategic purpose. The Group has chosen to designate these investments in equity instruments as fair value through other comprehensive income as the management believes this provides a more meaningful presentation for medium or long-term strategic investments, than reflecting changes in fair value immediately in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nFinancial assets not measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income are carried at fair value through pro/fit and loss.\n\n## Interest income\n\nInterest income is accrued on a time proportion basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and e/ffective interest rate applicable.\n\n## Dividend income\n\nDividend income from investments is recognised when the right to receive payment has been established.\n\n## Impairment of /financial assets\n\nLoss allowance for expected credit losses is recognised for /financial assets measured at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Group recognises life time expected credit losses for  all  trade  receivables  that  do  not  constitute  a /financing transaction.\n\nFor /financial assets (apart from trade receivables that do not constitute a /financing transaction) whose credit risk has not signi/ficantly increased since initial recognition, loss allowance equal to twelve months expected credit losses is recognised. Loss allowance equal to the lifetime expected credit losses is recognised if the credit risk of the /financial asset has signi/ficantly increased since initial recognition.\n\n## De-recognition of /financial assets\n\nThe Group de-recognises a /financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash /flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the /financial asset and substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.\n\nIf the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the assets and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.\n\nIf the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred /financial asset, the Group continues  to  recognise  the  financial  asset  and  also recognises a borrowing for the proceeds received.\n\n## (II) Financial liabilities and equity instruments\n\n## Classi/fication as debt or equity\n\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classi/fied according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the de/finitions of a /financial liability and an equity instrument.",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\n\n## Financial Liabilities\n\nTrade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the e/ffective interest rate method where the time value of money is signi/ficant.\n\nInterest bearing bank loans, overdrafts and issued debt are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest rate method. Any di/fference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## De-recognition of /financial liabilities\n\nThe Group de-recognises /financial liabilities when, and only  when,  the  Group's  obligations  are  discharged, cancelled or they expire.\n\n## Derivative /financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Group uses certain derivative /financial instruments to reduce business risks which arise from its exposure to foreign exchange, base metal prices and interest rate /fluctuations. The instruments are con/fined principally to forward foreign exchange contracts,  forward  rate  agreements,  cross  currency swaps, interest rate swaps and collar. The instruments are employed as hedges of transactions included in the /financial statements or for highly probable forecast transactions/firm  contractual  commitments.  These derivatives contracts do not generally extend beyond six months, except for certain currency swaps and interest rate derivatives.\n\nDerivatives are initially accounted for and measured at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period.\n\nThe Group adopts hedge accounting for forward foreign exchange,  interest  rate  and  commodity  contracts wherever possible. At the inception of each hedge, there is a formal, documented designation of the hedging\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrelationship. This documentation includes, inter alia , items such as identi/fication of the hedged item and transaction and nature of the risk being hedged. At inception, each hedge is expected to be highly e/ffective in achieving an o/ffset of changes in fair value or cash /flows attributable to the hedged risk. The e/ffectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated with the exposure being hedged is assessed and measured at the inception and on an ongoing basis. The ine/ffective portion of designated hedges is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nWhen hedge accounting is applied:\n\n- \u00b7 for fair value hedges of recognised assets and liabilities, changes in fair value of the hedged assets and liabilities attributable to the risk being hedged, are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss and compensate for the e/ffective portion of symmetrical changes in the fair value of the derivatives.\n- \u00b7 for cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recognised directly  in  other  comprehensive  income  and  the ine/ffective portion is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss. If the cash /flow hedge of a /firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of a non-/financial asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of a non/financial asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss in the same period in which the hedged item a/ffects the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nIn cases where hedge accounting is not applied, changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss as and when they arise.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer quali/fies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised  in  equity  is  retained  in  equity  until  the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss for the period.",

Signi/ficant accounting policies (Contd.)\n\n## (s) Employee bene/fits\n\n## De/fined contribution plans\n\nContributions  under  defined  contribution  plans  are recognised as an expense for the period in which the employee has rendered the service. Payments made to state managed retirement bene/fit schemes are dealt with as payments to de/fined contribution schemes where the Group's obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement bene/fit scheme.\n\n## De/fined bene/fit plans\n\nFor defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing bene/fits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuation being carried out at each year-end balance sheet date. Re-measurement gains and losses of the net de/fined bene/fit liability/(asset) are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. The service cost and net interest on the net defined benefit liability/(asset) are recognised as an expense within employee costs.\n\nPast service cost is recognised as an expense when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs or when any related restructuring costs or termination bene/fits are recognised, whichever is earlier.\n\nThe retirement benefit obligations recognised in the consolidated balance sheet represents the present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligation as reduced by the fair value of plan assets.\n\n## Compensated absences\n\nCompensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related service are recognised based on actuarial valuation at the present value of the obligation as on the reporting date.\n\n## (t) Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is ascertained on a weighted average basis. Costs comprise direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value is the price at which the inventories can be realised in the normal course of business after allowing for the cost of conversion from their existing state to a /finished condition and for the cost of marketing, selling and distribution.\n\nProvisions are made to cover slow moving and obsolete items based on historical experience of utilisation on a  product  category  basis,  which  involves  individual businesses  considering  their  product  lines  and market conditions.\n\n## (u) Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, which is expected to result in an out/flow of resources embodying economic bene/fits which can be reliably estimated. Each provision is based on the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. Where the time value of money is material, provisions are measured on a discounted basis.\n\nConstructive obligation is an obligation that derives from an entity's actions where:\n\n- (i) by an established pattern of past practice, published policies or a su/fficiently speci/fic current statement, the entity has indicated to other parties that it will accept certain responsibilities and\n- (ii) as a result, the entity has created a valid expectation on the part of those other parties that it will discharge such responsibilities.\n\n## (v) Onerous contracts\n\nA provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected bene/fits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.\n\n## (w)  Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised at its fair value, where there is a reasonable assurance that such grants will be received and compliance with the conditions attached therewith have been met.\n\nGovernment grants related to expenditure on property, plant and equipment are credited to the consolidated statement of profit and loss over the useful lives of qualifying assets or other systematic basis representative of the pattern of ful/filment of obligations associated with the grant received.

This condition is only met when the sale is highly probable and the asset, or disposal group, is available for immediate sale in its present condition and is marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. The Group must also be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classi/fication.\n\nWhere a disposal group represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, or is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, then it is treated as a discontinued operation. The post-tax pro/fit or loss of the discontinued operation together with the gain or loss recognised on its disposal are disclosed as a single amount in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss, with all prior periods being presented on this basis.\n\n## (y) Income taxes\n\nTax expense for the year comprises of current and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on taxable pro/fit for the year. Taxable pro/fit di/ffers from net pro/fit as reported in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted in countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate by the end of the reporting period.\n\nDeferred  tax  is  the  tax  expected  to  be  payable  or recoverable on di/fferences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the /financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable pro/fit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrecognised  for  all  taxable  temporary  differences.  In contrast, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro/fits will be available against which the temporary di/fferences can be utilised.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised on taxable temporary di/fferences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary di/fference and it is probable that the temporary di/fference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that su/fficient taxable pro/fits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets re/flects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying value of its assets and liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are o/ffset to the extent that they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority and they are in the same taxable entity, or a Group of taxable entities where the tax losses of one entity are used to o/ffset the taxable pro/fits of another and there are legally enforceable rights to set o/ff current tax assets and current tax liabilities within that jurisdiction.\n\nCurrent and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss, except when they relate to items credited or debited either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\nDeferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, which is likely to give future economic bene/fits in the form of availability of set off against future income tax liability. MAT is recognised as deferred tax assets in the consolidated balance sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will be realised.",

Delivery occurs when the products have been shipped or delivered to the speci/fic location as the case may be, the risk of loss has been transferred, and either the customer has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, or the Group has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satis/fied. Sale of products include related ancillary services, if any.\n\nGoods are often sold with volume discounts based on aggregate sales over a 12 months period. Revenue from these sales is recognised based on the price speci/fied in the contract, net of the estimated volume discounts. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts, using the most likely method, and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. A liability is recognised for expected volume discounts payable to customers in relation to sales made until the end of the reporting period. No element of /financing is deemed present as the sales are generally made with a credit term of 30-90 days, which is consistent with market practice. Any obligation to provide a refund is recognised as a provision. A receivable is recognised when the goods are delivered as this is the point in time that the consideration is unconditional because only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.\n\nThe Group does not adjust the transaction prices for any time value of money in case of contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer does not exceed one year.\n\n## Sale of power\n\nRevenue from sale of power is recognised when the services are provided to the customer based on approved tariff  rates  established  by  the  respective  regulatory authorities. The Group doesn't recognise revenue and an asset for cost incurred in the past that will be recovered.\n\n## (aa)  Foreign currency transactions and translation\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements of the Group are presented in Indian Rupee ('/uni20B9'), which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the consolidated /financial statements.\n\nIn  preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements, transactions  in  currencies  other  than  the  entity's functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rates prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated.\n\nExchange differences arising on the retranslation or settlement of other monetary items are included in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss for the period.\n\nFor the purpose of presenting the consolidated /financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are expressed in '/uni20B9' using exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange di/fferences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity. On the disposal of a foreign operation, all of the accumulated exchange di/fferences in respect of that operation attributable to the Company are reclassi/fied to the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nGoodwill  and  fair  value  adjustments  arising  on  the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.\n\n## (ab)  Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowings costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for the intended use or sale.",

The impairment charge (net of reversal) for the year is contained within the European and South-east Asian operations.\n\nTata Steel Europe (TSE) is exposed to climate risks through the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) which is applicable to all steel plant within Europe. Further, the Netherlands' government has enacted legislation for a local additional carbon tax (linked to the EU ETS scheme CO 2 allowances and traded prices). Given that most European steel producers have not been heavily a/ffected by CO 2 compliance costs to date, TSE's estimate is that such CO 2 emission costs, Netherland's EU ETS costs and speci/fic carbon tax costs will majorly be passed on to end customers from FY 2025. Further, given the aim to be carbon neutral by 2050, TSE is considering its future strategy on operating processes while continuing to serve its customers. The technology transition and investments will be dependent on national and international policy which is evolving.\n\nConsidering above and consistent with annual test for impairment of goodwill as at March 31, 2022, property, plant and equipment within the Group's European businesses were also tested for impairment at that date where indicators of impairment existed. The outcome of this test indicated that the value in use of the Group's certain CGUs against which property, plant and equipment is included, using a discount rate of 8.40 % p.a. (2020-21: 8.10% p.a.), except in Tata Steel UK Limited where a discount rate of 9.30 % (2020-21: 8.70%) was used, was lower than their carrying value. For the value in use model a Nil growth rate (March 31, 2021: Nil) is used to extrapolate the cash /flow projections beyond the three-year period of the /financial budgets up until the /fifteenth year, at which point a 1.8 % growth rate is used on future cash/flows into perpetuity Accordingly, an impairment charge of /uni20B9 137.28 crore (2020-21: /uni20B91,417.98 crore) has been recognised primarily in relation to the various businesses within European Operations. Out of the total impairment charge, /uni20B9 44.03 crore (2020-21: /uni20B91,300.78 crore) is included in exceptional items and /uni20B9 93.25 crore (2020-21: /uni20B9117.20 crore) is included within other expenses in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2021, the Group has recognised an impairment reversal of /uni20B93.84 crore, in respect of expenditure incurred at one of its mining sites within the Indian operations. The impairment reversed is included within other expenses in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.",

The value in use was computed using cash /flow forecasts based on the most recently approved /financial budgets which cover a period of 5 years and future projections taking the analysis out to the period over which the Group has right to use the underlying assets discounted using a discount rate of 10.00% p.a. The impairment recognised was included in exceptional items in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nThe Group has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment tests of the carrying value in respect of Group's CGUs and property, plant and equipment including sensitivity in respect of discount rate. The management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions used in the value in use calculations would cause the carrying value of property, plant and equipment in any CGU to materially exceed its value in use, other than in respect of the remaining property, plant and equipment at the Strip Products UK business which had a carrying value as at March 31, 2022 of /uni20B9 5,214.15 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B93,654.69 crore) and overseas Canadian mining business which had a carrying value as at March 31, 2022 of /uni20B9 3,537.87 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B95,234.71 crore). For the mining operations in Canada, the value in use is dependent on improvement in commodity prices and realisation of cost savings in operation. A reasonably possible change in any of these key assumptions would increase the likelihood of impairment losses in the future.\n\n- (iv) During the year ended March 31, 2022, other re-classi/fications (net of depreciation and impairment) mainly represents /uni20B9 2,035.12 crore from tangible assets to intangible assets pertaining to the Group's overseas mining operations.\n- (v) The details of property, plant and equipment pledged against borrowings is presented in note 23, page 463.\n\nValue Creation\n\n<!-- image -->",

Post-acquisition, the Group's net debt at a consolidated level had increased considerably.\n\nGiven the Group's strategic priority to deleverage balance sheet consequent to increase in net debt levels ahead of incurring further planned investments in organic growth projects, capital expenditure during last few years have been lower than the original phasing of spend approved by the Board of Directors of the Company. This was further exacerbated by the onset of the COVID19 pandemic towards the close of /financial year 2020, wherein business & supply chain disruptions, health and safety concerns across the globe coupled with travel restrictions globally impacted the pace of project execution over the last 2 years.\n\nFollowing the rebalancing of capital structure post signi/ficant reduction in the debt levels and the Company attaining an investment grade credit rating, the capital allocation for organic growth projects has been increased and the Group expects to commission these facilities in line with their revised completion schedules.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Right-of-use assets (Contd.)\n\n[Item No. I(c), Page 400]\n\n- (ii) The Group's signi/ficant leasing arrangements relate to assets speci/fically set up for dedicated use by the Group under long-term arrangements and time charter of vessels. Other leases include land, o/ffice space, equipment, vehicles and some IT equipment.\n\nLease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of di/fferent terms and conditions. Each lease generally imposes a restriction that, unless there is a contractual right for the Group to sublet the asset to another party, the right-of-use asset can only be used by the Group. Extension and termination options are included in some property and equipment leases. These are used to maximise operational /flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group's operations. Majority of the extension and termination options held are exercisable based on mutual agreement of the Group and the lessors.\n\nWith the exception of short-term leases and leases of low-value underlying assets, each lease is re/flected on the balance sheet as a right- of- use asset and a lease liability. Payments made for short-term leases and leases of low value are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nVariable lease payments which do not depend on an index or a rate (such as lease payments based on a percentage of sales) are excluded from the initial measurement of the lease liability and asset.\n\nFor leases recognised under long-term arrangements involving use of a dedicated asset, non-lease components are excluded based on the underlying contractual terms and conditions. A change in the allocation assumptions may have an impact on the measurement of lease liabilities and the related right-of-use assets.\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2022, the Group has recognised the following in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss:\n\n- (i) expense in respect of short-term leases and leases of low-value assets /uni20B9 25.95 crore (2020-21: /uni20B928.63 crore) and /uni20B9 11.17 crore (2020- 21: /uni20B911.50 crore) respectively.\n- (ii) expense in respect of variable lease payments not included in the measurement of lease liabilities /uni20B9 804.01 crore (2020-21: /uni20B9612.68 crore).\n- (iii) income in respect of sub leases of right-of-use assets /uni20B9 20.10 crore (2020-21: /uni20B946.83 crore).\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2022, total cash out/flow in respect of leases amounted to /uni20B9 2,751.64 crore (2020-21: /uni20B92,571.07 crore).\n\nAs at March 31, 2022, commitments for leases not yet commenced was /uni20B9 231.82 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B9266.57 crore).",

This goodwill relates to expected synergies from combining Corus' activities with those of the Group and to assets, which could not be recognised as separately identi/fiable intangible assets. The goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are any indications that the goodwill may be impaired.\n\nThe recoverable amount of Business Unit IJmuiden CGU has been determined from a value in use calculation. The calculation uses cash /flow forecasts based on the most recently approved /financial budgets and strategic forecasts which cover a period of three years and future projections taking the analysis out to perpetuity based on a steady state, sustainable cash /flow re/flecting average steel industry conditions between successive peaks and troughs of pro/fitability. Key assumptions for the value in use calculation are those regarding expected changes to selling prices, raw material costs, steel demand in European Union, energy costs, exchange rates, and a discount rate of 8.40 % p.a. (March 31, 2021: 8.10% p.a.). Changes in selling prices, raw material costs, exchange rates and steel demand in European Union are based on expectations of future changes in the steel market based on external market sources. In preparing the value in use calculation Tata Steel Europe (TSE) has considered the e/ffect that climate related risks may have on its future cash /flow generation. Included within the cash /flow forecasts are estimates for costs of compliance under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme based on the TSE's estimated shortfall between free allowances under the scheme and actual emissions. The forecasts also consider the ability of the TSE to fully mitigate these costs, primarily through the successful introduction of a CO 2 surcharge which has reduced uncertainty in regards to /fluctuation in CO 2 costs on the pro/fitability of TSE over the 3 year plan period.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Goodwill on consolidation (Contd.)\n\n[Item No. I(d), Page 400]\n\nGiven the uncertainties around decarbonisation, the recoverable amount of Business Unit IJmuiden CGU has also been determined by considering an alternative fair value less costs to sell (FV) model that has been prepared to consider the potential impact of decarbonisation. The model focuses on the two key components of the future cash /flows - the impact on capital expenditure and the impact on EBITDA. The key assumption in the impairment assessment is that decarbonisation will not reduce the pro/fitability of the European steel industry and the transition to carbon free steel would only be feasible if the signi/ficant upfront costs were recovered from either national governments or the market (or a combination of both). The outcome of the fair value model is largely aligned to the value in use model.\n\nFor the value in use model a Nil growth rate (March 31, 2021: Nil) is used to extrapolate the cash /flow projections beyond the three-year period of the /financial budgets up until the /fifteenth year, at which point a 1.8 % growth rate is used on future cash/flows into perpetuity. The pre-tax discount rate is derived from the TSE's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and the WACCs of its main European steel competitors. The outcome of the Group's goodwill impairment test as at March 31, 2022 for BU IJmuiden CGU resulted in no impairment of goodwill (2020-21: Nil).\n\nThe management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions used in the value in use calculation would cause the carrying value of the CGU to materially exceed its value in use.\n\n- (ii) Addition to goodwill during the year ended March 31, 2022 relates to acquisition of Medica TS Hospital Private. Ltd. by the Company and Wire mill business of Usha Martin Limited by Tata Steel Long Products, a subsidiary of the Group. Detailed disclosure is respect of the acquisition is given in note 41, page 494.",

Income tax expenses/(bene/fit)\n\nIndian companies are subject to income tax in India on the basis of their standalone /financial statements. Indian companies can claim tax exemptions/deductions under speci/fic sections of the Income-tax Act, 1961 subject to ful/filment of prescribed conditions as may be applicable. The Company and some of its Indian subsidiaries during the year ended March 31, 2020 have opted for the new tax regime under Section 115BAA of the Act, which provides a domestic company with an option to pay tax at a rate of 22% (e/ffective rate of 25.168%). The lower rate shall be applicable subject to certain conditions, including that the total income should be computed without claiming speci/fic deduction or exemptions.\n\nAs per the tax laws, business loss can be carried forward for a maximum period of eight assessment years immediately succeeding the assessment year to which the loss pertains.\n\nApart from India, major tax jurisdictions for the Group include Singapore, United Kingdom and Netherlands. The number of years that are subject to tax assessments varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.\n\nThe reconciliation of estimated income tax to income tax expense is as below:\n\n|                                                                   |                                                                                                | Year ended   March 31, 2022   | (/uni20B9 crore) Year ended   March 31, 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Pro/fit/(loss) before tax                                         | Pro/fit/(loss) before tax                                                                      | 50,226.87                     | 13,843.69                                      |\n| Income tax expense at tax rates applicable to individual entities | Income tax expense at tax rates applicable to individual entities                              | 12,764.70                     | 3,276.38                                       |\n| (a)                                                               | Additional tax bene/fit for capital investment including research and development expenditures | (0.02)                        | (0.41)                                         |\n|                                                                   | (b)  Income exempt from tax/items not deductible                                               | 575.59                        | (512.21)                                       |\n| (c)                                                               | Undistributed earning of subsidiaries, joint ventures and equity accounted investees           | 54.95                         | 39.94                                          |\n|                                                                   | (d)  Deferred tax assets not recognised because realisation is not probable                    | 436.77                        | 3,194.40                                       |\n| (e)                                                               | Adjustments to taxes in respect of prior periods                                               | (22.84)                       | (11.57)                                        |\n| (f )                                                              | Utilisation/credit of unrecognised tax losses, unabsorbed depreciation and other tax bene/fits | (5,166.91)                    | (176.27)                                       |\n|                                                                   | (g)  Impact of changes in tax rates (i)                                                        | (164.69)                      | (156.36)                                       |\n| Tax expense as reported                                           | Tax expense as reported                                                                        | 8,477.55                      | 5,653.90                                       |",

The principal rights are as follows:\n\n## A. Ordinary Shares of /uni20B910 each\n\n- (i) In respect of every Ordinary Share (whether fully paid or partly paid), voting right and dividend shall be in the same proportion as the capital paid-up on such Ordinary Share bears to the total paid-up Ordinary Capital of the Company.\n- (ii) The dividend proposed by the Board of Directors is subject to the approval of the shareholders in the ensuing Annual General Meeting, except in case of interim dividend.\n- (iii) In  the  event  of  liquidation,  the  shareholders of  Ordinary  Shares  are  eligible  to  receive  the remaining assets of the Company after distribution of  all  preferential  amounts,  in  proportion  to their shareholding.\n\n## B. 'A' Ordinary Shares of /uni20B910 each\n\n- (i)(a)   The holders of 'A' Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to such rights of voting and/or dividend and such other rights as per the terms of the issue of such shares, provided always that:\n- \u00b7 in the case where a resolution is put to vote on a poll, such di/fferential voting entitlement (excluding fractions, if any) will be applicable to holders of 'A' Ordinary Shares.\n- \u00b7 in the case where a resolution is put to vote in the meeting and is to be decided on a show of hands, the holders of 'A' Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to the same number of votes as available to holders of Ordinary Shares.\n- (b) The holders of Ordinary Shares and the holders of 'A' Ordinary Shares shall vote as a single class with respect to all matters submitted for voting by shareholders of the Company and shall exercise such votes in proportion to the voting rights attached to such shares including in relation to any scheme under Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act, 1956.\n\n- (ii) The holders of 'A' Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to dividend on each 'A' Ordinary Share which may be equal to or higher than the amount per Ordinary Share declared by the Board for each Ordinary Share, and as may be speci/fied at the time of the issue. Different series of 'A' Ordinary Shares may carry different entitlements to dividend to the extent permitted under applicable law and as prescribed under the terms applicable to such issue.\n\n## C. Preference Shares\n\nThe Company has two classes of preference shares i.e. Cumulative Redeemable Preference Shares (CRPS) of /uni20B9100 per share and Cumulative Convertible Preference Shares (CCPS) of /uni20B9100 per share.\n\n- (i) Such shares shall confer on the holders thereof, the right to a /fixed preferential dividend from the date of allotment, at a rate as may be determined by the Board at the time of the issue, on the capital for the time being paid-up or credited as paid-up thereon.\n- (ii) Such shares shall rank for capital and dividend (including  all  dividend  undeclared  upto  the commencement of winding up) and for repayment of capital in a winding up, pari passu inter se and in priority to the Ordinary Shares of the Company, but shall not confer any further or other right to participate  either  in  profits  or  assets.  However, in  case  of  CCPS,  such  preferential  rights  shall automatically cease on conversion of these shares into Ordinary Shares.\n- (iii) The holders of such shares shall have the right to receive all notices of general meetings of the Company but shall not confer on the holders thereof the right to vote at any meetings of the Company save to the extent and in the manner provided in the Companies Act, 1956, or any re-enactment thereof.\n- (iv) CCPS shall be converted into Ordinary Shares as per the terms, determined by the Board at the time of issue; as and when converted, such Ordinary Shares shall rank pari passu with the then existing Ordinary Shares of the Company in all respects.",

Employee bene/fits\n\n## A. De/fined contribution plans\n\nThe Group participates in a number of de/fined contribution plans on behalf of relevant personnel. Any expense recognised in relation to these schemes represents the value of contributions payable during the period by the Group at rates speci/fied by the rules of those plans. The only amounts included in the consolidated balance sheet are those relating to the prior months contributions that were not due to be paid until after the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe major de/fined contribution plans operated by the Group are as below:\n\n## (a) Provident fund and pension\n\nThe  Company  and  its  Indian  subsidiaries  provide provident fund bene/fits for eligible employees as per applicable regulations wherein both employees and the Company/Indian subsidiaries make monthly contributions at a speci/fied percentage of the eligible employees' salary. Contributions under such schemes are made either to a provident fund set up as an irrevocable trust by the Company/Indian subsidiaries to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees or to state managed funds.\n\nBene/fits provided under plans wherein contributions are made to state managed funds and the Company/Indian subsidiaries do not have a future obligation to make good short fall if any, are treated as a de/fined contribution plan.\n\n## (b) Superannuation fund\n\nThe Company and some of its Indian subsidiaries have a superannuation plan for the bene/fit of its employees. Employees who are members of the superannuation plan are entitled to bene/fits depending on the years of service and salary drawn.\n\nSeparate irrevocable trusts are maintained for employees covered and entitled to bene/fits. The Company and its Indian subsidiaries contribute up to 15% of the eligible employees' salary or /uni20B91,50,000, whichever is lower, to the trust every year. Such contributions are recognised as an expense as and when incurred. The Company and its Indian subsidiaries do not have any further obligations beyond this contribution.\n\nThe  contributions  recognised  as  an  expense  in  the consolidated statement of profit and loss during the year on account of the above de/fined contribution plans amounted to /uni20B9 1,580.09 crore (2020-21: /uni20B91,553.37 crore).",

A  part  of  the  Company's/Indian  subsidiaries' contribution is transferred to Government administered pension fund. The contributions made by the Company/ Indian subsidiaries and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as an expense in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss under employee bene/fits expense.\n\nIn accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund liabilities of Company and its Indian subsidiaries based on guidance issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, other than the amounts provided during the year in respect of two Indian subsidiaries /uni20B9 15.89 crore (2020-21: ' 19.32 crore), there is no de/ficiency in the interest cost as the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected amount to be credited to the individual members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered provident fund.\n\nKey assumptions used for actuarial valuation are as below:\n\n|                                        | Year ended   March 31, 2022   | Year ended   March 31, 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Discount rate                          | 6.75% - 7.20%                 | 6.50% - 6.80%                 |\n| Guaranteed rate of return              | 8.10%                         | 8.00% - 8.50%                 |\n| Expected rate of return on  investment | 7.50% - 8.10%                 | 7.50 % - 8.00%                |\n\n## (b) Retiring gratuity\n\nThe Company and its Indian subsidiaries have an obligation towards  gratuity,  a  defined  benefit  retirement  plan covering eligible employees. The plan provides for a lumpsum payment to vested employees at retirement, death while in employment or on termination of employment of an amount equivalent to 15 to 30 days salary payable for each completed year of service. Vesting occurs upon\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncompletion of /five years of service. The Company and its Indian subsidiaries make annual contributions to gratuity funds established as trusts or insurance companies. The Company and its Indian subsidiaries accounts for the liability for gratuity bene/fits payable in the future based on a year-end actuarial valuation.\n\n## (c) Post-retirement medical bene/fits\n\nUnder this unfunded scheme, employees of the Company and some of its subsidiaries receive medical bene/fits subject to certain limits on amounts of bene/fits, periods after retirement and types of bene/fits, depending on their grade and location at the time of retirement. Employees separated from the Company and its subsidiaries under an early separation scheme, on medical grounds or due to permanent disablement are also covered under the scheme. The Company and such subsidiaries account for the liability for post-retirement medical scheme based on a year-end actuarial valuation.\n\n## (d) Tata Steel Europe's pension plan\n\nTata  Steel  Europe  (TSE),  a  wholly  owned  indirect subsidiary of the Company, operates a number of de/fined benefit  pension  and  post-retirement  schemes.  The bene/fits o/ffered by these schemes are largely based on pensionable pay and years of service at retirement. With the exception of certain unfunded arrangements, the assets of these schemes are held in administered funds that are legally separated from TSE. For those pension schemes set up under a trust, the trustees are required by law to act in the best interests of the schemes bene/ficiaries in accordance with the scheme rules and relevant pension legislation. The trustees are generally responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund, after consulting with the sponsoring employer.\n\nTSE accounts for all pension and post-retirement de/fined benefit  arrangements  using  Ind  AS  19  'Employee Benefits', with independent actuaries being used to calculate the costs, assets and liabilities to be recognised in relation to these schemes. The present value of the defined  benefit  obligation,  the  current  service  cost and past service costs are calculated by these actuaries using the Projected unit credit method. However, the ongoing funding arrangements of each scheme, in place to meet their long-term pension liabilities, are governed by the individual scheme documentation and national legislation. The accounting and disclosure requirements of Ind AS 19 'Employee bene/fits' do not a/ffect these funding arrangements",

        "page_content": "## NOTES\n\nforming part of the consolidated /financial statements\n\n## 37.  Employee bene/fits (Contd.)\n\nThe British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS) is the legacy de/fined bene/fit pension scheme in the UK and is closed to future accrual. The current Scheme is the successor to the old BSPS which entered a Pension Protection Fund (PPF) assessment period in March 2018. The Scheme currently has around 69,000 members of which 81% are pensioners with bene/fits in payment. The BSPS is sponsored by Tata Steel UK Limited (TSUK). Although TSUK has a legal obligation to fund any future de/ficit, a key condition of the new BSPS going forward was that it was su/fficiently well funded to meet the scheme's modi/fied liabilities on a self-su/fficiency basis with a bu/ffer to cover residual risks. With the assets that it holds, the new scheme is therefore well positioned to pay bene/fits securely on a low risk basis without recourse to TSUK. Pension risks relating to the Scheme include economic risks (such as interest rate risk and in/flation risk), demographic risks (for example members living longer than expected), and legal risks (for example changes in legislation that may increase liabilities). TSUK has worked with the Trustee to develop and implement an Integrated Risk Management ('IRM') framework to manage these risks. The framework provides ongoing monitoring of the key investment, funding and covenant risks facing the scheme and tracks progress against the scheme's journey plan and target. Measures taken by the Trustee to manage risk include the use of asset-liability matching techniques to reduce interest rate risk, and investment in assets that are expected to be correlated to future in/flation in the longer term to mitigate in/flation risk. In particular, the scheme's investment policy has regard for the maturity and nature of the scheme's liabilities and seeks to match a large part of the scheme's liabilities with secure bonds, whilst achieving a higher long-term return on a small proportion of equity and other investments. However, the scheme's interest rate risk is hedged on a long-term funding basis linked to gilts whereas AA corporate bonds are implicit in the Ind AS 19 'Employee Bene/fits' discount rate and so there is some mismatching risk to the TSE /financial statements should yields on gilts and corporate bonds diverge.\n\nThe BSPS Trustee and TSUK have established a framework for  dynamic  de-risking  as  and  when  conditions  are appropriate. The framework provides for the parties to agree to partial buy-in transactions with one or more insurers over a period of time.\n\nIn relation to this, the scheme completed its /first buy-in transaction in respect to a small portion of the overall liabilities during the year. TSUK also remains in ongoing\n\ndiscussions with the BSPS Trustee, on the possibility of entering a buy-in arrangement for some or all of the remaining scheme liabilities.\n\nThe buy-in involved a purchase of annuities with an external insurer with a value of the order of /uni20B94,975.34 crore. Following the buy-in the relevant annuity asset has been valued on an IND AS 19 basis and the corresponding di/fference between the premium paid and the IND AS 19 asset value has been treated as an asset loss through the Other Comprehensive Income.\n\nThe  BSPS  holds  an  anti-embarrassment  interest  in TSUK agreed as part of the Regulated Apportionment Arrangement ('RAA') entered into in 2017. The antiembarrassment interest was initially 33.33% at the time of the RAA but has since been diluted to less than 1% due to successive equity issuances by TSUK to its parent company Corus Group Limited. No value has been included in the BSPS's assets at March 31, 2022 (March 31, 2021: Nil) for its interest in TSUK.\n\nAt March 31, 2022 the new scheme had an Ind AS 19 surplus of /uni20B9 19,504.71 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B918,860.16 crore). TSE has recognised 100% (March 31, 2021: 100%) of the surplus as it has an unconditional right to a refund of the surplus. The new scheme is fully funded on a low-risk technical provisions ('TP') basis and TSUK is working with the Trustee to explore options to increase security for members and to work towards an ultimate winding up of the scheme in which all bene/fits are fully secured with one or more insurance companies. Following the buy-in transaction in the current year TSUK is continuing to investigate with the BSPS Trustee options to further buy-in some or all of the scheme's liabilities with an insurer. TSUK retains the sole power to decide whether to subsequently proceed to wind-up and buy-out liabilities. The Pensions Framework Agreement agreed as part of the RAA stipulates that this can only be achieved if the valuation of the scheme on a 'buyout' basis is either at or above 103%. The 3% excess above full funding would be applied for restoration of an element of member bene/fits foregone as part of the RAA.\n\nEven though the buy-in of a small portion of the scheme liabilities happened during the year, it is considered the chance of achieving the required pricing level is currently not probable, hence no adjustments have been made to the IND AS 19 'Employee Bene/fits' valuation of the BSPS at March 31,  2022 with the assumption of pension payouts being retained at 100%.",

Employee bene/fits (Contd.)\n\nThe March 31,  2021 valuation was agreed between TSUK and the BSPS Trustee on January 21, 2022. This was a surplus of /uni20B94,895.73 crore on a TP (more prudent) basis equating to a funding ratio of 105%. The agreed Schedule of Contributions confirmed that neither ordinary nor de/ficit recovery contributions are due from the TSE.\n\nThe  Framework  Agreement  entered  into  as  part  of the RAA included provisions for a potential additional payment to pensioners with pre 1997 service if the 2021 Actuarial Valuation ('AV') results in an 'unexpected surplus' (calculated using assumptions set out in the Framework Agreement). Following the conclusion of the 2021 AV it has been con/firmed that the conditions for an increase have been met. As such an allowance of /uni20B9577.14 crore has been included in the IND AS 19, March 31, 2022 liability calculation  representing  the  amount  of  the  actual restoration payment due to members in the second half of /financial year 2021-22.\n\nThe weighted average duration of the scheme's liabilities at March 31, 2022 was 13.5 years (March 31, 2021: 14.5 years).\n\n## (e) Other de/fined bene/fits\n\nOther  benefits  provided  under  unfunded  schemes include pension payable to directors on their retirement, farewell gifts, post-retirement lumpsum benefit and reimbursement of packing and transportation charges to the employees based on their last drawn salary.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe de/fined bene/fit plans expose the Group to a number of actuarial risks as below:\n\n- (i) Investment  risk: The present value of the de/fined bene/fit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to government/high quality bond yields. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will create a plan de/ficit.\n- (ii) Interest  risk: A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability. However, this will be partially o/ffset by an increase in the value of plan's debt investments.\n- (iii) Salary  risk: The present value of the de/fined bene/fit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in salary of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.\n- (iv) Longevity risk: The present value of the de/fined bene/fit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.\n- (v) Inflation  risk: Some  of  the  Group's  Pension obligations are linked to in/flation, and higher in/flation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of in/flationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme in/flation.",

The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial funding valuations of the individual pension and post-retirement plans. For the BSPS the liability calculations as at March 31, 2022 use the Self-Administered Pension Schemes 3 (SAPS 3) base tables (2020-21 Self-Administered Pension Schemes 2 (SAPS 2) base tables), S3PMA\\_M/S3PFA/S3DFA with the 2020 CMI projections with a 1.25 % p.a. (2020-21: 1.50% p.a.) long-term trend applied from 2013 to 2021 (adjusted by a multiplier of 1.03 p.a. (2020-21: 1.15 p.a.) for males, 1.03 p.a. (2020-21: 1.21 p.a.) for females and 1.04 p.a. for female dependents (202021: N/A)). In addition, future mortality improvements are allowed for in line with the 2021 CMI Projections with a long-term improvement trend of 1% per annum and a smoothing parameter of 7.0. This indicates that today's 65 year old male member is expected to live on average to approximately 86 years (2020-21: 86 years) of age and a male member reaching age 65 in 15 years' time is then expected to live on average to 87 years (2020-21: 87) of age.\n\n- (iv) Weighted average duration of the pension obligations is 13.5 years (March 31, 2021: 14.5 years).\n- (v) The Group expects to contribute Nil to the plan during the /financial year 2022-23.",

Contingencies\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Group faces claims and assertions by various parties. The Group assesses such  claims  and  assertions  and  monitors  the  legal environment on an on-going basis, with the assistance of external legal counsel, wherever necessary. The Group records a liability for any claims where a potential loss is probable and capable of being estimated and discloses such matters in its consolidated /financial statements, if material. For potential losses that are considered possible, but not probable, the Group provides disclosure in the consolidated /financial statements but does not record a liability in its accounts unless the loss becomes probable.\n\nThe following is a description of claims and assertions where a potential loss is possible, but not probable. The Group believes that none of the contingencies described below would have a material adverse e/ffect on the Group's /financial condition, results of operations or cash /flows.\n\nIt is not practicable for the Group to estimate the timings of the cash out/flows, if any, pending resolution of the respective proceedings. The Group does not expect any reimbursements in respect of the same.\n\n## Litigations\n\nThe Group is involved in legal proceedings, both as plainti/ff and as defendant. There are claims which the Group does not believe to be of a material nature, other than those described below.\n\n## Income tax\n\nThe  Group  has  ongoing  disputes  with  income  tax authorities relating to tax treatment of certain items. These mainly include disallowance of expenses, tax treatment of certain expenses claimed by the Group as deductions and the computation of, or eligibility of the Group's use of certain tax incentives or allowances.\n\nMost  of  these  disputes  and/or  disallowances,  being repetitive in nature, have been raised by the income tax authorities consistently in most of the years.\n\nAs at March 31, 2022, there are matters and/or disputes pending  in  appeal  amounting  to  /uni20B9 3,645.67 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B92,461.62 crore) which includes /uni20B9 10.06 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B98.38 crore) in respect of equity accounted investees.\n\nThe details of signi/ficant demands are as below:\n\n- (a) Interest expenditure on loans taken by the Company for acquisition of a subsidiary has been disallowed in assessments with tax demand raised for /uni20B9 1,641.64 crore (inclusive of interest) (March 31, 2021: /uni20B91,551.10 crore).\n- (b) Interest expenditure on 'Hybrid Perpetual Securities' has been disallowed in assessments with tax demand raised for /uni20B9 484.78 crore (inclusive of interest) (March 31, 2021: /uni20B9170.54 crore)\n\nIn respect of above demands, the Company has deposited an amount of /uni20B9 1,255.63 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B91,250.54 crore) as a precondition for obtaining stay. The Company expects to sustain its position on ultimate resolution of the said appeals.\n\n## Customs, excise duty, service tax and GST\n\nAs at March 31, 2022, there were pending litigation for various matters relating to customs, excise duty, service tax  and  GST  involving  demands  of  /uni20B9 595.52 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B9542.04 crore), which includes /uni20B9 90.83 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B937.32 crore) in respect of equity accounted investees.\n\n## Sales tax /VAT\n\nThe total sales tax demands that are being contested by the Group amounted to /uni20B9 912.85 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B9998.87 crore), which includes /uni20B9 40.74 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B976.33 crore) in respect of equity accounted investees.\n\nThe detail of signi/ficant demand is as below:\n\n- (a) The Company stock transfers its goods manufactured at Jamshedpur works plant to its various depots/ branches located outside the state of Jharkhand across the country and these goods are then sold to various customers outside the states from depots/ branches. As per the erstwhile Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, these transfers of goods to depots/branches were made without payment of Central sales tax and F-Form was submitted in lieu of the stock-transfers made during the period of assessment. The value of these sales was also disclosed in the periodical returns /filed as per the Jharkhand Vat Act, 2005. The Commercial Tax Department has raised demand of Central Sales tax by levying tax on the di/fferences between value of sales outside the states and value of F-Form submitted for stock transfers. The amount involved for various assessment years beginning 20112012 to 2016-2017 as on March 31, 2022 is amounting to /uni20B9 142.00 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B9188.65 crore).",

The Company has not acknowledged this claim and has instead /filed a claim of /uni20B9 141.23 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B9141.23 crore) on the party. The matter is pending before the Calcutta High Court.\n- (b) The  State  Government  of  Odisha  introduced 'Orissa Rural Infrastructure and Socio Economic Development Act, 2004' with e/ffect from February 2005 levying tax on mineral bearing land computed on the basis of value of minerals produced from the mineral bearing land. The Company had /filed a writ petition in the Orissa High Court challenging the validity of the Act. The High Court held in December 2005 that the State does not have authority to levy tax on minerals. The State of Odisha /filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court and the case is pending in Supreme Court.

The Company has /filed a revision petition on November 14, 2013 before the Mines Tribunal, Government of India, Ministry of Mines, New Delhi, challenging the legality and validity of the demand and to grant refund of royalty paid in excess by the Company. Mines Tribunal has granted stay on the total demand with directive to Government of Odisha not to take any coercive action for realisation of this demanded amount.\n\nThe Hon'ble High Court of Orissa, in a similar matter held the circulars based on which demands were\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nraised to be valid. The Company has challenged the judgement of the High Court by a separate petition in the Hon'ble Supreme Court on April 29, 2016.\n\nOn July 16, 2019, the Company has /filed rejoinders to the reply /filed by State of Odisha against the revision petition. The State pressed for rejection of revision applications citing the judgment of the High Court. The Company represented before the authorities and explained that the judgment was passed under a particular set of facts and circumstances which cannot have blanket application on the Company considering the case of the Company is factually different. On August 7, 2019, the Mines Tribunal decided  to  await  the  outcome  of  Special  leave petition pending before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and adjourned the matter.\n\n- Likely demand of royalty on /fines at sized ore rates as on March 31, 2022, is /uni20B9 2,859.97 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B92,207.31 crore).\n- (d) Demand notices were originally issued by the Deputy Director of Mines, Odisha amounting to /uni20B93,827.29 crore  for  excess  production  over  the  quantity permitted under the mining plan, environment clearance  or  consent  to  operate,  pertaining  to 2000-01 to 2009-10. The demand notices have been raised under Section 21(5) of the Mines & Minerals (Development and Regulations) Act, 1957 (MMDR). The Company filed revision petitions before the Mines Tribunal against all such demand notices. Initially, a stay of demands was granted, later by order dated October 12, 2017, the issue has been remanded to the state for reconsideration of the demand in the light of Supreme Court judgement passed on August 2, 2017.\n\nThe  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  pronounced  its judgement in the Common Cause case on August 2,  2017  wherein  it  directed  that  compensation equivalent to the price of mineral extracted in excess of environment clearance or without forest clearance from the forest land be paid.\n\nIn pursuance to the Judgement of Hon'ble Supreme Court, demand/show cause notices amounting to /uni20B93,873.35 crore have been issued during 2017-18 by the Deputy Director of Mines, Odisha and the District Mining O/ffice, Jharkhand.",

Further, the Company has given an undertaking to State Bank of India to intimate them before diluting its shareholding in TBSPL below 50%.\n- During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company after obtaining a 'no objection certi/ficate' from the lenders of TBSPL, has transferred its stake of 50% in TBSPL to its 100% owned subsidiary Tata Steel Downstream Products Limited.\n- (d) The  Company,  as  a  promoter,  has  pledged 4,41,55,800 (March 31, 2021: 4,41,55,800) equity shares  of  Industrial  Energy  Limited  ('IEL')  with Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation Limited ('IDFC'). IEL has repaid the entire loan taken from IDFC in /financial year 2020-21 and the pledge is in the process of being released.\n- (e) The  Group  has  given  guarantees  aggregating /uni20B9 178.40 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B9178.40 crore) details of which are as below:\n- (i) in  favour  of  Commissioner  of  Customs  for /uni20B9 1.07 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B91.07 crore) given on behalf of Timken India Limited in respect of goods imported.\n- (ii) in favour of The President of India for /uni20B9 177.18 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B9177.18 crore) against performance  of  export  obligations  under various bonds executed by a joint venture Jamshedpur  Continuous  Annealing  and Processing Company Private Limited.\n- (iii) in  favour  of  President  of  India  for  /uni20B9 0.15 crore  (March  31,  2021:  /uni20B90.15  crore)  against advance license.\n- a) Odisha Legislative Assembly issued an amendment to Indian Stamp Act, 1889, on May 9, 2013 and inserted a new provision (Section 3A) in respect of stamp duty payable on grant/renewal of mining leases. As per the amended provision, stamp duty is levied equal to 15% of the average royalty that would accrue out of the highest annual extraction of minerals under the approved mining plan multiplied by the period of such mining lease. The Company had /filed a writ petition challenging the constitutionality of the Act on July 5, 2013. The Hon'ble High Court, Cuttack passed an order on July 9, 2013 granting interim stay on the operation of the Amendment Act, 2013. Because of the stay, as on date, the Act is not enforceable and any demand received by the Company is not liable to be proceeded with. Meanwhile, the Company received demand notices for the various mines at Odisha totalling to /uni20B9 5,579.00 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B95,579.00 crore). The Company has concluded that it is remote that the claim will sustain on ultimate resolution of the legal case by the court.\n\nIn April 2015, the Company has received an intimation from  Government  of  Odisha,  granting  extension  of validity period for leases under the MMDR Amendment Act, 2015 up to March 31, 2030 in respect of eight mines and up to March 31, 2020 for two mines subject to execution of supplementary lease deed. Liability has been provided in the books of accounts as on March 31, 2020 as per the existing provisions of the Stamp Act, 1899 and the Company had paid the stamp duty and registration charges totalling /uni20B9413.72 crore for supplementary deed execution in respect of eight mines out of the above mines.\n\n- b) Noamundi Iron Ore Mine of the Company was due for its third renewal with e/ffect from January 1, 2012. The application for renewal was submitted by the Company within the stipulated time, but it remained pending consideration with the State and the mining operations were continued in terms of the prevailing law.\n\nBy a judgement of April 2014 in the case of Goa mines, the Supreme Court took a view that second and subsequent renewal of mining lease can be e/ffected once the State considers the application and decides to renew the mining lease by issuing an express order. State of Jharkhand issued renewal order to the Company on December 31, 2014. The State, however, took a view on an interpretation of Goa judgment that the mining carried out after expiry of the period of second renewal was 'illegal' and hence, issued a demand notice of /uni20B93,568.31 crore being the price of iron\n\n<!-- image -->",

Based on the new Ordinance, Jharkhand Government revised the Express Order on February 12, 2015 for extending the period of lease upto March 31, 2030 with the following terms and conditions:\n\n- \u00b7 value  of  iron  ore  produced  by  alleged  unlawful mining during the period January 1, 2012 to April 20, 2014 for /uni20B92,994.49 crore to be decided on the basis of disposal of our writ petition before Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand.\n- \u00b7 value of iron ore produced from April 21, 2014 to July 17, 2014 amounting to /uni20B9421.83 crore to be paid in maximum 3 instalments.\n- \u00b7 value of iron ore produced from July 18, 2014 to August 31, 2014 i.e. /uni20B9152.00 crore to be paid immediately.\n\nDistrict  Mining  Officer  Chaibasa  on  March  16,  2015 issued a demand notice for payment of /uni20B9421.83 crore in three monthly installments. The Company on March 20, 2015 replied that since the lease has been extended by application of law till March 31, 2030, the above demand is not tenable. The Company has paid /uni20B950.00 crore under protest on July 27, 2015, because the State had stopped issuance of transit permits.\n\nThe Company filed another writ petition before the Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand which was heard on September 9, 2015. An interim order was given by the Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand on September 17, 2015, wherein the Court has directed the Company to pay the amount of /uni20B9371.83 crore in 3 equal instalments, /first instalment by October 15, 2015, second instalment by November 15, 2015 and third instalment by December 15, 2015.\n\nIn view of the interim order of the Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand /uni20B9124.00 crore was paid on September 28, 2015, /uni20B9124.00 crore on November 12, 2015 and /uni20B9123.83 crore on December 14, 2015 under protest.\n\nThe case is pending before the Hon'ble High court for disposal. The State issued similar terms and conditions to other mining lessees in the State rendering the mining as illegal. Based on the Company's assessment of the Goa mines judgement read with the Ordinance issued in the year 2015, the Company believes that it is remote that the demand of the State would sustain.\n\n- (c) The Supreme Court of India vide its order dated September 24, 2014, cancelled the coal blocks allocated to various entities which includes one coal block allocated to the Tata Steel BSL Limited (entity merged with the Company) which  were  under  development.  Subsequently,  the Government of India has issued the Coal Mines (Special Provision) Act 2015, which inter-alia deal with the payment of compensation to the affected parties in regard to investment in coal blocks. The receivable in respect of de-allocated coal block amounts to /uni20B9414.56 crore (net of provision of /uni20B9138.74 crore). The Company has /filed its claim for compensation with the Government of India, Ministry of Coal. Pursuant to letter dated November 22, 2019, Ministry of Coal ('MoC') informed that all statutory license,  consent  approvals,  permission  required  for undertaking of Coal mining operations in New Patrapara Coal Mine now vested to Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. MoC /Union of India, /filed supplementary a/ffidavit dated February 11, 2020 before Delhi High Court vide which it has informed that payment of compensation can be paid to prior allottee after the mine is successfully allotted and compensation is deposited by successful allottee, following the sequence mentioned in section 9  of  Coal  Mine  (Special  Provisions)  Act,  2015.  It  has been informed that New Patrapara Coal Mine has been allocated to Singareni Collieris Company Ltd (SCCL, a state Government Undertaking) and compensation to the prior allottee to be released. MoC vide order dated May 17, 2021 has directed SCCL to pay aforesaid compensation to TSBSL (entity merged with the Company).",

This category consists of investments in quoted equity shares and mutual funds.\n\nValuation techniques with observable inputs (Level 2): This level of hierarchy includes /financial assets and liabilities, measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices). This level of hierarchy includes the Group's over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts.",

Investments in equity and preference shares included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy have been valued using the cost approach to arrive at their fair value. Cost of unquoted equity instruments has been considered as an appropriate estimate of fair value because of a wide range of possible fair value measurements and cost represents the best estimate of fair value within that range.\n- (iv) Fair value of borrowings which have a quoted market price in an active market is based on its market price which is categorised as Level 1. Fair value of borrowings which do not have an active market or are unquoted is estimated by discounting the expected future cash /flows using a discount rate equivalent to the risk-free rate of return adjusted for credit spread considered by lenders for instruments of similar maturities which is categorised as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Some of such arrangements do not qualify for de-recognition due to recourse arrangements being in place. Consequently, the proceeds received from transfer are recorded as short-term borrowings from banks and /financial institutions. As at March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021, there has been no such transfer of trade receivables.\n\n## (e) Financial risk management\n\nIn  the  course  of  its  business,  the  Group  is  exposed primarily to /fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, equity prices, liquidity and credit risk, which may adversely impact the fair value of its /financial instruments.\n\nEntities within the Group have a risk management policy which not only covers the foreign exchange risks but also other risks associated with the /financial assets and liabilities such as interest rate risks and credit risks. The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors of  the  respective  companies.  The  risk  management framework aims to:\n\n- (i) create  a  stable  business  planning  environment by reducing the impact of currency, commodity prices and interest rate /fluctuations on the entity's business plan.\n- (ii) achieve  greater  predictability  to  earnings  by determining the financial value of the expected earnings in advance.\n\n## (i) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings, in realisable fair values or in future cash /flows that may result from a change in the price of a /financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument\n\nmay change as a result of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity price /fluctuations, liquidity and other market changes. Future speci/fic market movements cannot be normally predicted with reasonable accuracy.\n\n## (a) Market risk - Foreign currency exchange rate risk:\n\nThe /fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss and equity, where any transaction  references  more  than  one  currency or where assets/liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective consolidated entities.\n\nConsidering the countries and economic environment in which the Group operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from /fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries. The risks primarily relate to /fluctuations in US Dollar, Great British Pound, Euro, Singapore Dollar and Thai Baht against the respective functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries.\n\nEntities as per their risk management policy, use foreign  exchange  forward  and  other  derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate exposure. Any weakening of the functional  currency  may  impact  the  respective entities' cost of imports and cost of borrowings and consequently may increase the cost of /financing the Group's capital expenditures.\n\nA  10%  appreciation/depreciation  of  foreign currencies with respect to the functional currency of the entities within the Group would result in a decrease/increase in the Group's net pro/fit and equity before considering tax impacts by approximately\n\n<!-- image -->",

Disclosures on /financial instruments (Contd.)\n\n/uni20B9 1,092.32 crore for the year ended March 31, 2022, (2020-21 /uni20B91,191.46 crore).\n\nThe foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by assuming a simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the functional currency of the entities within the Group.\n\nThe  sensitivity  analysis  has  been  based  on  the composition of the Group's financial assets and liabilities as at March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021 excluding trade payables, trade receivables, other derivative and non-derivative /financial instruments not forming part of debt and which do not present a material exposure. The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the period.\n\n## (b) Market risk - Interest rate risk:\n\nInterest rate risk is measured by using the cash /flow sensitivity for changes in variable interest rates. Any movement in the reference rates could have an impact on the Group's cash /flows as well as costs.\n\nThe Group is subject to variable interest rates on some of its interest bearing liabilities. The Group's interest rate exposure is mainly related to debt obligations.\n\nBased on the composition of debt as at March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021 a 100 basis points increase in interest rates would increase the Group's /finance costs  (before  considering  interest  eligible  for capitalisation) and thereby consequently reduce net pro/fit and equity before considering tax impacts by approximately /uni20B9 221.37 crore for the year ended March 31, 2022 (2020-21: /uni20B9420.54 crore).\n\nThe risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves. This calculation also assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet date and has been calculated based on risk exposures outstanding as at that date. The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the period.\n\n## (c) Market risk - Equity price risk:\n\nEquity price risk is related to the change in market reference price of investments in equity securities held by the Group.\n\nThe fair value of quoted investments held by the Group exposes the Group to equity price risks. In  general,  these  investments  are  not  held  for trading purposes.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  quoted  investments  in  equity classi/fied as fair value through other comprehensive income/pro/fit and loss as at March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021 was /uni20B9 1,189.07 crore and /uni20B9544.13 crore respectively.\n\nA 10% change in equity prices of such securities held as at March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021 would result in an impact of /uni20B9 118.91 crore and /uni20B954.41 crore respectively on equity before considering tax impact.\n\n## (ii) Commodity  risk\n\nThe Group makes use of commodity futures contracts and options to manage its purchase price risk for certain commodities. Across the Group, forward purchases are also made of zinc, tin and nickel to cover sales contracts with /fixed metal prices.\n\nThere was no signi/ficant market risk relating to the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss since the majority of commodity derivatives are treated as cash /flow hedges with movements being re/flected in equity and the timing and recognition in the consolidated statement of profit and loss would depend on the point at which the underlying hedged transactions are recognised.\n\n## (iii) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of /financial loss arising from counter-party  failure  to  repay  or  service  debt according to the contractual terms or obligations. Credit risk encompasses both the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of credit worthiness as well as concentration risks.\n\nEntities within the Group have a policy of dealing only with credit worthy counter parties and obtaining su/fficient collateral, where appropriate as a means of mitigating the risk of /financial loss from defaults.\n\nFinancial instruments that are subject to credit risk and concentration thereof principally consist of trade receivables, loans receivables, investments in debt securities and mutual funds, balances with",

None of the /financial instruments of the Group result in material concentration of credit risk.\n\nThe carrying value of financial assets represents the maximum credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk was /uni20B9 33,916.48 crore and /uni20B920,898.34 crore, as at March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021 respectively, being the total carrying value of trade receivables, balances with bank, bank deposits, investments in debt securities and mutual funds, loans, derivative assets and other /financial assets net of insurance cover, wherever applicable.\n\nThe risk relating to trade receivables is presented in note 15, page 447.\n\nThe Group's exposure to customers is diversi/fied and there is no concentration of credit risk with respect to any particular customer as at March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021.\n\nIn  respect  of  financial  guarantees  provided  by the Group to banks and /financial institutions, the maximum exposure which the Group is exposed to is the maximum amount which the Group would have to pay if the guarantee is called upon. Based on the expectation at the end of the reporting period, the Group considers that it is more likely than not that such an amount will not be payable under the guarantees provided.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (iv)  Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group cannot meet  its  financial  obligations.  The  objective  of liquidity risk management is to maintain su/fficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements.\n\nThe  Group  has  obtained  fund  and  non-fund based working capital lines from various banks.

The erstwhile Tata Steel BSL Limited was eligible under Package Scheme of Incentives, 1993, and accordingly as per the provisions of the Scheme it had obtained eligibility certi/ficate from Directorate of Industries. As per the Scheme the Tata Steel BSL Limited has an option to defer the payment of sales tax for a period of fourteen years upto a speci/fied limit (twenty-one years in case the speci/fied limit is not availed in fourteen years). The said tax collected shall be paid after fourteen years in /five annual equal instalments and has been recognised as deferred sales tax liability, which as at March 31, 2022 amounts to /uni20B9 22.33 crore (March 31, 2021: /uni20B920.06 crore). Post-introduction of GST, the Maharashtra government modi/fied the scheme, whereby the Company needs to deposit the GST and claim refund of the same. During the year, the Company has recognised /uni20B9 201.21 crore (2020-21: /uni20B9110.03 crore) as an income (refer note 29, page 472) on account of such scheme.\n- 51. The net worth of TRF Limited (TRF), an associate of the Company, has been fully eroded. The carrying value of the share of investment in consolidated /financial statements is Nil. The /financial statements of TRF have been prepared on a going concern basis as it is transitioning to a sustainable business model whereby going forward it would operate as a captive service provider to the Company. The Company is also expected to provide the necessary /financial support to TRF, if required, to meet its past and future obligations.\n- 52. The Board of Directors in meeting on May 3, 2022 has considered a proposal for sub-division of 1 equity share of the Company having a face value of /uni20B910/- each, into 10 equity shares having face value of /uni20B91/- each subject to regulatory/statutory approvals as may be required and the approval of the shareholders of the Company.\n\n## 53.   Dividend\n\nThe dividend declared by the Company is based on pro/fits available for distribution as reported in the standalone /financial statements of the Company. On May 3, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company have proposed a dividend of /uni20B9 51.00 per Ordinary share of /uni20B910 each and /uni20B9 12.75 per partly paid Ordinary share of /uni20B910 each (paid-up /uni20B92.504 per share) in respect of the year ended March 31, 2022 subject to the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. If approved, the dividend would result in a cash out/flow of approximately /uni20B9 6,227.15 crore.\n\n- 54. Previous year /figures have been recasted/restated wherever necessary including those as required in keeping with revised Schedule III amendments.\n\nValue Creation\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  proposed sub-division of fully paid-up Ordinary (equity) Shares and partly paid-up Ordinary (equity) Shares will not result in any change in the amount of Authorized, Issued, Subscribed and Paid-up Ordinary (equity) Share Capital of the Company.\n\n## The Pre and post Ordinary (equity) Share Capital of the Company will be as under:\n\n| Share Capital         | PRE SUB /hyphen.cap DIVISION No. of shares                                            | Amount   '  In crore)   | POST SUB /hyphen.cap DIVISION No. of shares                                         | Amount   ( '  In crore)   |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| AUTHORIZED            | 175,00,00,000 Ordinary Shares of /uni20B910 each                                      | 1,750.00                | 1750,00,00,000 Ordinary Shares of /uni20B91 each                                    | 1,750.00                  |\n|                       | *35,00,00,000 'A' Ordinary Shares of /uni20B910 each                                  | 350.00                  | *35,00,00,000 'A' Ordinary Shares of /uni20B910 each                                | 350.00                    |\n|                       | *2,50,00,000 Cumulative Redeemable  Preference Shares of /uni20B9100 each             | 250.00                  | *2,50,00,000 Cumulative Redeemable  Preference Shares of /uni20B9100 each           | 250.00                    |\n|                       | *60,00,00,000 Cumulative Convertible  Preference Shares of /uni20B9100 each           | 6,000.00                | *60,00,00,000 Cumulative Convertible  Preference Shares of /uni20B9100 each         | 6,000.00                  |\n| ISSUED                | 122,32,18,367 fully paid-up Ordinary Shares of  /uni20B910 each                       | 1,223.22                | 1223,21,83,670 fully paid-up Ordinary Shares  of /uni20B91 each                     | 1,223.22                  |\n|                       | 2,23, 288 partly paid-up Ordinary Shares of   /uni20B910 each (/uni20B92.504) paid-up | 0.22                    | 22,32,880 partly paid-up Ordinary Shares of   /uni20B91 each (/uni20B90.25) paid-up | 0.22                      |\n| SUBSCRIBED &  PAID-UP | 122,21,22,042 fully paid-up Ordinary Shares of  /uni20B910 each                       | 1,222.12                | 1222,12,20,420 fully paid-up Ordinary Shares  of /uni20B91 each                     | 1,222.12                  |\n|                       | 2,23,288 partly paid-up Ordinary Shares of   /uni20B910 each (/uni20B92.504) paid-up  | 0.05                    | 22,32,880 partly paid-up Ordinary Shares of   /uni20B91 each (/uni20B90.25) paid-up | 0.05                      |\n\nThe sub-division of Ordinary (equity) Shares proposed under Item No. 7 of this Notice shall also require consequential\n\namendments to the existing Clause 5 (Capital Clause) of the Memorandum of Association of the Company and Article",
