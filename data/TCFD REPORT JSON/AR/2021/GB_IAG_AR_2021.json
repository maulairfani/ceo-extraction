Pursuant to this legislation, this Management Report must contain a fair review of the progress of the business and the performance of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces. In the preparation of this report, IAG has taken into consideration the guide published in 2013 by the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) which establishes a number of recommendations for the preparation of management reports of listed companies.\n\nThe Management Report is composed of the following sections:\n\n| 10   | Business model                                  |\n|------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| 18   | Our strategic priorities                        |\n| 22   | Key performance indicators                      |\n| 34   | Financial overview                              |\n| 35   | Financial review                                |\n| 63   | Sustainability                                  |\n|      | 100 Risk management and principal risk  factors |\n| 122  | Regulatory environment                          |\n\nThe Annual Corporate Governance Report is part of this Management Report but has been presented separately.\n\nThis report has been filed with the CNMV, together with the required statistical annex, in accordance with the CNMV Circular 2/2018, dated June 12. The Annual Corporate Governance Report and the statistical annex are also available on the Company's website (www.iairgroup.com).\n\nThe Non-Financial Information Statement in response to the requirements of Law 11/2018, of December 28 (amending the Commercial Code, the revised Capital Companies Law approved by Legislative Royal Decree 1/2010, of July 2, 2010 and Audit Law 22/2015, of July 20, 2015), is part of this Management Report and is available on the Company's website (www.iairgroup.com).",

But often, there doesn't have to be a reason beyond giving our customers the chance to experience new cultures and landscapes.\n\nFlying to places that needed us most\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThroughout the pandemic we operated around 167 repatriation flights from 33 cities across 21 countries to bring our customers home. Each time travel restrictions were eased, we laid on additional flights to more destinations so we could fly passengers where they needed to be.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reconnecting families and friends across the Atlantic\n\nWe were so proud to reunite families and friends following the lifting of the US travel restrictions on November 8, 2021. British Airways operated the first transatlantic flight powered by 35 per cent Sustainable Aviation Fuel. There were emotional scenes in New York as families reunited, with some meeting new family members for the first time after being separated for more than 18 months.",

Iberia gave a new boost to its air shuttle service between Madrid and Barcelona, the most important route for corporate traffic in Spain. Iberia is operating around 68 weekly frequencies on this route, which means up to 11 flights each way from Monday to Thursday, the busiest days. Vueling has also been supporting the recovery of Spanish tourism by increasing its domestic capacity by up to 114 per cent of 2019 levels in the year. The airline operated more than 310 routes, 42 of which were added to its network to support Spanish connections with countries such as Denmark or Sweden.\n\n## Global network that enables businesses to thrive\n\nThe pandemic has shown the importance of meeting people in person. We've played an important role in reconnecting businesses through facilitating face-to-face meetings, flying goods around the world and continuing to keep vital air links open across our extensive global network. We've also made it as simple as possible for our customers to fly with us, through driving changes in technology including digital apps to verify the necessary health and travel documents.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our business model is designed in a way that enables our airlines to perform in/uni00A0the long-term interests of our customers, people, shareholders and/uni00A0society.'\n\nIt is now more than two years since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. These two years have seen our lives change immeasurably. Around the world, people have been forced to respond to the changing environment and find new ways to do things in all aspects of their lives. We have all had to adapt to different ways of working, different ways of maintaining family life and different ways of spending our leisure time. All of these have/uni00A0impacted IAG as an international airline group.\n\nIt has been the most challenging time in our history, particularly for our people. I am proud of the resilience and creativity that they have shown. Despite the difficulties we have faced, it is thanks to their work that we can look to the future with confidence. IAG's strength comes from its people, and I would like to thank them all for the contribution they have made during this time.\n\nMy thanks also go to our shareholders. Their continued support has provided IAG/uni00A0with a strong foundation on which to/uni00A0rebuild the business and reshape it for the/uni00A0future.\n\nOne thing that the pandemic has not changed is IAG's purpose - to connect people, businesses and countries around the world. IAG was created as a unique platform that enables us to fulfil that purpose. Our strategy is to use that platform to deploy our strengths so that we can recover better and stronger than/uni00A0before.\n\nWe know that despite the difficulties faced by everyone over the past two years, the desire to travel and connect in person is as strong as ever. Being unable to see friends, family or business contacts face-to-face has reminded us all how important those bonds are. We saw that as restrictions were lifted throughout the course of 2021 and the pent-up demand was released, particularly once the long-closed North Atlantic travel corridor was re-opened. One could not fail to be moved by the images and stories of families reunited after so long apart, some meeting new family members for the first time. It was a reminder that what we do/uni00A0matters.",

        "page_content": "Our business model therefore is designed in a way that enables our airlines to perform in the long-term interests of our customers, people, shareholders and society. We know that successfully and sustainably delivering for one reinforces our success in delivering for the others.\n\nThe pandemic has proved the strength of our business model, which allows each of our airlines to benefit from our financial scale, while retaining their own agility to evolve and adapt to changing markets. That model is defined by shared capital strength, disciplined allocation of capital and diversification, each of which has served the business well over the past/uni00A0year.\n\nThe diversity of our airlines, ranging from full service to low cost, and their leadership positions in the markets in which they operate, has provided us with the resilience to meet the current challenges head on. Each airline is able to respond to changes in customer demand in its individual market, while being supported by the Group as a whole, which provides the shared best practice, talent and opportunities to collaborate where we can create advantage and value.\n\nThese attributes were front and centre of our operations in 2021. During the year each airline undertook a variety of actions needed to preserve its strengths, while also working closely together to innovate and promote efficiency.\n\nSo, while the impact of the pandemic led to a significant reduction in both revenue and profitability in the year, our platform ensured that we were able to take every opportunity to develop our business in the short term. That means that we remain well positioned to make the most of the recovery and are set up to return to profitability in 2022.\n\nDespite the pandemic, sustainability remains a key priority for IAG. We continue to fiercely pursue our net zero targets and we have made long-term investments to support the development of the emerging technologies that will be required to support our green transition.\n\nAviation may be one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise, but we have a clear plan and roadmap for one of the most pressing challenges facing our planet. We have led the industry in setting ambitious goals for carbon reduction and the adoption of sustainable fuels. In 2019, we became the first airline group worldwide to commit to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. We have since become the first European airline group to commit to powering 10 per cent of its flights by sustainable aviation fuel by 2030. And we/uni00A0are investing in new aircraft that are up/uni00A0to 40 per cent more fuel efficient than those they replace.\n\nWe cannot do this alone. While our airlines are innovating to respond to environmental challenges, we are also working in partnerships with governments, suppliers and other industry stakeholders to accelerate the development of the solutions that we need.\n\nTo be truly sustainable, we must also address societal challenges. We know that diverse teams are more successful and drive effective leadership and decisionmaking. I am pleased that 42 per cent of our Board members are female, but we know there is more to be done to further embed diversity throughout the organisation. Last year, we set a new target of having at least 40 per cent of senior roles held by women.\n\nWe can never be sure exactly what the future holds. The emergence of the Omicron variant affected our path to recovery and there are potential headwinds but I'm confident that we have the right business model and an experienced leadership team to face the challenges ahead. We know COVID-19 will remain part of our lives for years to come, while the changing climate will also affect our industry structurally. Airlines will need capital strength, combined with flexibility and agility to adapt to this new environment. These are all building blocks that IAG possesses.\n\nUse this QR code to watch our Chairman discuss how IAG is delivering on its purpose.\n\nAs people return to the skies, our ambition is to ensure that they do so with one of our airlines. We know our customers have a choice as to who they fly with, and we compete hard to win their trust. But as we compete, we will always think and act for the long term and operate with safety, security and ethical behaviour as our key principles. We will do the right thing to deliver sustainably for our customers, our people and our shareholders, connecting people, businesses and countries and providing the jobs, prosperity and cultural benefits that travel has always created now, and well into the future.\n\n## Javier Ferr\u00e1n\n\nChairman\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2021, we continued to work hard to ensure our business remained resilient in the face of global travel restrictions.\n\nOur people's exceptional work and dedication has been key to weather this crisis.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nClearly our financial performance continued to be severely impacted by travel restrictions worldwide. Throughout the year, individual markets were affected at different times and in different ways.\n\nThe uncertainty caused by the emergence of the Omicron variant in late November affected overall traffic with bookings declining mainly due to tightened entry requirements imposed by some countries. Although demand slowed down for very near-term trips, bookings remained strong for Easter and summer 2022.\n\nPrior to this, longhaul had seen the highest booking activity in October and November at over 80 per cent of 2019 figures. This was better than previously expected driven by the re-opening of the US border to European travellers on 8 November and the strength of longhaul leisure markets.\n\nThe opening of the North Atlantic corridor proved a pivotal moment for our industry and demonstrated that a significant recovery was underway. It was fantastic to see families and friends reunited and business travellers being able to meet face to face after many months of separation. It led to transatlantic bookings reaching nearly 100 per cent of 2019 levels. We expect North Atlantic routes to reach full capacity by summer 2022.\n\nWe started the year flying 19.6 per cent of our 2019 capacity in the first quarter. As pent-up demand was released, both leisure and corporate, we continued to restore capacity across our network. In the fourth quarter we were operating at 58.3 per cent of our pre-pandemic level, in line with previous guidance, while seat load factor was 71.5 per cent compared to 84.3 per cent two years ago. In total, we flew 36.1 per cent of our 2019 capacity in 2021.",

        "page_content": "Our teams across the Group worked hard to take every opportunity to develop our business while capitalising on the surge in bookings when travel restrictions were lifted. Premium leisure performed strongly at both Iberia and British Airways, while we saw early signs of a recovery in business travel from the third quarter and continued into quarter four especially on North Atlantic routes.\n\nAt a Group level, we reported an operating loss of \u20ac2,970 million before exceptional items, an improvement on the \u20ac4,390 million loss recorded in 2020 1 . However, there were significant variances in the performance of our individual airlines, which benefited from the lifting of travel restrictions at different times in their home markets.\n\nThe best performers within the Group were Iberia and Vueling. The third quarter marked an inflection point with Iberia returning to profitability and Vueling reaching breakeven at the operating level. Both have seized opportunities to strengthen their positions in their respective markets 1 .\n\nBritish Airways reduced its operating loss in 2021 and focused on restoring capacity throughout the year.\n\nAer Lingus was the most challenged due to the tougher travel restrictions in Ireland.\n\nOur unique and diversified model has enabled us to make the most of the recovery. For example, IAG Loyalty continued to be profitable and cash generative as it has been throughout the pandemic. New partnerships with Caixabank in Spain and with bp in the UK were successfully launched in 2021. September was the best ever month for customer Avios collection through our non-airline partners while the re-launch of British Airways' co-branded American Express card contributed to there being over 15 per cent more customers with a card than before the pandemic.\n\nDuring the year, as well as weathering this crisis, we have also tried to help wherever we could. We put all our experience, efforts and resources into flying to places that needed us most. We have carried over 20,000 tonnes of PPE and humanitarian aid and delivered millions of doses of\n\nvaccines to almost every corner of the world on a regular basis.\n\nThe decisions that we took on costs and capital have enabled us to retain our financial strength. At the end of the year, our liquidity remained strong at \u20ac11,986 million, as a result of the reduced operating loss and improved forward bookings, together with actions we took to raise debt and facilities. In the third quarter, our operating cash flow significantly improved and was positive for the first time since the start of the pandemic with a further increase in quarter four.\n\nAs we continue rebuilding IAG's financial strength in the coming years, I would like to welcome our new CFO Nicholas Cadbury and look forward to his contribution to our Group. I would also like to thank Steve Gunning for all he has done over the years and during these very challenging times.\n\n## Transforming our business\n\nWe devoted significant efforts during the year to reshaping our business both for the short and long term. Our initial focus was to ensure operational readiness so that we are prepared to return to the skies at short notice once restrictions are eased.\n\nWe have also continued to innovate, developing user-friendly digital solutions to provide the tools and reassurance customers need to travel. These included digital travel passes which can verify testing or vaccines to speed up check-in and boarding, which proved very useful for our customers.\n\nIn parallel, we have been transforming our business to be fit for the long term. Aviation has faced the biggest crisis any of us have seen in our lifetime and we know that in the future our industry will look very different. Transformation is no longer an option, but an imperative.\n\nAt IAG we have been resetting our business to take it to its full potential. This has led to a number of transformation projects that will help us to be stronger after COVID.\n\nAnd all the while we are taking every opportunity to develop the business. Notable among these was our decision to\n\n## \"We have been transforming our business to be fit for the long term.\"\n\nestablish a new competitive shorthaul operation at Gatwick for British Airways, which will begin flights in March 2022. Aer Lingus launched its Manchester subsidiary with flights to New York, Orlando, and Barbados. Vueling expanded its operations at Paris-Orly, introducing dozens of new routes and becoming the second largest operator at the airport. And Iberia reinforced its leadership on routes to Latin America while expanding its US destinations with the addition of Dallas and Washington from April 2022. We have also developed a new approach to aircraft maintenance by bringing together the best of Iberia and Vueling to maximise synergies at El Prat Airport.\n\nThese are great examples of the strengths\n\ndelivered by our unique model: collaboration between our airlines, shared capital strength and creation of synergies while retaining the agility to be innovative.\n\n## Sustainable value creation\n\nOur ambition is to create sustainable value and to deliver for all our stakeholders. This starts with our employees. We want to foster a culture in which all our people feel valued. This means a focus not just on diversity but also inclusion. This allows us to be a place where everyone's talents are nurtured, where skills and capabilities are developed, and where the leaders of the future are created. The jobs we create are part of the economic contribution that we make to society and to local communities.\n\nIn all our operations, we seek to be an active partner for positive change, recognising, managing and reducing our impact on the planet. We are determined to meet our climate commitments.",

We are setting ourselves demanding targets to drive the systemwide change that is needed to tackle climate change.\n\nWe have a clear roadmap to achieve these targets spanning a wide range of initiatives including investment in new fleet, operational efficiency, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), new technologies and carbon removal. SAF is an important tool in decarbonising aviation and we have been leading its use by partnering with emerging sustainable fuel technology companies such as LanzaJet, Velocys and Phillips 66.  British Airways operated the first commercial transatlantic flight powered by 35 per cent SAF while Iberia and Vueling were pioneers in Spain. We have pledged to invest $400 million over the next 20 years to support the development of SAF.\n\nHowever, to scale up the production of sustainable aviation fuels government support is critical in attracting the necessary investment to construct the plants needed to deliver enough supply for the whole industry. This requires all of us to work together. The whole ecosystem needs to work as one. Aircraft manufacturers, start-ups, suppliers and governments must come together to make a lasting difference to the world.\n\nWe're also investing in new technologies. So far, through our core innovation platform Hangar 51, we have supported 60 start-ups and invested in over 10 tech players. Many of these are helping to make aviation greener, including ZeroAvia which is working on the world's first hydrogen powered plane.\n\nIt is through these partnerships and collaborations with the wider aerospace industry including our peers, suppliers and policymakers, that we will transform our industry to meet the climate challenge.\n\n## \"We were the first airline group worldwide to commit to achieving net zero emissions by/uni00A02050.\"\n\nWe're pleased that our work tackling climate change continues to be recognised as industry-leading. For the second year running, IAG was the only European airline to receive a Leadership grade (A-) from the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). This puts us in the top 6 per cent among nearly 12,000 global companies assessed in 2021. We also received the joint-highest score of any airline from the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) which assesses companies' readiness to transition to a low carbon economy.\n\nDespite the crisis, we remain resolute in our climate commitments and have taken steps to create a truly sustainable business. I would like to thank our people across the Group for their remarkable commitment during these difficult times. Through hard work, we have demonstrated our resilience and innovation, and we are on track to return to sustainable profitability in 2022 and beyond.\n\nWe are building a better and more competitive business for the long term and one that is well placed to seize the opportunities that the future holds.\n\n## Luis Gallego\n\nGroup Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUse this QR code to watch our CEO discuss how IAG is transforming to achieve its full potential",

During this time, the Group's portfolio of brands continued to support the wider community in tackling its impacts, with the operating companies supporting local communities with charitable work and flying critical equipment and essential medical supplies across the world. The different brands continued to implement measures aimed at enhancing safety on board and reducing the complexity of vaccination and testing documentation and check-in processes. British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus partnered with the VeriFLY app and, along with Vueling, have been trialling the IATA Travel Pass, allowing customers to easily upload and verify COVID-19 documentation before their flights and reducing journey times at the airport. Our operating companies have additionally made other digital solutions available to increase customer confidence and reduce journey times, such as 'Digital Heatmaps' showing the status of travel restrictions and requirements by destination.\n\nThe operating companies implemented agile approaches to aircraft deployment, optimising and adapting their networks to changes in travel restrictions, whilst ensuring we maintain our presence in our priority markets and keep offering an unrivalled proposition to our customers. British Airways continued to roll out its newest business cabin seat Club Suite in its Boeing 777 fleet, and committed in October to operate all future flights to JFK exclusively with aircraft featuring this new product, reflecting the strategic importance the North Atlantic market has for the airline. This year Iberia celebrated its 75 th anniversary of flights to Latin America, where it operated a relatively high level of capacity in 2021, announcing an increased winter schedule to the region compared to last year and providing more choice to customers.\n\n## Our priorities for 2022\n\nWhilist the Group will continue its leading work on safety, we will also ensure our businesses can deliver an unrivalled customer proposition that adapts to meet changing customer expectations in the context of air travel recovery after two years of border closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. IAG will continue to ensure competitiveness in its chosen priority customer demand spaces, evolving the operating companies' products and services to best deliver against the needs of their customers. Strong emphasis will continue to be placed on digitalisation, including further customer-focused improvements to the digital experience.\n\nIAG Loyalty has significantly enhanced Avios redemptions to give our airlines' loyalty programme members more choice, for example doubling the number of Guaranteed Avios Reward Seats on British Airways and Iberia flights.",

In October, Aer Lingus launched a new base at Manchester Airport to offer transatlantic services from the UK, a strategic base for the Irish airline that will have a largely variable cost base. Vueling was granted 18 daily slot pairs at Paris-Orly airport that will be transferred from Air France, which will help strengthen Vueling's pan-European network in one of the continent's largest markets. British Airways announced in December the launch of its new subsidiary, BA Euroflyer, which will operate shorthaul services at Gatwick Airport under the British Airways brand. The company will restart shorthaul services at Gatwick in summer 2022 after a break of almost two years and will provide customers with access to a premium service at competitive prices.\n\nIAG's airlines have continued to strengthen their relationships with partners. For example, Alaska Airlines joined the one world alliance in March 2021, and launched a codeshare agreement with Iberia and LEVEL later in the year. British Airways also extended the number of codeshare routes with the Seattle-based airline, whilst Aer Lingus continued its frequent flyer collaboration. IAG has also further developed its partnerships with Atlantic Joint Business members American Airlines and Finnair, particularly with the continued integration of Aer Lingus into the Joint Business. The Group continued to expand its relationship with Qatar Airways, which extended its codeshare agreement with Iberia early in the year, and jointly with British Airways announced plans to expand their Joint Business to offer customers access to a greater choice of destinations and route options. Vueling took important action in the partnership space by leveraging its digital versatility and launching a global interlining platform, 'Vueling Global', to increase connections between the airline and its partners and expand its customer offering. In 2019, the Group announced plans to acquire Air Europa, which is owned by Globalia, subject to regulatory approvals. In December 2021, IAG and Globalia announced the termination of the agreement under which Iberia had agreed to acquire Air Europa, but noted that the parties intended to evaluate alternative structures. Any future deal would be subject to regulatory approval.\n\n## Our priorities for 2022\n\nIn 2022, the Group will aim to maintain and bolster its leadership positions in its home cities and priority markets. As and when the global aviation industry recovers from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, IAG will progress investment in valueaccretive organic and inorganic growth opportunities. IAG will continue to progress the integration of Aer Lingus into the Atlantic Joint Business. In addition, the Group will continue to leverage its other joint businesses, alliances and partnerships and, where appropriate, form new joint businesses or participate in the industry's consolidation process by entering into value-accretive merger and acquisition (M&A) deals.",

Despite the pandemic causing capacity levels to remain depressed throughout 2021, particularly during the first half of the year, IAG has proved the Group has a resilient business model, being able to reduce its cost base and adapt to the circumstances, leveraging its common integrated platform to generate additional revenue.\n\nIAG's airlines embarked on transforming their businesses to emerge from the crisis in a more efficient shape as the recovery from COVID-19 continues, reducing their costs and capturing new opportunities where available. All the airlines took action to restructure their cost bases, structurally changing and renegotiating handling, maintenance and other supplier arrangements in coordination with the IAG GBS procurement team and maximising the use of furlough and wage support schemes where possible. As an example, Vueling has transitioned to a new handling and maintenance model, including launching a joint venture for line maintenance with provider Nayak.\n\nIAG Cargo has experienced ongoing demand for its services in 2021, contributing additional revenue to the Group with an increased schedule compared to last year, co-sponsoring flights with the passenger airline businesses and operating a high level of cargo-only/uni00A0flights. The cargo segment has/uni00A0also/uni00A0arranged large charter programmes with strategic customers, considerably supporting the Group's cash/uni00A0generation.\n\nIAG Loyalty has also been key in supporting IAG's revenues during the crisis and has been profitable in 2021 due to a high level of spend and Avios collection through our non-airline partners. The loyalty segment expanded its partnership portfolio by successfully launching new agreements with Barclays Premier, Sainsbury's/Nectar, Santander and bp, as well as a new co-branded credit card with Vueling and CaixaBank in Spain.\n\n## Our priorities for 2022\n\nIn 2022, IAG will continue to focus on delivering the transformation plans for its different business segments, which will ensure they remain competitive as the recovery from COVID-19 continues. IAG will also keep investing in enhancing its common integrated platform, to provide quality services and solutions across the Group at faster pace and lower unit cost, and continue to support its operating companies to accelerate their digital transformations, which will be critical as the Group recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIAG Tech continued its focus on enhancing new technology capabilities across the Group, including improvement to the operating companies' loyalty platforms, changes to the platforms and systems to allow for frictionless travel (e.g. health passports), and enhancement to disruption and self-service management solutions for customers. Furthermore, IAG Tech delivered initiatives to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency through process automation.",

We use this indicator to measure the efficiency and profitability of our business and the financial performance of the individual operating companies within the Group.\n\n## Performance\n\nThe Group's operating margin improved 20.7 points to -35.1 per cent. Total revenue before/uni00A0exceptional items was up 7.4 per cent as restrictions eased in the second half of the year and passenger volumes increased. Cargo revenue was at a record high of \u20ac1,673 million due to the operation of 3,788 cargo-only and charter flights and strong yields.\n\nCosts benefitted from the initiatives implemented in 2020 and 2021 to reduce spend and increase cost variability.\n\n## Definition and purpose\n\nCapacity in the airline industry is measured in Available Seat Kilometres (ASKs) which is the number/uni00A0of seats available for sale multiplied by the/uni00A0distance flown.\n\n## Performance\n\nIAG's capacity was up 7.7 per cent versus 2020 and down 63.9 per cent versus 2019 as operations continued to be impacted by global travel restrictions. The easing of restrictions over the year meant last/uni00A0quarter capacity reached 58.3 per cent of 2019 operations compared with only 19.6 per cent in/uni00A0the first quarter.\n\nThe operating companies have the/uni00A0flexibility within fleet and operational plans to be able to/uni00A0adapt capacity and can react quickly to changes in demand and/uni00A0restrictions as necessary.\n\n## Definition and purpose\n\nGross CAPEX (capital expenditure) is the total investment in/uni00A0fleet, customer product, IT and infrastructure (including leased right of use assets) before any proceeds from the sale of property, plant and/uni00A0equipment.\n\nWe track the planned capital expenditure through our business planning cycle to ensure it is in line with achieving our other financial/uni00A0targets.\n\n## Performance\n\nGross capex for 2021 totalled \u20ac0.7 billion, which is significantly lower than the planned spend announced in 2019 of \u20ac4.3 billion, reflecting the agreements with Boeing and Airbus to defer fleet deliveries and pre-delivery payments. During the year 11 aircraft were delivered, of which six were direct leases and therefore not included in capital expenditure. In/uni00A02021, spend on property, IT and other reflected the investment needed to maintain core IT infrastructure and cyber projects.\n\nCapacity change (% ASKs)\n\nGross CAPEX (\u20acm) 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is used, in conjunction with leverage (measured as net debt to EBITDA), to measure the underlying cash generation of the business.\n\n## Performance\n\nThe Group's levered free cash flow for 2021 was/uni00A0\u20ac1,822 million, \u20ac4.9 billion higher than 2020, due mainly to an increase in net non-aircraft related borrowing of \u20ac4.1 billion and the operating loss before exceptional items being \u20ac1.4 billion lower than in 2020.\n\n## Definition and purpose\n\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) represents the diluted earnings for the/uni00A0year before exceptional items attributable to ordinary\n\nshareholders.

The effect of the assumed conversion of the IAG \u20ac500 million convertible bond 2022, the IAG \u20ac825 million convertible bond 2028 and outstanding employee share schemes is antidilutive for the year due to the reported loss after tax for the period, and therefore has not been included in the diluted earnings per share calculation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlternative performance measure\n\nMeasure linked to remuneration of Management Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLink to our strategic objectives\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNet debt to EBITDA 1 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 For further detail refer to the Alternative performance measures section of the financial statements.

This is divided by EBITDA 4 .\n\nIAG uses this measure to monitor leverage, to assess financial headroom.\n\n## Performance\n\nThe Group's leverage remained negative in 2021 at 11.5 times. Net debt rose by \u20ac1.9 billion, driven primarily by negative EBITDA of \u20ac1.0 billion and capital expenditure of \u20ac0.7 billion, together with the revaluation of US dollar debt. In the year, the Group drew debt facilities agreed in 2020, namely a \u00a32.0 billion Export Development Guarantee (EDG) term loan for British Airways from UK Export Finance and \u20ac75 million for Aer Lingus from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund. IAG closed a dual-tranche senior unsecured bond issuance in March, raising \u20ac1.2 billion, with \u20ac500 million maturing in 2025 and \u20ac700 million maturing in 2029. In May, IAG raised \u20ac825 million by issuing a convertible bond, maturing in 2028.\n\n## Definition and purpose\n\nAt IAG a transactional NPS is measured: customers respond about their likelihood of recommending an IAG operating carrier no more than seven days after taking a flight. Including NPS targets in the Group's employee bonus scheme has driven a stronger focus on improving the customer experience which, together with customer advocacy drives competitive advantage, leading to faster organic growth.\n\n## Performance\n\nIn 2021 IAG's NPS decreased 4.5/uni00A0points versus 2020. However, the score remained significantly above 2019 levels. While this result represents high levels of customer satisfaction across all IAG airlines, this score must be viewed in the context of the pandemic.\n\nThe appearance of new COVID strains and the further restrictive measures imposed by some governments including lockdowns, quarantines or testing requirements, have impacted the flying experience negatively versus the positive experience for/uni00A0those few who did fly in 2020. Increased volatility in the flying schedule throughout 2021 heightened stress for customers, as did longer queues at the airports due to ever-changing documentation requirements, and the continued suspension of/uni00A0certain products such as the delivery of full premium services.\n\nNet Promoter Score (NPS)\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group is dependent on external funding to meet these capital expenditure commitments, to be able to replace or grow our fleet at the rate required to deliver our strategy and business plan.\n- \u00b7  Provision of efficient external capital allows us to fund our operations and invest in our asset base in a cost-effective manner, supporting the delivery of our business plan and the Group's strategy.\n- \u00b7  Their views are critical in supporting the Group to formulate its strategy, which drives operational and financial performance in order to generate and optimise returns in a sustainable way.\n- \u00b7  The availability of external capital has shaped the Group's decisions through the pandemic as liquidity has been a key consideration. The ability to access external capital on competitive terms has influenced recovery plans and the financial strength and positioning of the Group and its operating companies.\n\n## Fit in our business model and strategy\n\n- \u00b7  Our suppliers are fundamental to ensuring our companies meet the high standards that customers and other key stakeholders expect. Any deviation from our expected standards could impact on the Group's operational and financial performance as well as disrupting our customers, leading to significant reputational damage for the operating company and the Group.\n- \u00b7  It remains the case that the airlines' operations are dependent on a number of suppliers to ensure reliable performance and efficiency of the operation.\n- \u00b7  Supply chain integrity remains critical to our business as we rely on our suppliers to help meet our customers' needs, ensure the reliability of our services and support IAG's sustainability agenda.\n- \u00b7  The Group has several internal and external measures in place to ensure supply chain resilience.  We actively monitor potential supplier risks and/or changes to relevant markets to ensure a continued robust supply chain.\n\n## Fit in our business model and strategy\n\n- \u00b7  Very many aspects of IAG's business are affected by government policy and decision making, since the aviation industry is a strategic industry in the eyes of policy makers. Public policies, regulations and political decisions condition IAG's strategy, performance and even our customers' experience.\n- \u00b7  Essential requirements for safety and security of operations are the highest priority of IAG's operating companies but are also subject to regulatory oversight by national authorities, requiring on going compliance.\n- \u00b7  International air services are still governed by treaties agreed between states. These include provisions to determine market access and often regulate frequency and capacity, which is essential to our business.\n- \u00b7  These and other aviation policy issues mean that IAG must engage with policy makers, elected representatives, government bodies and specialist aviation, economic and competition regulators since the rules they establish and decisions they take directly affect our operations and commercial practices.\n\n## Key topics/interests\n\n- \u00b7  Government restrictions on travel demand\n- \u00b7  Prospects of demand recovery and plans to restore capacity\n- \u00b7  Cost restructuring\n- \u00b7  Cash flows, funding sources and liquidity\n- \u00b7  Short-term outlook for capacity and operating profitability\n- \u00b7  Environmental, social and governance performance, including climate change initiatives\n- \u00b7  Known capital spending and debt repayment commitments\n\n## Key topics/interests\n\n- \u00b7  COVID-19 impact\n- \u00b7  Fair engagement with suppliers\n- \u00b7  Compliance with regulations\n- \u00b7  Responsible and robust supply chain\n- \u00b7  Inflation challenges\n- \u00b7  Global supply chain issues\n- \u00b7  Sustainability, with a focus on delivering upon the Group's Scope 3 commitments\n\n## Key topics/interests\n\n- \u00b7  Safety and security, including COVID-19 related measures\n- \u00b7  Travel and quarantine restrictions\n- \u00b7  Consumer rights\n- \u00b7  Sustainability, including climate change\n- \u00b7  Diversity and inclusion\n- \u00b7  International relations including air service agreements\n- \u00b7  Infrastructure regulation including airspace modernisation and airport charges",

Our customers travel with or connect through our portfolio of IAG brands, which are based in the UK, Spain and Ireland, our home countries and where an important number of our passengers start their trips.\n\nThe different passenger segments include\n\nleisure, VFF (visiting friends and family) and business passengers (travelling on their own) and corporate accounts. Additionally, customers from our Loyalty programmes are fundamental to us and key to our success. Last but not least, some of the world's best-known brands trust us to transport their valued cargo, whatever form this might take.\n\nAnother key stakeholder that is connected to our customers is our employees, either if they directly interact with our customers or those indirectly involved, they are key to support and provide our customers the best service, as well as being responsible for resolving any customer complaints or claims through our customer relations teams.  In addition to this, those employees with a day-to-day interaction with our customers represent our Group and their respective companies' culture and identity in front of them. Having an engaged workforce is key to the Group from a customer experience point of view. Suppliers are another stakeholder group that is relevant to customers, as a timely and safe procurement of aircraft and introduction of different products is key to our customer proposition.\n\n## How we engage\n\n- \u00b7  Every day, we send the 'Voice of Customer' survey to our passengers, designed to collect our customers feedback on their experience. It helps us understand key pain points throughout their journeys and to inform our product and service strategy decisions.\n- \u00b7  We conduct brand surveys to help us understand the needs and expectations of different customer types and meet those specific requirements through our diverse portfolio of brands.\n- \u00b7  We provide different channels for our customers to raise claims and complaints, and closely monitor these to accommodate our customers and take action where necessary.\n\n- \u00b7  We offer Contact Centre services and have developed other digital channels such as Chat bots in our websites or Whatsapp 24/7 to ensure that customers can reach out to us whenever they need to, and we constantly enhance them so that their experience is best in class. However, COVID-19 has hugely increased pressure in our call centres, especially regarding date changes and voucher requests. This has made it very challenging for us to deliver the 'best in class' experience that we aimed for, and while the experience has improved throughout the year, it will continue to be a key focus for 2022.\n- \u00b7  We keep our customers informed of the latest changes in our service, product enhancements or any other relevant information through various channels, including our websites, e-mail and our very dynamic social media accounts.\n- \u00b7  Our customers receive guidance and a high standard of customer care throughout their journey from our distinguished on-board and airport colleagues.\n\n## Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the relationship between our operating companies and customers has become stronger than ever. Because of the increased uncertainty around the ability to fly to some destinations, as well as the ever-changing restrictions and requirements to fly, our customers rely more than ever on our guidance.  As a result of this, one of our main priorities throughout the past year has been on reassuring customers throughout their whole journey. The airlines have launched different initiatives for doing that, such as increasing the level of communication to customers, from communications prior to flying (website instructions, emails to customers) or even announcements made by pilots in the cabin.\n\nIn addition to this, and as we experienced in 2020, the COVID-19 environment and travel restrictions have distorted our performance metrics, in particular NPS. As was the case in 2020, in 2021 IAG's NPS remained significantly above 2019 levels. While this result represents high levels of customer satisfaction across all IAG airlines, this score must be viewed in the context of the pandemic, as customer expectations and the flying experience have remained altered throughout 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring 2021, the flying experience has continued to be impacted by restrictive measures imposed by some governments including lockdowns, quarantines or testing requirements. These circumstances entailed volatility in the flying schedule, changes in documentation requirements, with resulting increased stress for customers, and longer queues at the airports, and finally, the continued suspension of certain products such as the delivery of full premium services (full meal service, hot towel).  We had to respond and adapt our services to this situation, introducing measures to reassure our customers and improve our services to the extent possible. Some examples are implementation of documentation verification apps, specific check-in and arrivals procedures, or initiatives aimed at further digitalising the journey. The customer response to these measures in our surveys, as reflected in the NPS performance, has been very positive.\n\n## For further detail see Our strategic priorities section.\n\nIAG Cargo continued to align its network to customer demand, supporting customers with cargo-led flying, increasing frequencies on important trade routes and implementing an active charter programme. IAG Cargo also moved large volumes of what are typically seen as non-airfreight commodities as shippers favoured shorter delivery times and volumes shifted from sea to air against a background of supply chain disruption, port congestion and low inventories.",

Some examples of it are:\n\n- \u00b7  Different initiatives aimed at further digitalising the way customers make and manage their trips. For example, in relation to document verification, which was especially challenging for customers throughout the year due to ever-changing documentation requirements. All our airlines either developed their own solutions to verify documentation or signed up to existing ones, including Verifly and IATA travel pass.\n- \u00b7  In addition to digitising the way customers can manage their trips, we are also digitising our business. Leveraging digital solutions is a key area of advancement and continued focus for all our airlines. Examples include transitioning our CRM to Salesforce, implementing a lounge food ordering system, launching the first European fully biometric airport journey, introducing new providers of our call centres, and developing inflight pre-order solutions.\n- \u00b7  In 2021, we launched new training methods coupled with a long-term training plan for all customer-facing staff and their management teams.\n- \u00b7  Some of our airline brands developed new culinary proposition across all cabins as well as introduced new pre-order solutions for some cabins.\n- \u00b7  Some airlines also looked at improving their Lounges experience through the creation of new and exciting partnerships.\n- \u00b7  We also finished the roll out of the new initiatives that were put on hold due to COVID-19.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIAG employs around 55 thousand people across our portfolio of airlines and platform businesses. The majority of our staff directly support customers with cabin crews and pilots making up 46 per cent of our workforce, and airport and maintenance teams representing a further 35 per cent. IAG staff are based throughout the world, with the highest concentration in our major hubs in the UK, Ireland and Spain.\n\n## How we engage\n\n- \u00b7  Each company in the Group has its own communication channels adapted to its culture and profile. In general terms, communication with employees is made using formal and informal channels, which include performance reviews, specific consultations, employee forums, internal social networks, local cascade meetings, newsletters, workshops, engagement surveys and confidential and independent Speak Up channels. These channels have been critical to ensure we understand what matters to colleagues and to ensure they understand and can access the support available to them. We have continued to tailor our approach throughout the year to reflect the travel and working restrictions in place.\n- \u00b7  IAG operates a number of employee-led network groups which provide peer support and help us understand the experiences and challenges faced by colleagues, enabling the Group to take action to make our business more inclusive.\n- \u00b7  Collective bargaining arrangements are in place for 89 per cent of our workforce. In addition, IAG has a European Works Council (EWC) which brings together representatives from the different European Economic Area (EEA) countries in which the Group operates. EWC representatives are informed about and, where appropriate, consulted on transnational matters which may impact employees in two or more EEA countries. Reflecting the changing geopolitical landscape and the specific role of the EWC to manage transnational issues for EEA Member States, the UK will cease to have representatives within the EWC, and we will continue to engage with UK employee representative groups on matters relevant to them through existing national channels. The EWC election and appointment process for the new Select Committee and Chair will be completed in early 2022.\n- \u00b7  Each operating company undertakes engagement surveys, at least annually, across its full workforce, and this year, in addition, IAG undertook an organisational health survey with managers across the Group to benchmark our working practices against world class companies. These surveys have helped management teams to refresh their people strategies and to adapt processes and policies to best support colleagues.",

Throughout the pandemic, we have had to react to changing regulations and travel restrictions and implement changes to policies and ways of working at breakneck speed, and we have relied on our colleagues to keep our customers and each other safe and to continue to deliver the best customer experience possible.\n\nOur colleagues have experienced the personal impact of the pandemic in terms of their roles, through both voluntary and agreed changes to terms and conditions and through participation in furlough and job protection schemes. Further, colleagues have seen significant change in the composition and structure of our workforce, as we have taken the necessary steps to protect cash and remain competitive. At all times we have strived to be open and transparent about these changes, consult with colleagues and employee representatives, and to support colleagues with a focus on physical and mental wellbeing.\n\nAt IAG, we hold ambition, teamwork, pragmatism, efficiency and responsibility as key values that enable us to fulfil our purpose and colleagues have consistently demonstrated these values in responding to the various challenges that they have been faced with across the year.\n\nWe recognise the critical role that colleagues will play in the recovery and transformation of IAG and are constantly looking at how we support them and to create a diverse and inclusive culture.  In 2021, we refreshed our diversity and inclusion strategy, introducing a new integrated framework to assess the sufficiency of our plans and to support operating companies with setting priorities. We are proud of the progress we have made to make IAG more diverse and inclusive but know we have further to go to achieve our ambition. We also recognise the impact of the pandemic in terms of workforce composition and gender pay, reflecting both the temporary and structural changes across the Group.\n\nAs we emerge from the pandemic, we are seeing resourcing demands increase and recruitment recommencing in a number of areas. IAG's unique operating model provides fantastic opportunities for career development and progression and we are building on our strengths in this regard with a more rigorous and structured approach to talent management and succession planning and to ensure we retain key talent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Results from the engagement with our employees\n\nWe use a range of channels to understand what matters to our colleagues and to help us improve our people policies. Each operating company runs regular engagement surveys and last year we introduced an organisational health survey to better understand colleagues' experiences and perceptions.\n\nBased on feedback from colleagues we have taken action to review and update our parental leave policies, making them more progressive, inclusive and supportive. We are also working hard to ensure that career opportunities in each of our operating units are more visible across the Group.\n\nWe have invested in the right channels for communication and information to improve advocacy and engagement and ensure information is available on a range of employee related issues. Whilst the strength of our brands and career opportunities at IAG is compelling in the recruitment market, we have faced challenges in attracting and retaining talent for some critical roles given the uncertainty and perceived risks in aviation relative to other sectors less impacted by the pandemic",

As a company listed on two of the largest stock markets in the world, IAG has investors from all around the world as well as from its major markets.\n\nThe Group has a wide range of shareholders. The largest shareholder is Qatar Airways with a 25.1 per cent holding acquired between 2015 and 2020. Other shareholders comprise individual retail investors, institutional investors and the Spanish state holding company, Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (SEPI), which has a 2.5 per cent shareholding. Apart from Qatar Airways, most shareholders are located in Europe, mainly in Spain and the United Kingdom, and in the United States.\n\nTo fund investment and capital expenditure commitments, in addition to equity, the Group requires access to debt capital markets.  This has been particularly relevant during the pandemic and has resulted in the Group currently having significant financial leverage. We have raised debt liabilities in a range of markets using different structures including, but not limited to, senior unsecured bonds, convertible bonds, secured bonds, private placements, finance leases, mortgage loans and operating lease arrangements. The providers of debt capital span commercial and investment banks, institutional investors and aircraft lessors. The providers of capital are geographically diverse as the Group accesses markets globally.\n\n## How we engage\n\n- \u00b7  We actively and frequently communicate with shareholders and other financial stakeholders through an open and transparent dialogue so they can understand performance and also raise any possible concerns.\n- \u00b7  IAG usually holds at least six formal meetings every year (Annual General Meeting, Capital Markets Day and four quarterly results briefings), where shareholders, investors and equity and credit analysts have the opportunity to interact with management.\n- \u00b7  Management and Investor Relations attend numerous investor conferences throughout the year. Investor Relations organises roadshows around the world to meet investors with diverse perspectives and from different locations. Some of these include both management and Board members and have a business focus as well as a corporate governance and ESG focus.\n- \u00b7  The Investor Relations team maintains an ongoing dialogue with equity, credit and ESG research analysts to understand investors' and shareholders' views of the Group. The Group Treasury team has regular interactions with credit analysts, global banks, debt investors and credit rating agencies. Finally, the Group Fleet Investments team and the Fleet teams of each operating company have regular interactions with aircraft operating lessors, who are either specialist aircraft leasing companies or the leasing arms of global banks. New commitments with these lessors are managed centrally through the Group Fleet Investments team.\n\n## Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThroughout the pandemic, the Group has maintained as frequent contact with institutional shareholders and investors as before the pandemic, the main difference being the use of virtual meetings and events replacing in-person meetings and events. The AGM was held virtually for the second consecutive year. The Group's management hosted four quarterly results calls for analysts and investors during the year. For a second year, however, the Group did not host a Capital Markets Day, given lack of uncertainty of the recovery from the pandemic and the considerable management time required to deal with the operational and financial impacts of COVID-19. Unfortunately, IAG was unable to distribute a dividend to shareholders because of the negative impact of the pandemic and government travel restrictions on the Group's financial performance.\n\nThe pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented decline in operating performance and resulted in material cash outflows. To maintain a suitable level of liquidity the Group has been forced to\n\nraise external capital and has as a consequence been reliant on providers of debt financing to support the liquidity position. The Group's relationship banks have provided capital in a number of formats to support liquidity.\n\nThe deterioration in our credit rating has seen the Company move out of investment grade into high yield and thus a different segment of the capital market. Expected terms and conditions in the high-yield market tend to be more punitive than investment grade owing to the weaker credit quality of the issuer, however we have been able to execute several capital markets transactions through the year on terms aligned with our investment grade issuances, for example the senior unsecured and convertible bonds issued in 2021.\n\nDuring this difficult period, we have raised substantial funds from the debt capital markets. In March 2021, the Group raised \u20ac1.2 billion in a two-tranche senior unsecured bond issuance. In May 2021, IAG raised a further \u20ac825 million through a single tranche Convertible Bond issuance. Both transactions provided additional financial flexibility for the Group as the pandemic evolved. As far as our airlines are concerned, British Airways has been able to access the capital markets to support its financial position throughout the year. The company raised \u00a32.0 billion through a term loan with commercial bank partners supported by an 80 per cent guarantee from the UK Export Finance Agency. A further \u00a31.0 billion was raised in October in the form of an undrawn Credit Facility, again provided by a syndicate of relationship banks with a 80 per cent UK Export Finance Agency guarantee. In March 2021, British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus secured $1,755 million of committed funding in the form of a Secured Revolving Credit Facility provided by the Group's relationship banks. The facility enhances the companies' liquidity positions and provides committed funding that can be drawn and repaid as and when required.\n\nFor further detail see the Financial review section.",

The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer hosted two virtual roadshows following the full year and half year results in March and September, respectively, and discussed with investors a range of strategic, financial, operational and ESG topics, in particular the prospects and plans for a recovery from COVID-19. In addition, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer held virtual meetings with a number of our key institutional investors and the Investor Relations team attended numerous investor meetings and broker conferences for investors throughout the year.\n\nThe Chairman hosted a virtual roadshow with key shareholders in April to discuss a range of ESG matters, in particular on climate change, diversity and Board governance issues. In addition, the Chairman and Senior Independent Director, who is also Chair of the Remuneration Committee, consulted with key shareholders on remuneration policy in April.\n\n## Environmental, Social, and Governance\n\nESG continues to be an area of focus for engagement with investors. The Investor Relations team has an ongoing dialogue with ESG research analysts and has hosted several meetings for the Group Head of Sustainability with key shareholders and institutional investors.\n\nInvestor Relations concluded in February 2021 an investor survey sent to the 100 largest institutional shareholders.  The survey, launched in December 2020, had the objective of better understanding investors' approaches towards ESG issues so that IAG can more closely align its ESG strategy, plans, reporting frameworks and disclosures with the interests and priorities of investors. The findings of this survey and its conclusions and recommendations were shared with IAG's sustainability team and the Group's Sustainability Steering Group and presented to the Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee of the Board. The findings of the ESG survey have been incorporated in IAG's disclosure frameworks, approaches to ESG rating agencies and ESG communications, including a planned ESG focused media and investor event for 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Suppliers\n\nIAG GBS provides a centralised procurement function for the Group and manages supplier engagement for 13,272 suppliers. In 2021, IAG GBS Group Procurement helped deliver over 1,500 initiatives to further optimise IAG's supply chain.\n\nAircraft and engine manufacturers are one of our key suppliers groups. Our aircraft suppliers include Airbus, Boeing and Embraer, and we have engines provided by CFM, GE, Pratt & Whitney and Rolls Royce, who also provide IAG with long term engine maintenance services, as well as support with spare parts and repairs used in our own maintenance facilities.\n\nThe Group is dependent on the performance of key suppliers that provide services to our customers and the business, including aircraft, engine, maintenance, airport operations and catering suppliers. Key suppliers are defined based on their importance to IAG, both in terms of economic impact and the complexity or risk of supply markets and include any service provider or third party that could significantly impact business operations if there is any disruption to the services or product provided.\n\n## How we engage\n\n- \u00b7  The Group engages with suppliers using customary procurement processes and through joint projects, including the Hangar 51 accelerator programme, independent review partners, industry conferences and supplier workshops.\n- \u00b7  The relationship with aircraft manufacturers and lessors is managed centrally by Group Fleet Investments who work closely with the fleet teams in the Group companies and with the MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) Procurement Team in IAG GBS.\n- \u00b7  In relation to airframe manufacturers, IAG has well established relationships with both Airbus and Boeing, whose aircraft make up most of the Group fleet, as well as with Embraer whose regional aircraft are operated by British Airways CityFlyer.\n- \u00b7  All other suppliers are managed centrally by IAG GBS Group Procurement in conjunction with relevant business stakeholders.",

        "page_content": "## Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nFaced with the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have strengthened many supplier relationships working side by side with the businesses we operate with to ensure mutual success. Equally, we have worked hard to identify those suppliers who may have been heavily impacted by the crisis and assisted in developing quick and effective solutions to ensure support was given where it was needed. This has included the timely management of payments.\n\nIn 2021, we have leveraged synergies within the IAG supply chain, benchmarking requirements and simplifying the supplier base wherever appropriate. There has been extensive collaboration with our suppliers to switch from fixed to variable costs enabling flexibility in the difficult business environment.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic required IAG GBS Group Procurement to change focus. The level and frequency of engagement with key suppliers increased and plans were implemented to mitigate the impact of the crisis until we had further clarity about the extent of the impact on the Group. We updated our procurement supplier engagement plan and worked in close partnership with our suppliers to defer spend and reduce costs. Wider measures were also implemented to temporarily waive minimum volume commitments across our contracts and we stopped or postponed capital investment projects that were no longer needed during the pandemic. The Group's goal is to ensure its supply chain is secure; for any risks identified at key suppliers, timely analysis is performed to understand the situation and define a potential business continuity plan.\n\nOur relationships with our aircraft manufacturers were also key to us during the pandemic. It has been necessary to reschedule many of our aircraft deliveries and the Group worked closely with our aircraft manufacturers to mutually agree terms for this. The Group Fleet and Group Procurement teams also worked with aircraft lessors and engine suppliers to align our spend more closely with the use of the fleet during the period where flying was heavily reduced. As we now plan for the recovery from the pandemic, it is equally important that we re-align our requirements working closely with our aircraft suppliers and lessors to be prepared for the recovery and to retain sufficient flexibility in an uncertain world.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Results from the engagement with our suppliers\n\nIn 2021, IAG became the first airline group worldwide to extend its net zero commitment to its supply chain. The Group will continue to liaise with, support and monitor suppliers to ensure net zero emissions by 2050 for products and services provided to the business.\n\nIAG GBS has partnered with EcoVadis, a market-leading provider of business sustainability ratings, to support the understanding and delivery of sustainability targets in our supply chain, including environment, labour and human rights, and ethics.\n\nIn 2021, IAG GBS continued to engage in initiatives that have led to a further reduction of onboard single-use plastics, including a switch from plastic cutlery sets to a sustainable wood cutlery pack. This switch delivered a plastic reduction of 185 tonnes per year across the Group. All plastic packaging was also removed from the BA Club World soft proposition, such as blanket and pillow wrapping.\n\n## IAG GBS Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nThe IAG GBS Supplier Code of Conduct clarifies the standards of behaviour expected from any supplier working with any part of our business and emphasises the importance of sustainability and fair treatment of employees. IAG and its suppliers must ensure that workers are treated fairly\n\nand not unlawfully discriminated against. We expect our suppliers to promote and provide work environments free from abuse, intimidation and harassment and that allow people to raise concerns freely and without fear of retaliation. IAG will only work with businesses which share our standards and ways of working.\n\n## Performance and metrics\n\nAs a minimum, all suppliers undergo bi-annual screening for any legal, social, environmental and financial risks. IAG GBS carries out in-depth supplier audits as part of the Group's commitment to sustainability. These audits are based on potential geographical and procurement category risk and performed by independent inspectors with corporate social responsibility (CSR) expertise using the SEDEX Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) methodology. The findings from the audits are discussed with the suppliers and corrective actions are agreed, if necessary.\n\nTo identify, manage and mitigate potential bribery and corruption risks, IAG uses risk-based third-party due diligence which includes screenings, external reports, interviews and site visits depending on the level of risk that a third-party presents. Any risks identified during the due diligence process are analysed and a mitigation plan put in place as necessary. Certain risks could result in termination of the proposed or existing relationship with the supplier. Business-critical suppliers are highlighted to the Group companies in regular risk alerts. The IAG Audit and Compliance Committee receives an annual update on the anti-bribery compliance programme.\n\nIn addition to the above, Group Procurement is working to deliver our Scope 3 commitment of net zero (supply chain) emissions by 2050, and 20 per cent emission reduction by 2030, in support of the Group's sustainability programme.",

        "page_content": "## STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT CONTINUED\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGovernment and regulator stakeholders include a wide range of organisations and individuals.  Our airline operating companies are subject to regulation by civil aviation regulators in the countries in which they are registered (Ireland, Spain and the UK) requiring very frequent engagement on practical matters, in particular safety and security but also consumer rights and other policy issues. Our airlines must also conform to regulatory requirements in all the countries in which they operate, necessitating involvement directly with many different aviation authorities around the world on a range of topics from administrative processes necessary to secure operating licences to slot applications and diplomatic discussions as well as, in this year, to comply with COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nThe nature of IAG's business, including its strategic goal of consolidation in the airline sector, means that regulatory stakeholders include competition authorities such as DG-COMP in the European Union and the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK. The wide range of policy subjects means that government stakeholders include national ministries responsible for (among others): transport, trade, finance, tourism, skills, the environment and international relations, as well as the European Commission's DG-MOVE and other directorates. IAG also seeks to build relationships with members of national parliaments and of the European Parliament across the political spectrum to enhance understanding of, and support for, our policy positions.\n\nIn building these relationships and undertaking engagement we work closely with our national and international trade associations in particular the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and Airlines For Europe (A4E).\n\nGovernment engagement is not an isolated activity. There is a clear relationship with customer stakeholders since government and regulatory stakeholders are concerned with matters such as consumer rights, and with employee stakeholders since colleagues are responsible for delivering customer service and are also affected by policy decisions relating to the aviation\n\nindustry. IAG's government affairs team works closely with operating companies to ensure work in these areas is consistent and informed.\n\n## How we engage\n\n- \u00b7  With all these we seek to arrange one to one contact but also work through our various industry associations, including the Asociaci\u00f3n de L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas (ALA) in Spain, Airlines UK, IATA and A4E.  We aim to take a leading role in each organisation with representation on the relevant executive committees and boards. These associations reflect and amplify IAG's positions in our 'home' countries - but also provide additional resource in key markets further afield.\n- \u00b7  We also work to influence the relevant supra-national organisations such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), in particular on COVID-19 or in support of its sustainability initiative CORSIA, largely through our home countries' national government inputs and directly where possible.\n\n## Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe involvement of regulators in aviation has never been so relevant as during the COVID-19 pandemic where governments have sought to control the spread of the virus through travel restrictions. A range of measures have been imposed on airlines, from simple requirements to wear masks on board to outright prohibition of flights. As a result, IAG's usual close engagement with the national governments, regulators and parliamentarians in the states in which its airlines are based has been exceptionally intense during the two-year duration of the pandemic.\n\nGovernment precautions and regulatory decisions have had direct and immediate impacts on our operating companies. Close engagement has therefore been essential in order to monitor and understand the actions that governments have taken, to ensure compliance with new rules and to allow our operating companies to make operational changes and decisions about when and where to operate. It also allows operating companies to provide information to customers and colleagues in a timely and effective way.\n\nThe frequent and sudden changes in policy and regulations have made this activity\n\nreally challenging and essential to allow the smooth operation of IAG's airline companies in 2021. The nature of the pandemic with constantly changing regulatory requirements around the world has meant a greater degree of interaction than in previous years.\n\nThe unprecedented level of engagement with governments and regulators during 2021 included Corporate Affairs and operating company staff taking part in regular national fora such as, in the UK, the Department of Transport's Expert Steering Group established to manage its response to the pandemic. Iberia representatives in Spain have engaged with government stakeholders, in particular with AESA (Agencia Estatal de Seguridad A\u00e9rea) in a similar way as have Aer Lingus senior executives with the Departments for Foreign Affairs, Transport and the Economy in Ireland. There has been extensive interaction both direct and indirectly with authorities in important markets for IAG's operating companies such as India, China, Hong Kong and the US in support of relaxing COVID-19 restrictions and reopening markets.\n\nTo manage the impacts of the pandemic, especially given multiplicity of changes and, among other issues, the emerging need for technological solutions to verifying travel documentation, IAG established internal working groups, both cross department within the operating companies and across Group companies, which continued to operate during 2021 and which allowed IAG to manage the process of implementing rule changes. These groups drew on the wide range of experience and expertise across the Group's operating companies and allowed a common position to be adopted in response to several proposed travel restrictions, strengthening IAG's position. It has also ensured that updates on new requirements and restrictions, as well as expertise, can be more rapidly shared across the Group.",

        "page_content": "## Results from the engagement government and regulators\n\nOur direct efforts, but also those undertaken collectively with trade associations and - unusually, but given the unprecedented impacts of the pandemic - on several occasions together with competitor airlines, have often been challenging given the speed of change and the multiplicity of regulations. Success has often come in the form of mitigating even more restrictive measures.  Other positive outcomes have included helping the European Commission to shape its official guidance on COVID-19 measures and the development and integration of digital travel apps into the border process in the UK and successes in influencing the design of UK documentation, in a staged way, to benefit consumers. Waivers from the 'use it or lose it' slot rules in Europe and the UK for the summer and winter 2021 seasons were also secured after intensive influencing work by the sector, in which IAG teams played a significant role.\n\nAlthough policy and regulation on COVID-19 response has dominated the year, we have continued to engage on many other issues in our home countries and in Brussels.  These include airspace modernisation, aviation taxes, consumer rights, slot policy and airport charges among others. Decisions by government and regulators in these areas have potential to affect our operations in various ways, so responding to them can present an opportunity for our Group.\n\nWe also engage on all policy topics affecting our business in the EU (Brussels), Spain, Ireland and in the UK, where our staff have met government ministers and officials to provide input on a range of issues including the UK government's potential aviation strategy, Heathrow's price review by the Civil Aviation Authority and with government departments in all the home countries on the topic of airport charges. Where appropriate the Group (or IAG) engages with and seeks to influence policy developments in key overseas markets, including the US in particular.\n\nDuring 2021 positive outcomes ranged from policy changes to operational specifics: IAG took a prominent part in collective influencing activity that resulted in a reduced rate of Air Passenger Duty on domestic flights in the UK and working individually, directly secured access for British Airways to Linate after leaving the EU through positive engagement with the Italian authorities.  IAG also successfully supported the European Commission in its signing of a Comprehensive Air Transport Agreement with Qatar.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nThe Corporate Affairs team is delivering a programme of engagement in the EU for the IAG Sustainability Team in response to the EU's Fit for 55 policy. This includes identifying appropriate contacts in the institutions of the EU and managing engagement.\n\nIn 2021, this has included direct meetings with senior officials in three different Directorates of the European Commission; around half of the permanent representatives (ambassadors) of Member States to the Parliament as well as ministers in Spain\n\nEU and many members of the European and Ireland in a number of departments.\n\nSustainability, and the EU's Fit for 55 package in particular as well as the UK's Net Zero strategy, have potentially a very significant impact on the industry and IAG - it is the key public policy issue facing the Group. In this area, we engage with regulators and governments to ensure the Group's' leadership in the sustainability field is clear and to influence changes to policy both to support our priorities as a Group and to support an effective approach to ensure aviation decarbonisation is adopted.\n\n## International relations\n\nIAG's Corporate Affairs team engages with international multilateral and bilateral discussions with the EU and third countries and the UK government in its talks with aviation partners and joins international fora such as the ICAO ICAN Conference on behalf of IAG operating companies. IAG aims to encourage open and liberal air service agreements that promote competition and consumer benefits and to secure access for our operating companies in new markets.",

        "page_content": "FINANCIAL OVERVIEW\n\n## Well-positioned for recovery\n\nSteve Gunning Chief Financial Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 'The Group took, and continues to take, decisive actions to preserve liquidity.'\n\nA year ago, I wrote that the timing and shape of recovery was uncertain and hence the Group remained focused on preserving liquidity and transforming its businesses for the future. The events of 2021 demonstrated that uncertainty very clearly and were a reminder of the need to continue to preserve liquidity, together with a focus on exploiting the opportunities the future will offer.\n\nIn 2021, the recovery was slow to take hold, as many markets were subject to severe travel restrictions well into the second quarter and the US did not re-open its borders to any meaningful degree until November. Where markets opened up there was evidence of strong pent-up demand for travel, both from leisure and corporate customers. The Group continued to focus on cash generation when planning capacity, including addressing the cargo opportunities that arose due to lower volumes of passenger aircraft capacity worldwide than pre-pandemic. IAG Loyalty saw an increase in volumes versus 2020,\n\nas membership increased and consumer spending rose.\n\nThe operating loss for the year was \u20ac2,765 million, with an operating loss excluding exceptional items of \u20ac2,970 million, which, whilst still substantial, was reduced by \u20ac1,420 million versus 2020. The greatest progress was made in Spain, where travel restrictions were less severe than in Ireland and the UK.\n\nIn the face of uncertain travel restrictions and demand, the Group took further actions to preserve liquidity. These included a continued focus on operating and capital expenditure, together with successfully raising new general debt and new committed credit facilities, demonstrating its continued access to funding markets. The Group successfully financed all 45 aircraft delivered in 2020\n\nand 2021 using long-term aircraft financing arrangements.\n\nThe Group raised \u20ac4.4 billion of additional non-aircraft related debt in 2021, including\n\n\u00a32.0 billion (\u20ac2.3 billion) for British Airways, partly guaranteed by UK Export Finance (UKEF) and an additional \u20ac75 million from Ireland's Strategic Investment Fund. In March, IAG issued two unsecured bonds, totalling \u20ac1.2 billion and then followed this with a \u20ac825 million convertible bond in May. The Group also secured additional credit facilities, with a $1.755 billion (\u20ac1.6 billion) revolving credit facility for British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus, which was agreed and executed in March, together with a further \u00a31.0 billion (\u20ac1.2 billion) UKEF credit facility for British Airways in November. The Group did not need to draw on any of its general facilities and ended the year with a very strong cash balance of \u20ac7.94 billion. As a result, total liquidity, including \u20ac4.04 billion of committed and undrawn general and aircraft facilities, ended the year at \u20ac12.0 billion.\n\nAt the time of last year's full-year results announcement in February 2021, capital expenditure for 2021 was expected to be \u20ac1.7 billion, including the delivery of seven wide-bodied aircraft, with four Airbus A350s and three Boeing 787s due for delivery in the year. None of these wide-bodied aircraft was delivered, due to delays at Airbus and Boeing. This was the principal driver of the record-low capital expenditure of \u20ac0.7 billion for the year. The Group does still expect to take delivery of the aircraft it has on order, which are needed to restore capacity as the recovery takes hold.\n\nQuarter 3 of 2021 proved to be an inflexion point for net cashflow from operating activities, which turned positive for the first time since Quarter 1, 2020. Operating cashflow increased further in Quarter 4, linked to positive EBITDA and increased forward bookings. Net cashflow from operating activities for the second half was \u20ac989 million positive, resulting in a net outflow for the year of only \u20ac141 million, versus an outflow of \u20ac3,432 million in 2020.\n\nIn November, the Omicron variant of COVID-19 was a further reminder of the uncertain shape of the recovery and has validated the actions taken in 2021 to preserve and further boost liquidity. These actions leave the Group well-positioned to benefit from the recovery, as it develops.\n\n## Steve Gunning\n\nChief Financial Officer",

        "page_content": "## COVID-19 impact and IAG's response\n\nThe main impact of COVID-19 materialised as a significant drop in the demand for passenger flights, linked to both the pandemic itself and the travel restrictions introduced, which changed many times throughout 2020 and 2021, often with no or very short notice, thereby creating uncertainty for customers. Capacity started to recover from the third quarter of 2021, in line with easing of restrictions and there was a strong increase in bookings for future travel once the US government announced it was easing its travel restrictions, which had operated largely unchanged from March 2020 to November 2021.\n\nAs a result of the significantly reduced flying programme, in 2020 aircraft had to be temporarily grounded, with some retired early. Jet fuel consumption in 2020 and 2021 was significantly lower than that on which the Group's hedging programme was based, leading to the discontinuation of hedge accounting for the related derivative financial instruments. In addition, the commodity price of jet fuel fell sharply, leading to significant losses related to the hedging programme, with an exceptional charge of \u20ac1.7 billion net of gains on related foreign exchange derivatives and a cash outflow in 2020 of \u20ac1.1 billion. In 2021 the remaining overhedged derivatives were settled, with a gain of \u20ac0.2 billion, reducing the total net loss to \u20ac1.5 billion.\n\nFrom early 2020 and throughout 2021 the Group acted to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on its liquidity and results, through reductions in operating and capital expenditure, together with working capital initiatives and additional funding.\n\n## Structure of Financial Review\n\nDue to the continued impact of COVID-19 and governments' travel restrictions, many of the usual variance analysis and measures are significantly less meaningful than in previous years and in some cases, measures used previously no longer provide relevant insight into understanding the performance of the Group. As a consequence, and in keeping with the Financial Review of 2020, in this review there is no detail on industry growth rates and GDP by market; in 2021 the main drivers of capacity and revenue\n\nwere COVID-19 and the related governmental travel bans and restrictions, rather than broader economic factors. This review, therefore, is structured to provide detail about the impact of COVID-19 on the Group, including the measures the Group has taken to mitigate the financial impact of the pandemic. Where variances exceed 100 per cent they have been substituted with 'nm' for 'not meaningful' and the absolute values are shown.\n\nIn 2020, the Group successfully completed a capital increase of \u20ac2.7 billion and raised non-aircraft related debt of \u20ac1.4 billion, together with negotiating a new contract with Amex, which resulted in a one-off payment of \u20ac830 million, including a significant pre-payment.\n\nThe Group also protected liquidity through working capital initiatives to defer payments into 2021 and by offering customers the choice of vouchers for future travel, in place of cash refunds. The net impact of vouchers issued and redeemed in 2021 was broadly neutral.\n\nThe Group entered into new credit facilities, including a $1.755 billion (\u20ac1.6 billion) facility for British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus and a further \u00a31.0 billion (\u20ac1.2 billion) via an additional UKEF facility for British Airways, agreed in the final quarter of 2021. Neither of these facilities was drawn in the year and, as at February 24, 2022 the Group had fully committed and undrawn general facilities of \u20ac2.9 billion and \u20ac1.1 billion of aircraft financing facilities, bringing total facilities to \u20ac4.0 billion.\n\nFunding initiatives continued in 2021, with a further \u20ac4.4 billion of non-aircraft related debt raised, including a \u00a32.0 billion (\u20ac2.3 billion) UK Export Finance (UKEF) backed loan for British Airways and at IAG unsecured bonds of \u20ac1.2 billion and a convertible bond of \u20ac825 million. The Group also repaid \u00a3300 million (\u20ac350 million) of one-year commercial paper issued under the UK's CCFF mechanism.",

However, Group capacity was up 7.7 per cent versus 2020, as global travel restrictions began to ease as vaccine programmes progressed. Capacity was increasingly restored during the year, in line with the easing of travel restrictions, although with some impact of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 felt in December.\n\n## Proportion of 2019 passenger capacity operated by quarter\n\n|                 | Q1    | Q2    | Q3    | Q4    |\n|-----------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Aer Lingus      | 15.2% | 10.9% | 27.1% | 44.3% |\n| British Airways | 14.8% | 14.1% | 31.7% | 52.7% |\n| Iberia          | 37.5% | 43.5% | 62.7% | 75.3% |\n| LEVEL           | 10.0% | 4.3%  | 15.5% | 10.8% |\n| Vueling         | 14.7% | 32.2% | 76.6% | 79.4% |\n| Group           | 19.6% | 21.9% | 43.4% | 58.3% |\n\nAcross the year, the travel restrictions for Ireland and the UK were greater than for Spain and consequently Iberia and Vueling were able to increase capacity earlier than the other Group airlines, with both reaching over 75 per cent of 2019 capacity in the final quarter of the year.\n\nIn the first three months of 2021, IAG capacity, measured in available seat kilometres (ASKs), was restricted to 19.6 per cent of that in the first quarter of 2019, with reductions across all regions. Capacity was significantly affected by the travel restrictions put in place, including new national lockdowns in the UK and Ireland in response to the third wave of infections at the start of the year. Passenger capacity for quarter 2 was up marginally at 21.9 per cent of 2019, with capacity increased where limited easing of travel restrictions allowed. Quarter 3 saw the highest passenger numbers and load factors since the start of the pandemic, but capacity was still severely constrained at 43.4 per cent of 2019. Capacity continued to increase in quarter 4, up to 58.3 per cent of 2019. The emergence of the Omicron variant impacted demand, mainly in December, as governments introduced stricter travel requirements and border restrictions in response.\n\nThe IAG passenger load factor was down 20.1 points from 2019 to 64.5 per cent, also impacted by travel restrictions, which changed frequently, together with low demand and a higher than normal level of passengers not checking in for flights that were still operating ('no-shows'). The passenger load factor for 2021 was up marginally on the 63.8 per cent seen in 2020. Some flights were operated mainly for cargo purposes, with low passenger load factors, but still cash-positive for the Group. The reduction in capacity across the industry continues to benefit cargo operations with favourable cargo yields and record cargo revenues.\n\n## IAG regional capacity\n\n| Year to  December 31,  2021          | ASKs  higher/ (lower) v2019   | ASKs  higher/ (lower)  v2020   |   Passenger  load factor | Higher/  (lower)  v2019   | Higher/  (lower)  v2020   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Domestic                             | (26.5)%                       | 46.3%                          |                     74.9 | (12.3) pts                | 3.9 pts                   |\n| Europe                               | (64.7)%                       | 19.3%                          |                     69.1 | (14.5) pts                | 4.5 pts                   |\n| North America                        | (71.3)%                       | (6.8)%                         |                     49.4 | (34.7) pts                | (3.8) pts                 |\n| Latin America  and Caribbean         | (52.3)%                       | 33.7%                          |                     69.8 | (16.6) pts                | (2.9) pts                 |\n| Africa, Middle  East and  South Asia |                               | (66.8)% (14.0)%                |                     67.4 | (15.6) pts                | 0.2 pts                   |\n| Asia Pacific                         |                               | (87.9)% (58.7)%                |                     39.4 | (46.4) pts (21.9) pts     |                           |\n| Total network                        | (63.9)%                       | 7.7%                           |                     64.5 | (20.1) pts                | 0.7 pts                   |\n\n## Domestic and Europe\n\nTogether, IAG's Domestic and European markets continue to represent the Group's largest region. However, capacity across both was, and continues to be, significantly impacted by travel restrictions and quarantine requirements.\n\nCapacity in IAG's Domestic markets recovered to a greater extent than other regions, with capacity lower by only 26.5 per cent versus 2019 and 46.3 per cent higher than in 2020. British Airways' capacity reflected demand from UK holidaymakers avoiding overseas destinations, which were subject to quarantine restrictions and expensive testing requirements. Vueling operations focused on connecting the Spanish peninsula with both the Canary and Balearic Islands and Iberia maintained similar Domestic routes for connectivity. Aer Lingus maintained its route between London and Belfast and benefitted from UK citizens opting for domestic holidays. Passenger load factor for the region was the highest for the Group at 74.9 per cent, down only 12.3 points versus 2019.\n\nThe Group's capacity in Europe was 64.7 per cent lower than 2019, however it recovered 19.3 per cent above 2020 as vaccination rates increased and travel restrictions eased. Aer Lingus, Vueling and Iberia benefitted from the introduction of the EU Digital Covid Certificate in the summer, allowing EU travellers to avoid self-isolation on travelling to other member states, with passenger load factors in the second half of the year significantly higher as a result. British Airways had a good performance throughout the summer on the routes operated to destinations included on the UK Government's 'Travel Corridor' Green and Amber list countries, once self-isolation requirements for double-vaccinated passengers were removed.\n\n## North America\n\nIAG's North American capacity was severely limited by the United States government's COVID-19 restrictions, which for a large portion of the year only allowed residents and nationals to enter the country. These restrictions were only lifted for EU and UK citizens on November 8, 2021. Prior to the entry requirements being relaxed, flights were operated primarily for cargo purposes. British Airways and Aer Lingus operated regular flights to New York, Boston, Washington and Chicago. Iberia operated flights to Miami and New York and LEVEL resumed operations to San Francisco and New York. Passenger load factor for the region was down 34.7 points versus 2019 to 49.4 per cent, reflecting the US government's strict border restrictions.",

        "page_content": "## Latin America and Caribbean (LACAR)\n\nIAG's capacity in LACAR was still down significantly on 2019, but increased 33.7 per cent on 2020, as routes re-opened and benefitted from significant visiting friends and relatives (VFR) and leisure demand. British Airways operated regular flights to Caribbean destinations, benefitting from leisure travel demand during holiday periods. Routes to Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires only resumed in December. Iberia benefitted from significant VFR travel during 2021 and load factors reached over 80 per cent from September onwards. Aer Lingus launched operations from Manchester in October 2021, with flights to Barbados starting in October. Passenger load factor for the region was down 16.6 points on 2019 at 69.8 per cent.\n\n## Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA)\n\nBritish Airways operated to multiple destinations including Dubai, India, South Africa and Pakistan. Capacity and demand were impacted by the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, including the Delta variant, which resulted in additional travel restrictions on certain destinations. Iberia operated regularly to Dakar and restarted operations to Israel and Morocco when travel restrictions were eased. Vueling also re-opened routes as restrictions eased, restarting routes to Morocco and Tunisia whilst continuing regular operations to Senegal and Algeria. Passenger load factor for the region was down 15.6 points versus 2019 at 67.4 per cent.\n\n## Asia Pacific\n\nThe Asia Pacific region was the most capacity-constrained region in 2021, as strict travel restrictions in the region continued to severely impact demand. British Airways operated routes to Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo regularly, mainly for cargo purposes. Iberia operated charter flights to China and Tokyo. Passenger load factor for the region was the lowest for the Group, down 46.4 points versus 2019 at 39.4 per/uni00A0cent.\n\n## Basis of Preparation\n\nBased on the extensive modelling the Group has undertaken in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, including considering plausible but severe downside scenarios, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has sufficient liquidity for the going concern assessment period to June 30, 2023 and accordingly the Directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThere are a number of significant factors related to the status and impact of COVID-19 worldwide that are outside of the control of the Group. These include the emergence of new variants of the virus and potential resurgence of existing strains of the virus; the speed at which vaccines are deployed worldwide; the efficacy of those vaccines; the availability of medicines to combat the impact of the virus and the restrictions imposed by national governments in respect of the freedom of movement and travel. Due to the uncertainty that these factors create, the Directors are not able to provide certainty that there could not be more severe downside scenarios than those that have been considered in the modelling, including the sensitivities the Group has considered in relation to factors such as the impact on yield, capacity operated, cost mitigations achieved and the availability of aircraft financing to offset capital expenditure. In the event that such a scenario were to occur, the Group may need to secure sufficient additional funding over and above that which is contractually committed as at February 24, 2022.\n\nThe Group has been successful in raising financing since the outbreak of COVID-19, having financed all aircraft deliveries in 2020 and 2021 and secured an additional \u20ac5.5 billion of nonaircraft related debt, in addition to a fully subscribed equity raise of \u20ac2.7 billion in 2020. The Group has negotiated and executed \u20ac2.8 billion of committed general facilities during 2021; these facilities were undrawn as at February 24, 2022 and would be available over the going concern period. However, the Directors cannot provide certainty that the Group will be able to secure additional funding, if required, in the event that a more severe downside scenario than those they have considered were to occur and accordingly this represents a material uncertainty that could cast doubts upon the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. Refer to note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant impact on the Group's results, although there were meaningful signs of recovery in the second half of the year, as travel restrictions were eased and the US lifted its severe restrictions (imposed in March 2020). Passenger capacity and passenger revenue were 7.7 per cent and 5.9 per cent higher than 2020 respectively, with cargo revenue 28.1 per cent higher. Passenger capacity rose from 19.6 per cent of 2019 in first quarter of 2021 to 58.3 per cent in the final quarter of the year. The Group continued to take action to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 by reducing costs and benefitted from the full-year impact of restructuring programmes implemented in the second half of 2020.\n\nThe net result was an operating loss for the year of \u20ac2,765 million, versus an operating loss of \u20ac7,451 million in 2020. The loss after tax for the year was \u20ac2,933 million, versus a loss of \u20ac6,935 million in 2020.\n\n## Loss for the year\n\n| Statutory results  \u20ac million   | 2021    | 2020 1   | Higher/ (lower) vly   |\n|--------------------------------|---------|----------|-----------------------|\n| Operating loss                 | (2,765) | (7,451)  | 4,686                 |\n| Loss before tax                | (3,507) | (7,827)  | 4,320                 |\n| Loss after tax                 | (2,933) | (6,935)  | 4,002                 |\n\nThe Group uses Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) to analyse the underlying results of the business excluding exceptional items, which are those that in management's view need to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence in understanding the entity's financial performance.  In 2020, the Group recorded a number of exceptional items arising as a direct result of COVID-19. During the course of 2021, the Group continued to record the fair value movements on derivatives de-designated from hedge accounting in 2020 as exceptional. In addition, new exceptional items arose in 2021, including the reversal of the impairment of certain aircraft stood back up in 2021, following the Vueling successful slot allocation at Paris Orly, together with adjustments to previously recorded restructuring provisions.\n\nA summary of the exceptional items relating to 2020 and 2021 is given below, with more detail in the Alternative Performance Measures section, including a breakdown of the exceptional items by operating company.",

The loss after tax and before exceptional items was \u20ac3,038 million, \u20ac1,299 million lower than 2020.\n\nAlternative\n\nPerformance Measures\n\n| (before exceptional items),   \u20ac million   | 2021    | 2020 1   | Higher/   (lower) vly   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|----------|-------------------------|\n| Operating loss                            | (2,970) | (4,390)  | 1,420                   |\n| Loss before tax                           | (3,637) | (4,766)  | 1,129                   |\n| Loss after tax                            | (3,038) | (4,337)  | 1,299                   |\n\n## Revenue\n\n| Statutory results \u20ac million   | 2021   | Higher/ (lower) vly   | Higher/   (lower) vly   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n| Passenger revenue 1           | 5,835  | 323                   | 5.9%                    |\n| Cargo revenue                 | 1,673  | 367                   | 28.1%                   |\n| Other revenue                 | 947    | (41)                  | (4.1)%                  |\n| Total revenue                 | 8,455  | 649                   | 8.3%                    |\n\n## Passenger revenue\n\nPassenger revenue increased by 5.9 per cent on 2020, driven by an increase in the second half of the year, in which 80 per cent of passenger revenue was generated, as travel restrictions reduced and passenger capacity increased. Passenger unit revenue, measured as passenger revenue before exceptional items per available seat kilometre (PRASK), was down 2.9 per cent versus 2020 (in which the main impact of COVID-19 was only seen from March). PRASK rose significantly in the second half of 2021, with an increase in the passenger load factor. Passenger revenue for the year was 74.1 per cent lower than in 2019, with PRASK down 28.1 per cent versus 2019.\n\n## Cargo revenue\n\n2021 was a record year for cargo revenue, for the second consecutive year, as additional flights were operated in the absence of passenger capacity and available aircraft were used for additional cargo-only flying. During the year 3,788 additional cargo-driven flights were operated. The overall impact of the cargo operation, including the additional cargo-driven flights, was an increase in Cargo revenue of \u20ac367 million, or 28.1 per cent higher versus 2020. Cargo revenue for the year was 49.8 per cent higher than in 2019.\n\n## Other revenue\n\nThe largest Other revenue streams for the Group in normal times are Iberia's Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) and Handling businesses, together with BA Holidays. Revenue from these activities was also significantly reduced by the continued impact of COVID-19. In the case of MRO and Handling, these revenues were affected by lower demand following reduced flight schedules and significant fleet reductions across the airline industry and hence lower maintenance requirements, although the reductions were less than the reduction in the level of passenger capacity. The BA Holidays business is closely linked to the passenger business and was therefore impacted by the significantly reduced passenger operation, although there was an increase in the second half of the year as operations increased. Overall, for the year, Other revenue was down \u20ac41 million, or 4.1 per cent, versus 2020 and was 50.7 per cent lower than in 2019.",

        "page_content": "## Operating costs\n\nDue to the continued impact of COVID-19 on the Group's flying programme, with significantly reduced revenues versus 2019, the Group continued to take action to offset the financial impact by reducing costs, together with measures to increase the variability and flexibility in its cost base. The Group benefitted from the full-year impact of restructuring and other cost-saving programmes implemented during 2020.\n\nTotal expenditure on operations fell from \u20ac15,257 million in 2020 to \u20ac11,220 million in 2021. Excluding the impact of exceptional items, Total expenditure on operations fell by \u20ac838 million, or 6.8 per cent versus 2020, despite a 7.7 per cent rise in passenger capacity.\n\n## Employee costs\n\n| Statutory results   |       | Higher/     | Higher/     |\n|---------------------|-------|-------------|-------------|\n| \u20ac million           | 2021  | (lower) vly | (lower) vly |\n| Employee costs 1 2  | 3,013 | (572)       | (16.0)%     |\n\nEmployee costs fell by \u20ac572 million versus 2020. In 2020 the Group recorded a \u20ac313 million exceptional charge relating to Group-wide restructuring programmes, which resulted in reductions at British Airways of approximately 10,000 employees (or one quarter of the workforce as at June 2020) and 500 at Aer Lingus (or approximately 10 per cent of the workforce at June 2020). Excluding the impact of exceptional credits in 2021 and exceptional charges in 2020, Employee costs reduced \u20ac241 million, or 7.4 per cent, versus 2020, despite the 7.7 per cent increase in passenger capacity.\n\nNational governments continued to provide wage or job support mechanisms in each of IAG's main home markets and the operating companies used these facilities to reduce employee numbers and costs, although the UK's support ended in September 2021. The direct impact of these mechanisms was to reduce employee costs by approximately \u20ac555 million.\n\n## Fuel, oil and emissions costs\n\n| Statutory results                        | 2021   | Higher/     | Higher/     |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| \u20ac million                                |        | (lower) vly | (lower) vly |\n| Fuel, oil costs and emissions  charges 1 | 1,781  | (1,954)     | (52.3)%     |\n\nFuel, oil and emissions charges were down \u20ac1,954 million, or 52.3 per cent versus 2020; excluding the exceptional net overhedging credit in 2021 and overhedging charge in 2020, Fuel, oil and emissions charges were down \u20ac106 million, or 5.2 per cent versus 2020 and down \u20ac4,086 million or 67.9 per cent on 2019.\n\n## Commodity prices\n\nCommodity fuel prices rose steadily over the course of 2021, having seen a dramatic fall in March 2020 as COVID-19 spread worldwide and a partial recovery by December 2020. Prices at the end of 2021 were 60 per cent higher than at the start of the year.\n\n## Jet fuel price trend ($/mt)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fuel hedging\n\nThe Group seeks to reduce the impact of volatile commodity prices by hedging prices in advance. In May 2021, the Board approved a revised fuel hedging policy, which is designed to provide flexibility to respond to both significant unexpected reductions in travel demand or capacity and/or material or sudden changes in jet fuel prices. The revised policy allows for differentiation within the Group, to match the nature of each operating company, and a greater use of call options. The revised policy operates on a two-year rolling basis, with hedging up to 60 per cent of anticipated requirements in the first twelve months and up to 30 per cent in the following twelve months and with flexibility for low-cost airlines within the Group to adopt hedging up to 75 per cent in the first twelve months. For all Group airlines, hedging between 25 and 36 months ahead will only be undertaken in exceptional circumstances.\n\n## Exceptional items\n\nIn 2020, due to the rapid fall in the commodity fuel price, the Group experienced losses on its fuel hedging derivatives. These hedging losses would have normally been offset against the reduced cost of physical fuel purchased. However, the impact of COVID-19 led to a significant reduction in the requirement to purchase jet fuel, due to the significantly reduced flying programme. As a consequence, the Group had derivative contracts for which there was no corresponding purchase of jet fuel, leading to discontinuance of hedge accounting for these derivatives, with a mark-to-market loss of \u20ac1,781 million recognised as an exceptional charge in the Income statement. There was also a related mark-to-market gain recognised in the Income statement related to foreign exchange hedging of \u20ac87 million, bringing the net exceptional charge to \u20ac1,694 million for the year. These values were calculated based on the fuel curve and foreign exchange rates as at December 31, 2020 and the anticipated capacity to be operated for 2021 and 2022. During 2021, there was limited further de-designation necessary, as capacity operated was broadly consistent with the volume of fuel hedged. However, due to the increase in the commodity fuel price, the losses on the remaining contracts were lower than anticipated and the Group recognised an exceptional credit of \u20ac154 million.",

        "page_content": "FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED\n\n## Fuel consumption\n\nThe Group continued to benefit from reduced fuel consumption associated with the investment in new fleet, together with the early retirement of older aircraft, including the full-year impact of the retirement of 15 Airbus A340-600 and 32 Boeing 747-400 aircraft in quarter 2 of 2020.\n\n## Supplier costs\n\n| Statutory results \u20ac million                   | 2021   | Higher/  (lower) vly   | Higher/   (lower) vly   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Handling, catering and other  operating costs | 1,308  | (32)                   | (2.4)%                  |\n| Landing fees and en-route  charges            | 923    | 5                      | 0.5%                    |\n| Engineering and other aircraft  costs 1       | 1,085  | (371)                  | (25.5)%                 |\n| Property, IT and other costs 2                | 758    | (24)                   | (3.1)%                  |\n| Selling costs                                 | 434    | 29                     | 7.2%                    |\n| Currency differences                          | (14)   | (95)                   | nm                      |\n\nHandling, catering and other operating costs were down \u20ac32 million on 2020, or 2.4 per cent, despite the higher volume of flying in 2021, as the Group continued to focus on reducing its cost-base and benefitted from the full-year impact of savings made in 2020 and ground handing contract negotiations in 2021.\n\nLanding fees and en-route charges were up \u20ac5 million on 2020, or 0.5 per cent, reflecting the impact of increased flying.\n\nEngineering and other aircraft costs reduced primarily due to the reduction in fleet since quarter 2, 2020 and the exceptional charges in 2020. Savings were negotiated for various maintenance contracts, including a new joint venture in Barcelona. Excluding the exceptional credit in 2021 and exceptional charge in 2020, Engineering and other aircraft costs were lower than 2020 by \u20ac256 million, or 19.0 per cent.\n\nProperty, IT and other costs were down \u20ac24 million, or 3.1 per cent, on 2020, which included exceptional charges for a settlement provision in relation to the theft of customer data at British Airways in 2018 and for legal costs relating to restructuring programmes undertaken in 2020. Excluding these exceptional charges in 2020, Property, IT and other costs were up \u20ac4 million or 0.5 per cent versus 2020.\n\nSelling costs increased by \u20ac29 million or 7.2 per cent versus 2020, reflecting increased booking activity for future travel, particularly in the second half of the year as travel restrictions eased. Cost increases were contained by negotiated savings for third party selling systems and commissions.\n\nOverall, Supplier costs (excluding fuel costs) were \u20ac488 million or 9.8 per cent, lower than 2020. Excluding exceptional charges and credits, Supplier costs (excluding fuel costs) were \u20ac4,626 million, or 50.7 per cent, lower than in 2019.\n\n## Ownership costs\n\nOwnership costs include depreciation, amortisation and impairment of tangible and intangible assets, including right of use assets.\n\n| Statutory results   |       | Higher/     | Higher/     |\n|---------------------|-------|-------------|-------------|\n| \u20ac million           | 2021  | (lower) vly | (lower) vly |\n| Ownership costs 1   | 1,932 | (1,023)     | (34.6)%     |\n\nThe reduction in ownership costs is mainly driven by the exceptional impairment charge made as a result of the fleet reductions brought about as a result of COVID-19 during 2020, when 82 aircraft were retired early, which led to an impairment charge of \u20ac856 million. For aircraft that were stood down temporarily as a result of COVID-19, depreciation costs continued to be charged. During 2021, Vueling was the successful bidder in a competition for additional take-off and landing slots at Paris Orly airport, which led to the requirement to return to service four Airbus A320 aircraft that were previously assumed surplus to requirements. The return of these four aircraft led to a \u20ac14 million reversal of the exceptional impairment charge recorded in 2020. There was also a \u20ac7 million reversal of an exceptional engine impairment charge recorded in 2020. Excluding the exceptional credit in 2021 and exceptional charge in 2020, Ownership costs were down \u20ac146 million, or 7.0 per cent.\n\n## Aircraft fleet\n\nIn 2021, the in-service fleet reduced by two aircraft, with 11 aircraft delivered and 13 aircraft removed from service for disposal or lease return.\n\n## Number of fleet\n\n| Number of fleet in-service   |   2021 |   2020 | Higher/  (lower) vly   |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|------------------------|\n| Shorthaul                    |    363 |    367 | (1.1)%                 |\n| Longhaul                     |    168 |    166 | 1.2%                   |\n|                              |    531 |    533 | (0.4)%                 |\n\nOf the 531 'in-service' fleet at the end of the year, 55 were temporarily grounded. In addition to the in-service fleet, there were a further 29 aircraft held by the Group pending disposal or lease return.\n\n## Exchange rate impact\n\nExchange rate impacts are calculated by retranslating current year results at prior year exchange rates. The reported revenues and expenditures are impacted by the translation of currencies other than euro to the Group's reporting currency of euro, primarily British Airways and IAG Loyalty. From a transaction perspective, the Group performance is impacted by the fluctuation of exchange rates, primarily exposure to the pound sterling, euro and US dollar. The Group typically generates a surplus in most currencies in which it does business, except the US dollar, for which capital expenditure, debt repayments and fuel purchases typically create a deficit which is managed and partially hedged. The Group hedges its economic exposure from transacting in foreign currencies but does not hedge the translation impact of reporting in euro.",

The main driver of the increase was the net currency retranslation charge of \u20ac82 million compared with a \u20ac245 million credit in 2020. Finance costs were up \u20ac160 million (23.9 per cent), related to interest on new debt and arrangement costs, including the IAG unsecured and convertible bonds issued in 2021. Non-operating costs also include a \u20ac89 million non-cash credit relating to movements in the fair value of the \u20ac825 million IAG convertible bond issued in the year.\n\nThe Group incurred an exceptional non-operating charge of \u20ac75 million in December 2021, relating to a settlement agreement reached with Globalia to terminate the agreements signed on November 4, 2019 and January 20, 2021 under which Iberia had agreed to acquire the issued share capital of Air Europa.\n\n## Tax\n\nThe tax credit on the loss for the year was \u20ac574 million (2020: \u20ac892 million), and the effective tax rate was 16 per cent (2020: 11 per cent). The substantial majority of the Group's activities are taxed where the main operations are based, in the UK, Spain and Ireland, with corporation tax rates during 2021 of 19 per cent, 25 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively, which result in an expected effective tax rate of 20 per cent. The difference between the actual effective tax rate of 16 per cent and the expected effective tax rate of 20 per cent is primarily due to certain current and prior period losses in Iberia and Vueling not being recognised and the effect of the rate change in the UK.\n\nOn March 3, 2021 the UK Chancellor announced that legislation would be introduced in the Finance Bill 2021 to set the main rate of corporation tax at 25 per cent from April 2023. On May 24, 2021 the increase in the rate of corporation tax in the UK was substantially enacted, which led to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances during the year and will increase the Group's future current tax charge accordingly.\n\nOn October 8, 2021 the Irish government announced that it would increase the rate of corporation tax for certain multinational businesses to 15 per cent with effect from 2023. This expected tax rate change has not been reflected in these results because it has not yet been substantively enacted.",

Aer Lingus operated the lowest passenger capacity relative to 2019, with ASKs at 24.4 per cent of 2019, British Airways operated at 28.3 per cent, Vueling at 53.0 per cent and Iberia at 55.4 per cent.\n\n## Operating (loss)/profit before exceptional items\n\n|                               | 2021    | 2020    | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|\n| British Airways (\u00a3 million) 1 | (1,900) | (2,349) | 1,890  |\n| Aer Lingus (\u20ac million)        | (347)   | (361)   | 276    |\n| Iberia (\u20ac million)            | (234)   | (759)   | 497    |\n| Vueling (\u20ac million)           | (262)   | (623)   | 240    |\n\nEmployee costs fell versus 2020, due to the use of wage support or similar schemes in all the operating companies' home countries, in which the substantial portion of employees are based. Support applied across the year in Ireland and Spain, although reduced as the year progressed in Spain, with the operation increasing. In the UK the furlough arrangements ended in September of 2021. Restructuring programmes were implemented in 2020, including at British Airways and Aer Lingus, with Iberia also making reductions in management numbers and reductions outside of Spain. The full-year impact of these 2020 restructuring programmes was seen in 2021, as most of the affected employees had left by the end of 2020.\n\nThe operating companies all operate similar hedging programmes, under a Group policy, which resulted in overhedging of jet fuel purchases and related currency transactions in 2020. Excluding the impact of overhedging, fuel costs fell in line with the capacity reductions, with an additional benefit from the efficiency of new-generation aircraft versus the aircraft they replace, together with a reduced effective price net of hedging.\n\nSupplier costs continued to benefit from initiatives in all the operating companies to reduce expenditure in light of the impact of the pandemic, including the full-year impact of actions taken during 2020.\n\nOwnership costs were impacted by the reduction in the Group's fleet of aircraft in 2020, leading to the impairment of aircraft and related assets in each operating company, with 2021 seeing a full-year benefit of the reduced fleet in depreciation costs.\n\nOperating margins are much less meaningful than in previous years, given the significant impact of COVID-19, but are included for completeness; the margins reflect the size of operation each operating company was able to fulfil in 2021.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nIn November 2019, at its Capital Markets Day, the Group announced its anticipated capital expenditure for the period 2020-2022 was \u20ac14.2 billion. In response to COVID-19, in 2020 the Group agreed to defer 68 aircraft scheduled for delivery over the period 2020-2022 and to re-schedule certain pre-delivery payments to aircraft manufacturers. The result of these changes was a significant reduction in expected capital expenditure over\n\nthe period 2020-2022, with capital expenditure over that period expected to be below \u20ac7 billion. In February 2021 the Group expected capital expenditure in 2021 to be \u20ac1.7 billion.\n\nDuring 2021, four Airbus A350 aircraft and three Boeing 787 aircraft were not delivered as anticipated and are now expected in 2022. As a response to the continued impact of COVID-19 and related travel restrictions, the Group continued to take actions to preserve liquidity by reducing certain project-related expenditure, whilst continuing to invest in key projects, including cyber-related investments. As a result, capital expenditure for 2021 reduced to \u20ac0.7 billion.\n\nThe Group did not enter into any new agreements to acquire additional aircraft in 2021, either from aircraft manufacturers or lessors.\n\nIn 2021 the Group took delivery of 11 aircraft, with six for British Airways, one for Iberia and four for Aer Lingus. Of these deliveries, five were aircraft acquired directly from manufacturers and six were leased from aircraft lessors. The liquidity impact of the aircraft deliveries in the year was cash-positive, as the value of financing raised exceeded the final delivery payments made to the aircraft manufacturers, due to pre-delivery payments for those aircraft made in previous years.\n\n| Aircraft deliveries   | 2021   |   2020 |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Airbus A320 family    | 8      |     15 |\n| Airbus A330           | 1      |      2 |\n| Airbus A350           | -      |      7 |\n| Boeing 777-300        | -      |      4 |\n| Boeing 787-10         | -      |      2 |\n| Embraer E190          | 2      |      4 |\n| Total                 | 11     |     34 |\n\n## Capital commitments\n\nCapital expenditure authorised and contracted for at December 31, 2021 amounted to \u20ac10,911 million (2020: \u20ac10,545 million). Most of this commitment is denominated in US dollars and includes commitments until 2027 for 110 aircraft including 56 aircraft from the Airbus A320 family, 10 Boeing 787s, 18 Boeing 777s and 26 Airbus A350s.\n\nThe Group has certain rights to cancel commitments in the event of significant delays to aircraft deliveries caused by the aircraft manufacturers. No such rights had been exercised as at December 31, 2021.\n\n| Aircraft future deliveries at December 31   | 2021   |   2020 |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Airbus A320 family                          | 56     |     64 |\n| Airbus A330                                 | -      |      1 |\n| Airbus A350                                 | 26     |     26 |\n| Boeing 777-9                                | 18     |     18 |\n| Boeing 787-10                               | 10     |     10 |\n| Embraer E190                                | -      |      2 |\n| Total                                       | 110    |    121 |\n\n## Working capital and other initiatives\n\nIn 2020, as a response to COVID-19, the Group negotiated deferrals to supplier payments and lease payments, rolled over fuel derivatives, monetised EU Emissions Trading Scheme credits and foreign currency derivatives. These initiatives reduced cash",

In quarter 3 of 2020 a multi-year renewal was signed with American Express, including an upfront payment of approximately \u20ac830 million (\u00a3754 million), with a significant amount being for the pre-purchase of Avios for future years. Despite the partial unwinding of these initiatives in 2021, the working capital cash inflow for 2021 was \u20ac473 million higher than in 2020 at \u20ac1,634 million, principally driven by a significant increase in bookings for future travel in the second half of the year and an increase in trade payables as the flying programme increased.\n\nDeferred revenue on ticket sales, which includes loyalty points (Avios), rose \u20ac1,422 million to \u20ac6,552 million at December 31, 2021; \u20ac6,161 million is included in current liabilities and \u20ac391 million within non-current liabilities, associated with the renewal of the IAG Loyalty contract with American Express. The value of loyalty points (Avios) issued and yet to be recognised in revenue was up \u20ac95 million versus 2020 at \u20ac2,820 million, reflecting the net impact of a partial unwind of the American Express pre-payment in 2020 and the balance of Avios issued versus redeemed in 2021. Sales in advance of carriage, related to passenger ticket sales, were up \u20ac1,327 million versus 2020 at \u20ac3,732 million. At constant currency, Sales in advance of carriage were at the same level as December 2019. The cash impact of cancelled flights continued to be partially mitigated by customers accepting vouchers for future travel in lieu of a cash refund, with the outstanding value of vouchers as at December 31, 2021 at approximately the same level as December 2020 and representing one third of Sales in advance of carriage.\n\nTrade receivables rose by \u20ac178 million, related to the significantly increased bookings for future travel versus those taken in the final months of 2020.\n\nTrade and other payables rose by \u20ac902 million, related mainly to the significantly increased flying schedule and related costs in the final quarter of 2021, in which the Group operated 58.3 per cent of 2019 passenger capacity, versus only 26.6 per cent operated in quarter 4 of 2020.\n\nBritish Airways deferred monthly UK pension deficit contributions that would otherwise have been due in quarter 4, 2020 to the value of \u20ac125 million, together with contributions of \u20ac390 million relating to the first three quarters of 2021, with the resultant amounts deferred due for payment in the 12 months ending March 2024. British Airways granted security over certain property assets to the Trustee of NAPS in respect of these deferred payments. British Airways has also agreed that it will not make dividend payments to IAG before the end of 2023 and that from 2024 dividends will be matched by a contribution to NAPS of 50 per cent of the dividend paid until the deferred contributions have been paid. In October 2021, the funding level of NAPS for the purposes of an overfunding protection mechanism, agreed in 2019, meant that British Airways made no contributions from October to December 2021. Should the funding level fall, contributions will resume at an accelerated rate to recover the contributions not made during the period the overfunding trigger applied. The triennial valuation of the scheme, based on conditions as at March 31, 2021, is expected to be completed in 2022 and will measure the latest funding position of the scheme, which may lead to a new schedule of deficit contributions.\n\n## Funding and debt\n\nIAG's long-term objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital and to provide sustainable returns to shareholders. In November 2018, S&P and Moody's assigned IAG with a long-term investment-grade credit rating with a stable outlook; these ratings remained unchanged up until the outbreak of COVID-19. The Group's current ratings (as at February 24, 2022) are: S&P: BB (3-notch decline), Moody's: Ba2 (2-notch decline), based on the impact of COVID-19 on the Group and the airline industry, together with the expected timing of the recovery of global air traffic.\n\n## Debt and capital\n\nThe Group monitors leverage using net debt to EBITDA, in addition to closely following measures used by the credit ratings agencies, including those based on gross debt.\n\nSee Alternative Performance Measures section for calculation",

British Airways repaid \u00a3300 million of debt raised under the UK's CCFF mechanism in 2020. Gross debt is subject to foreign exchange translation movements, as the majority of the Group's aircraft debt is denominated in US dollars. Over the course of 2021 the euro weakened against the US dollar and the pound sterling and as a consequence \u20ac820 million of the increase gross debt was due to adverse foreign exchange translation.

Of the 11 aircraft delivered in 2021, four for British Airways were financed using asset financing lease arrangements, including three financed through a new sustainability-linked Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificate (EETC) financing agreed in July 2021. As at December 31, 2021 the remaining undrawn balance of this facility was $635 million. One Iberia aircraft delivered in 2021 and two delivered in late 2020 were financed through sale and leaseback transactions. An additional six aircraft were introduced through leasing arrangements direct from lessors. The Group also raised additional financing against aircraft delivered in previous years and spare engines\n\nIn 2021, the Group drew non-aircraft debt facilities agreed in 2020, namely a \u00a32.0 billion Export Development Guarantee (EDG) term loan for British Airways from UK Export Finance and \u20ac75 million for Aer Lingus from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund. IAG closed a dual-tranche senior unsecured bond issuance in March, raising \u20ac1.2 billion, with \u20ac500 million maturing in 2025 and \u20ac700 million maturing in 2029. In May, IAG raised \u20ac825 million by issuing a convertible bond, maturing in 2028.\n\nThe debt actions above resulted in total 'Proceeds from borrowings' for the year of \u20ac4,817 million. Repayments of borrowings during the year included the repayment of British Airways' commercial paper issuance from the UK's Coronavirus Corporate Finance Facility (CCFF), which raised \u00a3300 million (\u20ac329 million) in March 2020.",

In quarter 4, 2020, the Group successfully completed a capital increase, with gross proceeds of \u20ac2.7 billion.\n\n## Liquidity facilities\n\nDuring the year, the Group signed a committed secured Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) with a syndicate of banks for $1.755 billion, available for three years, plus two consecutive one-year extension periods, at the discretion of the lenders. The facility is available to Aer Lingus, British Airways and Iberia, each of whom has a separate borrower limit within the overall facility. Any drawings under the facility would be secured against eligible unencumbered aircraft assets and take-off and landing rights at both London Heathrow and London Gatwick airports. No drawings against this facility were made in 2021 and the facility remained undrawn at February 24, 2022.

This represented an increase of \u20ac1,730 million versus pro forma liquidity of \u20ac10,256 million at the end of 2020, which included a \u00a32.0 billion UK EF facility agreed in December 2020 and drawn as debt in March 2021.\n\n## Cash flow\n\n| \u20ac million                                                                                        | 2021    | 2020 1,2   | Movement   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|------------|------------|\n| Operating loss                                                                                   | (2,765) | (7,451)    | 4,686      |\n| Depreciation, amortisation and  impairment                                                       | 1,932   | 2,955      | (1,023)    |\n| Movement in working capital                                                                      | 1,634   | 1,161      | 473        |\n| Payment related to restructuring                                                                 | (161)   | (383)      | 222        |\n| Pension contributions net of  service costs                                                      | (15)    | (288)      | 273        |\n| Provisions and other non-cash  movements                                                         | 305     | 486        | (181)      |\n| (Realised)/unrealised net loss on  discontinuance of fuel and foreign  exchange hedge accounting | (497)   | 569        | (1,066)    |\n| Interest paid                                                                                    | (640)   | (548)      | (92)       |\n| Interest received                                                                                | 3       | 22         | (19)       |\n| Tax received                                                                                     | 63      | 45         | 18         |\n| Net cash outflows from operating  activities                                                     | (141)   | (3,432)    | 3,291      |\n| Acquisition of PPE and intangible  assets                                                        | (744)   | (1,939)    | 1,195      |\n| Sale of PPE, intangible assets and  investments                                                  | 544     | 1,133      | (589)      |\n| Decrease in current interest- bearing deposits                                                   | 91      | 2,366      | (2,275)    |\n| Other investing movements                                                                        | (72)    | 2          | (74)       |\n| Net cash flows from investing  activities                                                        | (181)   | 1,562      | (1,743)    |\n| Proceeds from borrowings                                                                         | 4,817   | 3,567      | 1,250      |\n| Repayments of borrowings                                                                         | (784)   | (978)      | 194        |\n| Repayment of lease liabilities                                                                   | (1,481) | (1,536)    | 55         |\n| Dividend paid                                                                                    | -       | (53)       | 53         |\n| Proceeds from rights issue                                                                       | -       | 2,674      | (2,674)    |\n| Settlement of derivative financial  instruments                                                  | (268)   | 136        | (404)      |\n| Acquisition of Treasury shares and  other financing movements                                    | (49)    | -          | (49)       |\n| Net cash flows from financing  activities                                                        | 2,235   | 3,810      | (1,575)    |\n| Net increase in cash and cash  equivalents                                                       | 1,913   | 1,940      | (27)       |\n| Net foreign exchange differences                                                                 | 205     | (228)      | 433        |\n| Cash and cash equivalents at  January 1                                                          | 5,774   | 4,062      | 1,712      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents at year  end                                                           | 7,892   | 5,774      | 2,118      |\n| Interest-bearing deposits maturing                                                               |         |            |            |\n| after more than three months                                                                     | 51      | 143        | (92)       |\n| Cash, cash equivalents and  interest-bearing deposits                                            | 7,943   | 5,917      | 2,026      |",

Deferrals of deficit contributions were agreed with the NAPS Trustee from October 2020 to September 2021 and from October 2021 to December 2021 no deficit contributions were required, as the scheme had reached pre-agreed trigger levels for an overfunding protection mechanism to apply; this mechanism was agreed in 2019. Deficit contributions could resume should the funding level fall, or if the ongoing triennial valuation of the scheme, based on the funding position at March 31, 2021 and updated assumptions, determines there is a deficit.\n\n## See note 32 to the financial statements 'Employee benefit obligations' for further information\n\nOf the exceptional charges for discontinuance of hedge accounting in respect of passenger revenue of \u20ac62 million and fuel, oil and emissions costs of \u20ac1,694 million in 2020, \u20ac1,187 million had been paid, leaving \u20ac569 million to be paid in future years, with the majority due in 2021. As the fuel price rose in 2021 the required payments were lower than when measured at the end of 2020.\n\nSale of property, plant and equipment and intangibles, in addition to the aircraft sale and leaseback transactions discussed under 'Funding' above, includes the disposal of aircraft financed on sale and leaseback transactions, spare engines and other disposals.\n\nOther investing movements includes the \u20ac75 million payment to Globalia, due to the settlement agreement to terminate the agreements under which Iberia had agreed to acquire the issued share capital of Air Europa.\n\nRepayments of borrowings and lease liabilities includes the principal element of ongoing lease payments. Based on the share price at December 31, 2021, the remaining \u20ac500 million IAG convertible bond issued in 2015 will be due for repayment in November 2022.\n\nThe \u20ac53 million of cash outflow for dividends in 2020 relates to the Spanish withholding tax in respect of the 2019 interim dividend. No dividends were declared in respect of either 2020 or 2021.\n\nSettlement of derivative financial instruments relates to settlements of foreign exchange instruments taken out to hedge long-term debt payments, including US dollar lease payments. The outflow in 2021 is partly due to gains that would otherwise have been received in 2021 being accelerated into 2020, as part of the initiatives to preserve liquidity after the spread of COVID-19 in 2020.",

The dedication and resilience shown by our colleagues across the airline has helped us to get through this crisis, introducing new safety measures, constantly reviewing our schedules to respond to the frequent changes in restrictions and working dynamically to increase flights to countries when restrictions eased. We continued to offer flexibility to our customers with the guarantee that if their plans were affected by the pandemic, they could move their flight to an alternative date and/or destination or accept a voucher for future travel. Despite the financial impact the pandemic has had on our business we have continued to invest, in new aircraft, cabins and food and drink to delight our customers. We have also put sustainability at the heart of everything we do and invested heavily in our new sustainability programme, BA Better World.\n\n## Our people\n\nI am incredibly grateful to everyone at British Airways for their hard work and commitment during this period, not only for their resilience in the most difficult of times, but for pulling together to go the extra mile for our customers and to develop creative solutions to the problems generated by the pandemic. It was a difficult and an uncertain year for everyone in the company and we were absolutely delighted to welcome back our colleagues when the Covid Job Retention Scheme (CRJS) came to an end in September. As we emerge from the crisis, and look forward to more meaningful travel and fewer restrictions, we have started to recruit again, to help us rebuild our business as we seek to grow.\n\nI also want to thank the 1,500 colleagues who gave up their time while on furlough to volunteer and support organisations across the UK, including COVID-19 vaccination and test centres, foodbanks and charities such as the British Red Cross and St John's Ambulance.\n\n## Our customers\n\nIn many ways the pandemic has helped us to drive radical changes in our customer experience.

By the end of the year, 34 aircraft were fitted with our new Club Suite business cabin seat and WiFi installed on more than 80 per cent of our fleet. All our Heathrow-based Boeing 777 aircraft will feature our Club Suite by the end of this year. During the pandemic we also formed a new partnership with highly acclaimed chef Tom Kerridge, with a new menu for our Euro Traveller customers travelling on shorthaul flights.\n\n## Our planet\n\nIn September 2021 we launched our new sustainability programme BA Better World, acknowledging that this is 'our most important journey yet' and putting sustainability at our heart. We are working hard to reduce our emissions and waste and positively contribute to the communities we serve to create a great place for our people to work and build a resilient, responsible business. During the year we invested in ZeroAvia to further develop hydrogen-powered aircraft, as well as in the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with a new deal with LanzaJet in the US as well as investment in four UK-based projects, which also received funding from the Government during the past year. We are committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and worked with bp to provide enough sustainable aviation fuel for our flights between London and Glasgow and Edinburgh during COP26, as well as for our first transatlantic flight to New York once restrictions were lifted on November 8, 2021; operating an Airbus A350 aircraft using a 35 per cent blend of SAF reduced emissions by more than 50 per cent compared to the now-retired Boeing 747 aircraft that used to operate that route. We've also championed the use of sustainability financing, with three/uni00A0credit facilities linked to sustainability targets.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nDuring the most challenging period in our history I have been hugely impressed by the resilience and professionalism of our colleagues, who are determined to help us rebuild into an even better airline than before. We are creating a new subsidiary at Gatwick to offer more choice to our customers as well as reviewing our policies and procedures to ensure we empower colleagues to do the right thing for those who fly with us. And we're working on new initiatives to make British Airways an even more attractive place to work - something we know will drive even better customer service.",

We are now operating almost 100 per cent of our pre-pandemic network although our capacity is still below 2019\n\nOur handling and maintenance divisions have done a great job and both businesses have generated positive results in 2021.\n\nIt was very disappointing in December that we had to terminate an agreement reached previously with Globalia to acquire Air Europa. However, we have committed to analyse alternative arrangements.\n\n## Our people\n\nI am incredibly proud of the commitment our employees have shown during the last year, which has helped us weather this pandemic and stimulate demand in all the markets in which we operate. Our people have gone above and beyond to help where needed, helping repatriate thousands of people and transporting more than six million vaccines to the Spanish islands and across Latin America.\n\nOur priority during this crisis has been looking after our employees. The\n\nIberia's maintenance team has provided preservation services to more than 150 IAG aircraft and thirdparty customers in Madrid, Palma, Malaga and Seville\n\nimplementation of the emergency furlough scheme approved by the Spanish Government allowed us to protect more than 15,000 jobs from our workforce.\n\nDuring the summer we also collaborated with the Spanish vaccination programme, by setting up a centre where more than 25,000 people received their jabs, including our employees and members of the community in Madrid.\n\n## Our customers\n\nAt Iberia, as with all IAG's airlines, our customers are and will always be at the centre of our business. To ensure their utmost comfort, we updated our safety, prevention and hygiene measures, to ensure we could recommence travel with confidence. These measures earned us a four-star Skytrax rating and ranked us among the ten safest airlines in terms of protecting against COVID-19 in the world, according to the Safe Travel Barometer.\n\nCOVID-19 accelerated the digitalisation of our business, which was already underway prior to the pandemic. Our goal is to improve the customer experience through innovation, and we have been working on a range of new solutions, such as the Iberia chatbot on WhatsApp, and digitising the documentation required to fly.\n\nThree Airbus A330 aircraft will pass from Iberia to the Ministry of Defence to be transformed into Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT).

We flew one of the most efficient\n\naircraft in the world, the Airbus A320neo, which reduces noise by 50 per cent and produces 50 per cent less NOx.\n\nIberia also completed the construction, at its maintenance facilities, of the largest self-consumption solar panel plant of the IBEX companies. Built in partnership with specialist firm Getting Greener, the new facility is part of an ambitious plan to generate a total 10MW of power over the next three years, with production of more than 13 million kWh, generating the equivalent power consumed by more than 4,000 homes.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nWe expect Iberia's recovery to be consolidated in 2022. We will focus on returning the airline to profitability while continue working to make significant progress on the decarbonisation of aviation. Our teams will take every opportunity to strengthen Iberia's position in all the markets we operate, offering its customers a more personalised service using innovation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIberia and Getting Greener begin operating the largest selfconsumption\n\nplant of the Ibex in La Mu\u00f1oza\n\nRepsol and Iberia have completed the Madrid -Bilbao route with sustainable fuel produced from waste at the Petronor refinery.

In March 2021 the fourth Airbus A321neo aircraft was added to its fleet. This is the most efficient short- and medium-haul Airbus model and represented a further step in its fleet renewal as part of its roadmap towards zero net emissions by 2050.\n\nTogether with Iberia and IAG Cargo, Iberia Express contributed to the transport of vaccines to the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands throughout the year. Additionally, it carried humanitarian aid to support the crisis caused by the eruption of the volcano on La Palma, an example of the company's commitment to the islands.\n\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Iberia Express has always guaranteed connectivity with the Canary Islands. Last summer the number of seats offered to the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands was higher than in the same period of 2019. In summer 2021, the airline launched the new seasonal route to Kefalonia, landing for the first time on the Ionian island in July and expanding its network of more than 30 domestic and international destinations.\n\nIberia Express ranked among the most punctual airlines in Europe\n\nIberia's Express team is the airline's greatest asset. Despite the complex environment, they did their best to provide excellent customer service, achieving the best NPS in the company's history.",

Second, we enhanced flexibility to enable us to constantly adapt our capacity to match demand, identifying any new opportunities to fly, which generated cash. Third, we had to rigorously adapt our costs as much as possible to meet the level of flight activity. Finally, we had a constant focus on cash, working capital and financing.\n\nHowever, while managing the crisis, we also began preparing to emerge even more efficient and competitive in a post-pandemic environment by implementing the 19 initiatives included in our Plan 'Vueling Transform'. These\n\nVueling has received the prestigious Skytrax award and has been designated as the Best European low-cost carrier\n\ninitiatives aim to unlock the full potential of our airline by generating more value for our shareholders, our employees, our customers and ultimately society.\n\nFor example, we transformed our maintenance model by launching a new joint venture company that manages Vueling Line Maintenance; we changed the structure of our fare families and introduced new ancillaries such as Guaranteed Hand Bag, giving more flexibility to our customers to choose the services they exactly need; and we redefined our Mission Vision and Values to lead our people through this period of uncertainty.\n\n## Our people\n\nI'm incredibly thankful to all our people at Vueling: the impressive resilience and commitment that they demonstrated all through the year has been the driving force behind our achievements at a time where many were required to make personal sacrifices.\n\nIn its 17 years of history, Vueling has faced several challenges and, has always been able to emerge stronger afterwards. Once again, this crisis demonstrated what Vueling people are capable of and that the ability to rise to a challenge is in our DNA.\n\nAs a result of the creation of a new joint venture company that manages Vueling Line Maintenance, a new warehouse has been built\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is a reflection of the continuous hard work made to help our customers throughout difficult circumstances, for instance being the first European low-cost airline to implement the IATA travel pass and offering digital solutions to simplify the customer experience.\n\nThis was combined with another unprecedented achievement in 2021: Cirium named Vueling as The Most On-time European Airline in 2021.\n\nFor us, achieving these awards in a year that required so many sacrifices and efforts is a clear testimony of the exceptional level of commitment and dedication of all our people at Vueling.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVueling has recently signed an agreement with Repsol on Sustainable Aviation Fuel procurement and we operated our first green flight on a BarcelonaSeville route\n\nSince 2013, Vueling has been the leading commercial airline in Spain in the transport of organs for transplantation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnother key milestone in our progress to offer a stronger customer proposition has been to expand our offering in Orly: the European Commission assessed Vueling's proposal as the best for the 18 Air France slots that became available at Paris-Orly Airport, following a competitive process. As a result of obtaining these slots, Vueling becomes the second-largest operator -after the Air France Groupwhich allows us to offer our customers 32 new destinations from Paris-Orly airport.\n\nSimilarly, our efforts to strengthen our Spanish domestic network have been well received by our local customers. Last summer, we operated a level of capacity up to 114 per cent of 2019 levels and opened 42 new routes both in domestic and international markets.\n\nStill, in a year of so many achievements, we believe it has not been always easy to adjust our level of capacity as rapidly as demand was changing, and we have in time improved our agility to be able to react even more quickly that we did at the beginning of the crisis.\n\n## Our planet\n\nSustainability forms a key part of Vueling Transform, reflecting all the actions we are undertaking to reach our net zero commitment and, to achieve 10 per cent usage of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) by 2030. In this respect we recently signed an agreement with Repsol for the supply of SAF and we operated our first green flight on a Barcelona-Sevilla route on November 10, 2021.\n\nIn terms of diversity, Vueling continues to increase the ratio of women in management positions with the percentage of women in leadership roles now 38 per cent.\n\nFurthermore, we are proud to be the leading airline in the transport of human organs for transplantation in Spain.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nIn conclusion, while recognising that 2021 continued to be an extremely challenging year, we are confident that we are closer to recovery, and are well placed to successfully adapt to market conditions as they evolve. Vueling Transform is preparing us for the future and achievements such as the Skytrax award, and the attainment of slots at Paris-Orly, reinforce our confidence that, with the commitment of our Vueling employees, we will be able to emerge from the crisis stronger.",

The non-essential travel ban in Ireland was in place until well into the summer season. The inbound travel bans to the US - which covered the entirety of the Aer Lingus longhaul network - remained in place for over ten months of the year.\n\nThe impact has been profound: international travel to and from Ireland was less than 25 per cent of 2019 levels in 2021.\n\nHowever, Ireland is an island nation. Irish people love to travel. And Ireland's geographic position is a natural location for a successful North Atlantic hub. Therefore, whilst navigating the crisis, we have been readying ourselves for the recovery.\n\nOur schedule for summer 2022 triples our capacity compared to summer 2021 and reaches 90 per cent of 2019 levels by the summer peak. We are reintroducing capacity during the first quarter of 2022 to be operationally ready for this summer peak.\n\nFollowing constructive discussions with our pilot and cabin crew communities we have agreed structural changes covering both pay scales and working practices. These will make us more cost competitive and support future investment and growth.\n\n2021 also saw a significant milestone with the creation and launch of our new subsidiary airline. This allows us to pursue longhaul market opportunities out of the UK and we commenced our first transatlantic services from Manchester in October.\n\nThe focus on liquidity continued throughout the year and a series of debt facilities were made available through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) and IAG. Consequently, we finished the year in a firm liquidity position.\n\n## Our people\n\nThe low number of flights operated in 2021 belies the effort, teamwork and creativity of our Aer Lingus colleagues. It was a year of re-planning, re-booking, re-training, and returning aircraft to service, compounded by COVID-related supply chain issues and staff absences. Despite these challenges, the commitment to strong punctuality and high levels of customer service prevailed.\n\nMany office-based colleagues have not returned to the workplace since March 2020. Whilst our people have adapted to\n\nTeam Ireland athletes onboard the Aer Lingus flight ahead of their Paralympic homecoming\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAer Lingus has signed a deal with Daon to extend the use of the VeriFLY app, following the successful rollout of the technology across its network\n\n<!-- image -->",

We look forward to re-establishing face-to-face engagement and embracing flexible working following the Government's announcement in January 2022 that workers can return to the workplace on a phased basis.\n\nThroughout the crisis we sought to retain the employment of as many of our people as possible. That required significant salary reductions across the organisation. Payroll savings were reached by agreement with our workforce in 2020 and 2021 and the Irish government Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) provided important support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAer Lingus extends 'Book with Confidence' policy to offer additional flexibility to customers\n\nDeparture of the airline's first ever non-stop direct flight from Manchester to Barbados\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our customers\n\nThe social and economic benefits of air travel are compelling. We have consistently challenged the government to insist any COVID restrictions are evidence-based, proportionate and in place for the minimum amount of time. When restrictions have been lifted the customer response has been positive. In order to support consumer confidence, we have introduced market-leading flexible booking policies. Additionally, investment in digital solutions provide customers clarity of travel requirements, confidence in being ready-to-fly and a smoother experience through the airport.\n\nWe further developed our digital capability in areas such as disruption management, baggage, ancillary revenues and readiness to participate in the Atlantic Joint Business.\n\nFollowing the sudden collapse of Stobart Air - the franchise operator of Aer Lingus Regional - Aer Lingus stepped in to provide rescue flights and open new routes in order to minimise customer impact. We have successfully developed a new franchise partnership with Emerald Airlines and Aer Lingus regional service operations will restart from March 17, 2022.\n\n## Our planet\n\nWe continue resolute in our commitment to sustainability. In 2021 we took delivery of three fuel-efficient Airbus A321 LR aircraft to operate across the Atlantic and support the sustainable development of our Dublin hub. We are working with IAG and the other operating companies to develop a comprehensive sustainability programme.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nOur customer research tells us that Irish people are very keen to get back flying. The Aer Lingus team have laid the foundations for recovery, we have an ambitious schedule planned and a competitive product. Our vision is to be at the heart of travel to, through and beyond Ireland for generations to come. We look forward to more and more customers experiencing the warm welcome for which Aer Lingus is renowned.",

Our people went above and beyond to find solutions to the global capacity crunch and airfreight restrictions and, in turn, we were able to keep world trade moving, delivering essential supplies and the vital components of everyday life. Our 'always moving' mantra enabled us to deliver for our customers as passenger flying continued to be disrupted.\n\nWe reshaped our business to take advantage of the strong cargo market and actively repurposed Group capacity when appropriate. The business delivered record revenues of \u20ac1,673 million, up 28 per cent from 2020, with a sustained resurgence in the volume of flights and yields exceeding 2020 levels.\n\nIAG Cargo's people went above and beyond to find solutions to the global capacity crunch\n\nIn the second half of the year we saw momentum build. Capacity started to return, and the business began to take increasingly confident steps towards a more stable future as the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic gained ground. IAG Cargo also saw conversions from sea freight as shippers turned to air cargo to minimise the impact of supply chain disruption. We are still endeavouring to utilise available fleet and crew to align our network to cargo customer demand, with cargo-only flying.\n\n## Our people\n\nWe would not have achieved the results we did without the determination and creativity of our people, who faced the challenges of the pandemic head on. Our people have shown significant flexibility as they have adapted to the changing demands of the industry and business environment.\n\nWe are grateful for the key role our frontline operational colleagues have played, ensuring we were always delivering.

We aligned our network to customer demand, increasing frequencies on important trade routes.\n\nWe invested in improving the functionality of our online offering and expanded our partnerships with third-party platform providers. Both actions supported online channel shift and digital bookings whilst providing more flexibility to our customers.\n\nStrengthening our collaboration with our largest customers we launched our Global Partnership Programme, embarking on more strategic joint endeavours and aligning our sustainability ambitions. Supporting customers, we also enhanced our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) capabilities to provide more effective communications to help them build their businesses with us.\n\nCharters remained popular. In 2021 we operated 745 charters, opening new stations in Haiti, USA and Canada to service bespoke requests including keeping an automobile production line on schedule, keeping supermarket shelves stocked, supplying global communities with PPE and delivering ballot papers for elections. We also created further capacity for our charter customers by removing the seats from the cabins of three Airbus A330 LEVEL aircraft.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIAG Cargo partners with Kuehne+Nagel to complete its first charter chain from Stuttgart to Atlanta in the United States using Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)\n\nIAG Cargo announces it will grow its workforce with more than 500 new roles, in its biggest recruitment drive to date\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our planet\n\nIn 2021 our cold chain service, Constant Climate was responsible for shipping millions of doses of lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines to almost every corner of the world. IAG Cargo started a partnership with UNICEF, committing its support to the organisation's COVAX programme, the global effort aimed at providing equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nIn addition, IAG Cargo also funded several relief flights. Joining forces with British Airways, IAG Cargo's teams worked around the clock to transport emergency aid to Delhi to support the Indian government as the country battled rising COVID-19 cases with dwindling oxygen supplies. Working with the UK Government and UNICEF Spain, IAG Cargo helped support the recovery efforts in Haiti, flying 25 tonnes of aid to help the recovery efforts following the earthquake that struck the country in August 2021.\n\nWe are constantly looking at ways to reduce our impact on the environment whilst improving our customer offering and to that end, we were delighted to complete our first Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) charter chain of 16 flights from Stuttgart to Atlanta. Working with our partner Kuehne+Nagel, IAG Cargo sourced 1.2 million litres of sustainable aviation fuel. The collaboration marked the first time ever that passengerfreighter charter flights were operated with net zero carbon emissions.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nIn 2022 as passenger traffic numbers recover, our flexibility to optimise towards customer demand and provide bespoke solutions will become more constrained. We will work with our Group airlines to allocate capacity with the aim of maximising return from Group assets. The team at IAG Cargo is excited to enter 2022, starting a new and ambitious phase of activity.\n\nIn December 2021 we reached Practical Completion on our new Premium facility at London Heathrow, which will allow us to not only begin to increase capacity in 2022 also but add new product capability. Next year, we will also be investing in our pricing systems, distribution and the continued development of our people.",

We have added enhanced availability in business cabins for Premium Plus card members. This builds on the already industry-leading Companion Voucher card benefit and is proving popular with customers.\n\nIt has been a challenging year, particularly in the UK, managing the level of customer calls for redemption flight bookings during the changing travel restrictions globally.

The scale, complexity and challenge of this migration led to a delay in being able to reactivate some of the entry points for our customers to access their account for several days. Despite this challenge the migration was successful and this concludes the initiative to bring Group airline programmes onto a single, more capable and agile platform.\n\nWe created new innovative proprietary products, for example, the platform that enables customers earning Nectar points to exchange for Avios. We have seen strong engagement from customers to link their accounts and exchange.\n\nWe have recently announced a new agreement with Qatar Airways that will see Avios adopted as the currency of the Privilege Club, Qatar Airways' loyalty programme. This is a new and innovative way to globalise our currency. The new relationship will increase customer acquisition and value, through an enhanced earning and redemption proposition.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nOur business is in growth mode and ready to realise the full potential of loyalty for our customers and the Group.\n\nFocus and development in our technology and data capabilities will continue to enable deep digital expertise and delivery of best-in-class products.\n\nWe will be expanding the reach of the Avios currency globally by developing new ventures, delivery of new partnerships and earning opportunities for customers.",

It has adapted to the pandemic, seeking alternatives that have allowed it to maintain its operations and fulfil its raison d'\u00eatre: to connect the world and people.'\n\n## Business overview\n\nAt LEVEL we have played a crucial role in maintaining Barcelona's connectivity, adapting our operations to the varying restrictions, offering our clients an alternative choice of destinations. Reactivation commenced as soon the restrictions were lifted in our consolidated routes, peaking during the/uni00A0summer months when we attained 24 per cent of the seats flown to the United States out of Barcelona. Our commitment to air cargo allowed us to maintain operations in the most difficult months of the year. True to the model, we combined the most competitive fares with a boost in the sale of ancillary products. In addition, and thanks to the sale of connections with Vueling, we expanded the reach of our services. During the third quarter of the year, 16 per cent of sales were connecting flights. Despite facing\n\none of the most challenging years in aviation history, our commitment to the reactivation of the sector has strengthened our position in Barcelona.\n\n## Our people\n\nDestination equality. In 2021 we consolidated the team in Barcelona and solidified our way of doing things: disruptive thinking and a start-up culture to reinvent both processes and work dynamics. At LEVEL, diversity and inclusion run in our DNA, with 41 per cent of the senior roles held by women. During the month of March, we led an important campaign for gender equality: we focused our efforts to create an equalitarian company, being the first airline in adopting inclusive language in all our Spanish communications and empowering women to fly their way by creating a digital community to connect female travellers.\n\n## Our customers\n\nUnfortunately, during 2021 we were still forced to readjust our operations, which left many customers without their flight of choice. The high volume of requests meant it was not always possible to maintain the expected standard of quality. For that reason, we strengthened digital distribution and opted for 360\u00b0 communication channels that allowed us to be where we were needed: close to our customers. Since then, more than 30 per cent of enquiries were made through our\n\ndigital channels such as social networks, live chat, or chatbot. In 2021, we went a step further in the customisation of travel with LEVEL thanks to new web developments, which have allowed us to offer an easy and tailor-made experience. We have guaranteed very competitive departure prices and complementary products designed to meet the preferences of every customer. We launched flights to Punta Cana and Cancun to offer attractive alternatives to destinations opened to tourism.\n\n## Our planet\n\n## Optimise processes to reduce their\n\nenvironmental impact. We have worked to put technology at the centre, to improve efficiency and reduce waste. To that end, we designed a pre-order portal that has allowed us to adjust the amount of food we load to the specific demand on each flight. With this project, only what is going to be consumed is loaded on the plane, reducing leftovers and minimising waste.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nWe will continue to strengthen Barcelona as a hub between United States and Europe, reviewing every process and rethinking each aspect so that every trip on board LEVEL is the personalised, warm, and digital experience that the new generations demand.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We also saw reductions in the number of incidents affecting our customers and a decrease in the time to restore services. Progress was hampered though, by our need to support the business in responding to COVID-19, for example reducing investments to preserve cash. However,\n\nwe have maintained our focus on increasing the maturity of our cyber security capabilities, including strengthening our Security Operations Centre and the start of a new Group-wide identity and access management solution.\n\n## Our people\n\nWe have launched a new IAG Tech website as part of our strategy to create a thriving technology community that attracts and retains the very best talent. We now have over 1,500 active members of our guilds sharing best practice and knowledge, supported by a learning academy that is developing our future digital leaders. We also welcomed our second intake of graduates and apprentices.\n\nOur Digital Factory is rapidly deploying Robotic Process Automation and Low Code Solutions to automate processes and help our employees, for example, chatbots that can answer questions on our Ground Operations Manual. This automation is being accelerated through a Digital Champions network that identifies the opportunities and seeks to exploit this technology.\n\nWe continue to modernise our internal systems, for example, the upgrade of our call centre technology for British Airways in UK and Hong Kong. We are improving decision-making through use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics and dashboards including the deployment of a digital boardroom for our IAG GBS management team.\n\n## Our customers\n\nWe introduced a wide variety of solutions to assist with travel in a COVID-19 world including automating the validation of customers' travel documentation, preordering of onboard food and drink, and biometric boarding.\n\nOur omni-channel strategy saw the introduction of voice recognition, chatbots and WhatsApp used by our Iberia customers. In parallel, enhancements have been made to all .com platforms including dynamic pricing capability for fares and ancillaries. We increased self-service capabilities such as introducing disruption management onto airport kiosks. We also\n\nintroduced new distribution channels for our travel agent partners.\n\nWe have supported partnership launches and the delivery of the Global Loyalty Platform for Aer Lingus, Iberia and Vueling, providing a more customised and better experience for our customers.\n\nWe migrated Vueling onto our Salesforce platform which enabled us to deploy chatbots to handle routine tasks and answer many of our customer's questions. This resulted in a 60 per cent reduction in back office workload and improved customer satisfaction to over 90 per cent.\n\n## Our planet\n\nOur fifth Hangar 51 innovation accelerator platform explored how new technologies can help us meet our sustainability commitments, and improve operational efficiency, performance, safety, and customer experience.\n\nMany of our technology investments also contribute to our sustainability plan. This included investments in network, aircraft and operational planning systems to reduce the environmental footprint of our flights; the introduction of pre-ordering of food and drink onboard that has reduced waste; and the launch of three data centre migration programmes that will move all of our systems onto new infrastructure hosted in the cloud, providing enhanced resilience, performance and an 80 per cent lower CO2 footprint for our technology.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nWe have three main priorities in 2022, in our pursuit of Technology Excellence. We will accelerate the delivery of the new technology capabilities required to support the Group's transformation, including making significant progress on our data centre migration and replacing obsolescence. We will continue to embed and improve the IAG Tech operating model. We will continue to develop a culture where we value the diversity across our technology professionals, ensure that everyone feels included and is treated equally, and that we have a thriving and supportive community with a strong sense of belonging.",

As part of our commitment to ensure we are a diverse and inclusive organisation last year we set a new target of having at least 40 per cent of senior roles held by women by 2025.\n\nWe are determined to support the long-term prosperity of the communities we serve. In 2021, we continued to support countries' efforts to combat the pandemic by helping out wherever we could,\n\ntransporting vaccines and humanitarian aid to places that needed us most.\n\nTo ensure we fully understand our stakeholders' concerns, in 2021 we completed a comprehensive review using an independent, specialist third party, Simply Sustainable, to analyse 26 different environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics that are crucial to our operations. With these issues as the foundation, we then conducted 34 internal and external stakeholder interviews and gathered a further 131 responses from stakeholder surveys. We also benchmarked the results against industry peers.\n\nThe findings led to the production of two materiality matrices, over three-year and ten-year timescales respectively, with issues grouped into four different areas: People, Planet, Prosperity, and Governance. By aligning these with our strategic priorities and measuring our performance, we are best able to put all our stakeholders at the heart of our decision-making to ensure IAG can have a positive impact on society over the long term.\n\n\"We are determined to support the long-term prosperity of the communities we serve.\"\n\n## Contents of this section:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n65\n\nA.

Defining sustainability and material issues\n\nReference to GRI, TCFD and SASB standards:\n\nGRI 102-43, 102-44, 102-46, 102-47\n\nIn this context, sustainability covers both environmental and social issues.\n\nIAG's sustainability strategy, initiatives and reporting are based on a rigorous assessment of which business activities have a material impact on the environment and people and what is most important to key stakeholders.\n\nIn 2021, IAG repeated a comprehensive materiality assessment to assess these issues. This was facilitated by leading sustainability consultancy Simply Sustainable as an independent third party, with the scope as described in the introduction to this section.\n\nThe internal stakeholders included all IAG Management Committee members, certain Board members, and operating company sustainability representatives. External stakeholders included investors, corporate customers, policymakers, trade associations, fuel suppliers, airports, and NGOs. The materiality assessment was complemented by an ESG staff survey distributed in English and Spanish.\n\nThe results have informed our disclosures and strategy.\n\nTackling climate change remains our most material issue in the long run, and engagement with policymakers, customers and suppliers was identified as key to this effort. In the short term, as the business recovers from COVID-19, profitability and customer and employee engagement remain a high priority. In addition, wellbeing is a material issue and IAG has elevated its focus on this.\n\nWater consumption, biodiversity and light pollution were assessed as non-material for IAG. More information on water and biodiversity is available in the Additional Disclosures section of the Non-Financial Information Statement (NFIS).\n\nIAG does not have specific risk provisions, targets or guarantees related to these non-material issues.\n\n## Material issues as identified in 2021\n\nThe icons represent UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n## Principles of Governance\n\n- \u00b7  Investing in the future\n- \u00b7  Planning for climate-resilient operations\n- \u00b7  Working with suppliers\n\n## Planet\n\n- \u00b7  Reducing our climate impact\n- \u00b7  Influencing policy\n\n## Prosperity\n\n- \u00b7  Running a profitable business\n- \u00b7  Pleasing our customers\n\n## People\n\n- \u00b7  Engaging with employees\n- \u00b7  Building a diverse, inclusive and equal workplace\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe above four categories are aligned to best practice in the 2020 World Economic Forum 'Measuring Stakeholder Capitalism' report.\n\n## Changes in material issues to 2030\n\n| To 2023 (Three-year timeframe)   | To 2030 (Ten-year timeframe)              |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| 1  Running a profitable business | 1  Investing in the future                |\n| 2  Engaging with our employees   | 2  Reducing our climate impact            |\n| 3  Reducing our climate impact   | 3  Influencing policy                     |\n| 4 Pleasing our customers         | 4 Building a diverse, inclusive and equal |\n| 5  Investing in the future       | workplace                                 |\n| 6 Planning for climate-resilient | 5  Working with suppliers                 |\n| operations                       | 6 Pleasing our customers                  |\n\nNote: the most material issues are assessed using the combination of their importance to stakeholders, and their residual impact to the business after current mitigation plans.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

TCFD Governance a, b\n\n## Overview\n\nIAG has multiple levels of governance in place to ensure robust, aligned and progressive sustainability decision-making.\n\nIn 2021, IAG appointed a Chief People, Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Officer (CPCASO) to further drive forward environmental and social initiatives. The CPCASO is a member of the Management Committee and reports into the IAG CEO. The IAG Group Head of Sustainability and Group Head of People report into the CPCASO.\n\nThe Group sustainability strategy covers Group policies and objectives, governance structures, risk management, strategy and targets on material issues, sustainability performance indicators, and communications and stakeholder engagement plans. Each individual operating company within the Group has a distinct sustainability programme which is regularly reviewed to ensure alignment with the Group strategy.\n\nThe IAG Board provides oversight and direction for sustainability programmes. The IAG Management Committee provides the key forum for reviewing and challenging these programmes and setting strategy.\n\nKey governance structures include:\n\n- \u00b7  quarterly meetings of the Board Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility (SECR) Committee to provide dedicated oversight of the Group's sustainability programme and a link between the IAG and operating company management committees and the IAG Board;\n- \u00b7  quarterly meetings of the Sustainability Steering Group (SSG), comprised of senior representatives from each operating company and key IAG teams, to provide oversight of environmental and social initiatives and reporting;\n- \u00b7  monthly meetings of the IAG Sustainability Network, comprised of sustainability representatives from all operating companies, to share ideas and updates;\n- \u00b7  regular meetings of the SAF Steering Group and People Working Group reporting into the SSG; and\n- \u00b7  as part of the Group-wide Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process, bi-annual reporting of the principal sustainable aviation risks to the IAG Management Committee and Board's Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nInternal Group-wide policies related to sustainability help to ensure that wider decision-making aligns with the sustainability strategy. These include the Code of Conduct, Supplier Code of Conduct and specific policies on Environmental Sustainability, Modern Slavery, Anti-Bribery and Corruption, Equal Opportunities and Selection and Diversity. These are approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nIndividual airlines are also adopting ISO 14001-aligned internationally recognised environmental assessment and management tools. All four main airlines are working towards Stage 2 accreditation for the IATA Environmental Assessment (IEnvA) 1 management system. Only seven airlines worldwide have this accreditation. British Airways, Aer Lingus and Vueling have already achieved Stage 1 certification and Iberia plans to complete Stage 1 in 2022.\n\n## Reporting standards\n\nThe full contents of this sustainability report are included in the IAG NonFinancial Information Statement, which is third-party independently verified to limited assurance standards in line with ISAE3000 (Revised) 2 standards.\n\nIAG complies with current and emerging standards on sustainability reporting. These include obligations under EU Directive 2014/95/EU on non-financial reporting and its transposition in the UK and Spain, the 2018 UK Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) regulation, and the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and the EU Taxonomy Regulation (2020/852).\n\nIAG also goes beyond compliance requirements and voluntarily aligns sustainability reporting with the\n\nSustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the IATA Airlines Reporting Handbook, and relevant criteria from external ESG rating agencies. IAG supported IATA and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) to develop the IATA handbook.\n\nThis sustainability report has also been prepared in reference to GRI standards, which are listed under relevant section headings. Criteria for choosing specific standards are based on compliance with Spanish Law 11/2018 and on material issues. In cases where GRI alignment was not possible, other standards aligned to airline industry guidance or internal frameworks were used and described.\n\n## Data governance\n\nUnless otherwise stated:\n\n- \u00b7  The scope of environment performance data in this report includes all IAG airlines, subsidiaries and cargo operations over which IAG has operational control. This scope is consistent with environment-related policies and KPIs;\n- \u00b7  LEVEL, IAG Loyalty and IAG GBS functions are not in scope for environmental reporting as the environmental impacts of these business units are not material; and\n- \u00b7  Workforce data includes all IAG operating companies and support functions.\n\nEmissions data from intra-European flights is also independently verified within six months of the year end, for compliance with the UK and EU Emissions Trading Schemes (ETS), and for all flights for the UN Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).\n\nIn specific cases where full year data was not available, estimates have been applied based on business forecasts and data from prior months. Internal governance is in place to ensure that any estimations made are robust. Any prior year restatements are indicated next to relevant metrics with reasons provided.",

The Fleet team used updated carbon prices and price forecasts for shorthaul and longhaul fleet purchasing decisions.\n\nTo support management incentives, in 2020, climate-related incentives were agreed by IAG's MC, Remuneration Committee and Board so that 60 of the most senior executives across the Group, including the IAG CEO, would have a proportion of their annual incentives linked to achievement of annual carbon intensity targets. More details are in the report of the Remuneration Committee.\n\nTo support leadership in carbon disclosures, in 2021 IAG Investor Relations completed a survey of key IAG investors to identify their expectations, views on best practice in ESG reporting, and those ratings they prioritise. IAG plans to engage with relevant rating agencies in 2022 to enable more accurate calculations of IAG's scores and to identify actions to improve the scores.\n\nIAG is the only airline group worldwide to receive three leadership (A-/A) grades from CDP in the past five years and in 2021 received the joint-highest score of any airline from the Transition Pathways Initiative (TPI), which assesses companies' readiness for a lowcarbon economy.\n\n## A.4.

TCFD Governance a, b, Strategy a, b, c, Risk Management a, b, c\n\nSustainable aviation risks have been collectively identified as one of IAG's principal risks.\n\nIn 2021, IAG received 'A' grades from CDP for its climate risk and opportunities disclosures to CDP. This response is available on the IAG website.\n\nClimate-related risks are considered and assessed under the Group Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework which is presented to the Board. More details on the framework and process for how risks are assessed, and how Group risks inter-relate, can be found in the 'Risk Management, Principal risks and uncertainties' section.\n\nSustainability risks and opportunities, including climate-related risks and opportunities, are also identified and assessed by the Group Sustainability team, in conjunction with the Group ERM team. This assessment includes risks over medium-term (two to five years) and long-term (greater than five years) timescales.\n\nSustainability enterprise risks are biannually reported to and reviewed by the\n\nIAG Management Committee and the IAG Audit and Compliance Committee. Detailed sustainability risks and opportunities are also reported to the IAG CPCASO who reports to the IAG CEO. Plans to mitigate risks are developed by relevant risk owners in specific areas of the business.\n\nSustainability risk assessments have informed specific decisions related to business operations and strategy, and IAG allocates significant resources to environmental risk management. Examples include:\n\n- \u00b7  IAG has maintained its commitment to invest in SAF development, production and supply as part of its 20-year US$400 million (\u20ac360 million) SAF commitment, to manage climate policy risks and take advantage of energyrelated opportunities;\n- \u00b7  in 2018, TCFD-aligned scenario analysis identified a need for more ambitious action on climate change, which led to the 2019 decision to design and adopt the industry-leading Flightpath Net Zero strategy to deliver net zero emissions byy 2050;\n- \u00b7  in 2021, IAG set a new net zero target by 2050 for Scope 3 emissions and IAG GBS appointed EcoVadis to help to track supplier sustainability performance and mitigate supply chain-related sustainability risks; and\n- \u00b7  all operating airlines to work towards Stage 2 accreditation of the environmental management system IEnvA 1 , including investments in people and IT systems, to manage environmental compliance risks.\n\nIAG is committed to mitigating the impacts of hazards which, if they occur, have uncertain but potentially negative outcomes on the environment or people. As such, IAG adopts precautionary measures to mitigate these hazards, an approach known as the precautionary principle. The precautionary principle is applied to the planning of operations and the development and launch of new services, by integrating climate considerations into business plans and financial forecasts and aligning activities with the Flightpath Net Zero strategy.\n\nDetailed mitigation for climate-related risks is outlined in Section B.1.\n\n| Related risk: Environmental regulation compliance Risk description                                                                                                                              | Mitigating actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| An inadvertent breach of compliance requirements related to ESG  reporting, emissions or waste management, or other  environmental issues, leading to fines and potential reputational  damage. | \u00b7  Strengthening sustainability governance including reviews of  annual disclosures via the Audit and Compliance Committee \u00b7  Internal governance, training and assigning ownership for  environmental compliance obligations \u00b7  Working towards IEnvA 1  accreditation to improve internal |",

This applies both to the goal of achieving net zero by 2050 and to pathways aligned to the science. IAG sees both gross and net reductions in emissions as crucial elements of aviation decarbonisation, supports the mechanisms of fleet modernisation, airspace and operational efficiency, sustainable aviation fuels, carbon pricing schemes and voluntary offsets and removals, and advocates for effective policies to promote\n\nthose that are effective, and fair, and ideally global. IAG also supports the principle of carbon pricing, which is to drive emissions reductions where they are most cost-effective. IAG does not support carbon taxes as it has been proven that these are environmentally inefficient.\n\nIAG has internal governance to ensure that wider stakeholder engagement on sustainability is consistent with its material issues and environmental goals.\n\n| Stakeholders                    | Why we engage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Key 2021 activities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Industry associations           | \u00b7  To develop common policy positions \u00b7  To improve advocacy effectiveness \u00b7  To ensure consistency between IAG  sustainability goals and the goals of  associations of which IAG or operating  airlines are members  \u00b7  To share environmental and policy  expertise to drive a more sustainable | \u00b7  Supporting IATA industry commitment to  net zero emissions \u00b7  Key inputs to A4E 'Destination 2050'  roadmap to net zero for aviation \u00b7  Coordinated  one world roadmap to net  zero and 10% SAF by 2030 commitment \u00b7  Working group for new 2030 and 2040  emissions targets for UK aviation industry |\n| Government and other regulators | \u00b7  To support UK and EU commitments to  net zero emissions \u00b7  To build support for a net zero emissions  target for aviation through the UN  aviation regulator ICAO                                                                                                                              | for 55' climate policies \u00b7  Responses to UK SAF Mandate and Jet  Zero Consultations \u00b7  IAG staff chair two of four groups of the  UK Jet Zero Council (JZC) \u00b7  Direct advocacy with EU policymakers                                                                                                      |\n| Customers                       | \u00b7  To demonstrate IAG's sustainability  commitments to action, initiatives and  leadership \u00b7  To facilitate passenger action on the                                                                                                                                                               | \u00b7  British Airways, Aer Lingus, Iberia and  Vueling continued and updated  sustainability communications to  customers                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Workforce                       | \u00b7  To align individual airline sustainability  programmes with Group \u00b7  To share ideas and best practice \u00b7  To respond to demands from internal  stakeholders \u00b7  To drive positive employee engagement \u00b7  To improve recruitment and retention                                                    | \u00b7  Occupational Health and Engagement  Surveys across the Group \u00b7  Frequent sustainability presentations at  internal forums \u00b7  Vueling created a new Vision, Mission and  Values which included sustainability                                                                                          |",

Supports SDG 12\n\nIn 2021, IAG led the industry by becoming the first airline group worldwide to extend its net zero commitment to its supply chain. The Group will liaise with, support and monitor suppliers to ensure net zero emissions by 2050 for products and services provided to IAG.\n\nIAG Global Business Services (IAG GBS) manages the relationships and interactions with suppliers on behalf of the Group. This important supply chain sustainability programme is being delivered by the IAG GBS Group Procurement Team, with relationship owners and buyers closely involved in the collaboration with suppliers.\n\n## Opportunities for impact\n\nThe Group supply chain covers approximately 13,272 suppliers across every category. Working with key partners, including fuel suppliers, the business will target Scope 3 net zero emissions by 2050, and a 20 per cent reduction by 2030 relative to 2019. In 2021, Scope 3 emissions are 23 per cent of IAG's total CO2 and 68 per cent of Scope 3 emissions relate to fuel and energy.\n\nIn 2021 the Group appointed EcoVadis, a market-leading provider of business sustainability ratings, to support us in understanding every aspect of sustainability in our supply chain, including environment, labour and human rights, and ethics.\n\n## From insight to action\n\nTransparency in sustainable supply chain performance is right at the top of the IAG GBS Procurement agenda. We will work with EcoVadis to assess our suppliers against a range of measures and identify opportunities to improve our sustainable performance. This will give IAG, and its suppliers, a baseline for collaboration on emissions reduction and achievement of the Scope 3 targets. We want to work with suppliers who share our vision and want to join us in this vitally important work. Additionally, suppliers can share the findings of the EcoVadis assessment with their other customers via a simple scorecard, meaning that the overall impact of this work could reach well beyond IAG.\n\nThe Supply Chain Sustainability Programme includes four other key pillars:\n\n- \u00b7  Code of Conduct\n- \u00b7  Risk screening\n- \u00b7  Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Audits\n- \u00b7  Joint programmes to promote sustainability initiatives\n\nThe IAG GBS Supplier Code of Conduct clarifies the standards of behaviour expected from all suppliers working with any part of our business, emphasising the importance of sustainability. It has already been issued to the existing supply chain and integrated into the supplier onboarding process. IAG will only work with businesses that share our standards and ways of working.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSocial and corporate governance is also a high priority. We expect our suppliers to provide a safe and healthy environment for their workforce. Supplier selection considers potential industry and geographical risk and where necessary on-site audits are carried out. These audits are performed by independent inspectors with CSR expertise using the SEDEX Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) methodology. In 2021, 30 audits were completed.\n\nAs a minimum, all suppliers undergo bi-annual screening for any legal, social, environmental and financial risks. The Procurement and Compliance Teams assess any suppliers identified as having potentially higher levels of risk and implement a mitigation plan where necessary. Any issues are flagged to the risk owners within the Group to jointly take appropriate action.\n\nIn 2022, sustainability will be a key part of the IAG GBS continuous transformation plan. As well as continuing the measures outlined above, the plan includes embedding sustainability KPIs into procurement processes and the criteria for awarding new business to suppliers. We are also developing a wider training programme for employees, building sustainability awareness and driving higher sustainability performance across the entire organisation.\n\n|   Year | Total number of  suppliers   | Suppliers screened   | Suppliers with  additional compliance  assessment   | Critical suppliers under  regular risk monitoring   |   Independent CSR  Audits in year |\n|--------|------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|   2021 | 13,272                       | 13,272               | 1,510                                               | 34                                                  |                                30 |\n|   2020 | 22,947                       | 22,947               | 1,818                                               | 35                                                  |                                25 |\n|   2019 | 27,033                       | 18,369               | 2,912                                               | n/a                                                 |                                28 |\n\n## Related risk: Supply chain sustainability compliance\n\nRisk description/impact\n\nMitigating actions\n\nPotential breach of compliance on sustainability, human rights or anti-bribery by an IAG supplier resulting in financial penalties, legal, environmental, social and/or reputational impacts.\n\n- \u00b7  IAG GBS procedures including Integrity, sanctions and CSR audits, IAG Know Your Counterparty due diligence for higher-risk third parties, Supplier Code of Conduct\n- \u00b7  Internal governance on supplier management to identify challenges and mitigation actions\n- \u00b7  Supplier screening using external business intelligence databases which actively monitor supplier status and flag risks including sustainability",

Mandatory training and communications activities are carried out for Directors, employees and third parties on a regular basis to maintain awareness and understanding of the principles that govern the conduct of the Group.\n\nIf any employee has a concern about unethical behaviour or organisational integrity, they are encouraged to first speak with their manager or a member of the Legal, Compliance or Human Resources teams. Similarly, suppliers are encouraged to contact their primary contact within the business. IAG maintains Speak Up channels provided by independent third-party providers, Safecall and Ethicspoint, where concerns can be raised on an anonymous basis. These Speak Up channels are available to members of staff as well as suppliers, with information on how to access published in the Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct respectively.\n\nThe IAG Audit and Compliance Committee reviews the effectiveness of the Speak Up channels on an annual basis. This annual review considers the volume of reports by category; timeliness of follow-up; process and responsibility for follow-up; emerging themes and lessons; and any issues raised of significance to the financial statements or reputation of the Group or other areas of compliance.\n\nIn 2021, a total of 164 Speak Up reports were received via the Group's independently provided Speak Up facilities, compared with 193 in 2020.\n\nThese reports concerned issues relating to employment matters (60 per cent), dishonest behaviour/reputation (14 per cent), health and safety (23 per cent) and regulatory matters (2 per cent). All reports were followed up and investigated where appropriate.\n\n## Anti-corruption and anti-money laundering\n\nIAG and its operating companies do not tolerate any form of bribery or corruption. This is made clear in the Group Code of Conduct and supporting policies which are available to all Directors and employees. An anti-bribery policy statement is also set out in our Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\nEach Group operating company has a Compliance Department responsible for managing the anti-bribery programme in their business. The compliance teams from across the Group meet regularly through Working Groups and Steering Groups, under the IAG General Counsel, and annually they conduct a review of bribery risks at operating company and Group level.\n\nIn 2021, the main risks identified were unchanged from the previous year and relate to the use of third parties, operational and commercial decisions involving government agencies, and the inappropriate use of gifts and hospitality. No material compliance breaches were identified in 2021.\n\nAnti-bribery and corruption training is mandatory for all relevant personnel in IAG operating companies, Group functions and the Board and takes the form of e-learning\n\nsupplemented by face-to-face sessions as necessary. Individual training requirements are set by each operating company and function and are determined by factors such as the level and responsibilities of an employee. The Group-wide anti-bribery e-learning was rolled out in 2019. Employees are required to complete this every three years. In 2021, 1,404 employees completed the anti-bribery e-learning, This lower number is as expected due to those employees who have previously completed the training not being required to retrain.\n\nTo identify, manage and mitigate potential bribery and corruption risks, IAG uses risk-based-third-party due diligence which includes screenings, external reports, interviews and site visits depending on the level of risk that a third party presents. Any risks identified during the due diligence process are analysed and a mitigation plan put in place as necessary. Certain risks could result in termination of the proposed or existing relationship with the counterparty. The IAG Audit and Compliance Committee receives an annual update on the anti-bribery compliance programme.\n\nThere were no legal cases regarding corruption brought against the Group and its operating companies in 2021 and management is not aware of any impending cases or underlying issues.\n\nIAG has processes and procedures in place across the Group, such as supplier vetting and management, Know Your Counterparty procedures and financial policies and controls which help to combat money laundering in the business.\n\n|                                              | vly   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Employees completing anti-bribery e-learning | -29%  | 1,404  | 1,984  | 7,933  |",

Strategy - scenario analysis\n\n## Reference to GRI, TCFD and SASB standards: TCFD Strategy c\n\nIn 2021, IAG conducted analyses modelling climate risk scenarios. These included ongoing analysis of climate mitigation to 2050, detailed modelling of the impacts of the EU Fit for 55 proposals to 2035; and TCFD-aligned scenario analysis under a timeframe of 2030.\n\nTCFD analysis is a formal process to identify ways to strengthen organisational resilience in the face of climate change and related impacts. TCFD guidance outlines a six-step process, where scenarios assess climate-related impacts on business input costs, operating costs, revenues, supply chain, and business interruption. Potential responses are then mapped out in terms of changes to business model/s, portfolio mix, investments in transition capabilities and technologies and the potential impact on strategic and financial plans.\n\nCompanies choose emissions scenarios for this analysis. In 2018 IAG chose a 4\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C scenario. In 2021, a 3\u00b0C, 1.5\u00b0C orderly 1 , and 1.5\u00b0C disorderly scenario were used. This change was based on the impacts of the latest global emission pledges versus the goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement.\n\nScenario workshops were hosted virtually to engage IAG representatives in the UK, Ireland and Spain. A wide range of teams were represented including Strategy, Treasury, Finance, Government Affairs, Commercial Planning, Investor Relations, People, IAG Tech, IAG GBS, IAG Loyalty and sustainability representatives from all operating airlines.\n\nFour categories of TCFD-aligned climate impacts were explored - physical, market, technology, and policy.\n\n## B.1.3.

Sustainability risk management'\n\nSee 'Risk management, Principal risks and uncertainties'\n\nIAG takes a proactive approach to managing climate-related risks and is committed to managing the regulatory, reputational, market and technology aspects of these.\n\nIn 2021, IAG Sustainability and the ERM team undertook a review of all climaterelated risks and opportunities. This was informed by the materiality assessment and TCFD scenario analysis.\n\nA revised summary of risks, trends and potential impacts over short-, mediumand long-term timescales are disclosed on the next page. The risk environment has changed and this is reflected in the updated set of risks.\n\nTrends and the external environment continue to be reviewed on an ongoing basis. Mitigating actions are also reviewed on an ongoing basis. Carbon reduction targets are the key measures for assessing\n\nThis exercise identified that key potential impacts were industry-wide policy and market shifts. Significant uncertainty also exists around the global policy, technology and market pathways for aligning with 1.5\u00b0C by 2030.\n\nThe business is broadly resilient to the identified impacts, based on Flightpath Net Zero plans. However, there are further opportunities to maximise resilience to wider societal changes. These results informed our climate-related risk assessment and disclosures.\n\nIn December 2021, the SSG also agreed that TCFD-aligned scenario analysis would become a rolling exercise from 2022 onwards. Ten year time horizons would be further embedded into sustainabilityrelated planning wherever relevant.\n\nthe mitigation of these risks and other measures will be reviewed.",

The IAG Flightpath Net Zero strategy included a 30-year emissions roadmap to meet this outcome as well as short- and medium-term targets and a commitment to climate-related management incentives. The roadmap currently informs ongoing scenario analysis, planning, strategy, and risk management. The latest scenario is shown below with key assumptions on the next page.\n\nIAG has also been a leader in developing aviation industry transition plans. It was the first airline group to support roadmaps to net zero emissions across national, regional and global industry alliances, one of only two airlines worldwide to engage in both the SBTi Technical Working Group for aviation targets and the road-testing of the SBTi Net Zero Standard, and one of only three airlines to be acknowledged in the ATAG Waypoint 2050 work on global aviation decarbonisation. In 2021, via industry association SA, IAG staff helped to develop and launch the first 2030 and 2040 climate targets for UK aviation: 20% and 40% net reductions respectively.\n\nIAG will continue working with multiple industry partners, regulators, and stakeholders on pathways for aviation that support global 1.5\u00b0C ambitions, and to increase the ability of the industry to deliver emissions reductions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIAG is working to increase the contribution of gross emissions reductions to the net zero target.

In this context, net zero emissions means that all CO2 that IAG operations emit in a year will be balanced out by an equivalent amount of CO2 removed from the atmosphere.\n\nIAG will review targets on non-CO2 impacts when the science around these becomes robust enough to attribute impacts and reductions to individual airlines. Key actions to reduce non-CO2 impacts include greater uptake of SAF and route optimisation, and IAG continues to explore these solutions through its trade associations.\n\nIAG GBS is developing supply chain sustainability targets in conjunction with EcoVadis. To meet Scope 3 targets IAG will focus on influencing change, identifying collaborative emissions reduction projects and phasing in contractual requirements. Some suppliers will use a combination of gross and net reductions to meet their own targets and IAG plans to report more detail on this balance in future.\n\nIAG remains committed to science-aligned targets. Independent guidance on 1.5\u00b0C-aligned targets for aviation has yet to be published and we will review future guidance to ensure it accounts for the practical differences between aviation and other sectors. Where possible, we will also work with the SBTi and other relevant stakeholders to build understanding of these differences and of industry decarbonisation pathways.\n\nIAG will continue working with other stakeholders to enable delivery of targets.\n\n## Current transition plan targets:\n\n| Base  year                                                                 | Target  year                                                               | Target                                                                                                           |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2020                                                                       | 2020                                                                       | Net zero CO2 emissions for all British Airways UK domestic flights from 2020 onwards.

Based on the latest carbon roadmap, these represent 80 per cent of total emission reductions in the year 2050. There are four main methods of achieving these reductions:\n\n- \u00b7  Modernising the aircraft fleet. Purchasing the latest aircraft models like the Airbus A320neo, Boeing 777 and Airbus A350, which are up to 40 per cent more efficient than aircraft they replace, whilst retiring older aircraft;\n- \u00b7  Optimising the use and efficiency of the aircraft fleet. For example, optimising flightpaths, allocating fuel-efficient aircraft to specific routes and implementing in-flight efficiency initiatives which save fuel without compromising safety, service or flight schedules. These initiatives include optimised engine washes, single-engine taxiing, continuous descents, landing flaps and reducing weight onboard;\n- \u00b7  Increasing the use of cleaner energy sources in the fleet. For example, use of SAF displaces fossil fuel use and delivers lower CO2 emissions over a comparable lifecycle.

IAG has a long-standing SAF commitment, having committed in 2017 to invest $400 million in SAF over 20 years, and is targeting use of at least 19 million tonnes of SAF between now and 2040 based on the latest roadmap.\n\nIAG is a leader in the development of SAF projects not only through committed purchases of SAF, but also by making direct investments in new and innovative SAF production capacity, spurring the wider development of the SAF market. The Group's investments are backed up with SAF purchase agreements which are critical to the financeability of the new SAF production capacity. IAG has also been leading the industry at developing and advocating for 'second-generation' SAF, which use carbon-rich waste feedstocks and advanced conversion technologies, as opposed to first-generation SAF which is predominantly manufactured using crop feedstocks.\n\n2021 was a significant year for the Group SAF programme. It remains on track with a total of \u20ac8.6m million invested in SAF\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nagreements. British Airways, Iberia and Vueling all operated flights using SAF blends, and IAG airlines had uptakes of mandated SAF volumes in Norway and Sweden.\n\nKey firsts for the Group:\n\n- \u00b7  Managing the import of the UK's first ever bulk SAF to supply IAG Cargo to operate the world's first net zero cargo\n- charter flights between Stuttgart, Heathrow and Atlanta for its customer/uni00A0Kuehne+Nagel; and\n- \u00b7  Developing the partnership with the UK refiner Phillips 66 to develop the UK's first SAF production facility, with British Airways the first airline in the world to receive SAF from this facility from 2022.\n\n## Some current SAF projects:\n\nIAG continues to work with technology developers to establish a range of SAF supply options for the future. Below are some of the projects that are in the public domain and we continue to develop others including carbon capture projects.\n\nPlanned\n\n| Project/Partner                 | Feedstock                     | Production location   | production start   |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|\n| IAG Cargo/Neste                 | Used cooking oil (UCO)        | Europe                | 2021 one-off       |\n| COP26/AirBP                     | UCO                           | Europe                | 2021 one-off       |\n| Phillips 66/Phillips 66         | UCO/Food waste                | Humber, UK            | 2022               |\n| Freedom Pines/LanzaJet          | Agricultural wastes           | Georgia, USA          | 2023               |\n| one world/Aemetis               | Waste wood                    | California, USA       | 2024               |\n| Project Dragon/LanzaTech        | Waste gases and agriculture   | South Wales, UK       | 2025               |\n| Bayou Fuels/Velocys*            | Forestry residues             | Missisippi, USA       | 2026               |\n| Speedbird/LanzaTech/NovaPangea* | Waste wood, forestry residues | UK                    | 2026               |\n| Altalto/Velocys*                | Municipal waste               | Immingham, UK         | 2027               |\n\n- *includes carbon capture and storage.",

Supports SDGs 7, 9, 13\n\nNet/out-of-sector emissions reductions are a critical part of aviation decarbonisation pathways, as airlines proactively lay the groundwork for faster reductions in gross emissions in future.\n\nIAG sees carbon offset projects as key to reducing its emissions in the short and medium term, en route to full use of carbon removals in 2050 to mitigate any residual emissions.\n\nIAG is delivering net reductions via three key channels:\n\n- \u00b7  Through the EU-regulated Emissions Trading Scheme, purchasing carbon allowances from other sectors which drives and funds additional emission reduction projects. Airlines have been participating since 2013;\n- \u00b7  Through the UN-regulated CORSIA scheme, investing in a combination of fleet modernisation, efficiency, SAF and offsets to meet the global goal of keeping net international aviation emissions at or below 2019 levels; and\n- \u00b7  Through voluntary funding of internationally verified offset or carbon removal ('negative emissions') projects in the UK, Europe and around the world. This funding can either come from customers who choose to mitigate the\n\nimpact of their flights, or from IAG or operating companies funding projects directly. British Airways has offered voluntary offsetting since 2003.\n\nWhen IAG or operating companies choose to voluntarily invest in carbon avoidance and removal projects, they work in collaboration with key partners, carry out due diligence to select reputable providers and select projects carefully to meet and align with verified quality standards such as Gold Standard- and Verified Carbon Standard (VCS)-verified carbon reduction projects.\n\n2021 projects included rainforest protection in Cambodia, Peru and the Congo Basin, and sustainable cook stoves for communities in Sudan and Malawi.\n\nIAG will be required to purchase credits for CORSIA when global emissions from international flights rise above 2019 levels.\n\n## Key 2021 progress:\n\n- \u00b7  IAG contributed to a landmark report by McKinsey and the Coalition for Negative Emissions outlining the Case for Negative Emissions and the need for urgent government action to develop supportive carbon removals policy;\n\n| Metric                              | Unit       | vly   | v2019   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   |\n|-------------------------------------|------------|-------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Net emissions reduction through     |            |       |         |        |        |        |        |        |\n| EU, UK, Swiss ETS                   | '000 tCO2e | n/a   | -93%    | 219    | 0*     | 3,182  | 2,634  | nr     |\n| Via voluntary funding and  projects | '000 tCO2e | +17%  | n/a     | 197    | 168    | nr     | nr     | nr     |\n\n- * Emissions levels in 2020 were below the EU ETS sector cap for aviation so no net reductions were delivered.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7  British Airways and Aer Lingus continued to offer voluntary carbon offsetting for passengers and Iberia created a carbon calculator to enable passengers to establish their carbon impact; and\n- \u00b7  The British Airways Carbon Fund, in partnership with not-for-profit charity Pure Leapfrog, worked to deliver four high-quality carbon reduction projects in the UK and Africa.

Innovation\n\nIAG invests in innovation to meet its targets, drive decarbonisation in the Group and to accelerate wider change towards a more sustainable industry.\n\nHangar 51 is IAG's core innovation platform, which continues to attract the world's top emerging technology companies working on sustainability solutions.\n\nIAG also has established governance processes to review new potential investments in emerging climate technology and partnerships with startups. This process is overseen by the CSO, CFO, CIO and General Counsel.\n\nIAG supports climate technology innovation via its accelerator, incubator, venture capital investments, university collaborations, active pilots, supporting applications for grant funding, and research and development consortia.\n\nIAG representatives also sit on academic boards and public-private partnerships to support new technologies and innovation. For example, IAG staff sit on the UK Government's Jet Zero Council, academic boards (Cranfield and Heriot Watt Universities), the Aston Supergen consortium, and the Steering Board of the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC). Iberia continues the La C\u00e1tedra Iberia research collaboration with the Polytechnical University of Madrid.\n\nIn 2019, the Group launched the first dedicated sustainability accelerator in the aviation industry. In 2021, the focus of this broadened with the inclusion of a new Future Energy category. From hundreds of applications the Group chose to work with 12 pioneering start-ups covering topics such as new hydrogen fuel cell solutions, electrification infrastructure, customer engagement tools and carbon removal technologies.\n\nIn 2022, the Group will continue to expand its focus on sustainability innovation to accelerate decarbonisation.\n\n## B.1.10. Sustainable products and services\n\nIAG offers customers including corporates a range of sustainable products and services to help them to reduce their carbon emissions and to support wider sustainability goals. These goals include community development and protecting biodiversity.\n\nWithin the Group, British Airways currently has the widest range of sustainability offers available for customers and has offered voluntary carbon offsets since 2003.\n\nThe British Airways Carbon Fund delivers carbon reduction projects in the UK and Africa with community co-benefits. British Airways receives no revenue from this fund.\n\n## Spotlight: new waste targets\n\nIn 2021 IAG developed and approved new '5 through 2025' waste targets.

In 2021, IAG set new and comprehensive waste reduction targets as outlined on the previous page.\n\nThe '5 through 2025' waste strategy is expected to save approximately 20,000 tonnes a year from landfill and incineration\n\ncompared to 47,728 tonnes sent to landfill or incineration in 2019.\n\nThis strategy covers the five core areas of single-use plastic (SUP), onboard, office, cargo, and maintenance waste. Separate reduction and recycling targets are applied to all four airlines and to IAG Cargo.\n\nIAG plans to report detailed progress against these targets in 2022. Currently, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic make it difficult to establish meaningful year-on-year trends.\n\nIAG will also advocate to national governments and via IATA for clear and supportive waste policies which would enable the Group to be more ambitious.\n\n## Key 2021 progress:\n\n- \u00b7  IAG airlines worked together to identify common sustainable solutions for Group cutlery, to comply with the EU SUP ban which entered into force in July 2021;\n- \u00b7  British Airways and Iberia launched new services (Buy-Before-You-Fly and DeliverFly) to give passengers the choice of buying fresh and ambient products before departure. These services remove food waste from unpurchased shorthaul economy meals while maintaining customer choice;\n- \u00b7  Vueling developed an internal dashboard to track waste and set a target to segregate 60% of onboard waste by 2023; and\n- \u00b7  IAG Cargo increased recycling rates by 6 per cent at both the London and Dublin hubs.\n\n## Waste commentary:\n\nOnboard services are IAG's main source of waste. Key inputs include onboard meals and amenity kits supplied to passengers, and key outputs include plastic packaging, leftover food waste, drinks cans, and cabin items such as wrappers. Waste is typically offloaded and processed at airports by third-party caterers, with some materials recovered on-site and other materials incinerated or sent to landfill. The majority of cabin and catering waste is processed at IAG's hub airports - London Heathrow, Dublin, Madrid and Barcelona.\n\nWaste regulations limit the amount which can be recycled. For example, Irish regulations require specific categories of onboard waste to be incinerated.\n\nIAG supports innovation to minimise waste. For example, as part of the 2020 Hangar 51 platform, Iberia worked with Countalytics to track its flows of onboard waste and develop better onboard services.\n\n| Metric                                              | Unit        | vly   | v2019   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Onboard waste at hub airports                       | '000 tonnes | -7%   | -54%    | 12.3   | 13.2   | 27.0   |\n| Onboard waste generated per passenger at hubs       | kg/pax      | -19%  | +42%    | 0.47   | 0.58   | 0.33   |\n| Overall waste (onboard, office, maintenance, cargo) | '000 tonnes | -10%  | -54%    | 27.6   | 30.6   | 60.2   |\n| Overall recycled and recovered                      | %           | +6%   | +9%     | 30%    | 24%    | 21%    |\n\nNote: 2019 and 2020 values have been restated due to a more rigorous methodology aligned to GRI standards.\n\n| Metric                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Commentary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Waste/pax at  hubs               | \u00b7  Onboard catering waste generated per passenger,  including volumes later recycled and recovered. \u00b7  Passenger numbers are based on those inbound and  outbound passengers who have their waste processed  at hub airports London Heathrow and Gatwick, Madrid,  Barcelona and Dublin. | Onboard waste generated per passenger decreased in  2021 due to more predictable passenger behaviour and a  reduced share of longhaul flying, which has more  comprehensive onboard meal services.

Supports SDGs 3, 11\n\nIAG remains committed to reducing the impact of aircraft noise and air pollution on local communities near airports.\n\nThe average noise per journey - per landing and take-off cycle - has reduced by 19 per cent in the past five years. Due to the early retirement of Airbus A340s and B747s in 2020, an 8 per cent drop in average noise per sector was achieved in 2021 alone, almost meeting the 10 per cent noise reduction target set for 2025.\n\nIAG will update noise targets in 2022.\n\nOperating companies continue to work to minimise noise impacts. They regularly monitor noise and air quality performance using national databases and global aircraft noise standards. Improvements are driven via fleet modernisation and specific operational practices like continuous descents. Airlines also engage with stakeholders such as community groups, regulators and industry partners and\n\nparticipate in research and operational trials.\n\nIAG supports innovation to reduce noise impacts. In 2021, Iberia participated in the EU AVIATOR project to better understand air pollution impacts at airports using research on real aircraft. In 2022 a testing campaign will be carried out using SAF.\n\nDetailed descriptions on all noise metrics are available in the IAG NFIS.\n\n| Metric          | Unit          | Vly   | v2019   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   |\n|-----------------|---------------|-------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Noise per cycle | QC per LTO    | -8%   | -12%    | 0.88   | 0.96   | 1.00   | 1.07   | 1.06   |\n| NOx per cycle   | kg per LTO    | -8%   | -1%     | 9.10   | 9.84   | 9.23   | 9.71   | nr     |\n| ICAO Chapter 14 | % at standard | -2%   | +3%     | 56%    | 58%    | 53%    | 50%    | 46%    |\n| CAEP Chapter 6  | % at standard | 0%    | +2%     | 80%    | 80%    | 78%    | 74%    | 69%    |\n| CAEP Chapter 8  | % at standard | 3%    | +8%     | 43%    | 40%    | 35%    | 29%    | 26%    |\n\n% at standard is based on the fleet position at the end of 2021, including parked aircraft and excluding leased aircraft.

Workforce overview\n\n## Reference to GRI, TCFD and SASB standards: GRI 403-4, 408-1, 409-1\n\n## Supports SDG 12\n\n2021 has been another challenging year for the Group and for our colleagues as we continue to navigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, aligning our resourcing levels to the operational needs of the business, ensuring we are ready to take advantage of opportunities as restrictions are lifted, and ensuring we protect the safety and wellbeing of colleagues and customers.\n\nIAG aims to create an environment in which employees feel motivated, safe and able to thrive as this is central to the continued success of the Group. Core principles in the Code of Conduct include fair and equal treatment, nondiscrimination, fairness and respect for human rights. This Code applies to all Directors, managers and employees of the Group and e-learning training to support it is mandatory and applicable to all employees and Directors. In addition to the Code of Conduct, individual operating companies have responsibility for policies and procedures relating to their employees, including appropriate reward frameworks to ensure they can continue to attract and retain the best talent for every role.\n\nAt the end of 2021, 56,658 people were employed across the Group in 81 countries, a decline of 2 per cent in the year. Our voluntary turnover rate for 2021 was 5 per cent compared with 15 per cent in 2020, a change that reflects the completion of the necessary resizing of the business in response to COVID-19 but also giving some indication of new hiring and role creation in 2021. The necessary changes put in motion in 2020 and 2021 have positioned the business to a place which has allowed us to safeguard jobs in key areas of the business and take advantage of the opportunities as travel restrictions ease.\n\nAs the business pivots towards recovery from COVID-19, there has been a key emphasis and focus on maintaining and retaining employees during 2021 - which is reflective in our workforce measures. There has been no material change in our\n\nheadcount position compared to 2020 and there is some evidence of headcount growth in areas where we have seen a more regular pattern of flying return. As the world begins to open there is the expectation that our recovery will continue into 2022 and this will be reflected within our workforce population and composition.\n\nAs public health guidance changed and in line with operational requirements, employees across the Group started returning to our offices and our operating companies have taken approaches to coordinate and support the safe and flexible return of our employees. Our operating companies have promoted a balanced, flexible and hybrid working model which enables the right balance between flexibility whilst bringing the benefits of being together as a team. At Aer Lingus this is being promoted as 'hybrid working' and is guided by the principles that people are expected to develop the right balance between home and office working, reflecting role requirements and personal circumstances. Similarly, British Airways has recently introduced a hybrid model of working, which allows employees to create a mix of remote and office working which is right for them based around the concept of 'neighbourhood' communities for teams and hot-desking. Iberia has also welcomed back employees to its offices and has an individualised return to work programme for teams - launching targeted managerial and all employee guidance and mandatory training for all employees.\n\nOperating companies have also been making considerable investments in the workplace and both Vueling and IAG Loyalty have recently modernised and moved into new office facilities. These new facilities have been created to foster a more open and modern office environment which will help to facilitate collaboration and communication between teams.\n\nMeasures to support employee satisfaction and talent management are primarily managed within operating companies and each operating company has its own\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nestablished methods of measuring employee satisfaction. In addition, IAG has introduced an organisational health survey, initially focused on management populations across all operating companies to benchmark management practices against a globally recognised metric. This survey was run initially in November 2020 and repeated in October 2021. Insights from the survey are used to shape and prioritise cultural development plans.\n\nIndividual operating companies are responsible for learning, development and talent within their business, to enable them to ensure they have the right skills and capabilities required to support their strategy. In 2021, IAG launched a new leadership and talent strategy, building on the work within each operating company and enabling improved attraction, retention and mobility of talent across the Group. IAG is currently working to align the talent management framework across the Group, initially focusing at Group level on the IAG Management Committee and their direct reports. IAG has a strong track record of retaining and promoting talent into senior roles, as evidenced by the Management Committee appointments during 2020 and 2021, and this new approach will improve the rigour and consistency of talent management across the Group.\n\nIAG has employees based in European countries which comply with the conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), covering subjects that are considered as fundamental principles and rights at work: freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour; the effective abolition of child labour; and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Outside of the EU, IAG recognises trade unions in many jurisdictions, has collective agreements and meets/exceeds all relevant labour standards.\n\nIAG has a European Works Council (EWC) which brings together employee",

EWC representatives are informed about and, where appropriate, consulted on transnational matters which may impact employees in two or more EEA Member States. During 2021, IAG hosted one full meeting of the EWC and 11 Select Committee meetings, which have all been held virtually. In November 2021 we commenced the nominations and elections process for new representatives of the EWC, a process which had been postponed due to the pandemic. Reflecting the changing geopolitical landscape and the specific role of the EWC\n\nto manage transnational issues for EEA Member States, the UK will cease to have representatives within the EWC, and we will continue to engage with UK employee representative groups on matters relevant to them. The EWC election and appointment process for the new Select Committee and Chair will be completed in February 2022.\n\nWithin the Group, individual operating companies have responsibility for the policies and procedures relating to their employees, including reward frameworks to ensure they can continue to attract and retain the best talent for every role.\n\n## C.2. Health, safety and wellbeing\n\n## Reference to GRI, TCFD and SASB standards: Supports SDG 3\n\nIAG is committed to safeguarding the health and safety of our employees, customers and all others affected by our activities. This means operating in a healthy, safe and secure way in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, company policies and industry standards. Health and safety are fundamental to our business, whether in the air or on the ground. It is our highest priority.\n\nIAG has robust governance processes in place led by the safety committees in each operating company. The IAG Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee monitors all matters related to the operational safety and Corporate Responsibility of IAG's airlines as well as to the systems and resources dedicated to safety activities across the Group.\n\nIAG's customers travel on aircraft and through buildings and environments that are subject to regulations applicable to health and safety in each country. Procedures, systems and technology used in our operations are designed to protect employees and customers alike.\n\nCOVID-19 continues to be present in our communities and impacts our people and the Group continues to follow expert guidance from bodies such as the IATA Council Aviation Recovery Taskforce (CART), the WHO, Public Health England and Spanish and Irish authorities. New safety and hygiene measures have been introduced for all employees and customers. All these measures have been carefully thought through alongside the need to reflect the latest advice from public health authorities and aviation regulators.\n\nTo support employee wellbeing across the Group, each operating company has continued to create new websites and has deployed internal resources to support mental health and COVID-19 safety. For example, British Airways built on existing resources put in place throughout 2020 and issued daily press updates which continue to highlight wellbeing and the support available such as information about its Employee Assistance Programme and the UNMIND mental health digital\n\nDue to the diverse nature of Group businesses, both in terms of jurisdictions and operations, all training policies and programmes are implemented at operating company level. Each is responsible for determining the specific courses offered within their organisation, the frequency with which training courses must be completed, and the employees required to attend. However, across the Group, all operating companies are required to run the following mandatory corporate training courses for their employees:\n\n- \u00b7  Code of Conduct\n- \u00b7  Compliance with Competition Laws\n- \u00b7  Anti-bribery and Corruption Compliance\n- \u00b7  Data Privacy, Security and Protection.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\napplication. The latter includes webinars, interviews and other resources, and access was extended to family members of employees in the second half of 2020.\n\nIberia has also continued with its COVID-19 prevention training which is now mandatory for all employees returning to the office. In collaboration with local authorities in Madrid, Iberia has also assisted in the vaccination programme and operated a vaccination centre on premises between July 15 and September 30. Additionally, Iberia has taken part in the 'Elige Cuidarte' ('Choose to take care of yourself') programme aimed at getting all its employees vaccinated against both COVID-19 and the flu.",

        "page_content": "RISK MANAGEMENT AND PRINCIPAL RISK FACTORS\n\n## Agile risk management to support/uni00A0the delivery of sustainable/uni00A0long-term value\n\n## Enterprise risk management (ERM) approach\n\n## Agility in risk management\n\nThe risk management framework remains responsive to the needs of the business and our stakeholders by: continuing to develop the Group's assessment of the interdependencies of risks; further building on scenario planning to quantify risk impact under different assumptions; and considering the risks within the Group's risk environment that have increased either as a result of the external factors or as a result of decisions made by the business in response to the pace of the transformation agenda. This allows the Board and management to assess and respond quickly to changes across the Group's principal and other key risks.\n\nIn the year, improvements to further develop the framework have been considered and discussed with management and the Board, including an assessment of how the risk appetite framework aligns to the business and risk landscape following the COVID-19 pandemic impacts. New guidance from regulators and investors is reviewed on an ongoing basis and best practice sought from other risk management sources. Where appropriate, enhancements and adaptions are then implemented across the Group.\n\n## Emerging risks and longer-term threats\n\nAs part of the risk management framework, potential emerging risks and/uni00A0longer-term threats are considered to/uni00A0identify new trends and risks that have increased in speed of potential impact. These include competitor actions, regulations, governments' interventions, customer trends and sentiment to travel, sustainability concerns and stakeholder considerations or business disruptors that could impact the Group's/uni00A0business strategy and plans.\n\nIAG considers risks to the Strategic Business Plan ('the plan') over the short term up to/uni00A0two years, medium term from three to five/uni00A0years and in the longer term beyond five years.\n\n## ERM policy and framework\n\nThe Group Enterprise Risk Framework is set out in the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) policy, which has been approved by the Board. The comprehensive risk management process and methodology ensures a robust identification and assessment of the risks facing the Group, including emerging risks. The risk management framework is embedded across the Group businesses. Enterprise risks are defined as any risk that could impact the plan (above a threshold). They are assessed and plotted on an Enterprise risk map, based on probability and impact. Emerging risks are monitored within the overall risk framework as 'on watch' until they are re-assessed to/uni00A0be no longer a potential threat to the business or where an assessment of the risk impact over the next two to three years can be made, and appropriate mitigations can be/uni00A0put in place or the risk becomes a principal risk. Other high-impact, low-likelihood risks have been discussed. This/uni00A0process is led by the Management Committee supported by the ERM function.\n\nRisk outcomes are quantified as the potential cash impact to the plan over two years. Non-financial considerations include the Group's sustainability commitments, potential for increased regulatory scrutiny, as well as damage to customer and employee trust impacting the Group's brand and share price.\n\nKey controls and mitigations are documented, including appropriate response plans. Where risk treatments require time to implement, short-term mitigations are assessed and the timeline to risk mitigation and consequent risk acceptance discussed and agreed. Every principal risk has clear Management Committee oversight.\n\nRisk maps for each operating company and central function are reviewed by each operating company's management committee and function leadership team, which considers the accuracy and completeness of the map, significant movements in risk and any changes required to the response plans addressing those risks. Where the Group's operating companies have a reliance on other parts of the Group for services delivery, risks are reflected appropriately across risk maps to ensure accountability is clear.\n\nAt the Group level, key risks from the operating companies, together with Group-wide risks, are maintained in a Group risk map.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nIAG has a risk appetite framework which includes statements informing the business, either qualitatively or quantitatively, of the Board's appetite for certain risks.\n\nEach risk appetite statement applies either on a Group-wide basis or for specific programmes, initiatives or activity within the Group. The framework has continued to operate throughout the year, with the Board assessing its appetite across all of the framework statements at the half year and year end against the Group's performance and its anticipated delivery of the Board-approved strategic business plan priorities and initiatives. The Board is satisfied that the Group continued to perform and deliver initiatives throughout 2021 as planned to mitigate risk as set out in its framework statements or necessary additional mitigations to risks have been addressed as they occurred.\n\nThe appetite framework has been subject to review in 2021. Adaptions to the framework to set tolerances more dynamically, assess interdependencies of tolerances and link to the future strategic goals and prioritisation of investment will be implemented in 2022.\n\n## Risk assurance\n\nThe Group's risk heatmap is used to inform the annual Internal Audit plan. The ERM function also works with other compliance and Group functions, such as Government Affairs, Investor Relations and Sustainability, leveraging their frameworks and assessments where appropriate.\n\n## Viability assessment\n\nThe Board's assessment of the viability of the Group, including the selection of appropriate scenarios to determine the assessment, are directly informed by the outputs of the ERM framework. Full details of our approach, scenarios modelled and the viability assessment are shown at the end of this report.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management roles and responsibilities\n\nRisk owners and management\n\nAcross the Group, risk owners are responsible for identifying potential risks and appropriately managing decisions within their area of responsibility that could impact business operations and delivery of the plan.\n\nAs the Group undertakes transformation activities within its operating companies, the pace and agility of the changes required creates risks and opportunities. For transformational risks, business owners are assigned, and the business will agree appropriate mitigations and timelines for implementation, following discussions with all relevant stakeholders.\n\nEmerging risks are assessed and risk owners consider and identify any potential impact to plans. Longer-term 'on watch' risks are subject to review as part of the framework.\n\nOperating companies' management committees\n\nOperating companies review risk during the year including risk map reviews semi-annually, in advance of the Group risk heatmap reviews.\n\nThey escalate risks that/uni00A0have a Group impact or require Group consideration in line with the Group/uni00A0ERM framework.\n\nThey confirm to their operating company board and audit committees as to the identification, quantification and management of risks/uni00A0within their operating company as a/uni00A0whole at least annually.\n\nLocal heatmaps are in place for subsidiary businesses, together with Group support platforms including Group Business Services and IAG Tech.\n\nManagement is responsible for the effective operation of the internal controls and execution of the agreed/uni00A0risk mitigation plans.\n\nIAG Board and Audit & Compliance Committee\n\nThe IAG Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group has an appropriate, robust and effective risk management framework, including the determination of the nature and extent of risk it is willing to take to achieve its strategic objectives.\n\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee discusses risk and considers the risk environment as part of wider Board discussions at every meeting in addition to the bi-annual risk map review, including a review of the assessment of Group's performance against its risk appetite, scenarios for assessment of viability and the outputs from the viability modelling. The Audit and Compliance Committee has early sight of management consideration of scenarios to enable it to challenge subjectivities and confirm rationale.\n\nThe Group risk map is reviewed by the IAG Board annually.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management function\n\nThe Enterprise Risk Management function provides support across the Group to ensure risk management processes are appropriately embedded and applied consistently, as well as working with management to identify risk, challenge assessments and strengthen the risk culture across the Group. The function provides enterprise risk management guidance and shares best practice across the Group and its operating companies, keeping them informed of any risk related regulatory developments. The function is responsible for ensuring that the enterprise risk management framework remains agile and responsive to meet the needs of the business and its stakeholders.\n\nIAG Management Committee\n\nThe IAG Management Committee reviews risk during the year, including the Group risk map semi-annually in advance of reviews by the Audit and Compliance Committee, in accordance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and the/uni00A0Spanish Good Governance Code for/uni00A0Listed Companies.\n\nThe IAG Management Committee review the performance of the Group at half year and full year against the risk appetite framework and reports any near tolerance or out of tolerance assessments to the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nThe Management Committee recommends scenarios for stressing the strategic business plan as part of the annual Group viability assessment.",

These/uni00A0risks include:\n\n- \u00b7  changes in political and economic environment\n- \u00b7  government restrictions over travel and movement of their citizens, governance requirements and regulations\n- \u00b7  external events causing operational disruption including civil unrest, adverse weather or pandemic\n- \u00b7  volatility in the markets and availability of funding and distortion caused by differing government aviation-specific support schemes\n\nManagement remains focused on mitigating these risks at all levels in the business and investing to increase resilience whilst recognising that such risk events may not be so easily planned for and that mitigations are more responsive in nature.\n\nThe principal risks have been assessed as the Group moves back into recovery of its operations and adapts its model accordingly. One new principal risk of 'Transformation and change' has been identified as part of this exercise. It reflects the significance of the Group's transformation agenda and pace required\n\nto deliver the plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Principal risk radar\n\nThe assessed likelihood of risk materialisation for each principal/uni00A0risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group's airlines' brands are, and will continue to be, vulnerable to adverse publicity regarding events impacting service and operations. Reliability, including on-time performance, is a key element of the brands and of each customer's experience. Where customers have been stranded as a result of governments' imposition of new restrictions, all airlines have worked directly with their customers to ensure their safe return. IAG remains focused on strengthening its customer-centricity to ensure that its operating companies continue to adapt and focus their business models to meet changing customer expectations and needs. Customer sentiment to travel and their expectations when they travel are intrinsic to brand health. The Group's airlines have implemented all required measures to ensure customer and employee safety in line with governments' regulations. The resilience and engagement of our people and leaders is critical to retaining brand and customer trust.\n\n## Risk description\n\n## Strategic relevance\n\n## Mitigations\n\nErosion of the brands, through either a single event or a series of/uni00A0events, may adversely impact the Group's leadership position with customers/uni00A0and ultimately affect future revenue and/uni00A0profitability.\n\nIf the Group is unable to meet the expectations of its customers and does not/uni00A0engage effectively to maintain their emotional attachment, then the Group may/uni00A0face brand erosion and loss of market/uni00A0share.\n\nFailure to meet customer expectations on sustainability and the Group's impact on stakeholders and society could impact the Group and its brands.\n\n- \u00b7  The Group's brands are positioned in their respective markets to meet their customer propositions and deliver commercial value. Any change in/uni00A0engagement or travel preferences could impact the/uni00A0financial performance of the/uni00A0Group.\n- \u00b7  IAG will continue to focus on its customer propositions to ensure competitiveness in its chosen priority customer demand spaces and to ensure that it adapts to meet changing customer expectations.\n- \u00b7  The Group is clear on the key levers to improve brand perception and satisfaction for each of its operating company brands.\n- \u00b7  All IAG airlines are considered within the brand portfolio/uni00A0review.\n- \u00b7  Brand initiatives for each operating company have been identified and are aligned to the plan.\n- \u00b7  Product investment to enhance the customer experience supports the brand propositions and is provided for in the plan.\n- \u00b7  All airlines track and report internally on their Net/uni00A0Promoter Score (NPS) to measure customer/uni00A0satisfaction.\n- \u00b7  IAG Customer Steering Group meets monthly and shares/uni00A0initiatives.\n- \u00b7  Hygiene and travel protocols have been implemented across the Group's/uni00A0airlines to address regulatory requirements resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- \u00b7  Enhanced disruption management tools within airlines to allow customers to manage their travel preferences.\n- \u00b7  Enhanced flexibility in airline booking policies.\n- \u00b7  Increased focus on the end-to-end customer journey from flight search through to arrival and baggage reclaim.\n- \u00b7  The Group's global loyalty strategy builds customer loyalty within IAG airlines.\n- \u00b7  The Group's focus on sustainability and sustainable aviation including the IAG Climate Change strategy to meet the target of net zero carbon emissions by/uni00A02050.\n- \u00b7  Robust portfolio process to determine the right investments across the Group.\n- \u00b7  The Group's CIO and Chief Transformation Officer are members of the IAG Management Committee.",

Governmental restrictions continue to impact access to markets. The dynamic nature of the restrictions have required significant agility within our networks to manage the impact on our customers and business. In 2019, the Group announced plans to acquire Air Europa, which is owned by Globalia, subject to regulatory approvals. In December 2021, IAG and Globalia announced the termination of the agreement under which Iberia had agreed to acquire Air Europa, but noted that the parties intended to evaluate alternative structures. Any future deal would be subject to regulatory approval.\n\nThe Group continues to lobby over the negative impacts of government policies, such as increases in Air Passenger Duty (APD).\n\n## Risk description\n\n## Strategic relevance\n\n## Mitigations\n\nCompetitor capacity growth in excess of demand growth could materially impact margins.\n\nAny failure of a joint business or/uni00A0a/uni00A0joint business/uni00A0partner could adversely impact/uni00A0the Group's airline business operations and financial performance.\n\nSome of the markets in which the Group/uni00A0operates remain regulated by governments,/uni00A0in some instances controlling capacity and/or restricting market entry. Changes in such restrictions may have a/uni00A0negative impact on/uni00A0margins.\n\nGovernments' support schemes for the aviation sector create distortionary effects across the markets in which IAG's airlines operate.\n\n- \u00b7  The markets in which the Group operates are highly competitive. The Group faces direct competition on its routes, as well/uni00A0as from indirect flights, charter services and other modes/uni00A0of transport. Some competitors have other competitive advantages such as government support or/uni00A0benefits from insolvency protection.\n- \u00b7  Regulation of the airline industry covers many of the Group's activities including route flying rights, airport landing rights, departure taxes, security and environmental controls. The Group's ability to comply with and influence changes to regulations is key to maintaining operational and financial/uni00A0performance.\n- \u00b7  The IAG Management Committee meets weekly.\n- \u00b7  The Board discusses strategy throughout the year and dedicates two days per year to undertake a detailed review of the Group's strategic plans.\n- \u00b7  Additional Management Committee and Board meetings have been convened as required.\n- \u00b7  The Group strategy function supports the Management Committee by identifying where resources can be devoted to exploit opportunities and accelerate change.\n- \u00b7  The airlines' revenue management departments and systems optimise market share and yield through pricing and inventory management activity. Additional processes and reviews have allowed daily and weekly route analysis as required to respond to the rapidly changing environment resulting from government actions.\n- \u00b7  The Group maintains rigorous cost control and targeted investment to remain competitive. The Group Procurement function has led an ongoing review of all critical contracts.\n- \u00b7  The Group has restructured its businesses with greater flexibility and resilience built into the operations.\n- \u00b7  The portfolio of brands provides flexibility as capacity can be deployed at short notice as needed.\n- \u00b7  The IAG Management Committee regularly reviews/uni00A0the commercial performance of joint business/uni00A0agreements.\n- \u00b7  The Group's airlines review their relationships with business partners supported where appropriate by the Group strategy/uni00A0function.\n- \u00b7  The Group's Government Affairs function monitors government initiatives, represents the Group's interest and forecasts likely changes to laws and regulations.",

The operations of the Group's suppliers, including aircraft manufacturers, has increased the risk of significant business interruption, delays or disruptions, including a lack of availability of labour to support supplier operations and/or problems in maintaining supply. This has led to increased costs to secure such services. Additional focus has been placed on key suppliers following the removal of governments' support schemes to ensure that the business and operations are not impacted.\n\nThe Group continues to lobby and raise awareness of the negative impacts of ATC airspace restrictions and performance issues on the aviation sector and economies across Europe, particularly through the recovery period. The Group relies on the provision of airport infrastructure and is dependent on the timely delivery of appropriate facilities.

In 2021, the Group committed to extend net zero carbon emissions requirements to the Group's supply chain, with the Global Business Services (GBS) procurement function supporting the Scope 3 commitment. GBS will have a key role to play in ensuring its delivery for the Group with supplier sustainability ratings a key consideration for future contract negotiations and renewals. IAG has also committed to 10% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) usage on average across its fleet by 2030.\n\nIn July 2021, the EU announced its 'Fit for 55' package of proposals. This requires an at least 55% emission reduction target set for 2030 and aims to bring the EU climate and energy legislation in line with the 2030 goal. The Group is currently modelling potential impacts and costs based on the published proposals, which includes the removal of aviation jet fuel tax exemption from 2024.\n\nIberia has agreed deals in Spain for the production of SAF this year. Overall aviation industry requirements will require infrastructure investments across markets to support the production of SAF to meet demand expectations. Availability of SAF may be restricted at airports served by the Group in the medium to longer term, where markets may not have such strict eco targets or government set policy.\n\nThe Group has completed the retirement of its aged fleet of Boeing 747s and Airbus A340s.\n\nIAG was an early adopter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) guidelines for climate-related scenario analysis and climate-specific risk assessments. The Group continues with its assessment of climate-related risks, by testing and revising the assumptions on updated forecasts for future business growth and the regulatory context and future carbon price.

Following this process, short-, medium- and longerterm priorities, challenges and opportunities have been identified and actions agreed\n\n## Longer-term trends and risk considerations\n\n- \u00b7  The Directors have assessed industry, Group specific and non sector-specific longer-term trends over a timeframe beyond the plan period, such as climate change regulation, infrastructure proposals at hubs, availability and timing of technologies in fleet that will benefit the environment, move to and exploitation of the Cloud and disruptive innovation. This may require the business to consider strategic responses, plans to adapt and require new skillsets to implement ahead of any potential impact to the Group plan\n- \u00b7  Other considerations include:\n- \u00b7  Economic trends and shifts in the relative strengths of global economies including market dynamics and changes in customer behaviours or sentiment to travel\n- \u00b7  Supply chains and connectivity, movement of physical goods, inflationary and availability pressures on key suppliers\n- \u00b7  Costs of compliance to environmental and climate change regulations and/or lack of availability of infrastructure within countries to meet commitments or government mandates\n- \u00b7  Areas of risk or opportunity for the Group, such as ageing populations in Europe, war for talent, diversity and inclusion ambitions, hybrid ways of working and different career expectations from new joiners into workforces and the aviation industry\n- \u00b7  The ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, including structural changes in how customers travel, costs incurred by the Group in safeguarding customers and colleagues and the potential macroeconomic consequences of rising unemployment and inflation\n- \u00b7  The potential longer-term economic impact of Brexit\n- \u00b7  The Group's resilience to future events impacting aviation or global markets\n- \u00b7  Stakeholder expectations over commitment to acting with integrity to protect our planet, particularly climate change and carbon impacts\n\n## Viability scenario development\n\n- \u00b7  The Group has undertaken extensive analysis, forecasting and scenario modelling over the last year. It has refined its forecasting models and depth of analysis to ensure that stresses considered reflect specifics to markets and regions relevant to the Group's airlines as well as the analysis completed at the Group level\n- \u00b7  During 2021, the Board regularly reviewed scenarios stressing the financial plans. These exercises leveraged the existing processes and models used for viability assessment within the Group\n- \u00b7  When considering the viability of the Group, for the purposes of this report, the Directors have evaluated the risk landscape facing the Group and recommended plausible but severe downside scenarios that could impact the Group's refreshed three-year plan to determine the Group's resilience to such impacts. The results of these scenarios on the plan have been presented both pre and post an assessment of the likely effectiveness of the mitigations that management reasonably believes would be available over this period (and not already\n- reflected in the plan)\n- \u00b7  The scenarios have been defined by management and designed to consider principal risks that could materialise over the viability period and weaken the Group's liquidity position, and therefore its sustainability. Each scenario considered the impact on liquidity, solvency and the ability to raise financing in an uncertain and volatile environment\n- \u00b7  When considering the mitigations, management has assessed mitigations that are available to the business beyond operating cost reductions including further financing, capital expenditure plans and potential disposals. Options that may not have been previously considered as mitigations were presented with recommendations for the Board to consider. In assessing and approving the scenarios, the Board considered, amongst other matters, the availability and sufficiency of potential mitigations, the expected speed of implementation in response to the uncertainty and the future flexibility required for the Group to adapt further as needed\n- \u00b7  Sensitivities in the scenarios' assumptions have been highlighted by management and challenged by the Board. In addition, the Board reviewed the results of capacity and margin reverse stress tests, which demonstrated the level of sustained capacity reductions, with losses capped as experienced through the pandemic and losses followed by margin decline (before mitigations) that would result in the Group using all available liquidity (including cash and currently available undrawn credit facilities) and compared this to the outputs from the scenarios\n- \u00b7  The Downside Lockdown scenario was considered to be the most severly impactful but plausible scenario that could threaten the Group, and in excess of any other plausible combination of scenarios. Mitigating actions as described in the Downside Cases were also considered across all of the scenarios modelled\n- \u00b7  Management has assessed and the Board considered the longer-term sustainability and climate risks, applying scenario analysis techniques as set out by the TCFD process.

Although the prospects of the Group are considered over/uni00A0a longer period, the Directors have determined that a three-year period is an appropriate time frame for assessment as it/uni00A0is aligned with the Group's strategic planning period (as reflected in the plan) and the external uncertainties facing the aviation sector more widely are significantly beyond any experience to date/uni00A0and continue to drive change in the external risk environment. The/uni00A0Board recognises the pace of change required within the Group to further adapt and respond to this environment in addition to the rapidly changing competitive landscape and wider global macroeconomic conditions.\n\nThe Group has modelled the impact of mitigating actions to offset further deterioration in demand and capacity, including reductions in operating expenditure and capital expenditure. The Group expects to be able to continue to secure financing for future aircraft deliveries and in addition has further potential mitigating actions it would pursue in the event of adverse liquidity experience.\n\nFurther details on debt financing can be found in the Going Concern disclosures in note 2 of the Group financial statements.\n\nBased on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation, meet its liabilities as they fall due and raise financing as required over the period to December 2024. However, this is subject to/uni00A0a number of significant factors that are outside of the control of the Group. In reaching this assessment the Directors have made the following assumptions when considering both the plan and the Downside Lockdown scenario case (the most severe and plausible of the downside scenarios considered):\n\n- \u00b7  the Group will continue to have access to/uni00A0funding options and that the capital markets retain a level of stability and appetite for funding within the aviation sector;\n- \u00b7  the Group can implement any further structural changes required in agreement with any union consultation processes and/uni00A0regulatory approvals;\n- \u00b7  future COVID-19 pandemic impacts do not result in further prolonged and substantial capacity reductions and groundings beyond 2022; and not to Q2 2020 levels, as governments do not have the appetite for the economic impact and stress that it would place on their respective economies;\n- \u00b7  and any new virus strain or threat to public health that emerges during the viability period can be/uni00A0managed within existing health and testing regimes without recourse to government regulations that significantly affect our/uni00A0airlines' operations.\n\nDue to the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential for future waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequential impact on travel restrictions and/or demand, the Group is not able to provide certainty that there could not be more severe downside scenarios than those it has considered, including the stresses it has considered in relation to factors such as the impact on yield, capacity operated, cost mitigations achieved and fuel price variations. In the event that such a/uni00A0scenario were to occur, the Group would need to implement additional mitigation measures and would likely need to secure additional funding over and above that which is contractually committed at February 24, 2022. The Group has been successful in raising financing since the outbreak of COVID-19, however the Group cannot provide certainty that it will be able to/uni00A0secure additional funding, if required, in the event that a more severe downside scenario than those it has considered were to occur.",

        "page_content": "REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\n\n## Making the case for/uni00A0positive policies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe political and regulatory environment in 2021 continued to provide IAG with significant challenges as states around the world maintained, and in many cases tightened, restrictions on international travel as part of their ongoing responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. While always seeking to maintain the safety of its customers and colleagues, IAG worked to influence common sense approaches to rule-making and the safe lifting of restrictions as vaccination programmes expanded.\n\nThe effects of the pandemic had additional knock-on impacts in a variety of areas as policy makers and regulators reacted to the reduction in traffic, leading to temporary changes in policy. Specifically, there were restrictions that impacted IAG carriers via the limitation of frequencies and allocation of capacity between competitor airlines in several international markets that the Group worked to reduce or remove.\n\nAlongside the pandemic, sustainability continued to be the most important area of regulatory policy development affecting the industry. Interest around the world in the management of carbon emissions grew in the run-up to COP26 in November with ongoing scrutiny of the contribution of air transport to emissions. This is a challenge to which IAG is leading the aviation industry's response.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nRegulatory reaction to address the threat of COVID-19 required IAG and its operating companies to monitor and manage very many developments in the regulatory field throughout 2021.\n\nIn order to encourage the adoption of practical and reasonable rules, as well as to mitigate their impacts on the business, IAG and its operating companies took every opportunity to engage with the authorities in the countries in which its airlines are established and in other major markets directly and through trade associations. Understanding restrictions, implementing, and complying with associated regulations, as well as keeping customers informed of requirements, was unfortunately made ever more difficult by the very considerable variations between jurisdictions and further by constant changes to regulations, often implemented with little or no notice.\n\nSwift development of digital applications by the Group, such as British Airways' in-house Right To Fly or Iberia's and Vueling's AirCheck system, as well as collaboration with independent apps such as VeriFLY, were essential in helping verify customers' travel documents and managing demand as passenger volumes began to return in the second half of the year.\n\nAs well as the unprecedented level of engagement with governments over this period, IAG established internal working groups, both cross department within operating companies and across Group\n\ncompanies, to manage the process of implementing rule changes, thus benefitting from the wide range of experience and expertise across the Group.\n\nIAG's engagement included highlighting the benefits and value of aviation, especially that of transatlantic traffic, at the highest levels. The Group was well prepared to meet the US authorities' requirements for track and trace data when the country opened to vaccinated foreign visitors in November.\n\nThe US opening came as part of a gradual removal of restrictions in IAG's key home markets and around the world along with the welcome simplification of the UK's traffic light system and the removal of hotel quarantine requirements in the UK and Ireland.\n\nThe unpredictable nature of the pandemic was emphasised when further restrictions on travel to certain countries were imposed by governments in response to the spread of the Omicron variant. IAG continues to argue for such policy action to be proportionate so that future variants of concern should not, for example, result in blanket measures on all travellers, such as the need for onerous and costly testing regardless of origin.\n\nThroughout the pandemic IAG has advocated the establishment of a global approach to imposing restrictions and to rule-making through ICAO to reduce confusion for customers and airlines alike. The Group continues to urge governments to come together to develop a joint approach to crisis management that applies a consistent set of requirements whether for future pandemics (including moving to a traveller-based approach to risk rather than bans by country, allowing fully vaccinated passengers to travel without restriction, and setting standard architectures for digital health certificates) or for other upheavals that could impact the operation of this global industry.\n\n## Sustainability - Brussels\n\nIAG has continued to champion the cause of sustainable aviation and to share its plans for reducing carbon emissions as the industry recovers.\n\nTo explain and promote its sustainability position, the Group has engaged with representatives of the institutions of the European Union over the European Commission's Fit for 55 package. This commits the EU to reducing net",

        "page_content": "greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 (compared with 1990) and to reaching climate neutrality by 2050.\n\nIAG welcomes Fit for 55, and its objectives with which the Group is aligned, as a powerful package for change. However, IAG continues to argue that the design of some elements may reduce the EU's capacity to invest in sustainability and make it less competitive compared with other non-EU aviation markets.\n\nIAG does not support the imposition of the jet fuel tax that Fit for 55 proposes. This is not a solution for decarbonisation but will reduce the sector's ability to invest in more effective measures. Instead, we are firmly of the view that policy should focus on increasing the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) and market-based measures such as the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and ICAO's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme (CORSIA).\n\nIAG contends that increasing the use of SAF, which reduce lifecycle CO2 emissions by up to 85 per cent, provides the primary near-term opportunity to drive down industry emissions. In April, IAG became the first European airline group to commit to powering 10 per cent of its flights with SAF by 2030. We encourage the EU to include a package of investment incentives to enable scaled-up production of SAF alongside the blending mandate requirement that Fit for 55 introduces.\n\nBritish Airways launched its BA Better World sustainability strategy in September and also procured the use of sufficient SAF to power all flights between London and Glasgow during COP26.\n\nIAG has long been an advocate for and contributor to the design of CORSIA. The Group believes the Fit for 55 package must work alongside global measures, not duplicate them, and that the EU ETS should apply to intra-EU flights and CORSIA to extra-EU flights. Applying both systems to flights between EU Member States risks undermining support for CORSIA outside Europe.\n\n## Other policy issues Slot allocation\n\nA key impact of the pandemic, given the dramatic reduction in demand, was the need for a waiver from regulators to the slot allocation rules that would otherwise risk breaking up long-established airline networks. IAG worked with its trade association, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to advocate the adoption of a system agreed with airports and slot coordinators that would recognise the value to consumers to allow temporary alleviation from 'the use it or lose it' rules so as to maintain networks of airlines who have built them up over the years. The UK and others sensibly adopted full waivers of the 'use it or lose it\" rules but the patchwork of approaches adopted, including the different position of the EU\n\nfrom that of the US and other key markets, was disappointing. IAG continues to support the use of the proven, effective global rules of the IATA Worldwide Airport Slots Guidelines.\n\n## Competition\n\nAnother feature of the impacts of the pandemic in 2021 was that in some markets, governments imposed peremptory or arbitrary restrictions on capacity to protect their home carriers on the pretext of safeguarding public health. IAG and its operating companies continue to work through the governments of its home countries and in the markets in question to promote the benefit of competition to consumers and the health of the aviation industry and to encourage a full return to normal operations in 2022.\n\n## Airport charges\n\nWorking with the trade association Airlines for Europe (A4E), IAG continued to promote the need for changes to airport charges legislation in Europe to make the industry fit for a more competitive future. The Group continues to monitor developments and engage with regulators around the world as airports seek to increase charges to pass on their losses over the last two years to their airline customers. A key focus during 2021 was on Heathrow's regulatory price review. The airport sought to double charges when other hubs (e.g. all airports in Spain) are keeping rates flat or seeing only small increases (e.g. Frankfurt). It was disappointing to see the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) announce, in December, that it would allow Heathrow to increase charges by 50 per cent in 2022 (the interim price cap). British Airways and IAG are fully engaged in the CAA's review process that continues through the first half of 2022. We seek to demonstrate that charges should in fact more reasonably be reduced at Heathrow over the remainder of the regulatory period to 2026 in the interests of preserving the competitiveness of UK aviation and providing a better\n\noutcome for both IAG's airlines and for consumers.\n\n## Market access\n\nDuring the pandemic, regulatory approval was secured for a range of flights for Aer Lingus, British Airways and Iberia to new destinations or for new purposes including cargo and passenger charter services. As restrictions began to be lifted attention turned to strategic actions to expand markets.\n\nThe start of Aer Lingus's operations from Manchester to the Caribbean demonstrated the Group's flexible business model, including IAG's central Government Relations team helping to secure regulatory permission from both UK and US authorities for the new UK-based operation. Further regulatory engagement with several countries in the Caribbean, Africa and Asia has also helped secure the significant expansion of code share networks, in particular with Kenya Airways and Qatar Airways.\n\nIAG monitored, as usual, developments in relevant international relationships and air services agreements throughout the year, including the discussions in the Autumn between the EU and the UK on the Northern Ireland protocol (since the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement includes provisions on aviation). Any potential changes to the status of the protocol are not expected to have an impact on the air services arrangements between the EU and the UK.\n\nIn 2021 overall, the Group took every opportunity to emphasise the economic and social value of aviation in facilitating trade, tourism and in reuniting families separated by the pandemic, and also to demonstrate that this is being done in a responsible and environmentally sustainable manner.\n\n<!-- image -->",

I am pleased to be supported by such an experienced and committed team as we continue to navigate the impacts of the pandemic.\n\nBoth our purpose and our vision are clearly reflected in the Board and management's commitment to create and deliver long-term sustainable value for our people, customers, shareholders and our society. Firstly, by weathering this crisis and making the most of the recovery. Secondly, by transforming our business and preparing it for a post-COVID future.\n\nIn the last year, the Board met 19 times including two dedicated sessions on our strategy and long-term transformation aspirations. The September meeting in Madrid was particularly rewarding as we met face-to-face for the first time since February 2020. It was pleasing to corroborate first-hand that, as productive as online working proved to be, it cannot replace the benefits of being together in person, which is central to our purpose and business.\n\nOur unique model proved resilient and has served us well during the pandemic. The strength of our empowered operating companies has enabled them to respond effectively to a fast-changing environment in the different markets in which they operate. Being part of the Group also enabled us to share strategies and best practices to improve our response to the crisis and coordinate actions accordingly.\n\nSustainability remains a key priority. As announced last year, the Board is supported in this work by the newly established Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee. In parallel, the Management Committee has been bolstered with the appointment of a Chief People, Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Officer to ensure sustainability remains at the core of our strategy.",

        "page_content": "## Board composition\n\nAs anticipated, Antonio V\u00e1zquez retired as IAG Chairman on January 7, 2021. Moreover, we started the year with three new non-executive directors, Peggy Bruzelius, Eva Castillo and Heather Ann McSharry, who joined the Board on December 31, 2020. In addition, Maurice Lam joined our Board as a non-executive director, at our Shareholders Meeting in June 2021. All of these new appointees have completed their induction programmes during the year as further detailed in the Nominations Committee Report.\n\n## Our people\n\nI would like to highlight our renewed focus on our people who are at the centre of everything we do and achieve. The Board has direct oversight over culture, and together with management is redoubling efforts to nurture our talent and align our culture, purpose and strategy. In addition to Nicola Shaw and Alberto Terol, the Board has appointed Eva Castillo as a designated director supporting the workforce engagement initiatives detailed later in this report.\n\nThe Board is also prioritising diversity and inclusion. I am pleased that we are leading by example with a significant 42 per cent female representation on the Board, which is 62 per cent of our independent directors, and with women chairing two of the Board committees. We also comply with the Parker Review target for ethnic diversity on FTSE 100 boards. Despite this progress, there is still more to be done across the business and IAG management is committed to do so. To this end, a cross-Group Diversity Panel was created to share best practice and to lead the co-design of new diversity and inclusion initiatives. Additionally, we have set a new target of having at least 40 per cent of senior roles held by women and we will continue to review our policies to ensure we are a diverse and inclusive organisation.\n\n## Management changes\n\nI was pleased to welcome two new members of the Management Committee during the year. Firstly, as reported last year, David Podolsky, who was previously at Bain & Co, joined the Group in January 2021 as Chief Strategy Officer, he also became Chief Executive Officer of IAG Cargo from April 2021 . Secondly, we appointed Carolina Martinoli as Chief People, Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Officer from April 2021. Carolina has extensive experience in the Group having worked at both British Airways and Iberia for more than 10 years including leadership roles in brand and customer experience, as well as successful business transformation.\n\nWithin the Management Committee, Lynne Embleton was appointed Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aer Lingus from April 2021. From 2017, she led IAG Cargo and was responsible for setting the business on a digital transformation journey. Prior to this, Lynne held a number of leadership roles at British Airways.\n\nAs announced in October 2021, Steve Gunning has decided to stand down as Chief Financial Officer and leave the Group following the release of our full year 2021 results. After a rigorous search process, I am pleased to welcome Nicholas Cadbury who will join us in March 2022. He is a well-respected and experienced CFO with an excellent track record at Whitbread, Premier Farnell and Dixons Carphone, including valuable board experience as non-executive director and Chair of the Audit Committee for Land Securities.\n\n## Board evaluation\n\nReflecting our commitment to good governance, the Nominations Committee oversaw the evaluation of the Board and all committees' performance. The outcome of this review and details of the process are provided later in this report.\n\nOur robust and efficient governance processes underpin our ability to live our values and deliver our strategy. The Board is committed to ensuring that we continue to adhere to high standards of corporate governance so that we can create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders and perform in the interests of all our stakeholders.\n\nAs I have said before, our people are at the heart of our business and I would like to express once again our deep appreciation for the efforts and commitment shown during this difficult year. I would also like to thank my Board colleagues for their continued support and dedication throughout this period.\n\n## Javier Ferr\u00e1n\n\nChairman\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Steve for his significant contribution in helping us build resilience and a solid financial position from which the Group will be able to continue to navigate the challenges ahead.",

Each company has its own board of directors and its own management committee, led by the top executive of each company.\n\nFurther details on the Group structure can be found on the Business Model section within the Strategic Report.\n\n## Board of Directors: division of responsibilities\n\nThe IAG Board is collectively responsible for establishing the Company's purpose, values and strategy, promoting its culture, overseeing the business and its performance, as well as for the Group's long-term sustainable success. As stated in its Regulations, the Board endeavours to reconcile the corporate interest with the legitimate interests, as applicable, of the employees, suppliers, customers and other stakeholders that might be affected, also taking into consideration the impact of its activities on the community as a whole and on the environment. Examples of this long-term focus and consideration of stakeholders' interest are discussed further on in this report and in the stakeholder section.\n\nConsistent with its governance role, the Board of Directors retains a schedule of matters reserved for its decision, as detailed in article 3.4 of the Board Regulations. This schedule of reserved matters was reviewed at the Board meeting held on February 25, 2021 and is available on the Company's corporate website (www.iairgroup.com).\n\nThe Board has four advisory committees that provide dedicated focus on a number of areas. Each Board committee comprises non-executive directors only and has an experienced non-executive independent chair. Copies of the minutes of all committees' meetings as well as the documents distributed ahead of each committee meeting are made available to all Board members.\n\nThe different Board positions and their respective responsibilities are detailed in the Board Regulations as amended on February 25, 2021 (available on the corporate website). The Board also approved new and separate regulations for each one of the Board committees as part of the governance review completed in February 2021. These regulations are available on the corporate website. The roles, memberships and activities of these committees during 2021 are described in their individual reports within this Corporate Governance Report.\n\nThere is a clear separation of the roles of the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive and their main responsibilities are established in articles 5 and 6 of the Board Regulations. The Chairman is responsible for the operation of the Board and for its overall effectiveness in directing the Company. The Group Chief Executive and the management team are responsible for the day-to-day management and performance of the Group and for the implementation of the strategy approved by the Board. All the powers of the Board have been permanently delegated to the Group Chief Executive save for those which cannot be delegated pursuant to applicable legislation, the Company Bylaws or the Board Regulations.",

The biographies of each member of the Board are set out in the Board of Directors section.\n\nFollowing the significant number of changes in 2020, only one new non-executive director was appointed in 2021, filling the vacancy that arose following the retirement of the former Chairman, Antonio V\u00e1zquez, which took place on January 7, 2021. Accordingly, Maurice Lam was appointed a non-executive director at the Shareholders' Meeting held on June 17, 2021. Details of his recruitment process can be found in the Nominations Committee report.\n\nAs set out in the Company's Bylaws, the Board shall comprise a minimum of nine and a maximum of fourteen members. As of December 31, 2021, the Board composition was:\n\n| Name of Board Member   | Position/Category           | First appointed   |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|\n| Javier Ferran 1        | Chairman                    | June 20, 2019     |\n| Luis Gallego           | Chief Executive             | September 8, 2020 |\n| Alberto Terol          | Senior Independent Director | June 20, 2013     |\n| Giles Agutter 2        | Director (Proprietary)      | September 8, 2020 |\n| Peggy Bruzelius        | Director (independent)      | December 31, 2020 |\n| Eva Castillo           | Director (independent)      | December 31, 2020 |\n| Margaret Ewing         | Director (independent)      | June 20, 2019     |\n| Maurice Lam            | Director (independent)      | June 17, 2021     |\n| Heather Ann McSharry   | Director (independent)      | December 31, 2020 |\n| Robin Phillips 2       | Director (Proprietary)      | September 8, 2020 |\n| Emilio Saracho         | Director (independent)      | June 16, 2016     |\n| Nicola Shaw 3          | Director (independent)      | January 1, 2018   |\n\n- 1.  Became Chairman on January 7, 2021 following the retirement of Antonio V\u00e1zquez.\n- 2. Appointed on proposal from Qatar Airways (Q.C.S.C), a significant shareholder of IAG.\n- 3. The appointment of Nicola Shaw as a non-executive director was approved by the Shareholders' Meeting on June 15, 2017 but did not become effective until January 1, 2018.\n\nThe Board Secretary is \u00c1lvaro L\u00f3pez-Jorr\u00edn, partner of the Spanish law firm J&A Garrigues, S.L.P, and the Deputy Secretary is Lucila Rodr\u00edguez. The Group Chief Financial Officer, Steve Gunning, and the Group General Counsel, Chris Haynes, attend all Board meetings.\n\n## Directors' independence\n\nThe Board, as reported by the Nominations Committee, reviewed directors' independence at its meeting held on January 20, 2022. It is satisfied that those directors classified as independent are free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with exercising an independent judgement, both as a question of character and judgement. Further details are provided on conflicts of interests and independence of directors later in this report and the Nomination Committee Report.\n\nThe Chairman was considered to be independent on appointment and neither he nor any of the non-executive directors has exceeded the maximum nine-year recommended term of service set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code, with our longest serving director, Alberto Terol, having served on the Board since 2013.\n\n## Appointment, re-election, resignation and removal of directors\n\nThe selection and appointment process is described in detail in the Nominations Committee report.\n\nIAG directors are appointed for a period of one year, as set out in the Company's Bylaws. At the end of their mandate, directors may be re-elected one or more times for periods of equal duration to that established in the Bylaws. In this way, the Company complies with the UK Code recommendation that directors should be subject to annual re-election.\n\nRe-election proposals are subject to a formal process, based on the Nominations Committee proposal in the case of independent directors, or its recommendation report for all other categories of directors. This proposal or report is prepared having due regard to the performance, commitment, capacity, ability and availability of the director to continue to contribute to the Board with the knowledge, skills and experience required.\n\nDirectors cease to hold office when the term of office for which they were appointed expires.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, a director must resign in the cases established in article 17.2 of the Board Regulations, among other things when the director ceases to have the good standing, suitability, reliability, competence, availability or commitment to office necessary to be a director of the Company or when his or her remaining on the Board might affect the Company's credibility or reputation or otherwise jeopardises its interests.\n\nAccording to article 24.2 of the Board Regulations, directors have a number of disclosure obligations, including the duty to inform the Company of any situation in which they are involved and that may seriously affect the reputation of the Company, in particular if they are involved in any investigation in a criminal proceeding. In such circumstances, the Board would consider the case as soon as practicable and adopt the decisions it deems fit, taking into account the corporate interest, following a report by the Nominations Committee.",

For these purposes, just cause is deemed to exist when the director takes up new positions or enters into new obligations that prevent them from dedicating the necessary time to the performance of his or her duties as a director, otherwise breaches his or her duties as a director or unexpectedly becomes subject to any of the circumstances provided for in article 17.2 of the Board Regulations.\n\nThe removal may also be proposed as a result of takeover bids, mergers or other similar corporate transactions that determine a material change of control.\n\nA director who stands down before the end of their term of office must adequately explain the reasons for this decision, or in the case of a non-executive director, their opinion on the reasons for the Shareholders' Meeting resolution, in a letter to be sent to all the directors.

        "page_content": "## Board leadership and company purpose\n\n2021 continued to be a difficult year for the airline industry. A year in which IAG's management team had to focus on the immediate challenges, while also laying the foundations for the transformation of the Group so that it can emerge more competitive in the future. This includes ensuring our corporate culture is aligned with the Group strategy and reflects the values across the Group.\n\nIAG's purpose - 'To connect people, businesses and countries'- underpins the Group's vision to be the world's leading airline group, maximising sustainable value creation for its stakeholders. IAG will continue to use its unique business model to pursue this purpose and vision and always aims to deliver sustainable value for its customers, its people, its shareholders and the communities it serves.\n\nBy connecting people, businesses and countries, the Group is able to provide the jobs, prosperity and cultural benefits that travel has always created. While a number of important new initiatives and projects have been launched during the year, there is more to be done to achieve the aspirations the Group has set for itself.\n\nThe Board believes that IAG can achieve its purpose and vision by promoting the Group's key values, which are ambition, teamwork, innovation, pragmatism, efficiency and responsibility. In 2022, the Board will review how these values are further embedded in the organisation and how this links to the work on corporate culture and on people that started in the last quarter of 2020, ensuring that the complete exercise takes root with the strategy and the transformation of the Group.\n\nFurther detail on IAG's purpose and values can be found throughout this annual report, and in particular on the first pages of the Strategic Report and the introductory letters of the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive.\n\n## Corporate culture\n\nIAG's Code of Conduct, approved by the Board in 2019, remains our guide to the core behaviours that we seek to encourage and instil throughout the Group. This Code applies to all directors and employees and establishes our principles of integrity, as well as outlining where compliance is required.\n\nTo help strengthen the work on culture, in April 2021, Carolina Martinoli joined IAG's Management Committee as Chief People, Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Officer, with the remit to place a special focus on people, culture and sustainability.\n\nAt the annual strategy meeting held in September 2021, the Board devoted a special session on our people and how best to develop the Group's corporate culture. Consistent with IAG's model, the individual operating companies remain responsible for the design and implementation of their respective plans under the Group common framework. IAG plays an important role to set minimum principles and standards, to enable the sharing of best practices and the design of Group-wide projects where appropriate.\n\nAs reported last year, in the last quarter of 2020, a Group-wide Organisation Health Index (OHI) exercise facilitated by an external firm was completed. The objective is to have a unified Group metric which brings together organisational health and culture under a common framework.\n\nThe results and initial conclusions from the first survey were shared with the Board during the two-day strategy meeting held in December 2020 in a session devoted to culture and talent. Following this meeting, organisation-wide priorities and action plans were defined and launched in the first half of 2021. With that backdrop, going forward a full OHI survey will be undertaken once a year, with a follow-up pulse survey after six months.  All this information will be regularly reported and discussed with the Board.\n\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee has also reviewed and reported to the Board the effectiveness and functioning of the Speak Up channels available throughout the Group provided by independent third-party providers, whereby employees are able to raise concerns on a confidential basis. The Committee discussed this report, including the number and nature of issues reported to the Speak Up channels during 2021. Further details can be found in the 'Ethics and integrity' section of the sustainability report.\n\n## Investment in the workforce\n\nIn general terms, all Group companies invest in their employees through training and development programmes, as well as through healthcare and wellbeing programmes. Terms and conditions are set and managed within each operating company, enabling them to put in place appropriate rewards to reflect their specific operating model and local market conditions. Across the Group we look to ensure that all rewards and benefits are simple, clear, competitive, and fair. Across the UK, Spain and Ireland approximately 90% of IAG's workforce are part of collective bargaining agreements with varying levels in other countries the Group operates in. We work closely with employee representatives to consult on reward matters. For those outside of collective agreements, we benchmark roles and rewards against local markets to ensure they remain attractive and competitive.",

In addition to this, the Board has direct engagement with the Company's shareholders and with the workforce as recommended by the UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\nThe Company's governance framework was reviewed in February 2021 and, in accordance with the recommendation of the Spanish Governance Code, one of the Board advisory committees, the Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee, was assigned the responsibility to oversee and evaluate the Company's interaction with its stakeholder groups, including the workforce.\n\nConsidering the exceptional circumstances in which the Group is currently operating due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the identification of the Group's key stakeholders has been reviewed and updated.\n\nMore information on our stakeholders, how they fit in our strategy and business model, their main interests, and our engagement with them can be found in the stakeholder section of this annual report.\n\nInformation on the Board's engagement with the workforce is provided in the Workforce engagement section of this Governance report.  As far as shareholders are concerned, and as already described in the Stakeholder section, the Chairman has maintained regular engagement with major shareholders in order to understand their views on governance and performance of the Group against the strategy. In addition to this, the Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee had significant contact with key shareholders and proxy advisors in relation to IAG's directors' remuneration policy.\n\nThe Board has been regularly informed about shareholders' considerations and concerns. The Head of Investor Relations reports regularly to the IAG Board and one of the Company brokers was invited to the annual strategy meeting to discuss investor insights.\n\n## Section 172 Statement (and compliance with article 3.6 of IAG's Board of Directors Regulations)\n\nIn their discussions and decisions during the reporting period, the directors of IAG have acted in good faith, with unity of purpose and independent judgement, guided by the corporate interest to promote the success of the company as a profitable and sustainable business in the long term and giving the same treatment to all shareholders in the same position. In doing so the Board had regard and tried to reconcile the corporate interest with the legitimate interests of employees, suppliers, customers and other stakeholders, also taking into consideration the impact of its activities on the community as a whole and on the environment.\n\nInformation on how the directors discharged their duties under these principles during the year, including how they had regard to the matters set out above in their discussions and decision making, is included in this section. Further details can also be found throughout the Strategic and Governance reports.  Feedback from stakeholders is received at a number of different levels and helps inform numerous decisions directly or indirectly overseen by the Board. In many circumstances, the views of stakeholders are considered and embedded in the proposals shared with the Board or submitted for its decision.",

In addition, another instruction regulates the Group investment process.  This framework and the dedication and expert support provided by the different Board advisory committees ensures the existence of an adequate governance system.\n\nThe impact on our different stakeholders as well as the consequences of any decision in the long term are usually considered and discussed by the Board. It is not always possible to provide positive outcomes for all stakeholders and on occasions the Board has to make decisions based on the competing priorities of stakeholders.

At the same time, the Board maintained focus on the design and actions for the transformation of the Group to ensure it comes out from the crisis competitive and sustainable.

Significant  short-term measures were needed to reinforce the Company's resilience in the face of a very  difficult environment so that the delivery of our long-term strategy and the ongoing creation of  value for our shareholders could be ensured. | Corporate interest     |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | LT                     |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Employees              |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Shareholders           |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Other stakeholders     |\n| of the business to ensure operational readiness to be prepared to return to operations at short  notice once restrictions were eased is another example of decisions taken considering our  employees, considering our customers and with an enormous effort deployed to engaging with  Governments and regulators.

The Board has been regularly informed about initiatives at each operating company with respect to their workforce during the pandemic. A session at the annual strategy meeting was devoted to the analysis and discussion of the results and initial conclusions from the employee survey\n\ncompleted in the Group, as well as to discuss the Group's approach and ambition on employee matters.\n\nEva Castillo, Nicola Shaw and Alberto Terol have been designated as the directors responsible for workforce engagement. Recent Board engagement sessions have been held with British Airways, Iberia, IAG Loyalty, IAG Cargo, IAG Tech, Vueling and Aer Lingus. The sessions have been very constructive with an opportunity to hear from different employee groups and see latest\n\ninnovations. Key themes have been the impact of changes to terms and conditions, the company's plans regarding resourcing as we emerge from the pandemic, the effectiveness of communications channels, the approach to flexibility as more teams return to offices, and the Group's focus on development and careers. Each visit included a debrief for senior teams on emerging issues to ensure appropriate actions are taken forward.",

        "page_content": "CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED\n\n## Board and committee meetings\n\nThe Board was scheduled to meet eight times during the year, including its annual two-day strategy meeting scheduled for September 2021.\n\nSince the start of the year, the Board moved from weekly to holding bi-weekly meetings to continue monitoring the impact of the pandemic and the Group's response. Since the end of July 2021, the Board returned to its normal meeting schedule as travel restrictions started to be lifted and the Group's business started to approach its recovery path. The total number of Board meetings held during the reporting period was 19, Details of attendance at Board and committee meetings are shown further on in this report.\n\nIn addition, there were two board meetings held by written procedure without a meeting, with all board members agreeing to adopt certain resolutions by such procedure.\n\nThe Board Secretariat together with the General Counsel maintains an annual agenda schedule for Board meetings that sets out strategic, standard and operational matters to be considered. The\n\nChairman sets a carefully structured agenda for each meeting in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, with the support from the General Counsel and the Board Secretariat. During 2021, as was the case in 2020, the Board's main focus was conditioned by the COVID pandemic, supporting management and exercising oversight over the Group's businesses and stakeholders' interests and the Group's continued response to the pandemic. The key activities of the Board in 2021 are detailed in the Board activities table further on in this report.\n\nAfter the review and approval of the minutes of the prior Board meeting, each Board meeting continues with a report from each of the committees' chairs.  The reports focus on the key discussions and decisions considered by the respective committees, providing an opportunity for directors to comment or ask questions on the matters dealt with by each committee. This is followed by a general update from the Group Chief Executive and subsequently, from the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nAll scheduled Board meetings include a private session for non-executive directors\n\nto meet with the Chairman to discuss any matters arising. In addition to this, at least once a year there is a private meeting with the Chairman that includes independent non-executive directors only. The Senior Independent Director also met with the non-executive directors, without the Chairman, as part of the chair annual evaluation process.\n\nAs stated in the Board Regulations, directors shall make their best efforts to attend Board meetings. If this is not possible, they may grant a proxy to another director, although non-executive directors may only grant their proxy to another non-executive director. These proxies need to be in writing and specifically granted for each meeting. No director may hold more than three proxies, except for the Chairman, although he cannot represent more than half of the Board members. As far as possible, proxies should be granted including voting instructions.\n\nDue to the extensive number of additional Board meetings held during the year due to the COVID pandemic, and sometimes called at short notice, some directors were not able to attend all meetings.\n\n## Board and committee attendance during 2021\n\n| Board member 1       | Board   | Audit and  Compliance  Committee   | Nominations  Committee   | Remuneration  Committee   | Safety,  Environment  and Corporate  Responsibility  Committee   |\n|----------------------|---------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Javier Ferr\u00e1n 2      | 19/19   |                                    | 7/7                      |                           | 1/1                                                              |\n| Luis Gallego         | 19/19   |                                    |                          |                           |                                                                  |\n| Giles Agutter        | 18/19   |                                    | 6/7                      |                           | 3/3                                                              |\n| Peggy Bruzelius      | 18/19   | 10/10                              |                          |                           |                                                                  |\n| Eva Castillo         | 17/19   | 8/10                               |                          | 8/10                      |                                                                  |\n| Margaret Ewing 3     | 19/19   | 10/10                              | 6/6                      |                           |                                                                  |\n| Maurice Lam 4        | 8/8     | 4/4                                |                          |                           | 2/2                                                              |\n| Heather Ann McSharry | 19/19   |                                    | 7/7                      | 10/10                     |                                                                  |\n| Robin Phillips       | 19/19   |                                    |                          |                           | 3/3                                                              |\n| Emilio Saracho       | 19/19   |                                    |                          | 9/10                      | 3/3                                                              |\n| Nicola Shaw          | 19/19   |                                    |                          | 8/10                      | 3/3                                                              |\n| Alberto Terol 5      | 18/19   | 6/6                                | 7/7                      | 10/10                     |                                                                  |",

        "page_content": "CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED\n\n## Board information and training\n\nIn general all Board and committee meeting documents are available to all directors, including the minutes of each meeting, through an online platform which facilitates an efficient and secure access to all materials. All directors have access to the advice of the Board Secretary and the Group General Counsel. Directors may take independent legal, accounting, technical, financial, commercial or other expert advice at the Company's expense when it is judged necessary in order to discharge their responsibilities effectively. No such independent advice was sought in the 2021 financial year.\n\nIn 2021 the Board received specific briefings on corporate governance and key legal and regulatory developments. In addition to this, most directors attended two deep-dive briefings organised by the Audit and Compliance Committee regarding the BEIS open consultation in relation to the UK Government's white paper 'Restoring trust in audit and corporate governance: proposals on reforms', and in relation to the BA defined benefit pension obligations. Furthermore, two sessions of two hours each were held, with the support from an external firm and co-chaired by the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee chairs, regarding governance of climaterelated risks and opportunities and non-financial reporting requirements.\n\nDirectors are offered the possibility to update and refresh their knowledge of the business and any technical related matter on an ongoing basis to enable them to continue fulfilling their responsibilities effectively. Directors are consulted about their training and development needs and given the opportunity to discuss training and development matters as part of the Board annual performance evaluation.\n\n## Induction of directors\n\nAccording to the induction guidelines, approved by the Nominations Committee, on joining the Board every newly appointed director has a thorough and appropriate induction. Each programme is based on the individual director's needs and includes meetings with other directors, senior management and key external advisers as appropriate. The induction is designed to provide a wide overview of the industry and the sector, including particulars of each of the markets in which the Group operates, as well as an understanding of the Group business model and its different businesses. The programme is also a useful tool to introduce the new director to the IAG Management Committee as well as to the different operating companies' teams.\n\nIn January 2021, an induction programme for the three newly appointed directors was initiated following the IAG induction guidelines. On this occasion, meetings with management were arranged to prioritise a rapid introduction to the Group and briefings on main current matters, with a second phase of customary meetings with all Management Committee members and other key positions within IAG. Additionally, an induction programme was launched for Maurice Lam following his appointment in June 2021. Further detail are provided in the Nominations Committee report\n\nDue to COVID-19 related constraints, practically all meetings were held virtually, and directors' visits to the Group's key sites and meetings with each operating company's leadership team had to be delayed. As will be mentioned later in the context of the Board evaluation, these site visits will be resumed in 2022 as far as possible.\n\nAs explained next as part of the Board evaluation section, the feedback received from new directors on the IAG induction programme is very positive. Directors consider that the programme of meetings is very thorough, providing very complete information on the Group and the industry. In the present circumstances, an important effort was made to share insights into issues currently impacting the Group, particularly given the extremely difficult and uncertain conditions arising from the pandemic.\n\n## Board and committee evaluation\n\nThe effectiveness of the Board and its committees is reviewed annually, with an independent, externally facilitated review being conducted every three years. The last external review was conducted in 2019, therefore an internal evaluation was completed for 2021.\n\nThe internal evaluation was led by the Chairman and conducted by the Board Secretariat using a self-assessment questionnaire, complemented by a general discussion of the full Board on the outcome from the survey and proposed actions at the Board meeting held on December 16, 2021.\n\nThe overall conclusions of the review were positive, confirming that the Board and the committees continue to adequately fulfil their responsibilities. Directors considered that there has been an outstanding commitment and engagement from all Board members during the year while the business continues to face the challenges of the COVID-19 crisis.  The continued management of the Board's agenda and the frequency of meetings have ensured that the Board remained briefed and able to support management throughout the year as circumstances changed. In relation to the areas for focus agreed for 2021, the Board considered that good progress had been made in all of them considering the complexity of the situation. In particular, induction programmes were reinforced to facilitate the rapid introduction and adaptation of the new directors and the new Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee was established and meetings commenced in May as per its agreed plan of activities.\n\nActions agreed for 2022 include:\n\n- \u00b7  to  consider how best to reinforce the Board's competencies on IT and digital matters\n- \u00b7  as long as travel restrictions allow, to organise Board meetings in Barcelona and Dublin, including meetings with Vueling and Aer Lingus management teams\n- \u00b7  review of the annual calendar to ensure adequate coverage of key areas agreed\n- \u00b7  improvements to the follow up of matters arising and reporting back to the Board",

These include any situation where the interest of the director, either directly or through third parties, may conflict with the corporate interest or with their duties to the Company. In the event of conflict, the affected director must inform the Company and abstain from participating in the discussion of the transaction referred to by the conflict. For the purposes of calculating the quorum and voting majorities, the affected director would be excluded from the number of members in attendance.\n\nThe shareholders' meeting held on June 17, 2021,  approved the re-election of Giles Agutter and Robin Phillips as nonexecutive proprietary directors as proposed by IAG's significant shareholder Qatar Airways Group (Q.C.S.C.) ('Qatar Airways'). Qatar Airways, a Middle East air carrier headquartered in Doha, has been the single largest shareholder of IAG since 2016, owning, as of the date of this report, 25.143% of the share capital of the Company. Throughout this period there has been a long-standing business and commercial relationship between Qatar Airways and the airlines of the IAG Group. This close relationship of commercial cooperation, which has always been undertaken on an arms'-length basis and on market terms, which significantly reduces the potential existence of permanent conflicts of interest between Qatar Airways and the Group's airlines.\n\nAs far as the relationship of the proprietary directors with the significant shareholder who proposed their appointments is concerned, it should be noted that Giles Agutter is the owner and Chief Executive of the consultancy services firm Southern Sky Limited, one of whose material clients is Qatar Airways, and that Robin Phillips has no relevant connection with Qatar Airways\n\nAny potential conflict of interest that might affect such proprietary directors is managed by applying the duty of abstention in accordance with the procedure for managing conflicts of interest described below. In addition, the Spanish and the United Kingdom regimes on related parties' transactions are also applicable as detailed below.\n\nIn accordance with article 3.4 of the Board Regulations, the Board of Directors has the exclusive authority to approve transactions with directors or shareholders that have a significant holding or that are represented on the Board or with any persons related to them, on the terms established in the law and the Board Regulations and this will require a prior report from the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nThe execution of these type of transactions needs to be reported to the Audit and Compliance Committee to ensure that they are carried out at arm's length and with due observance of the principle of equal treatment of shareholders. This year IAG's internal regulations on related party transactions were revised to bring them into line with the changes introduced in the Spanish Companies Act regarding the regime for related party transactions in listed companies. According to this new requirement, the Audit and Compliance Committee needs to issue a report to the Board assessing whether the transaction is fair and reasonable from the standpoint of the Company and, where applicable, of the shareholders other than the related party, and report on this assessment, including the assumptions and methods used. The directors related to the transaction shall not participate in the preparation of such report.\n\nDepending on the amount or value of the proposed related party transaction, different corporate governance and disclosure requirements may apply under both the Spanish and UK legal frameworks.\n\nIn accordance with IAG procedures on related party transactions, prior to the Audit and Compliance Committee consideration, shareholder related party transactions are also reviewed by the IAG Management Committee and are reported to the IAG Head of Group Audit.\n\n## Share issues, buy-backs and treasury shares\n\nThe Annual General Meeting held on June 17, 2021 authorised the Board, with the express power of substitution, for a term ending at the 2022 Annual General Meeting (or, if earlier, 15 months from June 17, 2021), to:\n\n- \u00b7  increase the share capital pursuant to the provisions of Article 297.1.b) of the Spanish Companies Law, by up to fifty per cent of the aggregate nominal amount of the Company's issued share capital as at the date of passing such resolution (such amount to be reduced by the maximum amount that the share capital may need to be increased by on the conversion or exchange of any securities issued by the Board under the relevant authorisation), through the issuance and placement into circulation of new shares (with or without a premium) the consideration for which shall be cash contributions;\n- \u00b7  issue securities (including warrants) convertible into and/or exchangeable for shares of the Company, up to a maximum limit of 1,500,000,000 euros or the equivalent thereof in another currency, provided that the aggregate share capital that may need to be increased on the conversion or exchange of all such securities may not be higher than fifty per cent of the aggregate nominal amount of the Company's issued share capital as at the date of passing such resolution (such amount to be reduced by the amount that the share capital has been increased by the Board under the relevant authorisation);\n- \u00b7  exclude pre-emptive rights in connection with the capital increases and the issuance of convertible or exchangeable securities that the Board may approve under the previous authorities for the purposes of allotting shares or convertible or exchangeable securities in connection with a rights issue or in any other circumstances subject to an aggregate maximum nominal amount of the shares so allotted or that may be",

During the year, the Committee considered changes to three Management Committee positions, the appointment of a new Director of Strategy, that of the new Chief People, Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Officer, and the move of Lynne Embleton as new Chief Executive of Aer Lingus.\n\nIn addition, the Committee oversaw the process for the appointment of Nicholas Cadbury as our new Chief Financial Officer, who will be joining the Group on March 21, 2022 following the departure of Steve Gunning.\n\nFurther details of these management changes is provided in this report.\n\nAnother important area of focus for the Committee has been management succession planning and talent development, including diversity requirements. In fact, in September, the Committee undertook a detailed review of the new plans and initiatives in line with the Group's people strategy. In 2022, we will continue to focus on this important area, overseeing the development of the plans that have been presented.\n\nIn June 2021, we welcomed a new nonexecutive director, Maurice Lam, whose appointment process was managed by the Committee during the first half of the year.\n\nFollowing the recent non-executive directors appointments, the Committee oversaw their extensive induction programmes. Due to existing COVIDrelated restrictions, the induction meetings were held virtually. Despite the existing challenges, thanks to IAG's management commitment support, the feedback received from directors has been very positive. We hope to complete the induction with site visits to the Group's operations during 2022.\n\nWe close the year satisfied that we have a Board with the right skills and experience to continue providing the highest standards of leadership and oversight in the years ahead. We are also satisfied that the Board composition meets the target for the proportion of women on boards set out in the Hampton-Alexander Review as well as the recommendation on ethnic diversity on boards in the Parker Review. We hope to further consolidate and improve this progress, and trust that the Board's leadership will serve as an anchor for the management team's own plans on diversity and inclusion.\n\n## Javier Ferr\u00e1n\n\nNominations Committee Chair",

A copy of the Board and the Nominations Committee Regulations can be found on the Company's website.\n\nThe Nominations Committee has overall responsibility for leading the process for appointments to the Board and to ensure that these appointments bring the necessary skills, experience and competencies to the Board, aligning its composition to the business strategy and needs. The Committee also reports to the Board on the proposed appointment of senior executives of the Company. It oversees Board and senior management succession planning and in general the development of a diverse pipeline for succession.\n\nThe Nominations Committee shall be made up of no less than three non-executive directors appointed by the Board, with the dedication, capacity and experience necessary to carry out its function. A majority of the members must be independent directors that are EU nationals.\n\nAs mentioned in the 2020 Nominations Committee report, the only new appointment to the Committee was that of Margaret Ewing on January 28, 2021.\n\n## The Committee's responsibilities\n\nThe Nominations Committee's responsibilities can be summarised as:\n\n- \u00b7  evaluating the mix of competencies, knowledge and experience necessary in the Board's membership and reviewing the criteria for the Board composition and the selection of candidates\n- \u00b7  submitting the recommendation for appointment of directors to the Board for approval, and reporting on the proposed designations of the members of the Board committees and their chairs\n- \u00b7  succession planning for Board members making proposals to the Board so that such succession occurs in a planned and orderly manner\n- \u00b7  reporting to the Board on the appointment and removal of senior executives (which includes all IAG Management Committee members)\n\n## New Board appointment\n\nMaurice Lam Non-executive director\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSoon after joining the Board in June 2021, I attended IAG's induction programme which introduced me to the Group, its management and business. Given the pandemic situation and the fact that I was the only newly appointed member at that time, this induction consisted in a number of one to one virtual meetings with key members of management.\n\nI have a financial services background and am relatively new to the airline industry. The quality of the thorough and open exchange together with the level and completeness of the information provided, helped me significantly to better understand the industry dynamics and its business logic.\n\nWe had the opportunity to share insights into issues impacting the Group, particularly in the context of the uncertain conditions prevailing from COVID-19 and its unpredictable developments. We also had interesting discussions on challenging subjects like climate change, cybersecurity and other emerging risks and their potential impacts.\n\nAlthough the induction meetings were held virtually, the time commitment and the quality of the interactions provided me with a good start to building a relationship with key people in the\n\nGroup; indeed this proved to be very useful when we finally met physically last September for the 'Strategic meetings'. I felt encouraged to exchange at any time, an extremely important enabler to successfully fulfil my independent director role.\n\nCurrently, planned site visits to the different locations of IAG entities are still outstanding and I am looking forward to participating in these as soon as conditions allow.\n\nAs a new member of the Board, its Audit and Compliance Committee and its Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee, I feel well integrated so far, and from the start felt motivated to be actively engaged in all issues affecting the Group.\n\nThe complexity and diversity of the Group implies quite a lot of information to read and digest ahead of meetings. I feel the diversity and experience of the different board and committee members, under strong leadership and guidance, facilitate probing questions and challenging discussions; this is particular important in an environment where forecasting in current volatile and uncertain times, leading to the need to consider a variety of options, has to be continuously performed by management and overseen by the Board.\n\nI am proud to be a Board Member of IAG and look forward to contributing in this recent role.",

Directors' attendance at these meetings can be found in the Corporate Governance section. The Group Chief Executive is invited to attend the Committee's meetings as and when necessary.\n\nThe Committee focused on the following activities during the year:\n\n- \u00b7  review of the composition of the Board and search process for a new nonexecutive independent director\n- \u00b7  review of the Board committees' membership, including that of the new Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee\n- \u00b7  Board succession planning\n- \u00b7  review of the directors' independence\n- \u00b7  review of compliance with the Directors' Selection and Diversity Policy\n- \u00b7  management succession plans\n- \u00b7  launching of the Board annual evaluation process, as well as that of the Nominations Committee\n- \u00b7  changes to Group company boards\n- \u00b7  review of investor feedback from the 2021 Annual General Meeting\n- \u00b7  update on regulatory developments on diversity matters.\n\nThroughout the year, Spencer Stuart provided recruitment consultancy services to the Committee. Spencer Stuart does not have any other connection with the Company or individual directors and is a signatory to the UK Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms.\n\n## Non-executive directors appointment process\n\nAs already anticipated, the Nominations Committee and the Board were keen to improve ethnic diversity, and this was taken into consideration when a new search was started following the retirement of Antonio V\u00e1zquez in January 2021.  Spencer Stuart was appointed to conduct this search on January 7, 2021.  In May 2021, the Committee was pleased to recommend the appointment of Maurice Lam, who joined the Board at IAG's Annual Shareholders' Meeting on June 17, 2021.\n\nMaurice brings extensive financial audit, and risk-related experience to further reinforce the composition of the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nThis search process was completed pursuant to the IAG Directors Selection and Diversity Policy as confirmed by the Nominations Committee in the review completed in January 2022. The process was carried out in accordance with the following principles:\n\n- \u00b7  an executive search firm was engaged to conduct this search, which is a signatory to the UK Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms.\n- \u00b7  the search criteria were formulated following the evaluation of the balance of skills, experience, independence, diversity and knowledge on the Board, alongside the then existing succession plans for directors, and taking into consideration the conclusions from the annual review of the Board performance.\n- \u00b7  based on these considerations, the role and capabilities required for this particular appointment were established. As the Committee is keen to ensure a broad diversity in the Board, it was also agreed to put a special focus on diversity, in particular on minority ethnic diversity. These specifications were included in the search firm's engagement letter.\n- \u00b7  a long-list of candidates were reviewed during February and March 2021 and, following a detailed analysis of the profiles of the candidates included, a shortlist of potential candidates was agreed.\n- \u00b7  the final shortlist was reviewed and discussed by the Chair of the Nominations Committee and Chairman of the Board with the Committee members, and according to the conclusions reached and after hearing the feedback from a compliance perspective from the Group General Counsel, it was reported to the Nominations Committee.\n- \u00b7  following the interview process of the shortlisted candidates, a final candidate was then agreed, and submitted for final approval at the Nominations Committee held on May 5, 2021. A final report was presented to the Board endorsing the nomination.\n\n## Board succession\n\nThe Committee regularly reviews the formal succession plan for the Board, including analysis of non-executive directors' length of tenure, skills and experience, and planning for succession of any areas that could require strengthening from a skills and succession perspective. The conclusions of this exercise helped to inform new directors' searches and the profile and skills required.\n\nIn September 2021, the Committee reviewed in detail the Board succession planning, including the Board refreshment timeline, the Board skills matrix, as well as the identification of potential successors for the different positions.\n\n## Board positions and committee memberships\n\nOn February 24, 2021 the Nominations Committee considered the composition of the new Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee which was subsequently approved by the Board. This committee is chaired by an independent non-executive director, Nicola Shaw, and is composed of non-executive directors with a majority of independent directors.\n\nFollowing the Annual Shareholders' Meeting in June, the Committee reviewed the Committees' composition, and proposed the appointment of Maurice Lam as a member of the Audit and Compliance Committee and of the Safety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee, replacing Alberto Terol on the former, and Javier Ferr\u00e1n on the latter.\n\n## Directors' independence, performance and re-election\n\nThe Nominations Committee, having considered the matter carefully, is of the opinion that all of the current nonexecutive directors, with the exception of the two proprietary directors, are independent, both in line with the definition set out by the Spanish Companies Act and with that of the UK Corporate Governance Code, and are free from any relationship or circumstances that could affect, or appear to affect, their independent judgement.\n\nAll proposals for the appointment or re-election of directors presented to the 2021 Shareholders' Meeting were accompanied by an explanatory report issued by the Board of Directors with the support of the Nominations Committee assessing the competence, experience and merits of each candidate. The Committee also reviews the time commitment and availability of each non-executive director, which during 2021 was again remarkable. Following this review, the Committee was of the opinion that each non-executive director submitting themselves for re-election continued to demonstrate commitment to the role as a member of the Board and its committees, discharged",

At the same meeting, the Committee also considered and endorsed the appointment of Carolina Martinoli in a new role as Group Head of Culture, Talent and Sustainability Officer with her becoming Chief People, Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Officer in May 2021.\n\nAlthough this was not a position on the IAG Management Committee, the Committee also reviewed the appointment of David Shepherd, Chief Commercial Officer of Aer Lingus, as managing director and member of the board of IAG Cargo, reporting to David Podolsky who leads IAG Cargo as a Management Committee member and chairs the IAG Cargo board of directors.\n\nFinally, the Committee reviewed the search and selection process for the position of Chief Financial Officer of the Company. The search was conducted with the assistance of Egon Zehnder. This process culminated in October 2021 with the announcement of the appointment of Nicholas Cadbury, Chief Financial Officer of Whitbread, to replace Steve Gunning, who will be leaving in March 2022.\n\nIn the September meeting, the main principles and objectives of the Group management succession planning process were presented to the Committee. The process is currently being reviewed to better align it to IAG's broader people strategy. Several matters were discussed at this meeting, including: how to keep the right balance between succession and external recruitment and the different implications this could have from a cultural perspective; the relevance of structured processes and methodology for talent development and promotion; the focus on diversity standards; the role of the Group and that of the different operating companies. The Committee was also updated on the Group key roles, including an analysis of leadership changes since 2019, highlighting the high churn suffered\n\nin the leadership teams and across the Group critical roles in the same period.\n\nIt was agreed that the Committee will be kept updated on the initiatives and developments of this plan, as this is an area on which it was agreed to put a special focus following the Committee's performance evaluation last year.\n\n## Diversity\n\nThe Nominations Committee remit was reviewed in 2021 and its responsibility for diversity was confirmed from three different perspectives as far the Board and senior management are concerned.  The Committee is responsible for developing measurable objectives, for monitoring progress towards their achievement and compliance with IAG's diversity policies, and to oversee the development of a diverse pipeline for Board and senior management succession.\n\nThe IAG Directors Selection and Diversity Policy, which is available on IAG's website, sets out the principles that govern the directors selection process and the approach to diversity on the Board of Directors and on the Management Committee.  This policy reflects IAG's commitment to promote equality and diversity.\n\nThe IAG Board recognises the value of having a variety of opinions, perspectives, skills, experiences, backgrounds and orientations to enrich discussions and to have better decision-making processes.\n\nConsidering the ongoing work on people and culture in the Group, it has been deemed appropriate to delay the review of the Group's diversity and inclusion policies to this year, in order to ensure adequate consistency in these initiatives.\n\nThe procedure for the appointment of directors follows the principles established in the Directors Selection and Diversity Policy. As recommended by the Spanish Good Governance Code, the Nominations Committee reviews compliance with this policy on an annual basis. This review was completed in January 2022.\n\nThis selection process is described in detail in the preceding section on 'Non-executive directors' appointment process'.\n\nFemale directors currently represent 42% of the Board of Directors and 62% of the independent non-executive directors. In addition to this, two of the four Board advisory committees are chaired by women. From an ethic diversity perspective, the IAG Board has met the UK Parker Review objective, having appointed in 2021 one director from a minority ethnic group.\n\nThe Board and the Nominations Committee are committed to improving diversity, and gender diversity across the Group, and encourages and supports management actions in this regard.  As explained below, the Committee has agreed to maintain its focus on diversity and inclusion as a priority for 2022.\n\nGiven its relevance, the Board reviewed the Group's diversity and inclusion strategy during its annual strategy session in September 2021.  In addition, in January this year, the Group's gender diversity initiatives and ambitions within this new diversity framework were shared again with the full Board.\n\nFurther explanations of the steps that IAG is taking to promote diversity and inclusion across the Group is set out in the 'Diversity, inclusion and equality' section of the sustainability report.\n\n## The Committee annual evaluation\n\nThe annual performance evaluation of the Board and its committees was internally facilitated, having been carried out by an independent external facilitator in 2019. The evaluation concluded that the Committee operated effectively during the year. Although significant progress has been made, the Committee will continue prioritising its focus on the two areas identified in the prior evaluation, that is management succession planning, including talent retention and talent development, and diversity and inclusion initiatives at management level.\n\nWhen considering director appointments, the Committee follows a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure, designed to preserve this diversity value in its broader sense, while ensuring that any appointment is made on merit, and taking into account the specific skills and experience needed at any point in time to ensure continuing Board balance and relevant knowledge. Gender diversity principles are followed throughout the process, while preserving the general diversity and merit-based appointment principles established in the policy. The Board's policy is to consider candidates from a wide variety of backgrounds, without discrimination based on gender, race, colour, age, social class, beliefs, religion, sexual orientation, disability or other factors.",

In line with our Group's purpose, we're committed to ensuring aviation remains a force for good in the world. That means ensuring every business decision is rooted in the values that we hold and the desire to do the right thing for all our stakeholders. Only then can we create a resilient business that will grow sustainably for the long-term. This inspires the work of this new Committee\n\nwhich has a key role in supporting the Board by providing guidance and direction on IAG's sustainability and corporate responsibility ambitions.\n\nThe Committee was incorporated in February 2021 with new membership, expanding the remit of the former Safety Committee, to oversee environmental matters and corporate responsibility and met for the first time in May. In June 2021, Maurice Lam joined us following his appointment as non-executive director at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, replacing Javier Ferr\u00e1n.\n\nThe SECR Committee has oversight over safety matters. Although this responsibility lies with each airline in accordance with its applicable standards, its own culture and the circumstances and particularities of\n\neach business, the Committee carries out a high-level overview of safety activities and informs the Board as appropriate. More importantly, we aim at promoting the discussion of common issues and sharing best practice. This has proved to be a very valuable tool in facing the unprecedented impact of the COVID pandemic.\n\nSustainability takes many forms. From stewardship of the environment to social matters. We seek to actively manage our impact on the world by setting ambitious targets, measuring our progress, and transparently reporting on the steps we are taking. In 2021, the Committee oversaw and discussed the Group's initiatives in this area, from how we approach carbon emissions, to the new diversity targets we have established, the improvement in our reporting and the partnerships that we have joined to drive positive change.\n\nOn the environmental front, tackling climate change remains the most material issue, as validated by the stakeholder materiality exercise completed this year. In 2021, we became the first airline group in Europe to commit to deploying 10 per cent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2030, equating to 1 million tons of SAF per year. We have also continued to embed our net zero transition pathway within our business and remain focused on the delivery of our ambitious targets.\n\nListening to our stakeholders is crucial to inform our priorities and plans to deliver a fully sustainable business. In line with the feedback received, and going beyond environmental issues, the Committee will, along with our climate change commitments, continue to focus on social and corporate responsibility matters in the coming year.\n\nIt is fundamental to our ambition that we do business in the right way which is why sustainability is at the heart of our strategy. We are committed to building a truly sustainable, responsible and inclusive business to deliver long term value for our people, customers, shareholders and the communities we serve. Together we can make a lasting difference to the world.\n\n## Nicola Shaw\n\nSafety, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Committee Chair",

A copy of the Board and the SECR Committee Regulations can be found on the Company's website.\n\nThe Committee is made up of no fewer than three directors appointed by the Board, with the/uni00A0necessary dedication, capacity and experience. All the members of the Committee shall be non-executive directors and a majority of them shall be independent directors.\n\nIn addition to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary, regular attendees at Committee meetings included the Chairman, the Group Chief Executive and the Chief People, Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Officer. Senior managers with responsibility for safety matters and others in charge of different sustainability areas were invited to attend specific agenda items as required and when relevant.\n\n## The Committee's role and responsibilities\n\nThe Committee's role is to support and advise the Board in matters relating to safety, environment and corporate responsibility. Responsibility for safety matters belongs to the Group's airlines. IAG, through this Committee, has an overall view of each airline's safety performance and of any important issues that may affect the industry. The Committee also has visibility of the Group airlines' resources and procedures. Responsibility for performing detailed and technical assessments remains with each airline, overseen by their/uni00A0respective safety committees. In the areas of environment and corporate responsibility, the SECR Committee provides a governance forum for non-executive directors to exercise specific oversight, challenge and support to senior management in shaping the Group's sustainability strategy, policies and targets, buttressing IAG's vision to be the world's leading airline group on sustainability.\n\nAccording to its regulations, the SECR Committee's remit includes:\n\n- \u00b7  to receive significant safety information about IAG's subsidiaries, franchise, codeshare or wet-lease providers used by any member of the Group\n- \u00b7  to exercise a high-level overview of safety activities and resources\n- \u00b7  to review the Group's strategy and policies on social and environmental sustainability\n- \u00b7  to evaluate that the Company's environment and social practices are in accordance with the established strategy and policies\n- \u00b7  to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company's environment and social policies, to confirm that they are fulfilling its mission to promote the corporate interest and catering for, as appropriate, the legitimate interests of its stakeholders\n- \u00b7  to review the Group's global environment and climate risk mitigation strategy, the implementation of sustainability programmes and any climate related financial disclosure\n- \u00b7  to review the content of the nonfinancial information statement or sustainability report\n- \u00b7  to monitor and evaluate the Company's interaction with its stakeholder groups, including the workforce\n- \u00b7  to review the principal environmental, social and reputational risks\n- \u00b7  to review the general diversity and inclusion policies\n\n## The Committee's activities during the/uni00A0year\n\nDuring 2021, the Committee held three meetings. Directors' attendance at these/uni00A0meetings is detailed in the Corporate Governance report. At its first meeting, the Committee agreed on it plan of activities for 2021 as well as its standard annual plan for the following years.\n\nDuring 2021, the Committee focused on the following activities during the year:\n\n- \u00b7  safety readiness programmes of the Group airlines\n- \u00b7  overview of an airline company safety framework\n- \u00b7  safety review report of the Group airlines\n- \u00b7  Conclusions from the IAG Investors ESG survey\n- \u00b7  key upcoming EU and national ESG consultations\n- \u00b7  2021 stakeholder materiality assessment process and conclusions\n- \u00b7  update on sustainable aviation projects and other low carbon initiatives\n- \u00b7  review of the 2020 IAG Modern Slavery Statement\n- \u00b7  update on emerging trends and benchmark analysis on ESG\n- \u00b7  review of ESG ratings and relevant sustainability indexes\n- \u00b7  Group sustainability strategy and policies review\n- \u00b7  2021 Non-Financial Information Statement and other sustainability reporting, including review of compliance and key metrics.\n- \u00b7  diversity and Inclusion review",

        "page_content": "In addition to this, two externally provided training sessions were organised together with the IAG Audit and Compliance Committee, focusing on the Board's ESG compliance and reporting responsibilities, with a particular attention to climate change. A follow up discussion was also/uni00A0held at the SECR Committee December meeting.\n\n## Safety\n\nIn May 2021, the SECR Committee reviewed the four Group airlines' plans to restart and readiness to fly in the ramp up of the operations for the summer period. The Committee was briefed on the challenge the airlines faced under a dynamic and uncertain cancellation phase, the large-scale parking and storage plan which continued to vary, the extensive staff furlough programme to match a much reduced flying programme, a restart phase with significant uncertainty and including a new operational and customer environment. The different teams presented their respective plans to ensure a safe return into operations but also building on the opportunities that the situation also brings and on the possibility of sharing best practices across the Group benefiting from the safety and security network already established between the Group airlines and the support provided from the centre.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the relevant areas of each operating company's performance across the Safety Risk Management activities. In line with the above, in addition to each airline's standard reporting, the Committee devoted special attention to the different challenges posed by the COVID pandemic on the safety management systems and environment.\n\n## ESG investors survey and materiality assessment\n\nTwo key exercises on ESG were completed in 2021. The first one was the survey that the IAG Investor Relations team conducted to get input from IAG institutional shareholders and investors on ESG matters. The top 100 shareholders plus ten additional investors were contacted to participate. They were consulted on their approach to ESG when analysing investments, how they saw that evolving, what IAG is lacking, what should be the Group's focus in terms of reporting and the gap between their expectations and what IAG is currently doing. The Committee discussed with the Investor Relations and Sustainability teams the feedback received, including both qualitative and quantitative findings, as well as the conclusions and recommendations to be drawn from this important engagement.\n\nThe second exercise was the materiality assessment completed between April and June 2021 to seek the Group stakeholders' perspective regarding sustainability priorities. This was facilitated by a leading sustainability consultancy Simply Sustainable as an independent third party and it included both a medium (two years) and a long-term (ten years) approach. The Committee considered the design, methodology and content of the process, and was also briefed on the main conclusions drawn and actions to be taken to ensure this properly informs IAG's strategy and reporting going forward. A complete description of the materiality assessment can be found in the Sustainability Report.\n\n## Market trends and EU and national ESG consultations.\n\nThe Committee has been regularly updated on any upcoming ESG policy consultations at international, EU or national level, including the Group's positioning and actions intended in each of them. This year this included, among others, the UK BEIS consultation on Mandatory Climate Change Reporting, the EU 'Fit for 55' and the UK 'Jet Zero' consultations.\n\nAs part of the materiality assessment process, a benchmarking analysis was completed to position IAG versus best practice in the different areas considered.\n\n## Sustainable aviation strategy, projects and other low carbon initiatives\n\nAt the December SECR meeting the Committee reviewed and approved the updated IAG sustainability strategy with an increased focus on delivery of carbon mitigation initiatives particularly the commitment to 10% sustainable aviation fuels by 2030.\n\nThe Committee also closely follows the Group's various projects on sustainable aviation fuels and hydrogen projects, namely Lanzajet, Velocys/Altalto and ZeroAvia, discussing the relevant pathway, status and next steps. In this respect, the Committee also considered the Group's positioning and the various initiatives management undertakes to ensure appropriate policies support the development of these projects.",

        "page_content": "## Human rights and modern slavery\n\nIn July, the Committee was briefed on the steps IAG is taking to ensure that slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in the Group's businesses or in its supply chain, providing an update on the Group's key initiatives. In particular, the Committee reviewed IAG's Modern Slavery Statement and submitted it for approval to the Board of Directors.\n\nIAG's Code of Conduct, which is also applicable to IAG directors, establishes the Group's commitment to respect human rights in the business, underpins IAG's framework in this area, which also includes anti-bribery and anti-fraud policies and control, whistleblowing channels and reporting, and the Group's slavery and human trafficking statement. As far as suppliers are concerned, IAG screens suppliers to identify and mitigate potential incidences of human rights violations, and modern slavery clauses feature in all new supplier contracts as well as contract renewals. In addition to IAG's own Modern Slavery statement, IAG asks suppliers to adhere to the third IAG Group Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement.\n\nIn 2022, the Committee will focus on the assessment of human rights risks within the business and its supply chain, including environment, labour and human rights, and/uni00A0ethics.\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion initiatives\n\nAt the December meeting, the Committee assessed and refreshed the Group's diversity and inclusion commitments and oversaw the programme of activities envisaged under the Group's diversity and inclusion plans.\n\nThe Committee noted the progress made in the year, including the establishment of the new IAG Diversity Panel and refreshed plans for each operating company to underpin the Group's new targets and ambition, but also noted the adverse impact on workforce composition and gender pay due to the pandemic and restructuring activities over the last year.\n\n## Review of ESG ratings and relevant sustainability indexes and Group reporting\n\nAt its July meeting, the Committee was updated on the different IAG ESG ratings. The Committee considered the situation of each one of them and the actions proposed to be addressed by management, with particular attention to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), on which relevant disclosures were filed at the end of July.\n\n## The Committee annual evaluation and priorities for 2022\n\nAs the Committee started to be operative in May 2021, its annual performance evaluation was completed by the Committee Chair based on the conversations held with Committee members and management. The Committee was said to be operating effectively during 2021. Nonetheless, considering the early life of this Committee and the important expectations and business focus in this area, it was considered appropriate to add two additional meetings to the 2022 schedule, and to restructure the Committee plan of activities accordingly.",

It is our responsibility to ensure that financial information published by the Group properly presents its activities to all stakeholders in a way that is transparent, useful and understandable and is aligned with the latest guidance and requirements of regulators. In addition, the Committee's fundamental priorities include ensuring the quality and effectiveness of the external and internal audit processes and\n\nmonitoring the management of the principal risks of the business.\n\nThe continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on governments' policies regarding flying restrictions, the aviation industry and our business has meant that throughout 2021 the Group has continued to face unprecedented and significant challenges. The Committee continued to apply an increased level of focus on the effect of this situation on our people and financial integrity, for example, management's ability to forecast the recovery adds additional complexity to those significant accounting judgements based on future expectations. I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Committee, to acknowledge and express our significant gratitude to management and teams who have continued to adapt so well to the pandemic. We recognise that retaining our best people is more\n\nimportant than ever as they continue to work with determination as the business hopefully moves into a recovery phase and a progressive return to normal operations, which will bring further challenges for the finance and auditing teams. I would also like to thank Steve Gunning, our Group CFO, who steps down in March this year. Steve has been instrumental in leading the Group through the most challenging of times and has ensured that he is leaving the Group in a strong liquidity position.  I welcome Nicholas Cadbury, our new CFO, and look forward to working with him in future.\n\nAlberto Terol stood down from the Committee in June 2021, and I would like to thank him for his significant contribution, playing a key role in advocating strong internal control, risk management and compliance practices across the Group. I welcome Maurice Lam, who joined the Board and the Committee in June. Maurice is an experienced audit committee member with a breadth of finance, audit and accounting knowledge. Upon Maurice's appointment, I met with him to brief him on the key issues and priorities for the Committee this year as well as providing insights into certain industry-specific accounting and risk issues.\n\nThroughout 2021, I have maintained a dialogue with other members of the Committee, management and the internal auditor, including meeting with 'agenda topic owners' prior to Committee meetings, ensuring the Committee would be provided with the necessary information to enable it to guide, challenge and advise and, when required, make informed decisions. I also met regularly with the lead partners of our new external auditor, KPMG, as part of my ongoing review of their effectiveness, particularly in this year of their transition. In addition, other Committee members met with finance team representatives, management and internal and external auditors, as part of their induction.\n\nThe Committee held ten formal meetings during 2021 (compared to twelve in 2020) and several ad hoc meetings on topics such as fuel hedging strategy and policy. The key items discussed by the Committee in discharging its oversight responsibilities and its areas of focus are set out in further detail in this report. The Committee has had clear oversight over the continuing impact of COVID-19 on the business,",

        "page_content": "particularly in respect of the significant operational, compliance and financial risks that could materially impact the Group's financial position and ability to execute and deliver its strategy. A critical area of focus for the Committee has been the smooth transition to KPMG as our external auditor. KPMG presented an update of their transition at each Committee meeting, providing the Committee with their observations and plans. This included presenting their 2021 audit plan and risk assessment in November and plan for their review of the financial statements for the first six months of the year (in May), both of which the Committee discussed in detail and approved.\n\nThis report describes how the Committee has monitored and assessed the effectiveness of the external auditor during 2021. KPMG's fresh perspective, challenge and rigour have drawn the Committee's and management's attention to a requirement for renewed consideration of the application of certain accounting policies and judgements. Management have responded positively to KPMG's findings. The Committee has spent considerable time reviewing and scrutinising the Group's financial results, including the areas of challenge by the external auditor, and details of the significant issues we considered can be found in this report.\n\nDuring the year, several risk deep dives and educational sessions were held for the Committee (particularly given the recent appointment of three of the members) to ensure collective robust knowledge of issues unique to this industry and our businesses, key financial risks and more complex accounting judgements, as well as the impact of emerging regulatory and non-financial information requirements. These sessions covered topics such as fuel hedging, British Airways pensions, loyalty programmes and the associated accounting, ESG and sustainability. In addition, briefing sessions by management and the external auditor have ensured that all Committee members are aware of the rapid evolution of corporate governance proposals and regulatory guidelines in the UK and EU, including the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) consultations on UK Corporate Governance and Audit Reform, the European Commission's consultation 'Corporate reporting - improving its quality and enforcement' and FRC and CNMV thematic reviews.\n\nI believe that, throughout 2021, we have ensured: the key challenges and risks faced by the Group were reflected in the external and internal audit plans; effective controls remained in place; rapidly changing principal and emerging risks were identified and effectively managed; compliance with all regulatory and legal obligations; and sound financial\n\njudgements and estimates continued to be made. The internally facilitated evaluation of the Committee's effectiveness during 2021 supported this conclusion. The evaluation findings, which were shared with the Board, indicated that the Committee continued to perform effectively and had addressed its key priorities and action plan for 2021.\n\nAs we look forward to this current year, 2022, further relaxation in travel restrictions and the anticipated increase in business and operations levels of activity and revenues, the Committee will continue to provide robust challenge of management and our external and internal auditors. We will target known and emerging risk areas for deep dives and ensure that the transformation occurring across the Group, as well as challenges posed by the implementation of changes in corporate governance and regulatory requirements, are appropriately reflected in the Group's accounting, internal control, risk and compliance procedures.\n\nI hope that you find this report informative and can continue to take assurance from the work undertaken by the Committee during 2021 and planned for 2022. The Committee seeks to respond to shareholders' and other stakeholders' expectations in our reporting. I welcome feedback on this Committee report or other related issues and an opportunity to meet with investors during 2022.\n\n## Margaret Ewing\n\nAudit and Compliance Committee Chair\n\n## The Audit and Compliance Committee\n\nThe composition, competencies and operating remit of the Audit and Compliance Committee are regulated by article 29 of the Board Regulations as well as the Regulations of the Audit and Compliance Committee. The Committee and Board approved revisions to the Regulations in February 2021 to reflect the latest guidance and regulatory requirements in Spain and the UK. A copy of these Regulations can be found on IAG's website.\n\n## The Committee's composition, competencies and attendance\n\nDetailed biographies of all current Committee members are included in this Annual Report. The Board is satisfied that the Committee has retained competence relevant to its overall responsibilities and a wide range of financial, audit, risk management and relevant sector and business experience amongst its members, providing the right mix of skills and experience to provide constructive challenge and support to management. The Board has determined that Margaret Ewing and Maurice Lam have recent and relevant financial experience. The Board, through the Nominations Committee, will continue to review the Committee's membership to ensure the skills and experience of its members align with the business as it develops.\n\nIn addition to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary, regular attendees at Committee meetings included the Chairman, the Head of Group Audit (who reports functionally to the Chair of the Committee) and representatives from the external auditor. Members of the management team, including the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Group Financial Controller, were invited to attend specific/uni00A0agenda items as required and when relevant.\n\nA private session of the Committee members was held at the end of each Committee meeting and during the year the Committee met privately with each of the external and internal auditor.\n\n## The Committee's responsibilities and/uni00A0activities\n\nThe Committee's principal responsibility is to oversee and provide assurance to the Board on the integrity and quality of financial reporting, effectiveness of audit arrangements and robustness and effective operation of internal controls, compliance and risk management processes. The Committee meeting agendas are tailored to ensure emerging topics are included and to allow for ad hoc discussion and reviews.

These  amounts, which are significantly less than in 2020, have arisen from the substantial  deterioration in demand for air travel caused by COVID-19, which resulted in a significant  level of hedged fuel purchases in US dollars and hedged passenger revenue transactions in  a variety of foreign currencies to no longer be expected to occur, based on the Group's  operating forecasts prevailing at the balance sheet date. The Committee agreed with  management's approach to continue to derecognise hedge accounting for these  transactions. |\n| Exceptional items and alternative  performance measures | In response to the FRC's thematic review and letter to the Chairman on alternative  performance measures and exceptional items, and challenge from the Committee and  external auditor, management tabled a proposed revision to the exceptional items and  APM accounting policy. Management also performed analysis to facilitate the response to  the FRC's letter from the Committee. Following review of the draft policy revisions, the  Committee requested management to reconsider the definition of what should be  classified as exceptional, considering the position of industry peers.  The outcome of this  assessment was subsequently reflected in the revised policy approved by the Committee. The Committee also requested a detailed analysis of items proposed by management for                                                                                |\n| Defined benefit pension obligations                     | Audit Matter.

The Committee reviewed management's annual fraud risk assessment and noted alignment between the assessment,  the assurance map, including lines of defence, and the approved internal audit plan covering key financial reporting  anti-fraud controls as well as audits targeted at specific fraud risk across the Group during this period. In addition, the Committee reviewed the design of the internal control framework to prevent and detect fraud. This                                                                                                          |\n| Interest rate  and foreign  exchange  hedging  policy | The Committee reviewed management's proposals for a revised fuel hedging strategy and policy. The Group's previous  risk management strategy was to build up fuel hedges gradually over a three-year period when the level of forecast fuel  consumption and passenger revenues were more certain. Due to the current COVID-19 related market volatility and  unpredictable nature of government restrictions, management proposed a revision to the fuel hedging strategy and  supporting policy. The Committee recommended several enhancements to management's proposals, which were  accepted by management and resulted in the Committee approving the current fuel price hedging strategy and policy.  The revised strategy includes a reduction in the minimum percentage of hedging coverage as well as the use of |\n| Fleet  maintenance  and aircraft  refit               | The Committee considered management's assessment and application of existing accounting policies. In doing so,  KPMG and the Committee challenged management on the appropriateness of the accounting treatment of fleet assets,  and in particular accounting for heavy maintenance events and the componentisation of such assets on acquisition.  Management presented the existing accounting policies, supplemented with alternative treatments, including the  retrospective impact of any change in accounting policy. The Committee further challenged KPMG on the existing  accounting policies and the alternatives presented by management.                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Corporate  governance  and audit  reform              | change in accounting policy was merited. The Committee considered the European Commission's consultation 'Corporate reporting - improving its quality and  enforcement' as well as the Group's formal response to the BEIS open consultation in relation to the UK Government's  white paper 'Restoring trust in audit and corporate governance: proposals on reforms'.

        "page_content": "The Committee will continue to receive regular updates on all of the above matters in 2022.\n\n## Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThe Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for the supervision of the existence and effectiveness of Internal Control over Financial Reporting ('ICFR'). The Board has delegated the responsibility for the development of effective controls to the Chief Executive Officer and the supervision of the effectiveness of these controls to the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nThe Group's ICFR monitoring and auditing covers processes applied by the Company, Aer Lingus, British Airways, IAG GBS, IAG Loyalty, Iberia, and Vueling and covers processes performed by IAG GBS and IAG Cargo on behalf of the operating companies. The Committee reviews and validates the Group's approach to complying with the CNMV's ICFR recommendations.\n\nIn 2021, the Committee reviewed the results of the internal audits of ICFR (which included IT general controls) as well as the results of the external audit. Despite the operating conditions of 2021 and the continuation of remote working and ERTE or furlough being applied for much of the year, no material or significant weaknesses that would impact the integrity of the financial statements were identified, and management continued to improve the control environment across the Group. The Committee also tracked the progress of internal audit recommendations to address any weaknesses identified.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nThe Committee's activities during 2021 in relation to the Internal Audit function included:\n\n- \u00b7  reviewing and agreeing the internal audit 2021 plan and 2022 first six months plan (including resourcing and budget to appoint appropriate external specialist resource and recruit additional permanent resource when required to ensure the function is appropriately resourced to provide the required level of assurance over the principal risks, processes and controls throughout the Group) and amendments to the 2021 plan (as the internal auditor responded to the pandemic's impact on the Group). This included ensuring the 2021 plan continued to focus on fraud risk while\n- also ensuring coverage of specific risks, including cyber security, and satisfying ICFR and Spanish Criminal Code requirements;\n- \u00b7  reviewing key audit conclusions, discussing the quality and timeliness of management's responses, monitoring the resolution of issues raised and requesting additional audit review of certain weaknesses or concerns identified by internal audit, post management action to remediate;\n- \u00b7  holding regular meetings during the year between the Committee, the Head of Group Audit and the external audit partner as well as ensuring the Head of Group Audit feels able to raise any concerns informally and directly with the Chair of the Committee; and\n- \u00b7  monitoring and protecting internal audit's independence and standing within the Group, ensuring its ability to influence and engage at the most senior levels across IAG and all operating companies and functions and is closely involved in the Group's discussions on risk.\n\nDuring 2021, the Committee requested an independent effectiveness review of the Internal Audit function. This review was undertaken by Deloitte UK and concluded that Internal Audit remains a high performing function.\n\nThe Committee is satisfied that delivery of the approved internal audit strategy and plan is providing timely and appropriate assurance on the effectiveness of controls in place to successfully and effectively manage the Group's relevant principal risks (ie those that are capable of being subjected to an audit review).\n\n## External audit\n\nThe Committee engaged throughout the year with KPMG, with the engagement partners attending all Committee meetings as well as a series of ad hoc meetings. The Committee Chair met frequently with the Group and lead audit partners throughout the year to review Group developments, audit progress and their planned reporting. The Committee's key activities in relation to its interaction with KPMG included:\n\n- \u00b7  review of KPMG's transition and first year audit arrangements and plan and overseeing implementation progress throughout 2021;\n- \u00b7  approval of the 2021 external audit plan and strategy including consideration of scope, approach and methodology (including comparison to prior external auditor approach and reasons for differences), emerging industry and Group-specific audit risks and materiality. Monitoring the audit plan's implementation, including receiving regular reports from KPMG on key judgements, audit matters and any significant weaknesses detected in the internal control environment;\n- \u00b7  discussion, prior to recommendation of the financial statements to the Board for approval, of the audit findings, including audit differences, and observations on internal controls, operations and resources. This included challenging the auditors on their conclusions regarding fleet maintenance and aircraft refit discussed above.\n- \u00b7  performing an assessment of the effectiveness and independence of KPMG, including the quality of the 2021 audit, and reviewing and approving the fees and terms of reference; and\n- \u00b7  reviewing and approving 2021 non-audit services expenditure against policy and previously determined limit guidance. Reviewing and approving non-audit services limit guidance and expectations for 2022.\n\n## External audit scope, materiality and execution\n\nThe Committee discussed and agreed the scope of the audit with KPMG in November, prior to the commencement of the year end audit, ensuring that the audit strategy was robust and informed by the auditor's review of the financial statements for the six months to June 30, 2021 and assessment of the Group's key risks, particularly those that are significant to the audit. KPMG explained to the Committee the key tests that they intended performing on the identified higher-risk audit areas that could lead to material misstatement of the financial statements and significantly influenced the audit plan. In addition, KPMG presented a dynamic risk assessment providing the Committee with an enhanced four-dimensional view of risk by evaluating each risk's interconnectivity and how rapidly they can materialise.

        "page_content": "confirmed a shared understanding of these risks and key audit matters, including going concern and viability, the carrying value of tangible and intangible assets and how these were to be considered in the audit approach.\n\nThe auditor confirmed that 96 per cent (2020: 97 per cent) of the Group's revenue and 90 per cent (2020: 91 per cent) of the Group's total assets would be subject to a full scope audit and that specific scope procedures would be performed on IAG Loyalty. The Committee agreed that the approach was appropriate and should provide the Board with a high level of assurance regarding the integrity of the financial statements and subsequently approved the audit plan, recognising that the plan would evolve as the year concluded to reflect any changes in circumstances or outlook.\n\nThe Committee agreed with KPMG, in considering the accuracy of financial reporting, the scale of accounting errors of lesser significance that were to be brought to the Committee's attention and the amounts that would need to be adjusted so that the financial statements give a true and fair view. The Committee acknowledged KPMG's challenge in setting materiality given the economic and financial consequences of COVID-19 on the Group's revenues and profitability. The Committee challenged the auditor on the appropriateness of applying one measure of materiality only to the Group's income statement and balance sheet, given the carrying values of categories of assets and liabilities and the anticipated loss before tax for the year. The auditor explained the requirements of the relevant auditing standard and explained that, due to the current volatility, the default benchmark for a group like IAG does not currently provide an appropriate basis for setting materiality.  Consequently, the Committee was satisfied with the method used by the auditor to determine materiality and the consequential level of materiality applied during the audit.\n\n## External auditor quality and effectiveness\n\nThe Committee is very focused on audit quality and effectiveness, which is reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure the rigour and challenge of the external audit process is maintained. As 2021 is KPMG's first year as IAG's external auditor, the Committee received an update from KPMG at all Committee meetings, enabling\n\nthe Committee to assess and measure the quality of the audit through regularly monitoring the auditor's communications with management and the Committee, compliance with relevant regulatory, ethical and professional guidance and assess, on an ongoing basis, the audit team's qualifications, expertise, resources, partner performance and the effectiveness of the audit process. The Committee's assessment included, in addition to its own independent assessment, a survey as well as detailed discussion with key executives and finance staff, which demonstrated that, while the 2021 external audit was deemed to be effective and of good quality, there were some areas identified for improvement and this has been reported to the Lead Engagement Partner. The Committee's independent assessment considered the overall quality of the audit, including the independence of KPMG and whether the auditor exhibited an appropriate level of challenge and scepticism in their work and dealings with management. However, the Committee also acknowledged management's identified areas for improvement, which KPMG has agreed to action during 2022.\n\nIn particular, the Committee assessed the depth of review and level of challenge provided by the external auditor over the significant accounting policies, judgements and estimates made by management. An example of where the Committee observed the external auditor demonstrate both professional scepticism and a challenge of management was in relation to the treatment of administration costs associated with the Group's defined benefit pension schemes. The observations and conclusion of the Committee in respect of this matter are noted in this report above.\n\nIn addition to the annual evaluation and regular review of reports to the Committee and the working practices of the KPMG audit team, the Committee undertook an ongoing assessment of external audit quality and effectiveness including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n- \u00b7  the Committee oversaw formal terms of engagement with the auditor and agreed the audit fee. KPMG assured the Committee that despite a significant increase compared to the 2020 fee, the approved 2021 fee was at a level that was appropriate for the scope of the audit, to enable a quality audit to be undertaken and to allow for additional\n- procedures in relation to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the impact of UK audit reform.\n- \u00b7  reports from the external auditor were reviewed during all scheduled Committee meetings in 2021 and again in January and February 2022 Committee meetings, covering: the conclusions of the review of the Group's results for the half year, audit planning and transition updates, interim audit findings (including those of the review of the relevant key IT general controls), progress update for year end matters, and final report for year end matters.\n- \u00b7  KPMG attended all Committee meetings during the year, including ad hoc meetings, to answer any questions the Committee had outside of these formal updates.\n- \u00b7  Taking all aspects of the assessment throughout the year into consideration, the Committee concluded that it is satisfied that, despite it being the first year, the KPMG audit was probing, challenging and robust and the approach provided a reliable audit opinion with a reasonable expectation of detecting material errors, irregularities and material fraud. The Committee considered the external audit to have been effective and of a high quality.\n\n## External audit tender and transition\n\nTo comply with the Spanish Act 22/2015, the Committee conducted an audit tender process that concluded in January 2020. Since KPMG's appointment as the auditor of the Company for the years 2021, 2022 and 2023, the Committee has reviewed and monitored the implementation of KPMG's transition and audit plans as well as the execution of these plans throughout 2021. The Committee will be required to consider and approve the reappointment of KPMG annually from 2024.",

The Company complies voluntarily with the revised UK standards in relation to non-audit services and the Committee concluded that KPMG is independent.\n\nThe Committee reviews the nature and volume of projects undertaken by the external auditor on a quarterly basis and all projects are either pre-approved in line with the list of permitted services in the FRC's Revised Ethical Standard 2019 or approved by the Committee Chair for projects over \u20ac100,000 or of an unusual nature and then retrospectively approved by the Committee. The overall volume of work is addressed by a target annual maximum of \u20ac1.7 million with an additional allowance of up to \u20ac1.3 million for large projects where the external auditor is uniquely placed to carry out the work.\n\nSpend in 2021 is within the total target maximum and was \u20ac423,000 with an additional \u20ac776,000 relating to preparatory work performed on an aborted corporate finance transaction that would have been required under the regulations and most effectively performed by the statutory auditor.

This report includes both our current Directors' Remuneration Policy, as approved by Shareholders at the 2021 Annual Shareholders' Meeting, and our 2021 Annual Report on Remuneration, detailing how our policy was implemented during 2021. I will also present our proposed policy amendment to the Restricted Share Plan (RSP) for the IAG CEO, which is detailed later in the report.\n\nAs set out in more detail elsewhere in this report, COVID-19's continued impact in 2021 has been both more severe and more prolonged in our sector than others. However, the strength, stability and resilience of the IAG platform and focus of our reorganised Management Committee have enabled us to face into this protracted headwind, make improvements\n\nto the business and prepare for growth. This work has positioned the Group to take full advantage of the recovery that we are now beginning to experience in early 2022.\n\nWe believe that our new Directors' Remuneration Policy, strengthened by the proposed amendment to the IAG CEO RSP opportunity, will support the strategic priorities of the Company as we respond to the unique challenges faced by the airline industry. It will provide the Committee with the necessary flexibility to motivate and retain our key talent at a time when other markets are further progressed in their recoveries. I would like to thank shareholders on behalf of the Committee for supporting us in the transition to this framework.\n\n## Performance delivered in 2021\n\nThe proficient stewardship of the Group in 2021 both optimised preparations and opportunities for our recovery and ensured progress continued to be made against our strategy and the creation of long-term,\n\nsustainable value for our shareholders. In particular, the Group was effective in raising and maintaining cash liquidity through banks and public markets and positive levered free cash flows were achieved in 2021 as a result of improved operating cash flows and successful debt capital raising.\n\nThe establishment of the new Manchester base for Aer Lingus, Paris-Orly expansion for Vueling, strengthening of IAG Loyalty and relaunch of the BA Gatwick shorthaul network from summer 2022 (with flight sales having begun in December 2021) all showed significant progress against our long-term strategic initiatives, despite the challenges presented by the pandemic.\n\nSimilarly, the Group's climate change commitments continued to lead the global aviation sector towards net zero emissions by 2050, evidenced by IAG being the first European airline to commit to 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030, alongside multiple other environmental projects and innovations.\n\n## 2021 shareholder consultation and support for new policy\n\nIn my report last year, I described how we held a number of highly productive meetings with major shareholders to better understand their expectations on evolving Remuneration Policy design and implementation.\n\nThis feedback directly informed the design of our new Policy for 2021 and I was pleased that this collaboration was evident in the strong levels of support received for the new policy at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting in June 2021. I was also pleased to see a strong level of support for the 2020 Annual Report on Directors' Remuneration.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the biggest crisis the aviation industry has ever faced, the new Policy proposed a change in remuneration components from the 2018 policy's Performance Share Plan (PSP) to Restricted Shares (RSP) awarded under the Executive Share Plan (ESP) approved in June 2021. The strong level of support received from shareholders for this change enables us to improve simplicity and transparency, as well as strengthen the alignment of interests between our senior leaders and our shareholders. The RSP improves our ability to attract, motivate and retain our Management Committee and other key roles in what is an increasingly competitive market for talent.",

I would like to take this opportunity to thank shareholders for their contribution towards, and support for, these changes in 2021.\n\n## Response to COVID-19 during 2021 and remuneration impacts\n\nAt the end of 2020, the decision was taken to continue temporary salary and fee reductions into 2021 at a rate of 10 per cent for the IAG CEO and non-executive directors. Prior to this, the IAG CEO and non-executive directors had taken 20 per cent salary and fee reductions from the beginning of April 2020. The ongoing reduction in fixed pay maintained alignment of interests with the Group's stakeholders.\n\nThese lowered salary and fee levels were maintained for executives for the full year, extending beyond the UK Government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which ceased at September 2021.\n\n## Awards made in 2021\n\nFollowing the Board's approval of the decision to cancel the 2020 annual incentive plan, no cash or/uni00A0share-based\n\nannual incentive plan awards were made to directors or managers in 2021.\n\nFollowing shareholder approval of the Executive Share Plan in June 2021, a number of deferred, conditional long-term share awards were made to selected members of the Group's senior management, whose skills and contribution are critical to the delivery of IAG's longterm strategy.\n\nAs part of these awards, the IAG CEO received an RSP grant under the Executive Share Plan, consistent with the terms of the new Directors' Remuneration Policy. This award will vest in 2024, contingent on the satisfaction of the performance underpin, following which a two-year holding period will apply.\n\n## Summary of 2021 outcomes and senior leadership performance\n\nThe choice of performance measures for the 2021 annual incentive plan reflected the priorities for the Group during the uncertain and changing pandemic environment, namely, the need to protect capital, continue to provide an exceptional customer experience and ensure the Group's management delivered their functional objectives.\n\nThe significant volatility and overall reduction in flying schedules, as well as the unpredictability of passenger load factors experienced in 2021, made the implementation of a planned carbon efficiency measure impractical. Senior managers continued to focus on the delivery of the Group's low-carbon transition pathway as part of individual and functional objectives.\n\nThe uncertain and changing outlook for 2021, also made it appropriate to set and review targets at six-monthly intervals. This ensured the Group's senior leadership remained focused on the right priorities in light of changing government policies and commercial conditions.\n\nThroughout the ongoing challenges of 2021, the Group's senior leadership demonstrated their ability to respond to changing priorities and deliver strong underlying improvements in the areas where outcomes remained within senior leaders' ability to influence.\n\nThis effective management of significant short-term challenges alongside the preparation of the business for the return to flying, has set the foundations for success in 2022 and the longer term.\n\n## Variable pay outturns for the IAG CEO in 2021\n\nPrior to Committee's review of the 2021 Annual Incentive Plan performance measures, the IAG CEO confirmed to the Board that he did not wish to be considered for a 2021 annual incentive award.  In explaining his reasons for this, the IAG CEO has reflected on the experience of all the Group's stakeholders during 2021 due to the protracted nature of the pandemic and has sought to ensure his experience is aligned with theirs in a genuinely meaningful way. His decision demonstrates both personal integrity and a long-term commitment to the Group and its stakeholders. This request has been accepted by the Board, mindful of considerations in relation to our key stakeholders, who express their thanks to the IAG CEO for his enormous personal",

As a result of the pandemic, all three measures (relative TSR, EPS, and RoIC) fell short of the threshold level at which shares are paid out, resulting in a zero vesting outturn for the IAG CEO.\n\nNeither short- or long-term awards were therefore realised by the IAG CEO in respect of 2021.\n\n## Implementation of the Policy in 2022\n\nWith positive signs of recovery now visible in the external market and reductions to all directors' salaries, pension contributions and fees having been in place continuously for 20 months, it was agreed to reinstate full director fixed pay from January 1, 2022. It should be noted that this is the first point at which the full contractual CEO salary of \u00a3820,000 per annum, approved for implementation at September 2020, has been paid to the IAG CEO. For nonexecutive directors, full fees were restored from January 1, 2022.\n\nWith the return of more normalised flying schedules and passenger volumes expected in 2022, it was agreed to reintroduce a carbon efficiency annual incentive measure for 2022. The metric used to assess this measure will be grammes of CO2 per passenger kilometre, an unchanged basis from 2020.\n\nOur objective of continuing to build aligned interests between IAG senior leaders and the Group's shareholders will be supported in 2022 by the second year of RSP grants.  However, to ensure the Group is able to offer the IAG CEO a fair and proportionate long-term incentive opportunity, reflective of the complexity of the Group, its strategy, and one that adequately recognises ongoing external challenges, a proposal to amend the IAG CEO's maximum annual RSP opportunity will be presented at the 2022 Annual Shareholder's meeting.  I have already engaged with a number of our largest shareholders regarding this change and the reasons for it. This resolution will propose an increase in RSP opportunity from 100 per cent of salary to 150 per cent of salary.\n\nThe Committee believes a change to a more commensurate IAG CEO RSP opportunity is essential in light of the growing opportunities for talent in the external market.  In the Committee's view, the CEO's existing arrangements are becoming increasingly uncompetitive compared to companies both inside and outside of the aviation industry. The Group competes for talent in a global market and recent evidence suggests that the rate of executive pay growth in mainland Europe\n\nand US has been faster than the UK with the opportunity gap to US packages being a particular retention concern.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic the Group has lost a number of critical senior individuals to competitors in other sectors. Also, over the past year, the Group's own executive recruitment experience has confirmed the rising market for executive pay, reducing the relative positioning of the IAG CEO's total compensation compared to that of his executive team and increasing the compression in pay levels within the executive team. These factors highlight the challenges we face in retaining our top talent essential to the Group's transformation, as well as the important role that fair and competitive remuneration play in this.\n\nWe do not feel that it would be in IAG or our shareholders' best interests to compromise our ability to retain the current IAG CEO. The current environment amplifies the need for the IAG CEO's skills, capabilities and deep aviation experience. We therefore have the strong view that it is in IAG and our shareholders' best interests to change the RSP opportunity and place more emphasis in the CEO's remuneration package on sustained long-term performance.\n\nAs part of its overall review of the IAG CEO's package, the Committee has decided to defer the annual review of the IAG CEO's salary to the second half of 2022 to better understand the Group's recovery from the pandemic.  Whilst the proposed increase to the IAG CEO's RSP opportunity will increase competitiveness of the overall remuneration package and is therefore a step in the right direction, the Committee is acutely aware of the importance of ensuring that the salary level is also competitive in the context of a dynamic talent market in the geographies in which the Group operates and competes for talent.\n\n## Strategy and link to remuneration\n\nIAG was formed to create a new, disruptive industry model based around consolidation, strategic flexibility and financial performance. Our role in the world is to connect people, businesses and countries. We do this and create value through a unique model that enables our airlines to perform in the long-term interests of our customers, people, shareholders and society, knowing that success in each reinforces the others. We hold ambition, teamwork, innovation, pragmatism, efficiency and responsibility as key values that enable us to fulfil our purpose. The flexibility in our framework allows us to be agile and respond quickly to changing operating environments.\n\nThe Committee's main objective in the implementation of the Directors' Remuneration Policy is to drive the behaviours that support the delivery of our strategy and business objectives. Through\n\nthis overarching principle, we embed our pay for performance approach, ensuring both our short- and long-term incentive plans only pay out if sustainable progress and value is delivered to our shareholders. With the proposed amendment, our policy will continue to contain the necessary flexibility and discretion to adapt to commercial and market circumstances, as well as recoup incentives where any performance is subsequently understood to be unfounded. In this way we drive the right culture and maintain alignment of interests between our senior management and our shareholders, which is also reinforced by our minimum shareholding requirements that continue to apply for two years post-employment for executive directors.\n\nUnderstanding and balancing the interests of all stakeholders in executive pay decisions ensures outcomes are objective, fair and proportionate. The simplification of our remuneration framework and the focus on long-term performance, supports the Group's management to continue to deliver our strategy and sustainable shareholder returns.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nThe Committee believes that the 2021 Policy, supported by the amendment to the current IAG CEO RSP opportunity, will better underpin delivery against multi-year objectives and will further the alignment between our strategy and executive pay decisions.\n\nOn behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank shareholders for their engagement and support over the past year and request that this continues into 2022 as we seek to make an important change to the Policy this year.\n\nI hope that our Remuneration Report is clear in explaining how the new Policy has been implemented in 2021 and that it receives your support at our 2022 Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nApproved by the Board and signed on its behalf by\n\n## Alberto Terol\n\nRemuneration Committee Chairman",

Revisions in the areas of pensions, minimum shareholding and long-term incentive either simplified existing structures, such as the replacement of PSP with RSP, or introduced straightforward rules for new items, such as the post-employment shareholding requirement. This has improved the ability of participants, employees and shareholders to understand executive pay arrangements. Additionally, the Company continues to make more remuneration analysis and information available to both employees and shareholders, via both UK and Spanish disclosures.\n\nOur corporate governance structure provides for a cross-over in board committee membership between the Remuneration Committee and the Audit and Compliance Committee. This ensures a joined-up view between emerging or crystalised risks and remuneration outcomes. The design of our policy also ensures independent control over remuneration outcomes, with all executive variable pay being awarded on a discretionary basis and subject to malus and clawback provisions.\n\nOur Policy identifies the maximum opportunity for each component of executive remuneration and also illustrates potential total remuneration outcomes in various performance scenarios. These disclosures provide transparency around overall opportunities.\n\nOur executive remuneration performance measures, targets, underpins are transparently disclosed where awards are made, detailing the relationship between the performance achieved and the delivery of our long-term strategy and the creation of sustainable shareholder value. The transparency of this approach, alongside the independent nature of executive remuneration decisions, supports proportionate remuneration outcomes relative to company and individual performance measures, as well as the wider performance environment.\n\nThe selection and balance of financial and non-financial measures for both short- and long-term incentives is designed to reinforce the values and behaviours that support the delivery of long-term sustainable returns to shareholders. In particular, the new RSP, and high overall proportion of deferred executive pay, enable a focus on transformation and long-term success.",

The Spanish legal regime regarding directors' remuneration is substantially parallel to that of the UK as far as directors' remuneration disclosure and approval requirements are concerned.\n\nThe Company welcomes the opportunity provided by the Spanish CNMV allowing companies to prepare free-format reports. Therefore, for the fourth consecutive year, IAG is presenting a consolidated report responding to Spanish and UK disclosure requirements. This report will be accompanied by a duly completed form which is required by the CNMV covering some relevant data. This is prepared in accordance with Spanish legislation and is available on the Company's and the CNMV's respective websites.\n\nIt is the Company's intention once again to comply voluntarily with all reporting aspects of the UK legislation of 2018, The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations (SI 2018/860) and The Companies (Directors' Remuneration Policy and Directors' Remuneration Report) Regulations 2019, and to follow best practice UK standards.\n\nIn addition to the Remuneration Committee Chairman's statement, this Directors' Remuneration Report contains the Annual Report on Remuneration, which covers the information on directors' remuneration paid in the reported year.\n\n## Directors' Remuneration Policy\n\n## Key elements of pay\n\n## Executive directors\n\nThe Company's remuneration approach is to provide total remuneration outcomes that reflect the delivery of the business strategy, are competitive, and take into account each individual's performance of their role in the Company's work.\n\nThe Committee receives regular updates on pay and conditions of the Group's employees and takes this into account when considering executive directors' remuneration.\n\n## The current Directors' Remuneration Policy\n\nThe current Directors' Remuneration Policy was approved at the Shareholders' Meeting on June 17, 2021 and reflects recent regulatory and corporate governance framework changes. We are proposing to make an amendment to the current Directors' Remuneration Policy in respect of the restricted share award opportunity for the IAG CEO, which will be put forward for shareholder approval at the 2022 Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The policy (including the amendment) can be found later in this report.\n\nThe Committee maintains an ongoing evaluation of the policy to ensure its components, opportunities and implementation outcomes continue to achieve the Policy's objectives.",

Where the Company makes a payment in lieu of notice, a lump sum in lieu of the first six months' base salary is payable within 28 days of the date of termination of employment. A payment in respect of base salary for the second six-month period only becomes payable if, in the Company's opinion, the executive has taken reasonable steps to find alternative paid work and then only in six one-monthly instalments. The Company may reduce the sum payable in respect of any month by any amount earned by the executive (including salary and benefits) referable to work done in that month.\n\nIn the event of an executive's redundancy, compensation, whether in respect of a statutory redundancy payment or a payment in lieu of notice or damages for loss of office is capped at an amount equal to 12 months' base salary. The Company will honour the contractual entitlements of a terminated director; however, the Company may terminate an executive's service contract with immediate effect and without compensation on a number of grounds including where the executive is incapacitated for 130 days in any 12-month period, becomes bankrupt, fails to perform his or her duties to a reasonable standard, acts dishonestly, is guilty of misconduct or persistent breach of his or her duties, brings the Company into disrepute, is convicted of a criminal offence, is disqualified as a director, refuses to agree to the transfer of his or her service contract where there is a transfer of the business in which he or she is working or ceases to be eligible to work in Spain or the UK (as applicable).\n\nUnder any of the Company's share plans, save in respect of deferred annual incentive awards (which will normally vest in full following cessation for any reason), if a director leaves, the Board, after considering the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, may exercise its discretion (within the rules of the schemes) to grant Good Leaver status. This can be granted in certain circumstances including for example (list not exhaustive) the director leaving for reasons of ill health, injury or disability, redundancy, retirement or death. Executive directors leaving with good leaver status will receive a pro rata amount of their PSP shares subject to the company performance conditions being met, and a pro rata amount of their RSP shares, subject to the underpin being met, in accordance with the plan rules. The proration is normally calculated according to what proportion of the performance period the executive director spent in company service. Normal vesting dates, holding periods, and post-cessation shareholding guidelines will normally continue to apply, other than in a limited number of exceptional circumstances in accordance with plan rules and/or at the discretion of the Board. If good leaver status is not granted to an executive director, all outstanding awards made to them will lapse.\n\nExecutive directors leaving with good leaver status are eligible to receive a pro rata annual incentive payment for the period of the year actually worked, subject to the regular performance assessment and paid in the normal manner following year end.\n\nIn the event of an executive director's termination from the Company, they must not be employed by, or provide services to, a restricted business (i.e. an airline or travel business that competes with the Company) for a period of 12 months.\n\n## Non-executive directors\n\nNon-executive directors (including the Chairman) do not have service contracts. Their appointment is subject to the Board regulations and the Company's Bylaws. They do not have the right to any compensation in the event of termination as directors. Board members shall hold office for a period of one year.

As the sole executive director, the IAG CEO has confirmed in writing that he has not received any other items in the nature of remuneration other than those already disclosed in the table above.\n\n## Base salary\n\nThe values shown represent the actual salary paid to the IAG CEO as an executive director for each performance year. For 2020, the significantly reduced values reflect two considerations. Firstly, salary is only reported from appointment as an executive director on September 8, 2020. Secondly, the salary value reflects that a COVID-related reduction of 20 per cent of base salary operated for all directors during 2020. In contrast, for 2021, the IAG CEO served the full performance year as an executive director and the level of COVID-related salary reduction was decreased from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. The IAG CEO's contractual salary was \u00a3820,000 on appointment.\n\n## Taxable benefits\n\nTaxable benefits include the provision of a company car, a fuel allowance and private health insurances.\n\nThe Executive Director received payments relating to his relocation from Spain in 2020. These relocation payments terminated in February 2021.\n\nFrom January 2021 the Executive Director became eligible for a transitionary allowance to reflect that as a result of his role as IAG CEO he and his family now live in the UK. This allowance provides a two-year fixed period of transitionary support and considers that the IAG CEO continues to personally maintain a base in Madrid given the Company's significant operations and business in Spain. The value of the transitionary allowance is not included in the calculation of any pension, incentive or other benefit values. Payment of the transitionary allowance will terminate in December 2022.\n\n## Pension-related benefits\n\nEmployer's contribution to pension scheme and/or cash in lieu of pension contribution.\n\n## Annual incentive plan\n\nThe IAG CEO confirmed to the Board that he did not wish to be considered for a 2021 annual incentive award, waiving any 2021 incentive opportunity. The single total figure of remuneration therefore shows that no annual incentives have been awarded to the IAG CEO either for 2020 or 2021.\n\n## Long-term incentive vesting\n\nThis relates to the IAG PSP 2019 award based on performance measured to December 31, 2021. The outcomes of the performance conditions resulted in zero vesting for the IAG CEO and are described in detail later in this report.\n\n## Share price appreciation and depreciation\n\nThe amount of remuneration attributable to share price appreciation is zero, as there was zero vesting of the IAG PSP 2019 award. The/uni00A0Committee has not exercised any discretion as a result of share price appreciation or depreciation for any of the remuneration in the above table.\n\n## Life insurance\n\nThe Company provides life insurance and accidental death cover for all executive directors. For the year ended December 31, 2021 the Company paid life insurance premium contributions of \u20ac13,464 (2020: \u20ac15,366).\n\n## Exchange rate for 2021\n\nFor the year to December 31, 2021, \u20ac:\u00a3 exchange rate applied is 1.1587 (2020: 1.1273).",

        "page_content": "REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CONTINUED\n\n## Variable pay outcomes\n\n## 2021 Annual Incentive Plan\n\nThe IAG Annual Incentive Plan supports the business strategy through incentivising the delivery of identified priorities within the reporting period. The composition of measures selected reflect the most important priorities for Group for the year to deliver long-term sustainable returns. For 2021, in view of the ongoing restrictions to flying, the identified priorities were to focus on protecting capital, improving operating efficiencies, reducing costs, continuing to offer our customers an outstanding experience, whilst exploring and taking advantage of the new opportunities that would present themselves with the return to flying. The planned reintroduction of a carbon efficiency measure in 2021 was deferred until 2022, owing to the significantly reduced flying schedule and passenger volumes expected during the reporting period.\n\nThe 2021 performance year was split into two halves, reflecting the highly uncertain and changing external environment and enabling appropriate measures to be adopted for the anticipated change in commercial conditions expected with recovery.\n\nThe 2021 Annual incentive plan structure for the IAG CEO was as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial measures - (60%)\n- \u00b7 Customer - Net Promoter Score (20%)\n- \u00b7 Strategic and personal (20%)\n\nStrategic and personal objectives focussed on:\n\nEffectively navigating the pandemic : Responding to changing external factors and ensuring IAG is operational ready to take advantage of opportunities as market restrictions ease.\n\nLead sustainable aviation : Driving IAG's sustainability strategy and progressing towards ambitious carbon targets and building industry momentum towards a net zero world.\n\nSet strategy and plans to maximise long term value for IAG :  Oversee business transformations at the operating companies to ensure IAG emerges more efficiently from the crisis, and further develop the capability, culture, diversity and talent to underpin Group strategy and transformation plans.\n\nUnder the policy, the IAG CEO has a maximum annual incentive opportunity of 200 per cent of contractual salary.\n\n## Decision by IAG CEO not to be considered for 2021 annual incentive\n\nPrior to the Committee's review of the full year 2021 Annual Incentive Plan measures, the IAG CEO advised the Board that he did not wish to be considered for a 2021 Annual Incentive Plan award.  This request reflected a desire to maintain a personal alignment of interests with all the Group's stakeholders, many of whom continued to be negatively impacted by the ongoing pandemic in 2021.\n\nThe Board has accepted the IAG's CEO's request and expresses its gratitude to him for his long-term commitment to the Group. The Board also recognises that this is the second year for which no annual incentive or long-term incentive has been realised by the IAG CEO. These being in addition to reductions to his fixed pay over the same performance period.\n\nIrrespective of any decision regarding a financial outcome to the IAG CEO, the Board have evaluated the IAG CEO's performance in 2021 as being 'Exceptional' in managing the pandemic, driving the transformation of the Group and in leading sustainable aviation. This performance assessment is set against the context of an extremely uncertain and challenging external environment.",

This award was granted on May 10, 2018 and was tested at the end of the performance period which began on January 1, 2018 and ended on December 31, 2020. The plan participants who were serving executive directors during the year of vesting (2020), were Willie Walsh, who was Chief Executive Officer of IAG at the time of award and received a grant equivalent to 200 per cent of salary and Enrique Dupuy de L\u00f4me, who was Chief Financial Officer of IAG at the time of the award and received a grant equivalent to 150 per cent of salary. Luis Gallego and Steve/uni00A0Gunning, who were not executive directors at the time of the award in 2018, received awards of 150 per cent and 120 per cent of salary respectively.\n\nOne third of the award was subject to a TSR performance condition measured against the TSR performance of the MSCI European Transportation (large and mid-cap) index, one third subject to achievement of the Company's adjusted EPS targets (diluted EPS, adjusted for exceptional items), and one third subject to RoIC. The definition of RoIC used was the methodology as described in the Company's 2017 Annual Report and Accounts. The vesting of any award was subject to the Board being satisfied that the Group's underlying financial performance was satisfactory in the circumstances prevailing over the three-year period.\n\nThe outcomes of the performance conditions were as follows:\n\n| Measure                                                                                                                                                                             | Threshold                                                        | Target                                                                                                                                       | Maximum                                                                          | Outcome                                     | Vesting (as per  cent award  granted in 2018)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| TSR performance compared to the TSR  performance of the MSCI European  Transportation Index (large and mid-cap)  over the full three-year performance  period (one-third weighting) | IAG's TSR  performance  equal to the index  (25 per cent  vests) | IAG's TSR  performance  between index  return and  8/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent p.a.  outperformance  (straight-line  vesting between  threshold | IAG's TSR  performance  exceeds index by  8 per cent p.a.

The simplified structure and transparency of the RSP in comparison to the Performance Share Plan, also provided a better basis to attract and retain senior management talent.\n\nA three-year vesting period and further two-year holding period applies to RSP awards for executive directors, with vesting being dependent upon a satisfactory review of the discretionary underpin by the Remuneration Committee. This assessment focuses on the Company's overall performance during the vesting period, including financial and non-financial performance measures, as well as any material risk or regulatory failures identified and ensures any value delivered to executive directors is fair and appropriate in the context of business performance and shareholder experience. Malus and clawback provisions apply to RSP awards enabling the reduction of awards so far as nil value to further ensure that corporate or individual failure is not rewarded under the plan.\n\nFor 2021, the face value of the IAG CEO's award was reduced from 200 per cent of salary to 100 per cent of salary in association with the change from a PSP to an RSP opportunity.",

Vesting will be contingent on  the satisfaction of a discretionary underpin, assessed three years after grant. In assessing  the underpin, the Committee will consider the Company's overall performance, including  financial and non-financial performance measures over the course of the vesting period, as  well as any material risk or regulatory failures identified. Financial performance may  include elements such as revenue, profitability, cash generation, return on capital and  benchmarked with comparable airlines. Non-financial performance may include a range of  operational and strategic measures critical to the Company's long-term sustainable  success. This assessment will ensure any value delivered to executive directors is fair and  appropriate in the context of the performance of the business and experience of our  stakeholders and that corporate or individual failure is not rewarded.

At the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on June 17, 2021 the Company was given authority to allocate up to 100,000,000 shares (2.01 per cent of the share capital at that time) under the Executive Share Plan in 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 financial years. Of this a maximum of 5,000,000 shares could be allocated to executive directors under the Executive Share Plan for awards made during 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 financial years. Should some or all of these above-mentioned shares not be allocated to the executive directors, they may be allocated to the remaining participants in the Executive Share Plan.",

The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial year-ends. A spot share price has been taken on the date of listing, and a three-month average has been taken prior to the year ends.\n\nThe FTSE 100 was selected because it is a broad equity index of which the Company is a constituent, and the index is widely recognised.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IAG CEO remuneration history\n\nThe table below shows the IAG CEO single total figure of remuneration for the latest ten-year rolling period:\n\n|      |              | IAG CEO - total single figure of  remuneration   | Annual incentive payment as a  percentage of the maximum   | Long-term incentive vesting as a percentage of  the maximum   |\n|------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2012 |              | \u00a31,083,000                                       | No annual incentive payment                                | Zero vesting of long-term incentives                          |\n| 2013 |              | \u00a34,971,000                                       | 78.75 per cent of maximum                                  | 100 per cent of maximum                                       |\n| 2014 |              | \u00a36,390,000                                       | 97.78 per cent of maximum                                  | 85 per cent of maximum                                        |\n| 2015 |              | \u00a36,455,000                                       | 80 per cent of maximum                                     | 100 per cent of maximum                                       |\n| 2016 |              | \u00a32,462,000                                       | 33.33 per cent of maximum                                  | 50 per cent of maximum                                        |\n| 2017 |              | \u00a33,954,000                                       | 92.92 per cent of maximum                                  | 66.67 per cent of maximum                                     |\n| 2018 |              | \u00a33,030,000                                       | 61.85 per cent of maximum                                  | 46.19 per cent of maximum                                     |\n| 2019 |              | \u00a33,198,000                                       | 51.97 per cent of maximum                                  | 72.11 per cent of maximum                                     |\n| 2020 | Willie Walsh | \u00a3662,000                                         | No annual incentive payment                                | Zero vesting of long-term incentives                          |\n|      | Luis Gallego | \u00a3301,000                                         | No annual incentive payment                                | Zero vesting of long-term incentives                          |\n| 2021 |              | \u00a31,110,000                                       | No annual incentive payment                                | Zero vesting of long-term incentives                          |\n\nSingle total figure of remuneration includes basic salary, taxable benefits, pension-related benefits, annual incentive award and longterm incentive vesting, and in 2020 and 2021 reflects agreed reductions to salary and pension benefits in light of the pandemic.\n\n## Percentage change in remuneration of the IAG CEO compared to employees\n\nThe table below compares the remuneration outcomes of the IAG CEO against the UK workforce in 2021. The 'all UK employees' comparator group remains unchanged from that used for 2020 on the continued rationale that using the largest comparator group provides the most representative and meaningful comparison for the UK workforce.\n\nOver 90 per cent of UK employees reported are employed by British Airways, with the majority of the remainder employed by either employees of other airlines currently working in the UK, IAG Head Office, the Group's specialist procurement function GBS, IAG Tech, IAG Loyalty or IAG Cargo. The comparison therefore provides a full cross-section of roles, job functions and seniority levels in the UK. The use of the UK population also keeps a broad alignment with the population captured for the IAG CEO pay ratio, providing a more consistent population basis for all senior executive and workforce pay comparisons.\n\nFor specific comparisons, such as the award of salary increases, a 'same store' employee population is used focusing only on employees who were present in both 2020 and 2021, to give a more representative comparison against the salary increase eligible population.\n\nIAG CEO\n\nUK employees",

UK employee pay is based on the payroll records of 29,774 employees who were in the Group for the whole of or some of 2021. To provide a fair and representative view to all remuneration received by UK employees, the 2021 basic salary and total remuneration figures include statutory and company top-up furlough payments. The 2020 UK employee remuneration figures excluded all types of furlough payment and were representative of earnings for time worked, but were not representative of the full level of pay received by employees and their actual remuneration experience. With the UK furlough scheme having ended in September 2021, this consideration should not be relevant for future years reporting.\n\nTo ensure the accuracy of these calculations, earnings data was collected directly from the UK payroll on a month-by-month basis. Any variable incentive elements in respect of 2021, payable to employees later in 2022, are modelled on an employee-by-employee basis against agreed frameworks. This approach enables fair and accurate comparison to the IAG CEO 2021 single total figure of remuneration.\n\nThe continued low ratio for 2021 shows the impact of the ongoing pandemic to the IAG CEO's pay. The increases in remuneration for both the IAG CEO and UK employees in 2021, maintain the ratio in a broad equilibrium, with the ratio reducing slightly by two points from 2020.\n\nThe increase in the UK employee remuneration in 2021 reflects:\n\n- \u00b7  The rise in employee pay resulting from the reporting of all amounts paid to employees in 2021 (in 2020, UK Government furlough and company top-up amounts were not reported as part of employee earnings)\n- \u00b7  Any payments made to managers under the 2021 annual incentive plan\n- \u00b7  Changes to the size and composition of the UK workforce between years, with pay for 37,081 employees being reported for 2020 and 29,744 for 2021\n\nThe change in IAG CEO remuneration between 2020 and 2021, is due to balance of changing factors as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  The higher proportion of contractual salary and pension contributions received by the IAG CEO in 2021 vs 2020.\n- \u00b7  The increase in the value of the IAG CEO's taxable benefits resulting from his eligibility to a transitionary allowance in 2021.\n- \u00b7  No short- or long-term incentives being received by the IAG CEO in 2021.\n\nThe ratio reported for the second year of the pandemic is the lowest the Group has reported since disclosure of this metric commenced. The reduction in the ratio from 2019 demonstrates the continuing impact of the pandemic and is an accurate reflection of the contraction in IAG CEO pay, with current IAG CEO remuneration being around 35 per cent of 2019 levels. The fall in the ratio at all quartiles from 2019 and 2020 demonstrates that the implementation of the Policy in 2021 has not favoured the IAG CEO at the expense of the wider workforce.\n\nThe Committee is aware that the current ratio, whilst temporary, is an outlier amongst similar profile organisations. As the Group continues its recovery from the pandemic and IAG CEO variable incentives again begin to be payable against the generation of sustainable shareholder value, it is expected that the Group's CEO pay ratio will increase to a more representative, pre-pandemic range.",

        "page_content": "## Implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2022\n\nAt the outset of 2022, the Directors' Remuneration Policy continues to apply only to the IAG CEO, who is currently the only IAG executive director.\n\nWith the Group emerging from the pandemic at end of 2021, and the CEO having voluntarily given up over \u00a3150,000 in salary and pension allowances since assuming the IAG CEO role at September 2020, it was agreed to cease the IAG CEO salary reduction from January 1, 2022. This restoration increased the IAG CEO salary to its full contractual rate of \u00a3820,000 per annum and also implemented the full value of salary-linked pension benefits. This marked the first point at which the IAG CEO received full contractual pay since appointment, demonstrating the significant length of time pay reductions had been in place.\n\nThe review of executive director base salaries normally occurs in January each year. For 2022, the Committee has decided to defer the review of the IAG CEO's salary until the second half of the year. This postponement will enable the Committee to better understand the Group's recovery from the pandemic and make an informed decision in relation to the IAG CEO's base salary level.\n\nExecutive director\n\nBasic salary review\n\n## 2022 annual incentive plan\n\nFor 2022, with the anticipated return of more normalised flight and passenger volumes, we will reinstate/uni00A0an IAG-specific carbon efficiency measure, to further drive progress towards our Flightpath Net Zero 2050 commitment. This will measure the fuel efficiency of our flight operations, taking account of our/uni00A0network, aircraft mix and passenger load factors. The specific metric will be grammes of CO2 per passenger kilometre and will have a weighting of 10 per cent of overall incentive.\n\nIn addition to the carbon-efficiency measure, the existing 2021 measure types; financial, customer and strategic and personal will be carried forward into 2022 and weighted in alignment with the Policy with financial measures accounting for no less than 60 per cent of overall incentive opportunity.\n\n## 2022 long-term incentive plan\n\nFollowing the approval of the Executive Share Plan in June 2021, the Group ceased making awards under the Performance Share Plan (PSP) and granted the first schedule of Restricted Share Plan (RSP) to eligible senior leaders. In replacing the PSP with an RSP, a maximum RSP opportunity of 100 per cent of salary was determined for the IAG CEO and was approved in the Policy.\n\nSince the implementation of the Policy in 2021, the Committee has reflected at length on the appropriateness of the IAG CEO RSP opportunity and the extent to which the current opportunity level will be effective in supporting the delivery of the business strategy.\n\nThe current opportunity level was set at a modest level relative to the size and complexity of the Group's operations. Since approval, the Committee has undertaken a review of the CEO's remuneration arrangements, in light of the concerns around the competitiveness of the CEO's package, the wish to place more emphasis on sustained long-term alignment, and the need to retain a CEO of outstanding quality at this critical time.\n\nA number of shareholders have been consulted for their views and a resolution will be submitted to the 2022 Annual Shareholders' Meeting to amend the current Policy. This change will reflect an increase in the IAG CEO's maximum RSP opportunity from 100 per cent of salary to 150 per cent of salary.\n\nThe proposed RSP opportunity reflects the Committee's careful consideration, taking into account:\n\n- \u00b7  Long-term award opportunities both externally at other relevant businesses and internally within our senior management team\n- \u00b7  The cumulative impact that this higher opportunity could have on the CEO's long-term interest in IAG and the associated benefits of that, and\n- \u00b7  The wish to place more emphasis in the CEO's remuneration package on sustained long-term alignment at a challenging time for the business when the CEO provides critical stability\n\nAmending the Policy in this area builds long-term alignment of interests with shareholders and affords the Committee greater flexibility in determining the value of any RSP awards, relative to all factors, in 2022 and the future.\n\n## 2022 long-term incentives and wider senior leadership\n\nThe eligibility criteria for 2022 RSP awards remained unchanged from 2021, with grants for senior leaders continuing to be made only to consistently high-performing individuals, whose skills are critical to the delivery of the business strategy and whom the Company has identified as a long-term retention priority. With the exception of the IAG CEO, the maximum value of individual awards scheduled to be made in 2022 will remain consistent with last year and the overall face value of grants will be similar to that distributed in 2021.\n\nAlthough no value can be realised by plan participants from 2022 awards until 2025, their simplicity and transparency create immediate engagement, attraction and retention benefits amongst the Group's key leaders. This continues to enable the Group to maximise the contribution of its senior leadership throughout the 2022 recovery and remain focused on the delivery of long-term sustainable value to shareholders.",

The IAG CEO's eligibility to the transitionary allowance will cease at the end of 2022.\n\n## Non-executive director fees\n\nNon-executive director fees were last reviewed in 2017 and remain unchanged for 2022. The fees have remained unchanged since 2011.\n\nIn 2021, all non-executive directors including the Chairman, agreed to a 10 per cent reduction in fees for the full year, in view of the need to preserve cash within the business. Recognising the Group's emergence into recovery, and in alignment with the decision taken for the IAG CEO salary reinstatement, it was agreed that all non-executive directors should return to receiving full fees from January 1, 2022.\n\n## The Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is regulated by article 32 of the IAG Board Regulations and by its own Regulations approved on February 25, 2021. A copy of these Regulations is available on the company website.\n\nBeyond executive directors, the Committee oversees the general application of the Remuneration Policy for the members of the IAG Management Committee (and also occasionally considering remuneration matters related to managers generally across the Group).\n\nArticle 32 of the Board Regulations ensures that the Remuneration Committee shall be made up of no fewer than three independent non-executive directors, with the dedication, capacity and experience necessary to carry out their function. Alberto Terol chairs the Committee and holds Senior Independent Director responsibility. None of the Committee members has any personal financial interest, other than as a shareholder, in the matters to be decided.\n\nIn accordance with the 2018 UK Code, the Remuneration Committee also has responsibility to review workforce remuneration and related policies and the alignment of incentives and rewards with culture.\n\n## Advisers to the Committee\n\nThe Committee appointed Deloitte as its external adviser in September 2016. Deloitte reports directly to the Committee. The fees paid/uni00A0to Deloitte for advice provided to the Remuneration Committee during 2021 were \u00a356,073 (\u20ac64,971), charged on a time and materials basis./uni00A0Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and a signatory to the voluntary UK Code of Conduct. As well as advising the Remuneration Committee, other Deloitte teams provided advice in relation to remuneration, pensions, taxation and immigration compliance requirements for IAG's mobile workforce, data governance, business process improvement, financial/fiscal advisory work and tax to the Group in 2021. The/uni00A0Committee has reviewed the remuneration advice provided by Deloitte during the year and is comfortable that it has been objective and independent.\n\nIn addition to Deloitte providing the Remuneration Committee with market updates on pay themes, the Group also received market data and insights from other specialist consultants such as Aon, PwC and Willis Towers Watson in 2021.\n\n## Statement of voting\n\nThe table below shows the consultative vote on the 2020 annual Directors' Remuneration Report and the binding vote on the Directors' Remuneration Policy at the 2021 Shareholders' Meeting:\n\n|                                | Number of votes cast   | For              | Against         | Abstentions/Blank   |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|\n| 2020 Annual Directors'         | 2,573,169,545          | 2,383,678,763    | 189,490,782     | 1,525,952           |\n| Remuneration Report            | (99.94 per cent)       | (92.58 per cent) | (7.36 per cent) | (0.06 per cent)     |\n|                                | 2,574,695,497          | 2,407,953,176    | 149,433,203     | 17,309,118          |\n| Directors' Remuneration Policy | (99.33 per cent)       | (93.53 per cent) | (5.80 per cent) | (0.67 per cent)     |",

The following table details the current Executive Director's holdings of conditional awards over ordinary shares of the Company granted under the IAG IADP. Awards are shown for the performance periods ended December 31, 2017, December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019.\n\nNo award was made in respect of 2020 following the decision to cancel the 2020 IAG Annual Incentive Plan.

Nevertheless, the Committee recognises the importance of effective corporate governance and is firmly committed to UK best practice, such that we continue to operate in line with the regulations.\n\n## IAG Remuneration Principles\n\n| Alignment              | Our remuneration policies promote long-term value creation, through transparent  alignment with our corporate strategy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Simplicity and clarity | We will keep our remuneration structures as simple and clear as possible to ensure they  are understandable and meaningful to employees and shareholders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Competitiveness        | Total remuneration will be competitive for the role, taking into account scale, sector,  complexity of responsibility and geography.

        "page_content": "## Information supporting the policy tables\n\n## Shareholding requirements\n\nIn order to increase alignment with shareholders, executive directors are required to build up a minimum personal shareholding equal to a set percentage of base salary. The share price used to calculate the guideline is either the share price on the date of award or on the date of vesting/exercise. Executive directors will be required to retain the entire 100 per cent of shares (net of tax) which vest from share plans until their respective shareholding requirement is attained. The CEO of IAG is required to build up and maintain a shareholding of 350 per cent of basic salary, and other executive directors are required to build up and maintain a shareholding of 200 per cent of basic salary.\n\nOn departure, executive directors will be required to hold the number of shares in line with their in-employment shareholding requirement (or the number of shares that they own at departure if lower) for two years from their date of termination from the Group. Shares will normally be retained in the nominee account administered by the Company to ensure this.\n\n## Malus and clawback provisions\n\nThe Board, following the advice of the Committee, has authority to reduce or cancel awards before they are satisfied (and/or impose additional conditions on awards), and to recover payments, if special circumstances exist. These special circumstances include (but are not limited to) fraud; material breach of any law, regulation or code of practice; an error or a material misstatement of results leading to overpayment or over-allocation; misconduct; failure of risk management; the occurrence of an exceptional event affecting the Company's value or reputation; payments based on results that are subsequently found to be materially financially inaccurate or misleading; serious reputational damage as a result of a participant's behaviour; corporate failure; or any other circumstances in which the Board considers it to be in the interests of shareholders for the award to lapse or be adjusted. This is aligned with the latest version of the UK Corporate Governance Code provisions.\n\nFor RSP and PSP awards, clawback provisions apply for two years post vesting (which will usually align with the additional holding period). For the bonus deferral awards, there will be three years from the date of award in which shares can be withheld, i.e. the entire period from the date of the award until vesting. For the cash element of the annual incentive plan, clawback provisions apply for three years from the date of payment. The proportion of an award to be withheld or recovered will be at the discretion of the Board, upon consideration of the Committee, taking into account all relevant matters.\n\n## Discretion to adjust formulaic outcomes\n\nThe Board, after considering the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, retains the discretion to adjust (including preventing them in their entirety and making no payment) the formulaic outcome of incentive award payments in order to, in its opinion, properly reflect overall corporate performance. This includes where the business has had an exceptional event, in particular events that significantly impact stakeholders. This will include analysing the performance of the participant and the underlying financial performance of the Group to check whether they have been satisfactory in the circumstances and whether vesting levels reflect overall corporate performance. The Remuneration Committee can also take other factors as it considers relevant into account. Underlying financial performance is defined as the overall performance of the Company, which may be considered with reference to a range of measures as the Remuneration Committee considers most appropriate at the time. Stakeholders would include shareholders, customers, and the Company's workforce. The Board also has authority to reduce the award levels and/or the vesting outcomes for the former PSP and the RSP where the Company has experienced a significant fall in share price, as a result of which it considers that participants have unduly benefitted from windfall gains.\n\n## Benefits, expenses and taxation\n\nThe Board may arrange to settle any taxes and associated expenses payable if it deems such settlement appropriate, including, but not/uni00A0limited to tax on benefits or where, without such settlement, the executive will be subject to double taxation on the same remuneration/uni00A0amount.",

The proposed amendment to the policy for 2022 seeks to increase the opportunity level for long-term incentive component, therefore rebalancing the Executive Director's overall package more towards share-based, deferred remuneration and thereby increasing the proportion of overall remuneration opportunity directly aligned to shareholder's interests.\n\nThe chart on the following page shows the 2021 remuneration outturn for the Executive Director set against various remuneration outturn scenarios under the proposed 2022 policy opportunity structure. The scenarios illustrated include the minimum remuneration receivable, the remuneration receivable if the director performs in line with the Company's expectations, the maximum remuneration receivable, and the maximum remuneration receivable with 50 per cent share price growth. With the exception of the illustration showing 50 per cent share price growth, no share price variation is taken into consideration in these scenarios.\n\n## IAG CEO - 2022 remuneration scenario assumptions\n\nFixed remuneration is basic salary as at January 1, 2022 ((\u00a3820,000 (\u20ac950,134), plus taxable benefits (est. \u00a3275,000 (\u20ac318,642), plus pension-related benefits (2022 level of \u00a3102,500 (\u20ac118,766). The value of 2021 taxable benefits includes a fixed-term transitionary allowance of \u00a3250,000 p.a. (payable only until December 2022), as described on page 169.\n\nThe annual incentive amount is zero at the minimum remuneration level, \u00a3820,000 (\u20ac950,134) at the on-target level (equivalent to 100 per cent of salary), and \u00a31,640,000 (\u20ac1,900,268) at maximum (equivalent to 200 per cent of salary).\n\nThe long-term incentive (RSP) opportunity is presented on the basis of the proposed 2022 policy amendment which increases the Executive Director's opportunity from 100 per cent of salary to 150 per cent of salary.  RSP outturns are shown as zero at the minimum remuneration level, \u00a31,230,000 (\u20ac1,425,201) at the on-target level (equivalent to 150 per cent of salary) and \u00a31,845,000 (\u20ac2,137,802) at the maximum level, which includes a 50 per cent share price appreciation, solely for the purpose of illustrating a wider range of potential remuneration outcomes.\n\nIn contrast to the reporting of executive director remuneration in the 2021 single total figure of remuneration table where RSP value is shown at vesting rather than grant, for illustrative purposes for the scenario modelling opposite, RSP values for 2021 and 2022 are shown at time of grant rather than time of vesting.\n\nEuro amounts are shown at the 2021 exchange rate GBP 1: EUR 1.1587.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration scenarios: IAG CEO 2021 remuneration outturn vs proposed 2022 remuneration opportunity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFixed Remuneration\n\nAnnual Incentive\n\nLong-term incentive (RSP)\n\n- 1 Fixed remuneration includes a transitionary allowance of \u00a3250,000 p.a. (payable until the end of 2022 only), as described on page 169.\n\n## Remuneration policy below director level\n\nManagers at the operating companies in the Group participate in their own company annual incentive plans. These all have performance measures specific to their operating company, and are typically financial, operational, and customer service measures.\n\nSelected senior managers participate in RSP under Executive Share Plan rules. Employees below senior manager level do not participate in RSP.\n\n## Notes to the policy tables\n\nThe Board may make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (and exercise any discretions available to it in connection with such payments) which are not in line with this Remuneration Policy, where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before this policy came into effect (provided that they were in line with any applicable directors' Remuneration Policy in force at the time they were agreed) or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and such payment was not, in the Board's opinion, in consideration of the individual becoming a director. For these purposes 'payments' include the Board satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in respect a share award, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted. This will also include the vesting of any awards granted under the IAG PSP. The Board may also make remuneration payments and payments for loss of office outside of the policy set out above if such payments are required by law in a relevant country.\n\n## External non-executive directorship\n\nThe Company's consent is required before an executive can accept an external non-executive appointment and permission is only given in appropriate circumstances. The Company allows the executive to retain any fee from such appointments.\n\n## Approach to recruitment remuneration\n\nThe remuneration for new executive directors will be in line with the policy for current executive directors as far as possible, as expressed in the policy table earlier in this report.\n\nOn appointment, new executive directors will have their basic salary set by taking into account the external market, their peers, and their level of experience. New executive directors will participate in the annual and long-term incentives on the same basis as existing directors.\n\nTo facilitate recruitment, the Board, after considering the recommendation of the Committee, may make one-off awards to buy out variable pay or contractual rights forfeited on leaving a previous employer. Generally, such buy-out awards will be made on a comparable basis to those forfeited giving due regard to all relevant factors (including value, performance targets, the likelihood of those targets being met and vesting periods). In such circumstances, shareholders will be provided with full details and rationale in the next published Remuneration Report.\n\nExcluding the value of any potential buy-out, the maximum value of variable remuneration offered at recruitment will be no more than that awarded to current directors.\n\nIn the case of an internal promotion to executive director, the Company will continue to honour any commitments made before promotion. Other than that, the remuneration arrangements on recruitment will be as above.\n\nNon-executive directors will be recruited in line with the Company's Remuneration Policy principles outlined before.\n\n## Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group\n\nThe Committee is updated on pay and conditions of the employees within the Group and takes this into account when considering executive directors' remuneration.\n\nThe pay of employees across all companies in the Group is taken into account when determining the level of any increase in the annual salary review of directors. This takes place each year at the January Committee meeting.\n\nWhen determining the RSP awards for executive directors, the Committee takes note of the eligibility criteria and the potential size of awards for executives below director level in all companies within the Group.\n\nAt the operating company level, the company consults with employee representative bodies, including trade unions and works councils. This will include consultation on company strategy, the competitive environment, and employee terms and conditions. In addition, some of the operating companies run employee opinion surveys in order to take into consideration employee views on a variety of subjects, including leadership, management, and the wider employee experience.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS\n\nFor the year to December 31, 2021\n\n## 1 Background and general information\n\nInternational Consolidated Airlines Group S.A. (hereinafter 'International Airlines Group', 'IAG' or the 'Group') is a leading European airline group, formed to hold the interests of airline and ancillary operations. IAG is a Spanish company registered in Madrid and was incorporated on December 17, 2009. On January 21, 2011 British Airways Plc and Iberia L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas de Espa\u00f1a S.A. Operadora (hereinafter 'British Airways' and 'Iberia' respectively) completed a merger transaction becoming the first two airlines of the Group. Vueling Airlines S.A. ('Vueling') was acquired on April 26, 2013, and Aer Lingus Group Plc ('Aer Lingus') on August 18, 2015. A list of the subsidiaries of the Group is included in the Group investments section.\n\nIAG shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities and also on the stock exchanges of Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia (the 'Spanish Stock Exchanges'), through the Spanish Stock Exchanges Interconnection System ( Mercado Continuo Espa\u00f1ol ).\n\n## 2   Significant accounting policies\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the European Union (IFRSs as endorsed by the EU). The consolidated financial statements are rounded to the nearest million unless otherwise stated. These financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost convention except for certain financial assets and liabilities, including derivative financial instruments and other equity investments that are measured at fair value. The carrying value of recognised assets and liabilities that are subject to fair value hedges are adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable to the risks that are being hedged. The financial statements for the prior year include reclassifications that were made to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nThe Group's financial statements for the year to December 31, 2021 were authorised for issue, and approved by the Board of Directors on February 24, 2022.\n\n## Presentation of results\n\nThe prior period Cash flow statement includes a reclassification to conform with the current period of presentation regarding the settlement of foreign currency derivative financial instruments not designated in a hedge relationship, but entered into to mitigate foreign exchange movements on long-term financial liabilities in currencies other than the functional currencies of the operating companies holding the liabilities. Accordingly, the Group has reclassified the results for the year ended December 31, 2020 to recognise \u20ac136 million of derivative settlement cash inflows as Settlement of derivative financial instruments within cash flows from financing activities with a corresponding increase in cash outflows within cash flows from operating activities.\n\n## Change in accounting policy\n\nDuring 2021, the Group has changed its accounting policy with regard to the treatment of administration costs associated with British Airways' Airways Pension Scheme (APS) and the New Airways Pension Scheme (NAPS) defined benefit schemes, while remaining in compliance with IAS 19. The change in policy has been adopted to better reflect the underlying management and operation of these schemes. This change in accounting policy has been applied retrospectively to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nPreviously a discounted estimate of future administration costs was included as part of the APS and NAPS defined benefit obligations. These administration costs were recognised as a service cost in the year in which such costs arose and recorded within Other comprehensive income. Under the updated accounting policy, administration costs are now recognised as incurred and included within Employee costs in the Income statement. This change has had the effect of reducing the defined benefit obligation and increasing retained earnings at both December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020. It has in addition increased the charge to Employee costs and the Financing credit relating to pensions in the Income statement, as well as increased the Remeasurements of post-employment benefit obligations and Currency translation differences in the Statement of other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nFurther details of the accounting policy change are given in note 36.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe economic uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic and the fragmented and varied responses from governments have had a significant impact on the Group's results and cash flows. At December 31, 2021, the Group had total liquidity of \u20ac11,986 million (December 31, 2020: total liquidity of \u20ac8,054 million), comprising cash and interest-bearing deposits of \u20ac7,943 million, \u20ac2,917 million of committed and undrawn general facilities and a further \u20ac1,126 million of committed and undrawn aircraft specific facilities.\n\nThe increase in liquidity during the year to December 31, 2021 was attributable to, amongst other actions, accessing \u20ac2.3 billion (\u00a32.0 billion) of the UK Export Finance (UKEF) Credit Facility, the issuance of fixed rate bonds of \u20ac1.2 billion, the issuance of a convertible bond of \u20ac0.8 billion, securing a multi-entity three-year Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) of \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.8 billion), securing a \u20ac0.7 billion aircraft specific facility achieved as part of an Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificate (EETC) financing structure and securing an additional UKEF Credit Facility of \u20ac1.2 billion (\u00a31.0 billion). These actions raised an additional \u20ac7.6 billion of liquidity. Of facilities in place at December 31, 2021, \u20ac0.7 billion matures by the end of the going concern period. A loan from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) of \u20ac150 million has limited financial covenants, but otherwise the Group's facilities do not have financial covenants. There are a number of non-financial covenants to protect the position of the lenders, including restrictions on the upstreaming of cash to the Company or lending to other Group companies.\n\nDespite the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group has continued to successfully secure financing arrangements for all aircraft delivered in 2021.\n\nIn its assessment of going concern over the period to June 30, 2023 (the 'going concern period'), the Group has modelled three scenarios referred to below as the Base Case, the Downside Case and the Downside Lockdown Case. The Group's three-year business plan, prepared and approved by the Board in December 2021, was subsequently refreshed with the latest available internal and external information in February 2022. This refreshed business plan supports the Base Case, which takes into account the Board's and management's views on the anticipated impact of and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic on the Group's businesses across the going concern period. The key inputs and assumptions underlying the Base Case include:",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 As part of the recovery, the Group has assumed a gradual easing of travel restrictions, by geographical region, based on deployment of vaccines during the year. Travel restrictions, including testing and quarantine requirements, between countries are assumed to continue to be scaled back and removed;\n- \u00b7 Capacity recovery modelled by geographical region (and in certain regions, by key destinations) with capacity gradually increasing from a reduction of 34 per cent in quarter 1 2022 (compared to the equivalent period in 2019) to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the going concern period with the average over the going concern period being 11 per cent down versus 2019;\n- \u00b7 Passenger unit revenue per ASK, although forecast to continue to recover, is assumed to still remain below levels of 2019 by the end of the going concern period, which is based on, amongst other assumptions, a greater weighting of shorthaul versus longhaul, leisure versus business and economy versus premium compared to 2019. Specifically, the Group's assumption is that traffic related to domestic and leisure will recover faster than longhaul and business;\n- \u00b7 The Group has assumed that the committed and undrawn general facilities of \u20ac2.9 billion will not be drawn over the going concern period. The availability of certain of these facilities reduces over time, with \u20ac2.7 billion being available to the Group at the end of the going concern period;\n- \u00b7 The Group has assumed that of the committed and undrawn aircraft specific facilities of \u20ac1.1 billion, \u20ac0.9 billion would be available to be drawn over the going concern period if required, but is not expected to be drawn;\n- \u00b7 Of the capital commitments detailed in note 15, \u20ac4.3 billion is due to be paid over the going concern period of which the Group has committed aircraft financing of \u20ac0.6 billion, under the EETC financing structure, and the Group has further forecast securing 80 per cent, or \u20ac2.7 billion, of the aircraft financing required that is currently uncommitted, to align with the timing and payments for these aircraft deliveries. This loan to value assumption is below the level of financing the Group has been able to achieve recently, including over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic to date;\n- \u00b7 The Group has assumed that the \u20ac0.5 billion convertible bond that matures in November 2022 will be refinanced.\n\nThe Downside Case applies stress to the Base Case to model a more prolonged downturn, with a more gradual recovery relative to the Base Case. The Downside Case is representative of existing travel restrictions remaining in place and the gradual recovery of capacity being delayed longer than in the Base Case. The Downside Case also models a more acute impact on the longhaul sector, with the domestic sector and European shorthaul sectors recovering faster than longhaul. The result of which is that the levels of capacity assumed under the Base Case are delayed by a quarter under the Downside Case and would reach those of the Base Case at the end of the Going Concern period. In the Downside Case, over the going concern period capacity would be 17 per cent down on 2019. The Downside Case assumes that there would be no drawing on either of the RCF and the UKEF credit facility. The Directors consider the Downside Case to be a severe but plausible scenario.\n\nIn addition, the Group has sensitised the Downside Case to incorporate the occurrence of a two-month lockdown, and associated travel restrictions, during the second quarter of 2022, a scenario referred to as the Downside Lockdown Case. The Downside Lockdown Case is representative of the emergence of more virulent strains of COVID-19 and/or strains for which the efficacy of existing vaccines is reduced. The Downside Lockdown Case assumes that there would be full drawing on both the RCF and the UKEF credit facility. Subsequent to this lockdown, capacity is assumed to recover gradually over the going concern period and to only recover to the Base Case by the end of 2023. In this scenario, over the going concern period capacity would be 35 per cent down on 2019. Consistent with the Downside Case, the Directors consider the Downside Lockdown Case to be an alternative severe but plausible scenario.\n\nUnder all three scenarios modelled, the Group's limited financial covenants are forecast to be met.\n\nThe Group has modelled the impact of further deteriorations in capacity operated and yield, but also considered further mitigating actions, such as reducing operating and capital expenditure. The Group expects to be able to continue to secure financing for future aircraft deliveries and in addition has further potential mitigating actions, including asset disposals, it would pursue in the event of adverse liquidity experience.\n\nHaving reviewed the Base Case, Downside Case, Downside Lockdown Case and additional sensitivities, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has sufficient liquidity to continue in operational existence over the going concern period and hence continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year to December 31, 2021.\n\nHowever, due to the uncertainty created by COVID-19, there are a number of significant factors that are outside of the control of the Group, including: the status and impact of the pandemic worldwide; the emergence of new variants of the virus and potential resurgence of existing strains of the virus; the speed at which vaccines are deployed worldwide; the efficacy of those vaccines; the availability of medicines to combat the impact of the virus and the restrictions imposed by national governments in respect of the freedom of movement and travel. The Directors, therefore, are not able to provide certainty that there could not be a more severe downside scenario than those they have considered, including the sensitivities in relation to the timing of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, capacity operated, impact on yield, cost mitigations achieved and the availability of aircraft financing to offset capital expenditure. In the event that a more severe scenario were to occur, the Group may need to secure sufficient additional funding. Sources of additional funding are expected to include securing additional long-term financial facilities. However, the Group's ability to obtain this additional funding in the event of a more severe downside scenario represents a material uncertainty at February 24, 2022 that could cast significant doubt upon the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and therefore, to continue to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements for the year to December 31, 2021 do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group was unable to continue as a going concern.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED\n\nFor the year to December 31, 2021\n\n## 2   Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, each made up to December 31, together with the attributable share of results and reserves of associates and joint ventures, adjusted where appropriate to conform to the Group's accounting policies.\n\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, which is the date on which the Group obtains control and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. Control exists when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nThe Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration paid is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that are not held by the Group and are presented separately within equity in the Consolidated balance sheet. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nIf the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through the Income statement.\n\nGoodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the fair value of non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n\nAll intragroup account balances, including intragroup profits, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Unconsolidated structured entities\n\nThe Group regularly uses sale and leaseback transactions to finance the acquisition of aircraft. In certain instances the Group will undertake several such sale and leaseback transactions at once through Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (EETCs). Under each of these financing structures, a company or companies (the EETC Issuer) are established to facilitate such financing on behalf of a number of unrelated investors. In certain of these financing structures, additional special purpose vehicles (the Lessor SPV) are established to provide additional financing from a number of further unrelated investors to the EETC Issuer. The proceeds from the issuance of the EETCs by the EETC Issuer, and where relevant the proceeds obtained from the Lessor SPV, are then used to purchase aircraft solely from the Group. The Group will then enter into lease arrangements (which meet the recognition criteria of Asset financed liabilities) with the EETC Issuer, or where relevant the Lessor SPV, with payments made by the Group to the EETC Issuer, or the Lessor SPV, distributed, through a trust, to the aforementioned unrelated investors. The main purpose of the trust structure is to enhance the credit-worthiness of the Group's debt obligations through certain bankruptcy protection provisions and liquidity facilities, and also to lower the Group's total borrowing cost.\n\nThe EETC Issuer and the Lessor SPV are established solely with the purpose of providing the asset-backed financing and upon maturity of such financing are expected to have no further activity. The relevant activities of the EETC Issuer and the Lessor SPV are restricted to preestablished financing agreements and the retention of the title of the associated financed aircraft. Accordingly, the Group has determined that each EETC Issuer and the Lessor SPVs are structured entities. Under the contractual terms of the financing structures, the Group has no exposure to losses in these entities, does not own any of the share capital of the EETC Issuer or the Lessor SPV, does not have any representation on the respective boards and has no ability to influence decision-making.\n\nIn considering the aforementioned facts, management has concluded that the Group does not have access to variable returns from the EETC Issuers and Lessor SPVs because its involvement is limited to the payment of principal and interest under the arrangement and, therefore, it does not control the EETC Issuers or the Lessor SPVs and as such does not consolidate them.\n\n## Segmental reporting\n\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with how resource allocation decisions are made by the chief operating decisionmaker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for resource allocation and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the IAG Management Committee.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\n## a Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the functional currency, being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. In particular, British Airways and Avios have a functional currency of pound sterling. The Group's consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the Group's presentation currency.\n\n## b Transactions and balances\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency using the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary foreign currency balances are translated into the functional currency at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at balance sheet exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Income statement, except where hedge accounting is applied. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities classified as noncurrent on the Balance sheet are recognised within Net currency retranslation (charges)/credits in the Income statement. All other gains and losses arising on the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in operating profit.\n\n## c Group companies\n\nThe net assets of foreign operations are translated into euros at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Profits and losses of such operations are translated into euros at average rates of exchange during the year. The resulting exchange differences are taken directly to a separate component of equity (Currency translation reserve) until all or part of the interest is sold, when the relevant portion of the cumulative exchange difference is recognised in the Income statement.",

        "page_content": "## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is held at cost. The Group has a policy of not revaluing property, plant and equipment. Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost less the estimated residual value on a straight-line basis, over the economic life of the asset. Residual values, where applicable, are reviewed annually against prevailing market values for equivalently aged assets and depreciation rates adjusted accordingly on a prospective basis.\n\n## a Capitalisation of interest on progress payments\n\nInterest attributed to progress payments made on account of aircraft and other qualifying assets under construction are capitalised and added to the cost of the asset concerned. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Income statement in the year in which they are incurred.\n\n## b Fleet\n\nAll aircraft are stated at the fair value of the consideration given after taking account of manufacturers' credits. Fleet assets owned or right of use ('ROU') assets are disaggregated into separate components and depreciated at rates calculated to write down the cost of each component to the estimated residual value at the end of their planned operational lives (which is the shorter of their useful life or lease term) on a straight-line basis. Depreciation rates are specific to aircraft type, based on the Group's fleet plans, within overall parameters of 23 years and up to 5 per cent residual value for shorthaul aircraft and between 23 and 29 years (depending on aircraft) and up to 5 per cent residual value for longhaul aircraft. Right of use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the aforementioned depreciation rates.\n\nCabin interior modifications, including those required for brand changes and relaunches, are depreciated over the lower of five years and the remaining economic life of the aircraft.\n\nAircraft and engine spares acquired on the introduction or expansion of a fleet, as well as rotable spares purchased separately, are carried as property, plant and equipment and generally depreciated in line with the fleet to which they relate.\n\nCertain major overhaul expenditure, including replacement spares and labour costs, is capitalised and amortised over the average expected life between major overhauls. All other replacement spares and other costs relating to maintenance of fleet assets (including maintenance provided under 'pay-as-you-go' contracts) are charged to the Income statement on consumption or as incurred respectively.\n\n## c Other property, plant and equipment\n\nProvision is made for the depreciation of all property, plant and equipment. Property, with the exception of freehold land, is depreciated over its expected useful life over periods not exceeding 50 years, or in the case of leasehold properties, over the duration of the lease if shorter, on a straight-line basis. Equipment is depreciated over periods ranging from 4 to 20 years.\n\n## d Leases\n\nThe Group leases various aircraft, properties, equipment and other assets. The lease terms of these assets are consistent with the determined useful economic life of similar assets within property, plant and equipment.\n\nAt inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified tangible asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group has elected not to apply such consideration where the contract relates to an intangible asset, in which case payments associated with the contract are expensed as incurred.\n\nLeases are recognised as a ROU asset and a corresponding lease liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group.\n\n## Right of use assets\n\nAt the lease commencement date a ROU asset is measured at cost comprising the following: the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability; any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received; and any initial direct costs. In addition, at the lease commencement date a ROU asset will incorporate unavoidable restoration costs to return the asset to its original condition, for which a corresponding amount is recognised within Provisions. The ROU asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. If ownership of the ROU asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at their present value, which includes the following lease payments: fixed payments (including insubstance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable; variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate; amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees; the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option; and payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options.\n\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. The interest rate implicit in the lease is the discount rate that, at the inception of the lease, causes the aggregate present value of the minimum lease payments and the unguaranteed residual value to be equal to the fair value of the leased asset and any initial indirect costs of the lessor. For aircraft leases these inputs are either observable in the contract or readily available from external market data. The initial direct costs of the lessor are considered to be immaterial. If the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be determined, the Group entity's incremental borrowing rate is used.\n\nEach lease payment is allocated between the principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the Income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the lease liability for each period. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made.\n\nThe carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification of the lease contract, a re-assessment of the lease term (specifically in regard to assumptions regarding extension and termination options) and changes in variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate.",

        "page_content": "Financial Statements\n\n## NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED\n\nFor the year to December 31, 2021\n\n## 2   Significant accounting policies continued\n\nThe Group has elected not to recognise ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and those leases of low-value assets. Payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straightline basis as an expense in the Income statement. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less, that do not contain a purchase option. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture.\n\nThe Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or rate, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is re-assessed and adjusted against the ROU asset. Extension options are included in a number of aircraft, property and equipment leases across the Group and are reflected in the lease payments where the Group is reasonably certain that it will exercise the option. The Group is also exposed to variable lease payments based on usage or revenue generated over a defined period. Such variable lease payments are expensed to the Income statement as incurred.\n\nThe Group regularly uses sale and lease transactions to finance the acquisition of aircraft. Each transaction is assessed as to whether it meets the criteria within IFRS 15 'Revenue from contracts with customers' for a sale to have occurred. If a sale has occurred, then the associated asset is de-recognised and a ROU asset and lease liability are recognised. The ROU asset recognised is based on the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that is retained. Any gain or loss is restricted to the amount that relates to the rights that have been transferred to the counter-party to the transaction. Where a sale has not occurred, the asset is retained on the balance sheet within Property, plant and equipment and an asset financed liability recognised equal to the financing proceeds. The principal criteria for assessing whether a sale has occurred or not, is whether the contract contains the option, at the discretion of the Group, to repurchase the aircraft over the lease term; with the existence of such a repurchase option resulting in a sale having been deemed not to have occurred, and; if no such repurchase option exists, then a sale is deemed to have occurred.\n\n## Cash flow presentation\n\nLease payments are presented as follows in the Consolidated cash flow statement: the proceeds received from sale and leaseback transactions are presented within cash flows from investing activities; the repayments of the principal element of lease liabilities are presented within cash flows from financing activities; the payments of the interest element of lease liabilities are included within cash flows from operating activities; and the payments arising from variable elements of a lease, short-term leases and low-value assets are presented within cash flows from operating activities.\n\n## COVID-19 related rent concessions\n\nOn May 28, 2020, the IASB issued 'COVID-19 Related Rent Concessions - amendments to IFRS 16 Leases'. The EU subsequently adopted the amendment on October 9, 2020. The amendment provides a practical expedient for lessees, up to June 30, 2021, not to assess whether a COVID-19 related rent concession is a lease modification. On March 31, 2021, the IASB extended the period for the application of these concessions through to June 30, 2022. The EU subsequently adopted the amendment on August 31, 2021. The extended amendment is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after April 1, 2021 and the Group has elected to adopt this amendment for the year to December 31, 2021.\n\n## Lessor accounting\n\nFrom time to time the Group will lease, to third parties, specific assets, including certain property, plant and equipment. On inception of the lease, the Group determines whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.\n\nIn order to make this determination, the Group assesses whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. Factors in making this assessment include, but are not limited to, whether the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the underlying asset and whether the underlying asset transfers to the lessee or the lessee has the option to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease. Where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred, then the lease is recorded as a finance lease, otherwise it is recorded as an operating lease.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\n## a Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures and represents the excess of the consideration paid over the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree. Where the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree is in excess of the consideration paid, a gain on bargain purchase is recognised immediately in the Income statement.\n\nFor the purpose of assessing impairment, goodwill is grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units). Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever indicators exist that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\n## b Brands\n\nBrands arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries are initially recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Long-established brands that are expected to be used indefinitely are not amortised but assessed annually for impairment.\n\n## c Customer loyalty programmes\n\nCustomer loyalty programmes arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries are initially recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. A customer loyalty programme with an expected useful life is amortised over the expected remaining useful life. Established customer loyalty programmes that are expected to be used indefinitely are not amortised but assessed annually for impairment.\n\n## d Landing rights\n\nLanding rights acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Landing rights acquired from other airlines are capitalised at cost.\n\nCapitalised landing rights based outside of the United Kingdom and the EU are amortised on a straight-line basis over a period not exceeding 20 years. Capitalised landing rights based within the United Kingdom and the EU are not amortised, as regulations provide that these landing rights are perpetual.",

        "page_content": "## e Contract-based intangibles\n\nContract-based intangibles acquired in a business combination are recognised initially at fair value at the acquisition date and amortised over the remaining life of the contract.\n\n## f Software\n\nThe cost to purchase or develop computer software that is separable from an item of related hardware is capitalised separately and amortised on a straight-line basis generally over a period not exceeding five years, with certain specific software developments amortised over a period of up to ten years.\n\n## g Emissions allowances\n\nWhere an operating company purchases emissions allowances, such that it has a surplus of allowances when compared to the amount required to discharge its obligations to the relevant authorities, these amounts are recognised at cost and recorded within Other intangible assets. Emissions allowances recorded within Other intangible assets are not revalued or amortised but are tested for impairment whenever indicators exist that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where an operating company has a deficit of allowances compared to the amount required to discharge its obligations to the relevant authorities, the Group recognises a provision for the outstanding amount, measured at the market price of such an allowance at the reporting date.\n\nFrom time to time the Group enters into sale and repurchase transactions for specified emission allowances. Such transactions do not meet the recognition criteria of a sale under IFRS 15 and accordingly the asset is retained on the balance sheet within Intangible assets and an Other financing liability recognised equal to the proceeds received.\n\n## Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAssets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the value by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less cost to sell and value-in-use. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that were subject to an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.\n\n## a Property, plant and equipment, including Right of use assets\n\nThe carrying value is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and the cumulative impairment losses are shown as a reduction in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment.\n\n## b Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets are held at cost and are either amortised on a straight-line basis over their economic life, or they are deemed to have an indefinite economic life and are not amortised. Indefinite life intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\n## Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an undertaking in which the Group has a long-term equity interest and over which it has the power to exercise significant influence. Where the Group cannot exercise control over an entity in which it has a shareholding greater than 51 per cent, the equity interest is treated as an associated undertaking.\n\nA joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The considerations made in determining significant influence or joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control over subsidiaries.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, and initially recognised at cost. The Group's interest in the net assets of associates and joint ventures is included in Investments accounted for using the equity method in the Balance sheet and its interest in their results is included in the Income statement, below operating result. The attributable results of those companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included for the periods of ownership.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\n## a Other equity investments\n\nOther equity investments are non-derivative financial assets including listed and unlisted investments, excluding interests in associates and joint ventures. On initial recognition, these equity investments are irrevocably designated as measured at fair value through Other comprehensive income. They are subsequently measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in Other comprehensive income with no recycling of these gains and losses to the Income statement when the investment is sold. Dividends received on other equity investments are recognised in the Income statement.\n\nThe fair value of quoted investments is determined by reference to bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date. Where there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques.\n\n## b Interest-bearing deposits\n\nInterest-bearing deposits, principally comprising funds held with banks and other financial institutions with contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest, and held in order to collect contractual cash flows, are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.",

        "page_content": "Financial Statements\n\n## NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED\n\nFor the year to December 31, 2021\n\n## 2   Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## c Derivative and non-derivative financial instruments and hedging activities\n\nDerivative financial instruments, comprising interest rate swap derivatives, foreign exchange derivatives and fuel hedging derivatives (including options, swaps and forward contracts) are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. They are classified as financial instruments through the Income statement. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss arising from remeasurement depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged (as detailed below under cash flow hedges). The time value of options is excluded from the designated hedging instrument and accounted for as a cost of hedging. Movements in the time value of options are recognised in Other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects the Income statement.\n\nWhen forward contracts are used to hedge forecast transactions, the Group generally designates only the spot component of the forward contract as the hedging instrument within a hedge relationship. Gains or losses arising on the change in fair value of the spot component are recognised within Other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity. The forward component of a forward contract is not designated within a hedge relationship, with the associated gains and losses on the forward component recorded within Other comprehensive income in the Cost of hedging reserve within equity until the underlying transaction affects the Income statement.\n\nTo manage foreign exchange movements on foreign currency revenues (denominated in US dollars, euros, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan), certain non-derivative repayment instalments on foreign currency-denominated interest-bearing liabilities are designated as hedging instruments within a hedge relationship. Revaluations arising from movements in foreign exchange rates are recorded within Other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve. Accumulated gains or losses within the cash flow hedge reserve are reclassified to Passenger revenue in the same period as the forecast transaction occurs or when hedge accounting is discontinued when the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur.\n\nWhen a derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and that instrument expires, is sold or is restructured, if the initial forecast transaction is still expected to occur, any cumulative gain or loss remains in the cash flow hedge reserve until such time as the hedge item impacts the Income statement. Where there is a change in the risk management objective, then hedge accounting is discontinued and the associated cumulative gain or loss arising prior to the change in risk management objective remains in the cash flow hedge reserve until such time as the underlying hedged item impacts the Income statement had the risk management objective continued to have been met. Where a forecast transaction which was previously determined to be highly probable and for which hedge accounting applied, is no longer expected to occur, hedge accounting is discontinued and the cumulative gain or loss in the cash flow hedge reserve is immediately reclassified to the Income statement.\n\nThe Group enters into foreign currency derivative contracts, that are not designated in a hedge relationship, in order to mitigate foreign exchange movements on financial liabilities designated in currencies other than the presentational currency of the Group, including but not limited to, lease liabilities. Movements in the fair value of such derivatives are recognised in the Income statement in the period in which they occur and are presented within Net currency retranslation (charges)/credits.\n\nExchange gains and losses on monetary investments are taken to the Income statement unless the item has been designated and is assessed as an effective hedging instrument. Exchange gains and losses on non-monetary investments are reflected in equity.\n\n## d Cash flow hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as in a hedge relationship of a highly probable expected future transaction are assessed for effectiveness and accordingly recorded in the Cash flow hedge reserve within equity.\n\n## Hedge effectiveness\n\nHedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments, to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument. A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements: (i) there is 'an economic relationship' between the hedged item and the hedging instrument; (ii) the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship; and (iii) the hedge ratio is aligned with the requirements of the Group's risk management strategy and in all instances is maintained at a ratio of 1:1.\n\nSources of ineffectiveness include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 In hedges of fuel purchases, ineffectiveness may arise if the timing of the forecast transaction changes from what was originally estimated, or if there are changes in the credit risk of the Group or the derivative counterparty;\n- \u00b7 In hedges of foreign currency purchases, ineffectiveness may arise if the timing of the forecast transaction changes from what was originally estimated, or if there are changes in the credit risk of the Group or the derivative counterparty; and\n- \u00b7 In hedges of interest rate payments, ineffectiveness may arise if there are differences in the critical terms between the interest rate derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item, or if there are changes in the credit risk of the Group or the derivative counterparty.\n\nIneffectiveness is recorded within the Income statement as Realised/unrealised (losses)/gains on derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting and presented within Other non-operating charges.\n\n## Reclassification adjustments\n\nGains and losses accumulated in the Cash flow hedge reserve within equity are reclassified from the Cash flow hedge reserve when the hedged item affects the Income statement as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Where the forecast hedged item results in the recognition of revenue or expenses within the Income statement (such as the purchase of jet fuel for which both fuel and the associated foreign currency derivatives are designated as the hedging instrument), the accumulated gains and losses recorded in both the cash flow hedge reserve and the cost of hedging reserve are reclassified and included in the Income statement within the same caption as the hedged item is presented. Such reclassification occurs in the same period as the hedged item is recognised;",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Where the forecast hedged item results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (such as the purchase of aircraft for which foreign currency derivatives are designated as the hedging instrument), the accumulated gains and losses recorded within both the cash flow hedge reserve and the cost of hedging reserve are included in the initial cost of the asset. These gains or losses are recorded in the Income statement as the non-financial asset affects the Income statement (which for aircraft is through Depreciation over the expected life of the aircraft); and\n- \u00b7 Where the forecast hedged items results in the recognition of a financial asset or liability (such as variable rate debt for which interest rate swaps are designated as the hedging instrument), the accumulated gains and losses recorded within the cash flow hedge reserve are reclassified to Interest expense within the Income statement at the same time as the interest expense arises on the hedged item.\n\nFurther information on the risk management activities of the Group are given in note 28d.\n\n## e Long-term borrowings\n\nLong-term borrowings are recorded at amortised cost, including lease liabilities which contain interest rate swaps that are closely related to the underlying financing and as such are not accounted for as an embedded derivative.\n\n## f Convertible debt\n\nConvertible bonds are classified as either compound financial instruments or hybrid financial instruments depending on the settlement alternatives upon redemption. Where the bondholders exercise their equity conversion options and the Group has no alternative other than to settle the convertible bonds into a fixed number of ordinary shares of the Company, then the bonds are classified as a compound financial instrument. Where the Group has an alternative settlement mechanism to the convertible bonds that permits settlement in cash, then the convertible instrument is classified as a hybrid financial instrument.\n\nConvertible bonds that are classified as compound financial instruments consist of a liability and an equity component. At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt, and is subsequently recorded at an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds, and is recognised within Long-term borrowings. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bond and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in the equity portion of the convertible bond in Other reserves and is not subsequently remeasured. The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the effective interest rate for similar non-convertible debt to the liability component of the instrument. The difference between this value and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the liability.\n\nConvertible bonds that are classified as hybrid financial instruments consist only of a liability component recognised within Long-term borrowings. At the date of issue, the entirety of the convertible bonds is accounted for at fair value with subsequent fair value gains or losses recorded within Long-term borrowings. The fair value of such financial instruments is obtained from their respective quoted prices in active markets, with the portion of the change in fair value attributable to changes in the credit risk of the convertible bonds recognised in Other comprehensive income and the portion of the change in fair value attributable to market conditions recognised in the Income statement within Finance costs.\n\nIssue costs associated with compound financial instruments are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds where appropriate based on their relative carrying values at the date of issue. The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity. Issue costs associated with hybrid financial instruments are expensed immediately to the Income statement.\n\n## g Impairment of financial assets\n\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group recognises provisions for expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortised cost, based on 12-month or lifetime losses depending on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. The simplified approach, based on the calculation and recognition of lifetime expected credit losses, is applied to contracts that have a maturity of one year or less, including trade receivables.\n\nWhen determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and when estimating the expected credit loss, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's historical experience and informed credit assessment, including forward-looking information. Such forward-looking information takes into consideration the forecast economic conditions expected to impact the outstanding balances at the balance sheet date. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as the customer having filed for liquidation.\n\n## h Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nIn 2020 the Group adopted the amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 relating to the interest rate benchmark reform Phase 1, ('Phase 1') and in 2021 the Group has adopted the amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 relating to the interest rate benchmark reform Phase 2, ('Phase 2').\n\nThe Phase 1 amendments provide temporary relief from applying certain hedge accounting requirements to hedging relationships directly affected by IBOR reform. The reliefs have the effect that IBOR reform does not cause hedge accounting to terminate prior to contracts being amended. Where transition to an alternative benchmark rate has taken place, the Group ceases to apply the Phase 1 amendments and instead applies the Phase 2 amendments.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nWhere the Group continues to apply the Phase 1 amendments, the following reliefs are applied:\n\n- \u00b7 when considering the highly probable requirement, the Group has assumed that those benchmark rates that need to be transitioned to an alternative benchmark rate, on which the Group's hedged long-term borrowings are based, do not change as a result of IBOR reform;\n- \u00b7 in assessing whether the hedge is expected to be highly effective on a forward-looking basis the Group has assumed that those benchmark rates that need to be transitioned to an alternative benchmark rate, on which the cash flows of the hedged long-term borrowings and the interest rate swaps that hedge them are based, are not altered by IBOR reform; and\n- \u00b7 the Group has not recycled the cash flow hedge reserve relating to the period after the IBOR reform is expected to take effect.",

Such amendments do not give rise to the hedge relationship being discontinued.\n\nWhen the Group transitions to an alternative benchmark rate, the accumulated amounts within the cash flow hedge reserve are determined to be based on the alternative benchmark rate and no reclassification adjustments are made from the cash flow hedge reserve to the Income statement.\n\n## Long-term borrowings and lease liabilities\n\nPhase 2 of the amendments requires that, for financial instruments measured using amortised cost measurement, changes to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows required by interest rate benchmark reform are reflected by adjusting their effective interest rate prospectively. No gain or loss is recognised upon transition to the new benchmark. The expedient is only applicable to direct changes that are required by interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nFor lease liabilities where there is a change to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows, as a practical expedient the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a discount rate that reflects the change in the interest rate where the change is required by IBOR reform.\n\nFurther information on the management of and uncertainty arising from interest rate reform is given in note 27i. No amounts have been recorded in the current or prior periods as a result of these amendments.\n\n## Employee benefit plans\n\n## a Pension obligations\n\nThe Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior years.\n\nTypically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.\n\nThe Group's net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years. The benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA-rated corporate bonds of the appropriate currency that have durations approximating those of the Group's obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the net obligation calculation results in an asset for the Group, the recognition of an asset is limited to the present value of any future refunds, net of the relevant taxes, from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan ('the asset ceiling'). The fair value of the plan assets is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price. The fair value of insurance policies which exactly match the amount and timing of some or all benefits payable under the scheme are deemed to be the present value of the related obligations. Longevity swaps are measured at their fair value.\n\nCurrent service costs are recognised within employee costs in the year in which they arise. Past service costs are recognised in the event of a plan amendment or curtailment, or when the Group recognises related restructuring costs or severance obligations. The net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability or asset during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest and other expenses related to the defined benefit plans are recognised in the Income statement. Remeasurements, comprising IAS 19 gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (excluding interest) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), are recognised immediately in Other comprehensive income. Remeasurements are not reclassified to the Income statement in subsequent periods.\n\n## b Severance obligations\n\nSeverance obligations are recognised when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises a provision for severance payments when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without realistic possibility of withdrawal, or providing severance payments as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.\n\nOther employee benefits are recognised when there is deemed to be a present obligation.\n\n## Taxation\n\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:\n\n- \u00b7 Where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries or associates, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nIncome tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity. Otherwise income tax is recognised in the Income statement.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Such cost is determined by the weighted average cost method. Inventories include mainly aircraft spare parts, repairable aircraft engine parts and fuel.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits with any qualifying financial institution repayable on demand or maturing within three months of the date of acquisition and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based payment plans, under which the Group awards equity instruments of the Group for services rendered by employees. The fair value of the share-based payment plans is measured at the date of grant using a valuation model provided by external specialists. The resulting cost, as adjusted for the expected and actual level of vesting of the plan, is charged to the Income statement over the period in which the options vest. At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and management's best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, and accordingly the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The movement in the cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the Income statement with a corresponding entry in equity.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are made when an obligation exists for a present liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated and where it is considered probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation. Where it is not considered probable that there will be an outflow of economic resources required to settle the obligation, the Group does not recognise a provision, but discloses the matter as a contingent liability. The Group assesses whether each matter is probable of there being an outflow of economic resources to settle the obligation at each reporting date.\n\nEmployee leaving indemnities and other employee provisions are recorded for flight crew who, meeting certain conditions, have the option of being placed on reserve or of taking early retirement. The Group is obligated to remunerate these employees until they reach the statutory retirement age. The calculation is performed by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.\n\nOther employee-related provisions are recognised for direct expenditures of business reorganisation such as severance payments (restructuring provisions) where plans are sufficiently detailed and well advanced, and where appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date.\n\nRestoration and handback provisions arising on inception of a lease are recognised as a provision with a corresponding amount recognised as part of the ROU asset. Any subsequent change in estimation relating to such costs are reflected in the ROU asset. Maintenance and handback provisions that occur through usage or through the passage of time are recognised as such activity occurs, with a corresponding expense recorded in the Income statement. Any subsequent change in estimation are recognised in the Income statement.\n\nThe method for determining legal claims provisions is determined on a claim-by-claim basis. Where a claim includes a significant population of items, the weighted average provision is estimated by determining all potential outcomes and the probability of their occurrence. Where a claim relates to a single item, then the Group determines the associated provision by applying the most likely outcome giving consideration to alternative outcomes. Where an individual claim is significant, the disclosure of quantitative information is restricted to the extent that it does not prejudice the outcome of the claim. If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the provision. Where discounting is used, the effect of unwinding the discount rate is recognised as a finance cost in the Income statement.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\n## Passenger revenue\n\nThe Group's revenue primarily derives from transportation services for both passengers and cargo. Revenue is recognised when the transportation service has been provided.\n\nPassenger tickets are generally paid for in advance of transportation and are recognised, net of discounts, as Deferred revenue on ticket sales in current liabilities until either the customer has flown or, for flexible tickets, when unused ticket revenue is recognised or the ticket expires unused.\n\nAt the time of expected travel, revenue is recognised in relation to flexible tickets where a customer can reschedule the date of intended travel, that are not expected to be used, a term referred to as 'unused tickets'. This revenue is recognised based on the terms and conditions of the ticket and analysis of historical experience. For these unused flexible tickets, revenue is recognised only when the risk of a significant reversal of revenue is remote based on the terms and conditions of the ticket and analysis of historical experience. The estimation regarding historical experience is updated at each reporting date.",

Where compensation is issued to the customer, such payments are presented net within Passenger revenue against the original ticket purchased. Where the Group provides a refund to a customer, Deferred revenue on ticket sales is reduced and no amount is recorded within revenue. Where a voucher is issued it is retained within Deferred revenue on ticket sales until such time as it is redeemed for a flight or it expires, at which time it is recorded within Passenger revenue. The Group also recognises revenue by estimating the amount of vouchers that are not expected to be redeemed prior to expiry using analysis of historical experience. The estimation regarding historical experience is updated at each reporting date. The amount of such revenue recognised is constrained, where necessary, such that the risk of a significant reversal of revenue in the future is remote.\n\nPayments received in relation to certain ancillary services regarding passenger transportation, such as change fees, are not considered to be distinct from the performance obligation to provide the passenger flight. Payments relating to these ancillary services are recognised in Deferred revenue on ticket sales in current liabilities until the customer has flown.\n\nThe Group considers whether it is an agent or a principal in relation to passenger transportation services by considering whether it has a performance obligation to provide services to the customer or whether the obligation is to arrange for the services to be provided by a third party. The Group acts as an agent where (i) it collects various taxes, duties and fees assessed on the sale of tickets to passengers and remits these to the relevant taxing authorities; and (ii) where it provides interline services to airline partners outside of the Group. Commissions earned in relation to agency services are recognised as revenue when the underlying goods or services have been transferred to the customer. In all other instances, the Group considers it acts as the principal in relation to passenger transportation services.\n\n## Cargo revenue\n\nThe Group has identified a single performance obligation in relation to cargo services and the associated revenue is measured at its standalone selling price and recognised on satisfaction of the performance obligation, which occurs on the fulfilment of the transportation service.\n\n## Other revenue\n\nThe Group has identified several performance obligations in relation to services that give rise to revenue being recognised within Other revenue. These services, their performance obligations and associated revenue recognition include:\n\n- \u00b7 the provision of maintenance services and overhaul services for engines and airframes, where the Group is engaged to enhance an asset while the customer retains control of the asset. Accordingly, the performance obligations are satisfied, and revenue recognised, over time. The Group estimates the proportion of the contract completed at the reporting date and recognises revenue based on the percentage of completion of the contract;\n- \u00b7 the provision of ground handling services, where the performance obligations are fulfilled when the services are provided, which occurs upon the provision of the service; and\n- \u00b7 the provision of holiday and hotel services, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time as the customer receives the benefit of the service.\n\n## Customer loyalty programmes\n\nThe Group operates four loyalty programmes: the British Airways Executive Club, Iberia Plus, Vueling Club and the Aer Lingus Aer Club. The customer loyalty programmes award travellers Avios to redeem for various rewards, primarily redemption travel, including flights, hotels and car hire. Avios are also sold to commercial partners to use in loyalty activity.\n\n## Avios issuance\n\nWhen issued, the standalone selling price of an Avios is recorded within Deferred revenue on ticket sales in current liabilities until the customer redeems the Avios. The standalone selling price of Avios is based on the value of the awards for which the points could be redeemed. The Group also recognises revenue associated with the proportion of Avios which are not expected to be redeemed, referred to as 'breakage', based on the results of modelling using historical experiences up until the reporting date. The amount of such revenue recognised is limited, where necessary, such that the risk of a significant reversal of revenue in the future is remote.\n\nWhere the issuance of Avios arises from travel on the Group's airlines, the consideration received from the customer may differ to the aggregation of the relative standalone selling prices. In such instances the allocation of the consideration to each performance obligation is undertaken using a proportional basis using the relative standalone selling prices.\n\nThe Group has contractual arrangements with non-Group airlines and non-air partners for the issuance and redemption of Avios, for which it has identified the following performance obligations:\n\n## Brand and marketing activities\n\nFor both air and non-air partners, the Group licenses the Avios and the airline brands for certain activities, such as the creation of cobranded credit cards. In addition, the Group has certain contractual arrangements whereby it commits to provide marketing services to the members of the loyalty schemes on behalf of those partners. For both the provision of brand and marketing services, the partner receives benefits incremental to the issuance of Avios. The Group estimates the standalone selling price of the brand and marketing performance obligations, using valuation techniques, by reference to the amount that a third party would be prepared to pay in an arm's length transaction for access to comparable brands for the period over which they use the brand. For brand services, as the Group considers that the partner has the right to use the brand, revenue is recognised as the brand service is provided and not over time. For marketing performance obligations, revenue is recognised as the marketing activities occur based on when the partner receives the benefit of those services.\n\n## Upfront payments\n\nWhere a partner makes an upfront payment to the Group which does not relate to any specific performance obligation, then the Group considers such payments as advance payments for future goods and services and the associated revenue is recognised as those goods and services are provided, as detailed above. In such instances the payment is allocated across all of the performance obligations over the contract term. The Group estimates the expected level of Avios to be issued over the contract term using experience, historical and expected future trends, and allocates the payments to the relevant performance obligations accordingly. At each reporting date, the Group",

        "page_content": "updates its estimate of the number of Avios expected to be issued over the total contract term and recognises a cumulative catch-up adjustment where necessary.\n\nWhen a partner makes an upfront payment to the Group, the Group assesses whether such a payment is representative of a significant financing event. Where a significant financing component is identified, the Group estimates a market rate of interest that an arm's length financial liability of similar size and tenor would yield. The Group recognises the imputed interest as a Finance expense in the Income statement.\n\n## Other considerations\n\nThe Group considers whether it is an agent or a principal in relation to the loyalty services by considering whether it has a performance obligation to provide services to the customer or whether the obligation is to arrange for the services to be provided by a third party. In particular, the Group acts as an agent where customers redeem their Avios on interline partner flights outside of the Group, where the fees payable to interline partner are presented net against the associated release of the Deferred revenue from ticket sales.\n\n## Exceptional items\n\nExceptional items are those that in management's view need to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or nature and where such presentation is relevant to an understanding of the Group's financial performance. While management has a defined list of items and a quantitative threshold that would merit categorisation as exceptional that has been established through historical experience, the Group retains the flexibility to add additional items should their size or nature merit such presentation. The classification of an item as exceptional is approved by the Board, through the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nThe financial performance of the Group is monitored by the Management Committee and the Board on a pre-exceptional basis to enable comparison to prior reporting periods as well as to other selected companies, but also for making strategic, financial and operational decisions.\n\nThe exceptional items recorded in the Income statement include, but are not limited to, items such as significant settlement agreements with the Group's pension schemes; significant restructuring; the impact of business combination transactions that do not contribute to the ongoing results of the Group; significant discontinuance of hedge accounting; legal settlements; individual significant tax transactions; and the impact of the sale, disposal or impairment of an asset or investment in a business. Where exceptional items are separately disclosed, the resultant tax impact is additionally separately disclosed. While certain exceptional items may cover more than a single reporting period, such as significant restructuring events, they are non-recurring in nature.\n\nFurther information is given in the Alternative performance measures section.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received. Loans provided and/or guaranteed by governments that represent market rates of interest are recorded at the amount of the proceeds received and recognised within Borrowings. Those loans provided and/or guaranteed by governments that represent below-market rates of interest are measured at inception at their fair value and recognised within Borrowings, with the differential to the proceeds received recorded within Deferred income and released to the relevant financial statement caption in the Income statement on a systematic basis. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in the Income statement in the relevant financial statement caption on a systematic basis in the periods in which the expenses are recognised.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. These judgements, estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results in the future may differ from judgements and estimates upon which financial information has been prepared. These underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised prospectively.\n\n## Estimates\n\nThe estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows:\n\n## a Employee benefit obligations, employee leaving indemnities, other employee-related restructuring\n\nAt December 31, 2021 the Group recognised \u20ac1,775 million in respect of employee benefit assets (2020 restated: \u20ac334 million) and \u20ac285 million in respect of employee benefit obligations (2020 restated: \u20ac477 million). Further information on employee benefit obligations is disclosed in note 32.\n\nThe cost of employee benefit obligations, employee leaving indemnities and other employee-related provisions is determined using the valuation requirements of IAS 19. These valuations involve making assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these schemes, such assumptions are subject to significant uncertainty. The assumptions relating to these schemes are disclosed in note 32. The Group determines the assumptions to be adopted in discussion with qualified actuaries. Any difference between these assumptions and the actual outcome will impact future net assets and total comprehensive income. The sensitivity to changes in pension assumptions is disclosed in note 32.\n\nUnder the Group's APS and NAPS defined benefit schemes, increases to pensions are based on the annual Government Pension Increase (Review) Orders, which since 2011 have been based on the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). Additionally, in APS there is provision for the Trustee to pay increases up to the level of the Retail Prices Index (RPI), subject to certain affordability tests. Historically market expectations for RPI could be derived by comparing the prices of UK Government fixed-interest and index-linked gilts, with CPI assessed by considering the Bank of England's inflation target and comparison of the construction of the two inflation indices.",

        "page_content": "Financial Statements\n\n## NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED\n\nFor the year to December 31, 2021\n\n## 2   Significant accounting policies continued\n\nIn February 2019, following the UK House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee report on measuring inflation, the National Statistician concluded that the existing methodology was unsatisfactory and proposed a number of options to the UK Statistics Authority (UKSA). In March 2019, the UKSA recommended to the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer that the publication of the RPI cease at a point to be determined in the future and in the intervening period, the RPI be addressed by bringing in the methods of the CPIH (a proposed variant to CPI). In September 2019, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer announced his intention to consult with the Bank of England and the UKSA on whether to implement these proposed changes to RPI in the period of 2025 to 2030. Following consultation during 2020, on November 25, 2020 the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer and the UKSA confirmed that from February 2030 onwards CPIH will replace RPI with no compensation to holders of index-linked gilts.\n\nFollowing the Chancellor of the Exchequer's announcement in September 2019 and through to December 31, 2021, market-implied breakeven RPI inflation forward rates for periods after 2030 have reduced in the investment market. Therefore, in assessing RPI and CPI from investment market data, allowance has been made for partial alignment between RPI and CPI from 2030 onwards.\n\n## b Revenue recognition\n\nAt December 31, 2021 the Group recognised \u20ac6,552 million (2020: \u20ac5,130 million) in respect of deferred revenue on ticket sales of which \u20ac2,820 million (2020: \u20ac2,725 million) related to customer loyalty programmes.\n\nPassenger revenue is recognised when the transportation service is provided. At the time of transportation, revenue is also recognised in respect of unused tickets and is estimated based on the terms and conditions of the tickets and historical experience. The Group considers that there is no reasonably possible change to unused ticket assumptions that would have a material impact on Passenger revenue recorded in the year.\n\nRevenue associated with the issuance of Avios under customer loyalty programmes is based on the relative standalone selling prices of the related performance obligations (brand, marketing and Avios), determined using estimation techniques. The transaction price of brand and marketing services is determined using specific brand valuation methodologies. The transaction price of the points is based on the value of the Avios for which the points can be redeemed and is reduced to take account of the proportion of Avios that are not expected to be redeemed by customers.\n\nThe Group estimates the number of Avios not expected to be redeemed using modelling and historical experience. A five percentage point increase in the assumption of Avios outstanding and not expected to be redeemed would result in an adjustment to Deferred revenue from ticket sales of \u20ac100 million, with an offsetting adjustment to increase revenue and operating profit recognised in the year.\n\n## c Income taxes\n\nAt December 31, 2021 the Group recognised \u20ac1,282 million in respect of deferred tax assets (2020: \u20ac1,075 million). Further information on current and deferred tax is disclosed in note 10.\n\nThe Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Estimates are required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it may be unclear how tax law applies to a particular transaction or circumstance. Where the Group determines that it is more likely than not that the tax authorities would accept the position taken in the tax return, amounts are recognised in the financial statements on that basis. Where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is uncertain, the Group recognises a liability based on either: the Group's judgement of the most likely outcome; or, when there is a wide range of possible outcomes, a probability-weighted average approach.\n\nThe Group recognises deferred income tax assets only to the extent that it is probable that the taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised. Management uses judgement, including the consideration of past and current operating performance and the future projections of performance laid out in the approved business plan in order to assess the probability of recoverability.\n\nIn exercising this judgement, while there are no time restrictions on the utilisation of historic tax losses in the principal jurisdictions in which the Group operates, future cash flow projections are forecast for a period of up to ten years from the balance sheet date, which represents the period over which it is probable that future taxable profits will be available.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Group had unrecognised deferred tax assets of \u20ac2,458 million relating to tax losses the Group does not reasonably expect to utilise. In applying the aforementioned judgement, had the Group extended the period of future cash flow projections indefinitely, then the amount of unrecognised deferred tax assets would have reduced by \u20ac2,068 million.\n\n## d Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAt December 31, 2021 the Group recognised \u20ac2,439 million (2020: \u20ac2,390 million) in respect of intangible assets with an indefinite life, including goodwill. Further information on these assets is included in note 17.\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets with indefinite economic lives are tested, as part of the cash generating units to which they relate, for impairment annually and at other times when such indicators exist. The recoverable amounts of cash generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations, which use a weighted average multi-scenario discounted cash flow model, which are then compared to the carrying amount of the associated cash generating unit.\n\nIn determining the carrying value of each cash generating unit, the Group allocates all associated operating tangible and intangible assets, including ROU assets. In addition the Group has allocated certain liabilities to the carrying value of each CGU where those liabilities are critical to the underlying operations of the cash generating unit and in the event of a disposal of the cash generating unit would be required to be transferred to the purchaser. Such liabilities include lease liabilities.\n\nThe Group has applied judgement in the weighting of each scenario in the discounted cash flow model and these calculations require the use of estimates in the determination of key assumptions and sensitivities as disclosed in note 17.\n\nThe Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-financial assets at each reporting date. When such indicators are identified, then non-financial assets are tested for impairment.",

        "page_content": "## e Engineering and other aircraft costs\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Group recognised \u20ac1,832 million in respect of maintenance, restoration and handback provisions (2020: \u20ac1,588 million). Information on movements on the provision is disclosed in note 26.\n\nThe Group has a number of contracts with service providers to replace or repair engine parts and for other maintenance checks. These agreements are complex and generally cover a number of years. Provisions for maintenance, restoration and handback are made based on the best estimate of the likely committed cash outflow. In determining this best estimate, the Group applies significant judgement as to the level of forecast costs expected to be incurred when the aircraft is returned to the lessor. The assumptions of this significant judgement include aircraft utilisation, expected maintenance intervals, future maintenance costs and the aircraft's condition. The associated forecast costs are discounted to their present value, the effect of which is not considered to be material. The Group considers that there is no reasonably possible change to a single assumption that would have a material impact on the provisions, however a combination of changes in multiple assumptions may.\n\n## Judgements\n\n## a Determining the lease term of contracts with renewal and termination options\n\nThe Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. Such judgement includes consideration of fleet plans which underpin approved business plans and historical experience regarding the extension of leases. After the commencement date, the Group re-assesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that affects the Group's ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate. Further information is given in note 14.\n\n## New standards, amendments and interpretations\n\nThe following amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2021, but do not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 COVID-19 related rent concessions beyond June 30, 2021 - Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases; and\n- \u00b7 Interest rate benchmark reform - Phase 2 - amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021.\n\nThe IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards, amendments and interpretations with an effective date after the year end of these financial statements which management believe could impact the Group in future periods. The Group has assessed of the impact of these standards, amendments and interpretations and it is not expected that these will have a material effect on the reported income or net assets of the Group. Unless otherwise stated, the Group plans to adopt the following standards, interpretations and amendments on the date they become mandatory:\n\n- \u00b7 Property, plant and equipment: proceeds before intended use - amendments to IAS 16 effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022;\n- \u00b7 Reference to the Conceptual Framework - amendments to IFRS 3 effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022;\n- \u00b7 Onerous contracts - cost of fulfilling a contract - amendments to IAS 37 effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022;\n- \u00b7 Annual improvements to IFRS standards 2018-2020 - effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022;\n- \u00b7 Classification of liabilities as current or non-current - amendments to IAS 1 effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023;\n- \u00b7 Definition of accounting estimate - amendments to IAS 8 effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023;\n- \u00b7 Disclosure of accounting policies - Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice statement 2 effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023; and\n- \u00b7 Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction - Amendments to IAS 12 effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023.\n\n## 3  Impact of COVID-19 on financial reporting\n\n## Significant transactions and accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements in the determination of the impact of COVID-19\n\nAs a result of COVID-19 the Group has experienced a significant decline in the level of flight activity and does not expect to return to the level of 2019 activity until at least 2023. Accordingly, the Group has applied estimation and judgement in the evaluation of the impact of COVID-19 regarding the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities within the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements - cash flow forecast estimation\n\nThe Group has applied estimation and judgement in the evaluation of the impact of COVID-19 on the estimation uncertainty of determining cash flow forecasts as part of the approved business plans. The details regarding the inputs and assumptions used in the determination of these cash flow forecasts are given in the going concern basis of preparation.\n\nThe following critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements utilise these cash flow forecasts consistently, which are in some instances significantly different from judgements applied in periods prior to the COVID-19 pandemic:",

The Group applied the capacity output from the cash flow forecasts as part of the approved business plans in order to determine the forecast level of revenue generation and fuel consumption over the periods in which hedge accounting has been applied.\n\nIn the year to December 31, 2021, the Group recognised a credit of \u20ac159 million (2020: expense of \u20ac1,756 million) arising from a combination of the discontinuance of hedge accounting in the year to December 31, 2021 and the fair value movement on those relationships where hedge accounting was discontinued in the year to December 31, 2020, but for which the underlying hedging instrument had not matured at January 1, 2021. This was represented by a credit of \u20ac162 million (2020: expense of \u20ac1,781 million) relating to fuel derivatives and an expense of \u20ac8 million (2020: credit of \u20ac87 million) related to the associated fuel foreign currency derivatives. The credit to Passenger revenue of \u20ac5 million (2020: charge of \u20ac62 million) relates to the discontinuation of hedge accounting of the associated foreign currency derivatives on forecast revenue.\n\nThe Group's risk management strategy has been to build up these hedges gradually over a three-year period when the level of forecast passenger revenue and fuel consumption were higher than current expectations. Accordingly, the hedge accounting for these transactions has been discontinued and the credit recognised in the Income statement. The credit relating to revenue derivatives and fuel derivatives has been recorded in the Income statement within Passenger revenue and Fuel, oil and emission charges, respectively.\n\nFurther information is given in the Alternative performance measures section.\n\n## b Long-term fleet plans and associated impairment\n\nThe Group derives long-term fleet plans from the cash flow forecasts arising from the approved business plans. In deriving the long-term fleet plans, the Group applies judgement with respect to consideration of the period of temporary and permanent grounding of fleet assets, the deferral of the delivery of certain aircraft and the assumptions around specific provisions relating to leased fleet assets.\n\nDuring the year to December 31, 2021, the Group recognised impairment reversals of \u20ac21 million, represented by an amount of \u20ac14 million relating to the reversal of aircraft impairment and an amount of \u20ac7 million relating to the reversal of engine impairment. The aircraft impairment reversal relates to four Airbus A320 aircraft in Vueling, previously permanently stood down in the fourth quarter of 2020, being stood up in the third quarter of 2021 following the successful slot allocation at Paris Orly and the resultant increased capacity. The engine impairment reversal relates to certain engines which had been fully impaired during 2020 having been leased to a third party in the fourth quarter of 2021. Of the impairment reversal, \u20ac9 million was recorded within Property, plant and equipment relating to owned aircraft and \u20ac12 million was recorded within Right of use assets relating to leased aircraft.\n\nIn the year to December 31, 2020 the Group recognised an impairment charge of \u20ac856 million, represented by an impairment of fleet assets of \u20ac837 million and an impairment of other assets of \u20ac19 million. The fleet impairment related to 82 aircraft, their associated engines and rotable inventories that were stood down permanently and 2 further aircraft which were impaired down to their recoverable value at December 31, 2020, which includes 32 Boeing 747 aircraft, 23 Airbus A320 aircraft, 15 Airbus A340 aircraft, 4 Airbus A330-200 aircraft, 2 Airbus A318 aircraft, 1 Airbus A321 aircraft, 1 Airbus A319 aircraft, 2 Boeing 777-200 aircraft and 4 Embraer E170 aircraft. Of the fleet impairment, \u20ac676 million was recorded within Property, plant and equipment relating to owned aircraft and \u20ac161 million was recorded within Right of use assets relating to leased aircraft.\n\nFurther information is given in the Alternative performance measures section, note 13 and note 14.\n\n## c Impairment testing of the Group's cash generating units\n\nDue to the estimation uncertainty of the timing and duration of the recovery from COVID-19, the Group has adopted a weighted average multi-scenario discounted cash flow model derived from the cash flow forecasts from the approved business plans. The Group exercises judgement in determining the weighting between these scenarios in the value-in-use model.\n\nHaving undertaken this impairment testing, in the year to December 31, 2021, the Group has not recognised any impairment charge (2020: \u20acnil). While no impairment charge is arising, the headroom in the impairment test of the British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus cash generating units are particularly sensitive to changes in key assumptions. Further information is given in note 17.\n\n## d Recoverability of deferred tax assets\n\nIn determining the recoverable amounts of the Group's deferred tax assets, the Group applied the future cash flow projections from the approved business plans. Given the estimation uncertainty of the timing and duration of the recovery from COVID-19, the Group exercises judgement in the determination of cash flows during this recovery and subsequent periods.\n\nIn exercising this judgement, while there are no time restrictions on the utilisation of historic tax losses in the principal jurisdictions in which the Group operates, future cash flow projections are forecast for a period of up to ten years from the balance sheet date.",

        "page_content": "## Accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements - other transactions\n\nIn addition to the estimation uncertainty relating to cash flow forecasts, the Group has applied the following accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements that impact the consolidated financial statements:\n\n## e Revenue recognition\n\nHistorically, where a voucher has been issued to a customer in the event of a flight cancellation, the Group estimated, based on historical experience, the level of such vouchers not expected to be used prior to expiry and recognised revenue accordingly. Due to the significant level of flight cancellations arising from COVID-19 there remains insufficient historical data by which to reliably estimate the amount of these vouchers that will not be used prior to expiry and accordingly, the Group is unable to estimate with a sufficiently high degree of probability that there will not be a significant reversal of revenue in the future. As such, consistent with the approach taken at December 31, 2020, the Group does not recognise revenue arising from those vouchers issued due to COVID-19 related cancellations until either the voucher is redeemed or it expires.\n\nRevenue associated with the issuance of Avios under customer loyalty programmes is determined using estimation techniques, with the transaction price based on the value for which the Avios can be redeemed and is reduced taking into consideration breakage. The Group estimates breakage using modelling and historical experience. Due to the significant restrictions imposed on the ability of customers to redeem Avios coupled with the disruption in the patterns of redemption caused by COVID-19, the Group considers that the trends experienced since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic are not reflective of the long-term expected patterns of redemption, which the Group considers will return to pre-COVID-19 levels in the future. Accordingly, consistent with the approach taken at December 31, 2020, the Group has maintained breakage at the pre-COVID-19 levels.\n\n## Significant transactions as a result of COVID-19\n\nThe Group has recorded the following additional significant transactions as a result of management actions in response to COVID-19:\n\n## f Loans and borrowings\n\nTo enhance liquidity due to the impact of COVID-19, the Group has entered into a number of financing arrangements during 2021, which have been fully drawn unless otherwise stated, including:\n\n- \u00b7 On February 22, 2021, British Airways entered into a 5-year term loan Export Development Guarantee Facility of \u20ac2.3 billion (\u00a32.0 billion) underwritten by a syndicate of banks, with 80 per cent of the principal guaranteed by UKEF. On November 1, 2021, British Airways entered into a further 5-year Export Development Guarantee Facility credit facility of \u20ac1.2 billion (\u00a31.0 billion) underwritten by a syndicate of banks, with 80 per cent of the principal guaranteed by UKEF. At December 31, 2021 no amounts had been drawn under the facility;\n- \u00b7 On March 23, 2021, the Group entered into a three-year US dollar secured Revolving Credit Facility accessible by British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus. The amount available under the facility is $1.755 billion. As at December 31, 2021 no amounts had been drawn under the facility. Concurrent to entering into the facility, British Airways extinguished its US dollar secured Revolving Credit Facility due to mature in June 2021;\n- \u00b7 On March 25, 2021, two senior unsecured bonds were issued by the Group for an aggregate principal amount of \u20ac1.2 billion; \u20ac500 million fixed rate 2.75 per cent due in 2025, and \u20ac700 million fixed rate 3.75 per cent due in 2029;\n- \u00b7 On December 23, 2020, Aer Lingus entered into a financing arrangement with the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund for \u20ac75 million. On March 27, 2021, Aer Lingus entered into a further financing arrangement to extend the total amount to \u20ac150 million. The facility is repayable in 2023;\n- \u00b7 On May 18, 2021, the Group issued an \u20ac825 million senior unsecured convertible bond due 2028 and bearing a fixed rate of 1.125 per cent; and\n- \u00b7 In April 2021, British Airways fully repaid the Coronavirus Corporate Finance Facility of \u20ac350 million (\u00a3300 million), which was entered into in April 2020.\n\nFurther information is given in note 25.\n\n## g Government assistance\n\nGiven the significant reduction in operations that have occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group has availed itself of the various employee support mechanisms in the jurisdictions in which it operates. This has led to an amount of \u20ac424 million being received directly from governments (classified as government grants) and savings of \u20ac135 million (classified as government assistance) where employees have been paid directly by their respective governments. Those amounts received in the form of government assistance have been recorded net within Employee costs. Further information is given in note 34.\n\n## h Defined benefit pension scheme contributions\n\nOn December 18, 2020 British Airways reached agreement with the Trustee of NAPS to defer deficit contributions on an interim basis for the period between October 1, 2020 and January 31, 2021. The deferral of such contributions amounted to \u20ac165 million. On February 19, 2021 British Airways reached further agreement with the Trustee of NAPS to defer deficit contributions through to September 30, 2021. The deferral of such contributions amounted to \u20ac330 million. Further information is given in note 32 on the deferral of contributions.\n\n## i Renegotiation of Air Europa acquisition and subsequent termination\n\nOn November 4, 2019, the Group entered into an agreement to acquire the entire share capital of Air Europa for \u20ac1 billion, subject to receipt of the approval by the European Commission. As a result of the impact COVID-19 has had on both the Group and Air Europa during 2020, on January 19, 2021, the Group announced the execution of an amended agreement to acquire the entire share capital of Air Europa, which resulted in the reduction of the purchase price to \u20ac500 million and deferred this payment until the sixth anniversary of the date of completion of the acquisition conditional on the satisfactory negotiation between Iberia and Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales or 'SEPI' (the Spanish state holding company that has a direct participation in Air Europa) regarding the non-financial terms associated with the financial support provided by SEPI to Air Europa.\n\nOn December 16, 2021, the Group announced that Iberia and Globalia had terminated the agreement regarding the acquisition of the share capital of Air Europa, with the Group paying \u20ac75 million. This payment is recorded in Other non-operating charges in the Income statement and was settled prior to December 31, 2021 and recorded within Other investing movements within the Statement of cash flows.\n\nFurther information is given in the Alternative performance measures section.",

While approved business plans currently have a duration of three years, the Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy impacts both the short, medium and long-term operations of the Group.\n\nThe details regarding the inputs and assumptions used in the determination of the Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy include, but are not limited to, the following that are within the control of the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 The additional cost of the Group's commitment to increasing the level of Sustainable Aviation Fuels to ten per cent by 2030 and to fifty per cent by 2050;\n- \u00b7 The cost of incurring an increase in the level of carbon offsetting and carbon capture schemes; and\n- \u00b7 The impact of introducing more fuel-efficient aircraft and being able to operate these more efficiently.\n\nIn addition to these inputs and measures within the control of management, Flightpath Net Zero includes assumptions pertaining to consumers, governments and regulators regarding the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The impact on passenger demand for air travel as a result of both passenger trends regarding climate change and government policies;\n- \u00b7 Investment and policy regarding the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel production facilities;\n- \u00b7 Investment and improvements in air traffic management;\n- \u00b7 The price of carbon through the EU and UK Emissions Trading Schemes (ETS) and the UN Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA); and\n- \u00b7 Effective market-based policy measures in addition to the EU and UK ETS and CORSIA.\n\nThe level of uncertainty regarding the impact of these factors increases over time. Accordingly, the Group has applied critical estimation and judgement in the evaluation of the impact of climate change regarding the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities within the financial statements.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements - cash flow forecast estimation\n\nWith the Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy assessing the impact over a long-term horizon to 2050, the level of estimation uncertainty in the determination of cash flow forecasts increases over time. For those assets and liabilities, where their recoverability is dependent on long-term cash flows, the following critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements, to the extent they can be reliably measured, have been applied:\n\n## a Long-term fleet plans and useful economic lives\n\nThe Group's Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy has been developed in conjunction with the long-term fleet plans of each operating company. This includes the annual assessment of useful lives and the residual values of each aircraft type.\n\nDuring the course of 2020 as a result of the impact of COVID-19, the Group permanently stood down 82 aircraft, their associated engines and rotable inventories. These permanently stood-down aircraft were older-generation aircraft, that were less fuel efficient, more carbon intensive and more expensive to operate than more modern models.\n\nWith the permanent standing down of these aircraft, coupled with the future delivery of 110 fuel-efficient aircraft as detailed in note 15, the Group considers the existing fleet assets align with the long-term fleet plans to achieve its Flightpath Net Zero strategy. All aircraft in the fleet, and those due to be delivered in the future, have the capability to utilise SAF in their operations without impediment. Accordingly, no impairment has arisen in the current or prior year as a result of the Group's decarbonisation plans.\n\n## b Impairment testing of the Group's cash generating units\n\nThe Group applies discounted cash flow models, for each cash generating unit, derived from the cash flow forecasts from the approved three-year business plans. The Group's Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy is long-term in nature and includes commitments that will occur at differing points over this time horizon. To the extent that certain of those commitments occur over the short-term, then they have been incorporated into the three-year business plans.\n\nThe Group adjusts the final year of the three-year business plan to incorporate the impacts of climate change that the Group can reliably estimate at the reporting date. However, given the long-term nature of the Group's sustainability commitments, there are other aspects of these commitments that cannot be reliably estimated at the reporting date and have been excluded from these adjustments. These adjustments incorporate the increased utilisation of sustainable aviation fuel as well as price assumptions relating to sustainable aviation fuels and the price of carbon (both ETS and CORSIA), which are derived from externally sourced prices. Where the Group considers such costs will be recovered through increased passenger ticket fares, then a corresponding adjustment is made to increase passenger revenue.\n\nAs detailed in note 17, the Group applies a long-term growth rate to this adjusted three-year business plan, per CGU, and each of the longterm growth rates include a specific adjustment to reduce the rate to reflect the Group's assumptions regarding the reduced demand impact arising from climate change. This demand impact is derived with reference to external market data.\n\nFurther, in preparing the impairment models, the Group cash flow projections are prepared on the basis of using the current fleet in its current condition. The Group excludes the estimated cash flows expected to arise from future restructuring, assets not currently in use by the Group and expected technological advancements in aircraft and other technologies not available at the reporting date. The Group excludes potential future legislation/regulation regarding carbon pricing and/or alternative schemes not currently enacted, such as the implementation of kerosene taxes.\n\nGiven the inherent uncertainty associated with the impact of climate change, the Group has applied additional sensitivities in note 17 to reflect a more adverse impact of climate change than currently expected. This has been captured through both the downward sensitivities of the long-term growth rates, ASKs, operating margins and the increased fuel price sensitivity.",

        "page_content": "## c Valuation of employee benefit scheme assets\n\nThe Group's employee benefit schemes are principally represented by the British Airways APS and NAPS schemes in the UK. The schemes are structured to make post-employment payments to members over the long term, with the Trustees having established both returnseeking assets and liability-matching assets that mature over the long-term to align with the forecast benefit payments.\n\nThe assets of these schemes are invested predominantly in a diversified range of equities, bonds and property. The valuation of these assets ranges from those with quoted prices in active markets, where prices are readily and regularly available, through to those where the valuations are not based on observable market data, often requiring complex valuation models. The trustees of the schemes have integrated climate change considerations into their long-term decision-making and reporting processes across all classes of assets, actively engaging with all fund and portfolio managers to ensure that where unobservable inputs are required into valuation models, that such valuation models incorporate long-term expectations regarding the impact of climate change.\n\n## d Recoverability of deferred tax assets\n\nIn determining the recoverable amounts of the Group's deferred tax assets, the Group applies the future cash flow projections for a period of up to ten years derived from the approved three-year business plans. The Group applies a medium-term growth rate subsequent to the three-year business plans, specific to each operating company. In considering the impact of the Group's Flightpath Net Zero climate strategy, management adjusts this medium-term growth rate, where applicable, to incorporate the impacts on both revenue and costs to the Group.\n\n## 5  Segment information\n\n## a Business segments\n\nThe chief operating decision-maker is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, and has been identified as the IAG Management Committee (IAG MC).\n\nThe Group has a number of entities which are managed as individual operating companies including airline and platform functions. Each airline operates its network operations as a single business unit and the IAG MC assesses performance based on measures including operating profit, and makes resource allocation decisions for the airlines based on network profitability, primarily by reference to the passenger markets in which the companies operate. The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to optimise consolidated financial results.\n\nThe Group has determined its operating segments based on the way that it treats its businesses and the manner in which resource allocation decisions are made. British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus have been identified for financial reporting purposes as reportable operating segments. IAG Loyalty and LEVEL are also operating segments but do not exceed the quantitative thresholds to be reportable and management has concluded that there are currently no other reasons why they should be separately disclosed.\n\nThe platform functions of the business primarily support the airline operations. These activities are not considered to be reportable operating segments as they either earn revenues incidental to the activities of the Group and resource allocation decisions are made based on the passenger business or are not reviewed regularly by the IAG MC and are included within Other Group companies.",

Further information with regard to the sensitivity of the recoverability of deferred tax assets is given in note 2.\n\n## Unrecognised temporary differences - investment in subsidiaries and associates\n\nNo deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of \u20ac617 million (2020: \u20ac547 million) of temporary differences relating to subsidiaries and associates. The Group either controls the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future or no tax consequences would arise from their reversal to a material extent.\n\n## Tax rate changes\n\nOn March 3, 2021 the UK Chancellor announced that legislation would be introduced in the Finance Bill 2021 to set the main rate of corporation tax at 25 per cent from April 2023. On May 24, 2021 the Finance Bill was substantively enacted, which has led to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances and will increase the Group's future current tax charge accordingly. As a result of the remeasurement of deferred tax balances in UK entities, a credit of \u20ac78 million is recorded in the Income statement and a credit of \u20ac61 million is recorded in Other comprehensive income.\n\nOn October 8, 2021 Ireland announced that it would increase the rate of corporation tax for certain multinational businesses to 15 per cent with effect from 2023. This expected tax rate change has not been reflected in these results because it has not yet been substantively enacted. The effect of the proposed rate change is not expected to be material over the period of the management approved business plan.\n\n## Tax policy developments\n\nThe Group is monitoring the OECD's proposed two-pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy. This proposed reform to the international tax system addresses the geographical allocation of profits for the purposes of taxation, and is designed to ensure that multinational enterprises will be subject to a minimum 15 per cent effective tax rate. The new framework is expected to be enacted in 2022, and effective from 2023. The implications for the Group will be determined when the relevant legislation is available.\n\n## g Tax-related contingent liabilities\n\nThe Group has certain contingent liabilities, across all taxes, which at December 31, 2021 amounted to \u20ac106 million (December 31, 2020: \u20ac166 million). No material losses are likely to arise from such contingent liabilities. As such the Group does not consider it appropriate to make a provision for these amounts. Included in the tax related contingent liabilities is the following:\n\n## Merger gain\n\nFollowing tax audits covering the period 2011 to 2014, the Spanish Tax Authorities issued a corporate income tax assessment to the Company regarding the merger in 2011 between British Airways and Iberia. The maximum exposure in this case is \u20ac95 million (December 31, 2020: \u20ac92 million), being the amount in the tax assessment with an estimate of the interest accrued on that assessment through to December 31, 2021.\n\nThe Company appealed the assessment to the Tribunal Econ\u00f3mico-Administrativo Central or 'TEAC' (Central Administrative Tax Tribunal). On October 23, 2019 the TEAC ruled in favour of the Spanish Tax Authorities. The Company subsequently appealed this ruling to the Audiencia Nacional (National High Court) on December 20, 2019, and on July 24, 2020 filed submissions in support of its case. The Company does not expect a hearing at the National High Court until the second half of 2022 at the earliest.\n\nThe Company disputes the technical merits of the assessment and ruling of the TEAC, both in terms of whether a gain arose and in terms of the quantum of any gain. The Company believes that it has strong arguments to support its appeals. The Company does not consider it appropriate to make a provision for these amounts and accordingly has classified this matter as a contingent liability.",

The dividend paid in the year to December 31, 2020 of \u20ac53 million relates to the withholding tax on the 2019 interim dividend, which was proposed in October 2019.\n\nThe future dividend capacity of the Group is dependent on the liquidity requirements and the distributable reserves of the Group's main operating companies and their capacity to pay dividends to the Company, together with the Company's distributable reserves and liquidity.\n\nCertain debt obligations place restrictions or conditions on the payment of dividends from the Group's main operating companies to the Company, including a loan to British Airways partially guaranteed by UKEF and loans to Iberia and Vueling partially guaranteed by the Instituto de Cr\u00e9dito Oficial (ICO) in Spain; these loans can be repaid early without penalty at the election of each company. In Spain, Iberia and Vueling are not permitted to make dividend payments in the reporting period in which they are in receipt of Expedientes de Regulaci\u00f3n Temporal de Empleo or 'ERTE' (Temporary Employment Regulation Records). British Airways agreed with the Trustee of its main UK defined benefit pension scheme (NAPS) as part of an agreement to defer \u00a3450 million of contributions that no dividends will be paid to IAG before 2024 and that any dividends paid to IAG from 2024 will trigger a pension contribution of 50 per cent of the amount of the dividend, until the deferred pension contributions have been paid.",

During 2021, the IASB extended the period for the application of the practical expedient.\n\nThe Group has applied this practical expedient to all such modifications in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The net impact on the Income statement for 2021 has been a credit of \u20ac8 million (2020: credit of \u20ac2 million) reflecting the changes to lease payments that arose from such concessions.\n\n## c Amounts recognised in the Consolidated cash flow statement\n\nThe Group had total cash outflows for leases of \u20ac1,912 million in 2021 (2020: \u20ac1,997 million).\n\nThe Group had total cash inflows associated with sale and leaseback transactions of \u20ac213 million in 2021 (2020: \u20ac898 million).\n\nThe Group is exposed to future cash outflows (on an undiscounted basis) as at December 31, 2021, for which no amount has been recognised in relation to leases not yet commenced to which the Group is committed, of \u20acnil (2020: \u20ac183 million).\n\n## d Maturity profile of the lease liabilities\n\nThe maturity profile of the lease liabilities is disclosed in note 27f.\n\n## e Extension options\n\nThe Group has certain leases which contain extension options exercisable by the Group prior to the non-cancellable contract period. Where practicable, the Group seeks to include extension options in new leases to provide operational flexibility. The Group assesses at lease commencement whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options.\n\nThe Group is exposed to future cash outflows (on an undiscounted basis) as at December 31, 2021, for which no amount has been recognised, for potential extension options of \u20ac795 million (2020: \u20ac998 million) due to it not being reasonably certain that these leases will be extended.\n\n1,521\n\n1,560\n\n8,116\n\n8,464",

The Group has classified those leases that transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee as finance leases and those leases that do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee as operating leases.\n\n## Operating leases\n\nRental income from operating leases recognised by the Group in 2021 was \u20acnil (2020: \u20acnil). Rental income is recorded within Property, IT and other within the Income statement.\n\nThe following table sets out a maturity analysis of operating lease receipts, showing the undiscounted lease receipts to be received after the reporting date:\n\n\u20ac million\n\n|                      | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Within one year      | 4      | -      |\n| One to two years     | 5      | -      |\n| Two to five years    | 2      | -      |\n| More than five years | -      | -      |\n| TToottaall           | 11     | -      |\n\n## 15  Capital expenditure commitments\n\nCapital expenditure authorised and contracted for but not provided for in the accounts amounts to \u20ac10,911 million (December 31, 2020: \u20ac10,545 million). The majority of capital expenditure commitments are denominated in US dollars, and as such are subject to changes in exchange rates.\n\nThe outstanding commitments include \u20ac10,813 million for the acquisition of 22 Airbus A320s (from 2022 to 2025), 34 Airbus A321s (from 2022 to 2024), 26 Airbus A350s (from 2022 to 2025), 18 Boeing 777-9s (from 2025 to 2027) and 10 Boeing 787s (from 2022 to 2024). The Group has certain rights to cancel commitments in the event of significant delays to aircraft deliveries caused by the aircraft manufacturers. No such rights had been exercised as at December 31, 2021.\n\n## 16  Non-current assets held for sale\n\nThe non-current assets held for sale of \u20ac20 million represent three Airbus A321-200 aircraft. No gain or loss was recognised on classification as non-current assets held for sale. These aircraft are presented within the Aer Lingus segment and will exit the business within 12 months of December 31, 2021.",

The details of these scenarios are given in the going concern section of note 2, with a weighting of 70 per cent to the base case, 20 per cent to the downside case and 10 per cent to the downside lockdown case. Cash flow projections are based on the business plans approved by the relevant operating companies covering a three-year period. Cash flows extrapolated beyond the three-year period are projected to increase based on long-term growth rates. Cash flow projections are discounted using each CGU's pre-tax discount rate.\n\nAnnually the relevant operating companies prepare and approve three-year business plans, and the Board approved the Group three-year business plan in the fourth quarter of the year. Adjustments have been made to the terminal year of the business plan cash flows to incorporate the impacts of climate change that the Group can reliably estimate at the reporting date. However, given the long-term nature of the Group's sustainability commitments, there are other aspects of these commitments that cannot be reliably estimated and accordingly have been excluded from the value-in-use calculations (refer to note 4). The business plan cash flows used in the value-in-use calculations also reflect all restructuring of the business where relevant that has been approved by the Board and which can be executed by management under existing agreements.\n\n## Key assumptions\n\nThe value-in-use calculations for each CGU reflected the increased risks arising from COVID-19, including updated projected cash flows for the decreased activity from 2022 through to the end of 2024 and an increase in the pre-tax discount rates to incorporate increased equity market volatility. For each of the Group's CGUs the key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are as follows:\n\n|                                  | 2021             | 2021   | 2021    | 2021       | 2021        |\n|----------------------------------|------------------|--------|---------|------------|-------------|\n| Per cent                         | British  Airways | Iberia | Vueling | Aer Lingus | IAG Loyalty |\n| Operating margin 1               | 3-13             | 2-12   | 2-11    | 0-14       | 22-24       |\n| ASKs as a proportion of 2019 1,2 | 75-103           | 77-100 | 97-119  | 84-115     | n/a         |\n| Long-term growth rate            | 1.9              | 1.7    | 1.6     | 1.7        | 1.6         |\n| Pre-tax discount rate            | 11.8             | 11.4   | 11.1    | 10.1       | 12.0        |\n\n|                                  | 2020             | 2020    | 2020    | 2020       | 2020        |\n|----------------------------------|------------------|---------|---------|------------|-------------|\n| Per cent                         | British  Airways | Iberia  | Vueling | Aer Lingus | IAG Loyalty |\n| Operating margin 1               | (20)-16          | (12)-11 | (22)-12 | (14) -13   | 25-27       |\n| ASKs as a proportion of 2019 1,2 | 45-95            | 49-98   | 46-107  | 40-100     | n/a         |\n| Long-term growth rate            | 2.1              | 2.0     | 1.8     | 1.9        | 2.0         |\n| Pre-tax discount rate            | 11.2             | 11.6    | 11.5    | 10.4       | 10.3        |\n\n|   Jet fuel price ($ per MT) |   Within 12  months |   1-2 years |   2-3 years |   3 years and  thereafter |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|\n|                        2021 |                 690 |         673 |         659 |                       659 |\n|                        2020 |                 373 |         420 |         449 |                       449 |\n\nForecast ASKs reflect the range of ASKs as a percentage of the 2019 actual ASKs over the forecast period, based on planned network growth and taking into account management's expectation of the market.\n\nThe long-term growth rate is calculated for each CGU based on the forecast weighted average exposure in each primary market using gross domestic product (GDP) (source: Oxford Economics). The terminal value cash flows and long term growth rate incorporate the impacts of climate change insofar as they can be determined (note 4). The airlines' network plans are reviewed annually as part of the Business plan and reflect management's plans in response to specific market risk or opportunity.\n\nPre-tax discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each CGU, taking into consideration the time value of money and underlying risks of its primary market. The discount rate calculation is based on the circumstances of the airline industry, the Group and the CGU. It is derived from the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC takes into consideration both debt and equity available to airlines. The cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by airline investors and the cost of debt is derived from both market data and the Group's existing debt structure. CGU-specific risk is incorporated by applying individual beta factors which are evaluated annually based on available market data. The pre-tax discount rate reflects the timing of future tax flows.\n\nJet fuel price assumptions are derived from forward price curves in the fourth quarter of each year and sourced externally. The cash flow forecasts reflect these price increases after taking into consideration of level of fuel derivatives and their associated prices that the Group has in place.",

        "page_content": "## Summary of results\n\nAt December 31, 2021 management reviewed the recoverable amount of each of the CGUs and concluded the recoverable amounts exceeded the carrying values.\n\nReasonable possible changes in key assumptions, both individually and in combination, have been considered for each CGU, where applicable, which include reducing the operating margin by 2 percentage points in each year, ASKs by 5 per cent in each year, long-term growth rates in the terminal value calculation to zero, increasing pre-tax discount rates by 2.5 percentage points, changing the weighting of the base case and the downside case to be 100 per cent weighted towards the downside lockdown case, and increasing the fuel price by 40 per cent with no assumed cost recovery. Given the inherent uncertainty associated with the impact of climate change, these sensitivities represent a reasonably possible greater impact of climate change on the CGUs than that included in the impairment models.\n\nFor the British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus CGUs, while the recoverable amounts are estimated to exceed the carrying amounts by \u20ac3,402 million, \u20ac2,166 million, \u20ac2,271 million and \u20ac1,614 million, respectively, the recoverable amounts would be below the carrying amounts when applying reasonable possible changes in assumptions in each of the following scenarios:\n\n- \u00b7 British Airways: (i) if ASKs had been five per cent lower combined with a fuel price increase of 4 per cent; (ii) if ASKs had been five per cent lower combined with a reduction of the long-term growth rate to 1.3 per cent; (iii) if operating margin had been two percentage points lower; and (iv) if the fuel price had been 11 per cent higher;\n- \u00b7 Iberia : (i) if ASKs had been five per cent lower combined with a fuel price increase of 15 per cent; and (ii) if the fuel price had been 21 per cent higher;\n- \u00b7 Vueling : (i) if ASKs had been five per cent lower combined with a fuel price increase of 32 per cent; and (ii) if the fuel price had been 39 per cent higher; and\n- \u00b7 Aer Lingus : (i) if ASKs had been five per cent lower combined with a fuel price increase of 23 per cent; and (ii) if the fuel price had been 31 per cent higher.\n\nFor the remainder of the reasonable possible changes in key assumptions applied to the British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus CGUs and for all the reasonable possible changes in key assumptions applied to the remaining CGUs, no impairment arises.\n\nFor impairment charges, and impairment reversals, recognised in relation to landing rights and fleet assets stood down permanently at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, refer to note 3 and the Alternative performance measures section.\n\n## 18  Investments\n\n## a Investments in subsidiaries\n\nThe Group's subsidiaries at December 31, 2021 are listed in the Group investments section.\n\nAll subsidiary undertakings are included in the consolidation. The proportion of the voting rights in the subsidiary undertakings held directly do not differ from the proportion of ordinary shares held. There have been no significant changes in ownership interests of subsidiaries during the year.\n\nThe total non-controlling interest at December 31, 2021 is \u20ac6 million (2020: \u20ac6 million).\n\nBritish Airways Employee Benefit Trustee (Jersey) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of British Airways, governs the British Airways Plc Employee Share Ownership Trust (the Trust). The Trust is not a legal subsidiary of IAG; however, it is consolidated within the Group results.\n\n## b Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nThe share of assets, liabilities, revenue and profit of the Group's associates and joint ventures, which are included in the Group's financial statements, are as follows:\n\n\u20ac million\n\n|                     | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total assets        | 115    | 73     |\n| Total liabilities   | (85)   | (50)   |\n| Revenue             | 64     | 22     |\n| Profit for the year | 2      | 1      |\n\nThe detail of the movement in Investment in associates and joint ventures is shown as follows:\n\n\u20ac million\n\n|                           | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|\n| At beginning of year      | 29     | 31     |\n| Additions                 | 9      | -      |\n| Share of retained profits | 2      | 1      |\n| Dividends received        | (1)    | (3)    |\n| Exchange movements        | 1      | -      |\n|                           | 40     | 29     |\n\nAt December 31, 2021 there are no restrictions on the ability of associates or joint ventures to transfer funds to the parent and there are no related contingent liabilities.\n\nAt both December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 the investment in Sociedad Conjunta para la Emisi\u00f3n y Gesti\u00f3n de Medios de Pago EFC, S.A. exceeded 50 per cent ownership by the Group (50.5 per cent). The entity is treated as a joint venture as decisions regarding its strategy and operations require the unanimous consent of the parties who share control, including IAG.",

Of this amount, \u20ac279 million is expected to be recognised as revenue in 1 to 5 years from the reporting date and \u20ac112 million thereafter.\n\nDeferred revenue relating to customer loyalty programmes consists primarily of revenue allocated to performance obligations associated with Avios. Avios are issued by the Group's airlines through their loyalty programmes, or are sold to third parties such as credit card providers, who issue them as part of their loyalty programme. Avios do not have an expiry date and can be redeemed at any time in the future. Revenue may therefore be recognised at any time in the future.\n\nDeferred revenue in respect of sales in advance of carriage consists of revenue allocated to airline tickets to be used for future travel. Typically these tickets expire within 12 months after the planned travel date, if they are not used within that time period, however, with the significant disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group has extended the expiry period up to 24 months after the planned travel date, depending on the operating company. In addition, the significant disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic led to a number of flight cancellations during both 2020 and 2021, which entitled the customer to either a refund or the issuance of a voucher for future redemption. Vouchers are presented within sales in advance of carriage.",

Under the CCFF, British Airways issued commercial paper to the Government of the United Kingdom of \u20ac350 million (\u00a3300 million). This loan was repaid in April 2021.\n\nIn addition, on March 23, 2021, the Group entered into a three-year US dollar secured Revolving Credit Facility accessible by British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus. The amount available under the facility is $1.755 billion. As at December 31, 2021 no amounts had been drawn under the facility. Concurrent to entering into the facility, British Airways extinguished its US dollar secured Revolving Credit Facility due to mature in June 2021, and which had $786 million undrawn and available at December 31, 2020. While the Group does not forecast drawing down on the Revolving Credit Facility, should it do so, the resultant debt would be securitised against specific landing rights and aircraft in the respective operating companies.\n\n## Details of the 2028 convertible bond\n\nThe convertible bond provides bondholders with dividend protection and includes a total of 244,850,715 options at inception and at December 31, 2021 to convert into ordinary shares of IAG.

These transactions mature between 2031 and 2035. This arrangement was transacted through an unconsolidated structured entity, which in turn issued the British Airways Pass Through Certificates, Series 2021-1, commonly referred to as Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (EETCs). In doing so the Group recognised \u20ac204 million of Asset financed liabilities.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Group entered into an asset-financing structure, under which nine aircraft were financed. These transactions mature between 2028 and 2032.

The provision also includes an amount relating to leased land and buildings where restoration costs are contractually required at the end of the lease. Such costs are capitalised within ROU assets. The provision is long-term in nature, typically covering the leased asset term, which for aircraft is up to 12 years.\n\nIncluded within the release of unused restoration and handback provisions is an amount of \u20ac7 million relating to the reversal of contractual lease provisions, which represent the estimation of the cost to fulfil the handback conditions associated with the leased aircraft that had been permanently stood down and impaired during the year ended December 31, 2020, which have subsequently been stood back up with a resultant impairment reversal during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nWhere amounts are finalised and the uncertainty relating to these provisions removed, the associated liability is reclassified to either current or non-current Other creditors, dependent on the expecting timing of settlement.\n\n## Restructuring provisions\n\nThe restructuring provision includes provisions for voluntary redundancies including the collective redundancy programme for Iberia's Transformation Plan implemented prior to 2021, which provides for payments to affected employees until they reach the statutory retirement age. The amount provided for has been determined by an actuarial valuation made by independent actuaries, and was based on the same assumptions as those made to determine the provisions for obligations to flight crew below, with the exception of the discount rate, which in this case was 0.00 per cent. The payments related to this provision will continue over the next eight years.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, \u20ac270 million of this provision related to collective redundancy programmes (2020: \u20ac428 million).\n\n## Employee leaving indemnities and other employee-related provisions\n\nThis provision includes employees leaving indemnities relating to staff under various contractual arrangements.\n\nThe Group recognises a provision relating to flight crew who, having met certain conditions, have the option of being placed on reserve and retaining their employment relationship until reaching the statutory retirement age, or taking early retirement. The Group is required to remunerate these employees until they reach the statutory retirement age, and an initial provision was recognised based on an actuarial valuation. The provision was reviewed at December 31, 2021 with the use of independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method, based on a discount rate consistent with the iBoxx index of 0.91 per cent and 0.00 per cent (2020: iBoxx index of 0.37 per cent and 0.00 per cent) depending on whether the employees are currently active or not, the PERM/F-2000P mortality tables, and assuming a 2 per cent annual increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in 2022 and 1.5 per cent in 2023. This is mainly a long-term provision. Remeasurements in the valuation of this provision are recorded in Other comprehensive income. The amount relating to this provision was \u20ac644 million at December 31, 2021 (2020: \u20ac654 million).\n\n## Legal claims and contractual disputes provisions\n\nLegal claims and contractual disputes provisions include:\n\n- \u00b7 amounts for multi-party claims from groups of employees on a number of matters related to its operations, including claims for additional holiday pay and for age discrimination;\n- \u00b7 amounts related to ongoing contractual disputes arising from the Group's ongoing provisions; and\n- \u00b7 amounts related to investigations by a number of competition authorities in connection with alleged anti-competitive activity concerning the Group's passenger and cargo businesses.\n\nThe final amount required to pay the remaining claims and fines is subject to uncertainty.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nOther provisions include a provision for the Emissions Trading Scheme for CO2 emitted on flights within the United Kingdom and the EU in excess of the relevant United Kingdom and EU Emission Allowances granted.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED\n\nFor the year to December 31, 2021\n\n## 27 Financial risk management objectives and policies\n\nThe Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including fuel price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The principal impact of these on the financial statements are discussed below:\n\n## a Fuel price risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to fuel price risk. In order to mitigate such risk, under the Group's fuel price risk management strategy a variety of over the counter derivative instruments are entered into. The Group strategy is to hedge a proportion of fuel consumption up to two years (previously three years) within the approved hedging profile.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial instruments to a reasonable possible change in fuel prices, with all other variables held constant, on result before tax and equity 1 :\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n| Increase/(decrease)   in fuel price   per cent   | Effect on result  before tax  \u20ac million   | Effect on equity  \u20ac million   | Increase/(decrease)  in fuel price  per cent   | Effect on result  before tax  \u20ac million   | Effect on equity  \u20ac million   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| 30                                               | -                                         | 834                           | 30                                             | 189                                       | 525                           |\n| (30)                                             | -                                         | (520)                         | (30)                                           | (219)                                     | (664)                         |\n\nDuring the year to December 31, 2021, following a substantial recovery in the global price of crude oil, the fair value of such net asset derivative instruments was \u20ac288 million at December 31, 2021, representing an increase of \u20ac1,066 million since January 1, 2021. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, a significant proportion of the associated hedge relationships are no longer expected to occur and subsequently fuel hedge accounting was discontinued, with subsequent mark-to-market movements recorded in the Income statement. However, as a result of the updated forecasts as detailed in note 3, a further \u20ac72 million of the gains recognised in Other comprehensive income were reclassified to the Income statement and recognised within Fuel, oil costs and emission costs in the year to December 31, 2021.\n\nThe gain arising from the derecognition of fuel hedges has been recorded as an exceptional item. Refer to Alternative performance measures section for further details.\n\n## b Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on revenue, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group. The currencies in which these transactions are denominated are primarily euro, US dollar and pound sterling. The Group has a number of strategies to hedge foreign currency risk. The Group strategy is to hedge a proportion of its foreign currency sales and purchases for up to three years.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group's principal foreign exchange exposure to a reasonable possible change in the US dollar, pound sterling and Japanese yen exchange rates, with all other variables held constant on result before tax and equity 1 . The sensitivity analysis has been performed on interest-bearing liabilities, lease liabilities and derivatives (both designated in hedge relationships and those not designated in hedge relationships) denominated in foreign currencies, with the disclosure for 2020 updated to align with the current methodology. The methodology has been updated to better reflect the foreign exchange exposures arising from the Group's operations.\n\nStrengthening/\n\nStrengthening/\n\n|      | Strengthening/  (weakening) in  US dollar rate   per cent   | Effect on  result before  tax  \u20ac million   | Effect on  equity   \u20ac million   | (weakening) in  pound  sterling rate  per cent   | Effect on  result before  tax  \u20ac million   | Effect on  equity   \u20ac million   | (weakening) in  Japanese yen  rate   per cent   | Effect on  result before  tax  \u20ac million   | Effect on  equity   \u20ac million   |\n|------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| 2021 | 10                                                          | 255                                        | 523                             | 10                                               | (10)                                       | 134                             | 10                                              | (17)                                       | (41)                            |\n| 2021 | (10)                                                        | (260)                                      | (481)                           | (10)                                             | 10                                         | (134)                           | (10)                                            | 17                                         | 41                              |\n| 2020 | 10                                                          | 234                                        | 283                             | 10                                               | 9                                          | (167)                           | 10                                              | (16)                                       | (42)                            |\n| 2020 | (10)                                                        | (273)                                      | (345)                           | (10)                                             | (9)                                        | 157                             | (10)                                            | 16                                         | 42                              |\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the fair value of foreign currency net asset derivative instruments was \u20ac185 million, representing an increase of \u20ac652 million since January 1, 2021. These comprise both derivatives designated in hedge relationships and those derivatives that are not designated into a hedge relationship at inception. As per the fuel price risk above, a significant proportion of the derivatives designated in hedge relationships have no longer been expected to occur and subsequently hedge accounting has been discontinued, with subsequent mark-to-market movements recorded in the Income statement. However, as a result of the updated forecasts as detailed in note 3, a further \u20ac5 million of the gains recognised in Other comprehensive income were reclassified to the Income statement and recognised within Fuel, oil costs and emission costs and within Passenger revenue. Those derivatives not designated in a hedge relationship on inception have their mark-to-market movements recorded directly in the Income statement and recognised within Net currency retranslation (charges)/credits.",

The Group is exposed to credit risk from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments. The Group has policies and procedures to monitor the risk by assigning limits to each counterparty by underlying exposure and by operating company and by only entering into transactions with counterparties with a very low credit risk.\n\nAt each period end, the Group assesses the effect of counterparties' and the Group's own credit risk on the fair value of derivatives and any ineffectiveness arising is immediately recognised in the Income statement within Other non-operating expenses.\n\n## e Counterparty risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to the non-performance by its counterparties in respect of financial assets receivable. The Group has policies and procedures to monitor the risk by assigning limits to each counterparty by underlying exposure and by operating company. The underlying exposures are monitored on a daily basis and the overall exposure limit by counterparty is periodically reviewed by using available market information.\n\nThe financial assets recognised in the financial statements, net of impairment losses (if any), represent the Group's maximum exposure to credit risk, without taking into account any guarantees in place or other credit enhancements.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 the Group's credit risk position, allocated by region, in respect of treasury managed cash and derivatives was as\n\nfollows:\n\n|                  | Mark-to-market of treasury  controlled financial   instruments allocated by  geography   | Mark-to-market of treasury  controlled financial   instruments allocated by  geography   |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Region           | 2021                                                                                     | 2020                                                                                     |\n| United Kingdom   | 44%                                                                                      | 53%                                                                                      |\n| Spain            | -                                                                                        | 3%                                                                                       |\n| Ireland          | 18%                                                                                      | 7%                                                                                       |\n| Rest of Eurozone | 34%                                                                                      | 16%                                                                                      |\n| Rest of world    | 4%                                                                                       | 21%                                                                                      |",

For the year to December 31, 2021, the net debt to EBITDA was minus 11.5 times (2020: minus 4.3 times). The definition and calculation for this performance measure is included in the Alternative performance measures section.\n\nFurther detail on liquidity and capital resources and capital risk management is disclosed in the going concern section in note 2.\n\n## i Managing interest rate benchmark reform and associated risks\n\n## Overview\n\nA reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally, including the replacement of certain interbank offered rates (IBORs) with alternative nearly risk-free rates (referred to as 'IBOR reform'). The Group has exposures to IBORs on its financial instruments that are expected to mature subsequent to December 31, 2021, and as such will be replaced as part of these market-wide initiatives. The Group anticipates that IBOR reform will impact its risk management and hedge accounting.\n\nDuring 2020 the Group established an IBOR transition working group and project plan, led by Group Treasury. This project has and continues to consider the required changes to systems, processes, risk management and valuation models, as well as managing any accounting and tax implications. During the course of 2021, the Group, and the counterparties to the financial instruments, have transitioned the majority of such instruments to an alternative benchmark rate and in order to enable such transitions, changes to systems, processes and models have been implemented. Those financial instruments that have not transitioned at December 31, 2021 predominantly relate to those with a US dollar LIBOR component, which is not expected to convert to an alternative risk-free rate until mid-2023, subject to further consultation.\n\nIn addition, during 2021, the Group has enquired of the trustees of the Group's pension schemes to understand the status of their IBOR transitions, if any. The Group has satisfied itself that all material derivative financial and non-derivative financial instruments with an IBOR component have been transitioned to an alternative benchmark at December 31, 2021.\n\nReforms to the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) methodology to enable it to meet the criteria of a risk-free rate were completed in 2019. As such the Group expects to continue to utilise financial instruments with a EURIBOR component without transitioning to an alternative benchmark rate.",

        "page_content": "## Derivative and non-derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nWhile the Group has transitioned a number of its derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to an alternative benchmark rate, certain interest rate swap derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments continue to have their floating legs indexed to US dollar LIBOR. These derivative financial instruments continue to be recognised as hedging instruments in hedge relationships, with the hedged item being those non-derivative financial instruments indexed to US dollar LIBOR.\n\nFor such derivative financial instruments the Group has evaluated the extent to which its cash flow hedging relationships are subject to uncertainty driven by IBOR reform as at December 31, 2021. As part of this evaluation, the Group has applied the hedging relief provided by the IFRS 9 amendments for IBOR reform Phase 1.\n\nThere remains uncertainty about when and how replacement may occur with respect to the relevant hedged items and hedging instruments. Such uncertainty may impact the hedging relationship. Hedging relationships impacted by IBOR reform may experience ineffectiveness attributable to market participant's expectations of when the change in rates will occur, which may differ between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.\n\nThe table below provides an overview of the IBOR-related exposures as at December 31, 2021. Non-derivative financial instruments are presented on the basis of their carrying values, while derivative financial instruments are presented on the basis of their nominal amounts.\n\n| \u20ac million   | Non-derivative  financial  instruments -  carrying value 1   | Derivative  financial  instruments -  nominal  amount   |\n|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| GBP LIBOR   | -                                                            | -                                                       |\n| USD LIBOR   | 600                                                          | 782                                                     |\n| Other LIBOR | -                                                            | -                                                       |\n\nThe principal outstanding IBOR-related exposures relate to those lease liabilities with a USD LIBOR component. The Group has such leases with a limited number of counterparties for which the Group expects to transition to an alternative benchmark by June 30, 2023.\n\n## 28 Financial instruments\n\n## a Financial assets and liabilities by category\n\nThe detail of the Group's financial instruments at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 by nature and classification for measurement purposes is as follows:\n\nDecember 31, 2021\n\n|                                         | Financial assets   | Financial assets                                 | Financial assets                       |                       |                                                |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| \u20ac million                               | Amortised  cost    | Fair value  through Other  comprehensive  income | Fair value  through  Income  statement | Non-financial  assets | Total carrying  amount by  balance sheet  item |\n| Non-current assets                      |                    |                                                  |                                        |                       |                                                |\n| Other equity investments                | -

A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis. Level 1 methodologies (market values at the balance sheet date) were used to determine the fair value of listed asset investments classified as equity investments and listed interest-bearing borrowings. The fair value of financial liabilities and financial assets incorporates own credit risk and counterparty credit risk, respectively.\n\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates.\n\nDerivative instruments are measured based on the market value of instruments with similar terms and conditions using forward pricing models, which include forward exchange rates, forward interest rates, forward fuel curves and corresponding volatility surface data at the reporting date. The fair value of derivative financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows, incorporating adjustments for own credit risk and counterparty credit risk:\n\n- \u00b7 commodity reference contracts including swaps and options transactions, referenced to (i) CIF NWE cargoes jet fuel; (ii) ICE Gasoil ; (iii) ICE Brent; (iv) ICE Gasoil Brent crack; (v) Jet Differential and (vi) Jet fuel Brent crack - the mark-to-market valuation prices are determined by reference to current forward curve and standard option pricing valuation models, values are discounted to the reporting date based on the corresponding interest rate;\n- \u00b7 currency forward and option contracts - by reference to current forward prices and standard option pricing valuation models, values are discounted to the reporting date based on the corresponding interest rate; and\n- \u00b7 interest rate swap contracts - by discounting the future cash flows of the swap contracts at market interest rate valued with the current forward curve.",

The fair value of the Group's interest-bearing borrowings is adjusted for own credit risk.\n\nLevel 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. The principal method of such valuation is performed using a valuation model that considers the present value of the dividend cash flows expected to be generated by the associated assets.\n\nThe fair value of cash and cash equivalents, other current interest-bearing deposits, trade receivables, other current assets and trade and other payables approximate their carrying value largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.\n\nThe carrying amounts and fair values of the Group's financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2021 are as follows:\n\nCarrying\n\n|                                        | Fair value  value   | Fair value  value   | Fair value  value   | Fair value  value   | Fair value  value   |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| \u20ac million                              | Level 1             | Level 2             | Level 3             | Total               | Total               |\n| Financial assets                       |                     |                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| Other equity investments               | -

        "page_content": "## 30 Share-based payments\n\nThe Group operates share-based payment schemes as part of the total remuneration package provided to employees. These schemes comprise both share option schemes where employees acquire shares at an option price and share award plans whereby shares are issued to employees at no cost, subject to the achievement by the Group of specified performance targets.\n\n## a IAG Performance Share Plan\n\nThe IAG Performance Share Plan (PSP) is granted to senior executives and managers of the Group who are most directly involved in shaping and delivering business success over the medium to long term. Since 2015, awards have been made as nil-cost options, with a twoyear holding period following the three-year performance period, before options can be exercised. All awards since 2015 have three independent performance measures with equal weighting: Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to the STOXX Europe 600 Travel and Leisure Index (for 2020 awards) or MSCI European Transportation Index (for prior to 2020 awards), earnings per share, and Return on Invested Capital.\n\nIn 2020, the outstanding PSP awards granted to participants other than Executive Directors from 2018 onwards were modified, and the resulting incremental fair value granted of \u00a31.61 per award is recognised over the remaining vesting period.\n\n## b IAG Restricted Share Plan\n\nDuring 2021, the Group revised its approach to long-term incentives, replacing the existing PSP with a Restricted Share Plan proposal under the new Executive Share Plan (RSP) approved by shareholders in June 2021. The RSP was introduced to increase the alignment of both interests and outcomes between the Group's senior management and shareholders through the build-up and maintenance of senior management shareholdings and an increased focus on the long-term, sustainable performance of the Group. Awards have been made as nil-cost options, with a two-year holding period following the three-year performance period, before options can be exercised. There are no performance measures associated with the awards, although approval at the end of the vesting period will be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, considering the Group's overall performance, including financial and non-financial performance measures over the course of the vesting period, as well as any material risk or regulatory failures identified.\n\n## c IAG Full Potential Incentive Plan\n\nDuring 2021, the Group launched the new Full Potential Incentive Plan (FPIP), which is granted to key individuals involved in the delivery of a series of transformation projects that will enable the Group to deliver business success over the medium to long term. The Awards have been made as nil-cost options, vesting in 2025 and dependent on stretch performance targets for 2024 and the approval of the Board.\n\n## d IAG Incentive Award Deferral Plan\n\nThe IAG Incentive Award Deferral Plan (IADP) is granted to qualifying employees based on performance and service tests. It will be awarded when an incentive award is triggered subject to the employee remaining in employment with the Group for three years after the grant date. The relevant population will receive 50 per cent of their incentive award up front in cash, and the remaining 50 per cent in shares after three years through the IADP.\n\n## e Share-based payment schemes summary\n\n|                               | Outstanding  at January 1,  2021 '000s   | Granted  number '000s   | Lapsed  number '000s   | Vested  number  '000s   | Outstanding  at December  31, 2021 '000s   | Exercisable  December 31,  2021 '000s   |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Performance Share Plan        | 32,800                                   | -                       | 5,768                  | 2,326                   | 24,706                                     | 1,748                                   |\n| Restricted Share Plan         | -                                        | 16,260                  | 62                     | -                       | 16,198                                     | -                                       |\n| Full Potential Incentive Plan | -                                        | 28,067                  | 188                    | -                       | 27,879                                     | -                                       |\n| Incentive Award Deferral Plan | 8,367                                    | -                       | 218                    | 2,790                   | 5,359                                      | 6                                       |\n|                               | 41,167                                   | 44,327                  | 6,236                  | 5,116                   | 74,142                                     | 1,754                                   |\n\nThe weighted average share price at the date of exercise of options exercised during the year to December 31, 2021 was \u00a31.78 (2020: \u00a33.89).\n\nThe fair value of equity-settled share-based payment plans determined using the Monte-Carlo valuation model last granted in 2020, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the plans were granted, used the following assumptions:\n\n|                                                   | December 31, 2021   |   December 31, 2020 |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Expected share price volatility (per cent)        | -                   |               35    |\n| Expected comparator group volatility (per cent)   | -                   |               20    |\n| Expected comparator group correlation (per cent)  | -                   |               70    |\n| Expected life of options (years)                  | -                   |                4.6  |\n| Weighted average share price at date of grant (\u00a3) | -                   |                4.59 |\n| Weighted average fair value (\u00a3)                   | -                   |                1.84 |\n\nVolatility was calculated with reference to the Group's weekly pound sterling share price volatility. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome. The fair value of the PSP also takes into account a market condition of TSR as compared to strategic competitors. No other features of share-based payment plans granted were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.\n\nThe Group recognised a share-based payment charge of \u20ac23 million for the year to December 31, 2021 (2020: credit of \u20ac8 million).",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED\n\nFor the year to December 31, 2021\n\n## 32 Employee benefit obligations\n\nThe Group operates a variety of post-employment benefit arrangements, covering both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes. The Group also has a scheme for flight crew who meet certain conditions and therefore have the option of being placed on reserve and retaining their employment relationship until reaching the statutory retirement age, or taking early retirement (note 26).\n\n## Defined contribution schemes\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes for its employees.\n\nCosts recognised in respect of defined contribution pension plans in Spain, UK and Ireland for the year to December 31, 2021 were \u20ac200 million (2020: \u20ac235 million).\n\n## Defined benefit schemes\n\nThe principal funded defined benefit pension schemes within the Group are the Airways Pension Scheme (APS) and the New Airways Pension Scheme (NAPS), both of which are in the UK and are closed to new members.\n\nAPS has been closed to new members since 1984, but remains open to future accrual. The benefits provided under APS are based on final average pensionable pay and, for the majority of members, are subject to inflationary increases in payment.\n\nNAPS has been closed to new members since 2004 and closed to future accrual since 2018, resulting in a reduction of the defined benefit obligation. Following closure members' deferred pensions will now be increased annually by inflation up to five per cent per annum (measured using the Government's annual Pension Increase (Review) Orders, which since 2011 have been based on CPI).\n\nAPS and NAPS are governed by separate Trustee Boards. Although APS and NAPS have separate Trustee Boards, much of the business of the two schemes is common. Some main Board and committee meetings are held in tandem although each Trustee Board reaches its decisions independently. There are three sub committees which are separately responsible for the governance, operation and investments of each scheme. British Airways Pension Trustees Limited holds the assets of both schemes on behalf of their respective Trustees.\n\n## 32 Employee benefit obligations continued\n\nTriennially, the Trustees of APS and NAPS undertake actuarial valuations, which are subsequently agreed with British Airways to determine the cash contributions and any deficit payments plans through to the next valuation date, as well as ensuring that the schemes have sufficient funds available to meet future benefit payments to members. These actuarial valuations are prepared using the principles set out in UK Pension legislation. This differs from the IAS 19 'Employee benefits' valuation, which is used for deriving the Income statement and Balance sheet positions, and uses a best-estimate approach overall. The different purpose and principles lead to different assumptions being used, and therefore a different estimate for the liabilities and deficit.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the triennial valuations as at March 31, 2021 were not finalised and accordingly the latest actuarial valuations of both APS and NAPS were performed as at March 31, 2018, which resulted in a surplus of \u20ac683 million for APS and a deficit of \u20ac2,736 million for NAPS. The actuarial valuations performed for APS and NAPS are different to the valuation performed as at December 31, 2021 under IAS 19 'Employee Benefits' mainly due to timing differences of the measurement dates and to the specific scheme assumptions in the actuarial valuation compared with IAS 19 guidance used in the accounting valuation assumptions.\n\n## Other plans\n\nBritish Airways also operates post-retirement schemes in a number of jurisdictions outside of the UK. The principal scheme is the British Airways Plc Pension Plan (USA) based in the United States and referred to as the 'US Plan'. The US Plan is considered to be a defined benefit scheme and is closed to new members and to future accrual.\n\nThe majority of the British Airways other plans are fully funded, but there are also a number of unfunded plans, where the Group meets the benefit payment obligations as they fall due.\n\nIn addition, Aer Lingus operates certain defined benefit plans, both funded and unfunded.\n\n## Risk associated with the defined benefit schemes\n\nThe defined benefit schemes expose the Group to a range of risks, with the following being the most significant:\n\n- \u00b7 Asset volatility risk - the scheme obligations are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to high quality corporate bond yields. If scheme assets underperform this yield, this will reduce the surplus / increase the deficit, depending on the scheme. Certain of the schemes hold a significant proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term while creating volatility and risk in the short term;\n- \u00b7 Longevity risk - the majority of the scheme obligations are to provide benefits over the life of the scheme members. An increase in life expectancy will result in a corresponding increase in the defined benefit obligation;\n- \u00b7 Interest rate risk - a decrease in interest rates will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of certain of the scheme assets;\n- \u00b7 Inflation risk - a significant proportion of the scheme obligations are linked to inflation, such that any increase in inflation will cause an increase in the obligations. While certain of the scheme assets are indexed to inflation, any expected increase in the scheme assets from inflation would be disproportionately lower than the increase in the scheme obligations; and\n- \u00b7 Currency risk - a number of scheme assets are denominated in currencies other than the pound sterling. Weakening of those currencies, or strengthening of the pound sterling, in the long term, will have the effect of reducing the value of scheme assets.",

        "page_content": "## a Cash payments and funding arrangements\n\nCash payments in respect to pension obligations comprise normal employer contributions by the Group and deficit contributions based on the agreed deficit payment plan with APS and NAPS. Total payments for the year to December 31, 2021 net of service costs made by the Group were \u20ac38 million (2020: \u20ac313 million) being the employer contributions of \u20ac41 million (2020: \u20ac318 million) less the current service cost of \u20ac3 million (2020: \u20ac5 million) (note 32b).\n\n## Future funding arrangements\n\nPension contributions for APS and NAPS were determined by actuarial valuations made at March 31, 2018, using assumptions and methodologies agreed between the Group and Trustee of each scheme.\n\nIn total, the Group expects to pay \u20ac1 million in employer contributions to APS and NAPS in 2022.\n\nThe following graph provides the undiscounted benefit payments to be made by the trustees of APS and NAPS over the remaining expected duration of the schemes:\n\n## Projected benefit payments from the valuation date (\u20ac million, unaudited)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe amounts and timing of these projected benefit payments are subject to the aforementioned risks to the schemes.\n\n## Deficit contributions and deferred deficit contributions\n\nAt the date of the actuarial valuation, the actuarial deficit of NAPS amounted to \u20ac2,736 million. In order to address the deficit in the scheme, the Group has also committed to deficit contribution payments through to the end of the first quarter of 2023 amounting to approximately \u20ac130 million per quarter. The deficit contribution plan includes an over-funding protection mechanism, based on the triennial valuation methodology for measuring the deficit, whereby deficit contributions are paid into an escrow account if the scheme funding position reaches 97 per cent, and are suspended if the funding position reaches 100 per cent, with a mechanism for contributions to resume if the contribution level subsequently falls below 100 per cent, which includes additional contributions equivalent to those months where contributions had been suspended, or until such point as the scheme funding level reaches 97 per cent.\n\nDuring the year ended and as at December 31, 2021, the NAPS funding position exceeded 100 per cent and accordingly deficit contributions were suspended. At December 31, 2021, the valuation of the funding level incorporates significant forward-looking assumptions, such that the Group currently does not expect to make further deficit contributions. Given the long-term nature of the NAPS scheme, these assumptions are subject to uncertainty and there can be no guarantee that deficit contributions will not resume in the future or that additional deficit contributions will be incorporated into future triennial actuarial valuations.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, had the over-funding protection mechanism not been applied, then the asset ceiling adjustment (as detailed in note 32c) would have been \u20ac289 million higher.\n\nOn December 18, 2020 British Airways reached agreement with the Trustee of NAPS to defer deficit contributions on an interim basis for the period between September 1, 2020 and January 31, 2021. On February 19, 2021 British Airways reached further agreement with the Trustee of NAPS to defer deficit contributions previously agreed in October 2019 on the March 31, 2018 valuation, through to August 31, 2021. Under this deferral agreement, the deferred payments will be incorporated into the future deficit payment plan and associated deficit contributions arising from the triennial valuation of the NAPS scheme as at March 31, 2021. The deferred deficit contribution payments do not include an over-funding protection mechanism.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Group is committed to the following undiscounted deficit payments, which are deductible for tax purposes at the statutory rate of tax:\n\n| \u20ac million                       | NAPS   | Other  schemes   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|------------------|\n| Within 12 months                | -      | 4                |\n| 1-2 years                       | 397    | -                |\n| 2-5 years                       | 175    | -                |\n| Greater than 5 years            | -      | -                |\n| Total expected deficit payments | 572    | 4                |\n\nDeficit payments in respect of local arrangements outside of the UK have been determined in accordance with local practice.\n\nUnder the contribution deferral agreement between British Airways and the Trustee of NAPS, in the period up to December 31, 2023, no dividend payment is permitted from British Airways to IAG. From 2024 onwards, any dividends paid by British Airways will be matched by contributions to NAPS of 50 per cent of the value of dividends paid. Any such payments to NAPS will reduce the outstanding repayment balance and are capped at that level. The requirement to make such payments to NAPS ceases after deferred contributions have been repaid.",

The latter is a form of investing designed to match the movement in pension plan assets with the movement in the projected benefit obligation over time. The Trustees' investment committee adopts an annual business plan which sets out investment objectives and work required to support achievement of these objectives. The committee also deals with the monitoring of performance and activities, including work on developing the strategic benchmark to improve the risk return profile of the scheme where possible, as well as having a trigger-based dynamic governance process to be able to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. The investment committee reviews the existing investment restrictions, performance benchmarks and targets, as well as continuing to develop the derisking and liability hedging portfolio.\n\nBoth schemes use derivative instruments for investment purposes and to manage exposures to financial risks, such as interest rate, foreign exchange, longevity and liquidity risks arising in the normal course of business. Exposure to interest rate risk is managed through the use of Inflation-Linked Swap contracts. Foreign exchange forward contracts are entered into to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations. Longevity risk is managed through the use of buy-in insurance contracts, asset swaps and longevity swaps.\n\nThe strategic benchmark for asset allocations differentiate between 'return seeking assets' and 'liability matching assets' depending on the maturity of each scheme. At December 31, 2021, the benchmark for NAPS was 37 per cent (2020: 42 per cent) in return seeking assets and 63 per cent (2020: 58 per cent) in liability matching investments. Bandwidths are set around these strategic benchmarks that allow for tactical asset allocation decisions, providing parameters for the investment committee and their investment managers to work within. APS no longer has a 'strategic benchmark' as instead, APS now runs off its liquidation portfolio to a liability matching portfolio of bonds and cash. The actual asset allocation for APS at December 31, 2021 was 1 per cent (2020: 1 per cent) in return seeking assets and 99 per cent (2020: 99 per cent) in liability matching investments.\n\n## ii Movement in scheme assets\n\nA reconciliation of the opening and closing balances of the fair value of scheme assets is set out below:\n\n\u20ac million\n\n|                                                   | 2021    | 2020    |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| January 1                                         | 31,185  | 31,681  |\n| Interest income                                   | 432     | 599     |\n| Administrative expenses 2                         | (21)    | (25)    |\n| Return on plan assets excluding interest income 2 | 2,495   | 2,268   |\n| Employer contributions 1                          | 41      | 313     |\n| Employee contributions                            | 13      | 14      |\n| Benefits paid 2                                   | (1,930) | (1,528) |\n| Exchange movements                                | 2,155   | (2,137) |\n| December 31                                       | 34,370  | 31,185  |",

Under the contract, to reduce the risk of long-term longevity risk, Rothesay Life makes benefit payments monthly in respect of the agreed list of members in return for the contractual return receivable on a portfolio of assets (made up of quoted government debt, asset swaps and longevity swaps) held by the scheme. The Group holds the portfolio of assets at their fair value, with the government debt held at their quoted market price and the swaps accounted for at their estimated discounted future cash flows.\n- During 2011, APS entered into a longevity swap with Rothesay Life, which covers an additional 21 per cent (2020: 20 per cent) of the pensioner liabilities for the same agreed list of members as the 2010 contract. Under the longevity swap, to reduce the risk of long-term longevity risk, APS makes a fixed payment to Rothesay Life each month reflecting the prevailing mortality assumptions at the inception of the contract, and Rothesay Life make a monthly payment to APS reflecting the actual monthly benefit payments to members. The cash flows are settled net each month. If pensioners live longer than expected at inception of the longevity swap, Rothesay Life will make payments to the scheme to offset the additional cost of paying pensioners and if pensioners do not live as long as expected, then the scheme will make payments to Rothesay Life. The Group holds the longevity swap at fair value, determined at the estimated discounted future cash flows.\n- \u00b7 Insurance contract - During 2018 the Trustee of APS secured a buy-in contract with Legal & General. The buy-in contract covers all members in receipt of pensions from APS at March 31, 2018, excluding dependent children, receiving a pension at that date and members in receipt of equivalent pension-only benefits, who were alive on October 1, 2018. Benefits coming into payment for retirements after March 31, 2018 are not covered. The contract covers benefits payable from October 1, 2018 onwards. The policy covers approximately 60 per cent of all benefits APS expects to pay out in future. Along with existing contracts with Rothesay Life, APS is 90 per cent protected against all longevity risk and fully protected in relation to all pensions that were already being paid as at March 31, 2018. It is also more than 90 per cent protected against interest rates and inflation (on a Retail Price Index basis).",

The asset ceiling represents the present value of the economic benefits available in the form of a refund or a reduction in future contributions after they are paid into the plan. The Group has determined that the recoverability of such surpluses, including minimum funding requirements, will be subject to withholding taxes in the UK, payable by the Trustee, of 35 per cent.\n\nThe future committed NAPS deficit contributions, as detailed in note 32a, are treated as minimum funding requirements under IAS 19 and are not recognised as part of the scheme assets or liabilities. The Group has determined that upon the wind up of the scheme, that if the scheme is in surplus, including the incorporation of the minimum funding requirements, then the surplus will be available as a refund or a reduction in future contributions after they are paid into the scheme. The recovery of such amounts are subject to UK withholding tax payable by the Trustee. In measuring the recoverability of the surplus for each scheme, the Group limits such measurement to the lower of the surplus in each scheme and the respective asset ceiling. The asset ceiling represents the present value of the economic benefits available upon wind up of the scheme, less the application of withholding taxes in the UK, payable by the Trustee, at 35 per cent.\n\nA reconciliation of the effect of the asset ceiling used in calculating the IAS 19 irrecoverable surplus in APS and NAPS is set out below:\n\n\u20ac million\n\n|                      | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|\n| January 1 1          | 761    | 1,130  |\n| Interest expense     | 9      | 14     |\n| Remeasurements 1     | 419    | (307)  |\n| Exchange movements 1 | 59     | (76)   |\n| December 31          | 1,248  | 761    |\n\n## d Present value of scheme liabilities\n\n## i Movement in scheme liabilities\n\nA reconciliation of the opening and closing balances of the present value of the defined benefit obligations is set out below:\n\n\u20ac million\n\n|                                               | 2021    | 2020    |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| January 1 1                                   | 30,556  | 30,335  |\n| Current service cost                          | 3       | 5       |\n| Past service cost/(credit)                    | -       | 7       |\n| Interest expense 1                            | 425     | 573     |\n| Remeasurements - financial assumptions        | 46      | 3,633   |\n| Remeasurements of experience losses/(gains) 1 | 427     | (421)   |\n| Benefits paid 1                               | (1,930) | (1,528) |\n| Employee contributions                        | 13      | 14      |\n| Exchange movements 1                          | 2,082   | (2,062) |\n| December 31                                   | 31,622  | 30,556  |\n\n## ii Scheme liability assumptions\n\nThe principal assumptions used for the purposes of the IAS 19 valuations were as follows:\n\n|                                           | 2021   | 2021   | 2021           | 2020   | 2020   | 2020           |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------------|--------|--------|----------------|\n| Per cent per annum                        | APS    | NAPS   | Other  schemes | APS    | NAPS   | Other  schemes |\n| Discount rate 1                           | 1.80   | 1.90   | 0.3 - 6.5      | 1.20   | 1.40   | 0.5 - 2.4      |\n| Rate of increase in pensionable pay 2     | 3.55   | -      | 2.0 - 6.0      | 2.95   | -      | 2.5            |\n| Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3 | 3.55   | 2.85   | 2.0 - 3.0      | 2.95   | 2.25   | 1.1 - 3.5      |\n| RPI rate of inflation                     | 3.55   | 3.3    | 1.8 - 2.5      | 2.95   | 2.80   | 2.5 - 2.7      |\n| CPI rate of inflation                     | 2.95   | 2.85   | 1.8 - 2.5      | 2.25   | 2.25   | 1.1 - 3.0      |",

The standard mortality tables were selected based on the actual recent mortality experience of members and were adjusted to allow for future mortality changes. Life expectancy assumptions do not reflect any adjustments for the impact of COVID-19 due to the uncertainty of the long-term effects. The current longevities underlying the values of the scheme liabilities were as follows:\n\nMortality assumptions\n\n|                                  | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a: |        |        |\n| \u00b7 male currently aged 60         | 28.1   | 28.2   |\n| \u00b7 male currently aged 40         | 29.9   | 29.9   |\n| \u00b7 female currently aged 60       | 29.5   | 29.3   |\n| \u00b7 female currently aged 40       | 31.9   | 31.8   |\n\nFor schemes in the United States, mortality rates were based on the MP-2021 mortality tables.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the weighted-average duration of the defined benefit obligation was 12 years for APS (2020: 12 years) and 19 years for NAPS (2020: 20 years). The weighted-average duration of the defined benefit obligations was 11 to 23 years for other schemes (2020: 11 to 24 years). The weighted average duration represents a single figure for the average number of years over which the employee benefit liability discounted cash flows is extinguished and is highly dependent on movements in the aforementioned discount rates.\n\n## iii Sensitivity analysis\n\nReasonable possible changes at the reporting date to significant valuation assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the present value of scheme liabilities by the amounts shown:\n\n|                                                              | Increase in scheme liabilities   | Increase in scheme liabilities   | Increase in scheme liabilities   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| \u20ac million                                                    | APS                              | NAPS                             | Other  schemes                   |\n| Discount rate (decrease of 10 basis points)                  | (35)                             | (424)                            | (9)                              |\n| Future salary growth (increase of 10 basis points)           | n/a                              | n/a                              | (3)                              |\n| Future pension growth (increase of 10 basis points)          | (47)                             | (400)                            | (4)                              |\n| Future mortality rate (one year increase in life expectancy) | (35)                             | (871)                            | (34)                             |\n\nAlthough the analysis does not take into account the full distribution of cash flows expected under the plan, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.\n\n## 33 Contingent liabilities and guarantees\n\nDetails of contingent liabilities are set out below. The Group does not consider it probable that there will be an outflow of economic resources with regard to these proceedings and accordingly no provision for these proceedings has been recognised.\n\nContingent liabilities associated with income and deferred taxes are presented in note 10.\n\nThere are a number of other legal and regulatory proceedings against the Group in a number of jurisdictions which at December 31, 2021 amounted to \u20ac22 million (December 31, 2020: \u20ac56 million).\n\nThe Group also has guarantees and indemnities entered into as part of the normal course of business, which at December 31, 2021 are not expected to result in material losses for the Group.",

        "page_content": "## 34 Government grants and assistance\n\nThe Group has availed itself of government grants and assistance as follows:\n\n## The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) - recognised net within Employee costs\n\nThe CJRS was implemented by the Government of the United Kingdom from March 1, 2020 to August 30, 2020, where those employees designated as being 'furloughed workers' were eligible to have 80 per cent of their wage costs paid up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 per month.\n\nFrom September 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020, the level of eligibility reduced to 70 per cent of wage costs and up to a maximum of \u00a32,197.50 per month. From October 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020, the level of eligibility reduced to 60 per cent of wage costs and up to a maximum of \u00a31,875 per month. Following the introduction of further lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom in November 2020, the CJRS was extended from November 1, 2020 to November 30, 2020 and then further to March 31, 2021 and then further again to September 30, 2021 with the level of eligibility increased to 80 per cent of wage costs and a maximum of \u00a32,500 per month through to the end of June 2021. From July 1, 2021 the eligibility decreased down each month to 60 per cent of wage costs and a maximum of \u00a31,875 per month by September 30, 2021, at which time the CJRS ended.\n\nSuch costs were paid by the Government to the Group in arrears. The Group was obliged to continue to pay the associated social security costs and employer pension contributions.\n\n## The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) - recognised net within Employee costs\n\nThe TWSS was implemented by the government of Ireland from March 1, 2020 to August 30, 2020, where those employees designated as being furloughed workers were eligible to have 85 per cent of their wage costs paid up to a maximum of \u20ac410 per week. This scheme was replaced with the EWSS from September 1, 2020 and is expected to run through to April, 2022. For those qualifying employees (earning less than \u20ac1,462 per week), the government will reimburse wage costs up to a maximum of \u20ac203 per week. Such costs are paid by the government to the Group in arrears.\n\nThe total amount of the relief received under the CJRS, the TWSS and the EWSS by the Group during 2021 amounted to \u20ac286 million (2020: \u20ac344 million).\n\n## Temporary Redundancy Plan (ERTE) - no recognition in the financial statements of the Group\n\nThe ERTE was implemented by the government of Spain from March 1, 2020 and is expected to run through to February 28, 2022. Under this plan, employment was temporarily suspended and those designated employees were paid directly by the government and there was no remittance made to the Group. The Group was obliged to continue to pay the associated social security costs.\n\nHad those designated employees not been temporarily suspended during 2021, the Group would have incurred further employee costs of \u20ac269 million (2020: \u20ac214 million).\n\n## The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) - recognised within Long-term borrowings\n\nOn December 23, 2020, Aer Lingus entered into a financing arrangement for \u20ac75 million. On March 27, 2021, Aer Lingus entered into a further financing arrangement to extend the total amount to \u20ac150 million.\n\n## The UK Export Finance (UKEF) - recognised within Long-term borrowings\n\nOn February 22, 2021, British Airways entered into a 5-year term loan Export Development Guarantee Facility of \u20ac2.3 billion (\u00a32.0 billion) underwritten by a syndicate of banks, with 80 per cent of the principal guaranteed by UKEF. The facility is unsecured.\n\nOn November 1, 2021, British Airways entered into a further 5-year term loan Export Development Guarantee Facility of \u20ac1.2 billion (\u00a31.0 billion) underwritten by a syndicate of banks, with 80 per cent of the principal guaranteed by UKEF. The facility is unsecured. At December 31, 2021 the facility remained undrawn.",

The change in policy has been adopted to better reflect the underlying management and operation of these schemes, while remaining in compliance with IAS 19. This change in accounting policy has been applied retrospectively to the consolidated financial statements and is detailed below.\n\nPreviously a discounted estimate of future administration costs was included as part of the APS and NAPS defined benefit obligations. Under the updated accounting policy, administration costs are now recognised as incurred and included within Employee costs in the Income statement. This change has had the effect of reducing the defined benefit obligation and increasing retained earnings at both December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020. It has in addition increased the charge to Employee costs and the Financing charge relating to pensions in the Income statement, as well as increased the Remeasurements of post-employment benefit obligations and Currency translation differences in the Statement of other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nThe impact of the changes in these accounting policies on the Consolidated income statement and the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 2020, as well as the Consolidated balance sheet at December 1, 2020 and January 1, 2020 are shown below:\n\n## Consolidated income statement (extract for the year to December 31, 2020)\n\n| \u20ac million                                 | Reported   | Adjustment - administration  costs   | Restated   |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|------------|\n| Total revenue                             | 7,806      | -                                    | 7,806      |\n| Employee costs                            | 3,560      | 25                                   | 3,585      |\n| Other expenditure on operations           | 11,672     | -                                    | 11,672     |\n| Total expenditure on operations           | 15,232     | 25                                   | 15,257     |\n| Operating loss                            | (7,426)    | (25)                                 | (7,451)    |\n| Net financing credit relating to pensions | 4          | 8                                    | 12         |\n| Other financing items                     | (384)      | -                                    | (384)      |\n| Other non-operating items                 | (4)        | -                                    | (4)        |\n| Total net non-operating costs             | (384)      | 8                                    | (376)      |\n| Loss before tax                           | (7,810)    | (17)                                 | (7,827)    |\n| Tax                                       | 887        | 5                                    | 892        |\n| Loss after tax for the year               | (6,923)    | (12)                                 | (6,935)    |\n\n## Consolidated statement of other comprehensive income (extract for the year to December 31, 2020)\n\n| \u20ac million                                                     | Reported   | Adjustment - administration  costs   | Restated   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|------------|\n| Items that may be classified subsequently to net profit       |            |                                      |            |\n| Currency translation differences                              | (192)      | (21)                                 | (213)      |\n| Other items that may be classified subsequently to net profit | (335)      | -                                    | (335)      |\n| Items that will not be reclassified to net profit             |            |                                      |            |\n| Remeasurements of post-employment benefit obligations         | (632)      | 36                                   | (596)      |\n| Other items that will not be reclassified to net profit       | (72)       | -                                    | (72)       |\n| Total other comprehensive loss for the year, net of tax       | (1,231)    | 15                                   | (1,216)    |\n| Loss after tax for the year                                   | (6,923)    | (12)                                 | (6,935)    |\n| Total comprehensive loss for the year                         | (8,154)    | 3                                    | (8,151)    |",

        "page_content": "## ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES\n\nThe performance of the Group is assessed using a number of alternative performance measures (APMs), some of which have been identified as key performance indicators of the Group. These measures are not defined under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), should be considered in addition to IFRS measurements, may differ to definitions given by regulatory bodies applicable to the Group and may differ to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. They are used to measure the outcome of the Group's strategy based on 'Unrivalled customer proposition', 'Value accretive and sustainable growth' and 'Efficiency and innovation'.\n\nDuring 2021, while the Group has made no changes to its pre-existing disclosures and treatments of APMs compared to those disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts for the year to December 31, 2020, the Group has added an additional APM regarding the Liquidity of the Group to reflect the increased level of scrutiny, internally and externally, on this measure as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed the basis on which the Management Committee and external parties monitor the performance of the Group. In this regard measures relating to Levered free cash flow, Net debt to EBITDA and Return on capital employed do not provide the level of meaningful additional information that they have done in the past. However, the Group continues to present these APMs for consistency and they will become more prominent and relevant subsequent to the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe definition of each APM, together with a reconciliation to the nearest measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is presented below.\n\n## a Loss after tax before exceptional items\n\nExceptional items are those that in management's view need to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to supplement the understanding the entity's financial performance. The Management Committee of the Group uses financial performance on a preexceptional basis to evaluate operating performance and to make strategic, financial and operational decisions, and externally because it is widely used by security analysts and investors in evaluating the performance of the Group between reporting periods and against other companies.\n\nExceptional items in the year to December 31, 2021 and 2020 include: significant discontinuation of hedge accounting; significant restructuring; significant changes in the long-term fleet plans that result in the impairment of fleet assets and the recognition of associated provisions; and legal settlements.\n\nThe table below reconciles the statutory Income statement to the Income statement before exceptional items of the Group:\n\n|                                                    | Year to December 31  Before   | Year to December 31  Before   | Year to December 31  Before   | Year to December 31  Before   | Year to December 31  Before   | Year to December 31  Before      |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| \u20ac million                                          | Statutory  2021               | Exceptional  items            | exceptional  items  2021      | Statutory  2020 1             | Exceptional  items            | Before  exceptional  items  2020 |\n| Passenger revenue 2                                | 5,835                         | 5                             | 5,830                         | 5,512                         | (62)                          | 5,574                            |\n| Cargo revenue                                      | 1,673                         | -

        "page_content": "## ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES CONTINUED\n\n- 1 Refer to notes 2 and 36 for the change in accounting policy relating to pension administration costs.\n\nThe rationale for each exceptional item is given below. In 2021 and 2020 all items were associated with the impact of COVID-19, except the settlement provision in relation to the charge in 2020 relating to the theft of customer data at British Airways (item 5).\n\n## 2 Discontinuation of hedge accounting\n\nThe exceptional credit of \u20ac159 million (2020: expense of \u20ac1,756 million) arising from a combination of the discontinuance of hedge accounting in the year to December 31, 2021 and the fair value movement on those relationships where hedge accounting was discontinued in the year to December 31, 2020, but for which the underlying hedging instrument had not matured at January 1, 2021. This was represented by credit of \u20ac162 million (2020: expense of \u20ac1,781 million) relating to fuel derivatives and an expense of \u20ac8 million (2020: credit of \u20ac87 million) related to the associated fuel foreign currency derivatives. The credit to Passenger revenue of \u20ac5 million (2020: charge of \u20ac62 million) relates to the discontinuation of hedge accounting of the associated foreign currency derivatives on forecast revenue.\n\nThe Group's risk management strategy is to build up these hedges gradually over a three-year period when the level of forecast passenger revenue and fuel consumption were higher than current expectations. Accordingly, the hedge accounting for these transactions has been discontinued and the credit recognised in the Income statement. The credit relating to revenue derivatives and fuel derivatives has been recorded in the Income statement within Passenger revenue and Fuel, oil and emission charges, respectively.\n\nThe cash outflow impact associated with the discontinuance of hedge accounting was \u20ac338 million in the year to December 31, 2021 (2020: \u20ac1,187 million).\n\nThe related tax charge was \u20ac26 million (2020: credit of \u20ac273 million), with \u20ac1 million (2020: credit of \u20ac11 million) being attributable to Passenger revenue and \u20ac25 million (2020: credit of \u20ac262 million) being attributable to Fuel, oil costs and emissions charges.\n\n## 3 Restructuring costs\n\nThe exceptional credit of \u20ac18 million (2020: charge of \u20ac319 million) relates to the reversal of restructuring provisions that have been released unutilised. In 2020, the exceptional charge (comprising \u20ac313 million of employee severance pay and \u20ac6 million of associated legal costs) represented the Group-wide restructuring programme, which right-sized the Group for the near term. While the restructuring programme affected all of the Group's operating companies, the exceptional charges in the year to December 31, 2020 related to British Airways, Aer Lingus, Iberia and LEVEL only, due to the status of negotiations with employees and their representatives. The exceptional credit (2020: charge) has been recorded within Employee costs (2020: Employee costs and Property, IT and other costs). There has been no cash flow impact relating to the exceptional restructuring credit in 2021.\n\nThe related tax charge was \u20ac3 million (2020: credit of \u20ac53 million).\n\n## 4 Engineering and other aircraft costs\n\nThe exceptional credit of \u20ac7 million (2020: charge of \u20ac108 million) relates to the reversal of contractual lease provisions for those aircraft in Vueling that have been stood up during 2021, where the estimated costs to fulfil the hand back conditions will be recognised over the remaining operating activity of the aircraft. In 2020, the exceptional charge included an inventory write down expense of \u20ac71 million and a charge relating to contractual lease provisions of \u20ac37 million. The inventory write down expense represented those expendable inventories that, given the asset impairments, were no longer expected to be utilised. The charge relating to the recognition of contractual lease provisions represented the estimation of the additional cost to fulfil the hand back conditions associated with the leased aircraft that were permanently stood down and impaired. The exceptional credit (2020: charge) is recorded within Engineering and other aircraft costs. There has been no cash flow impact relating to the exceptional credit in 2021.\n\nThere is no tax impact on the recognition of this credit (2020: credit of \u20ac14 million).\n\n## 5 Settlement provision\n\nThe exceptional charge of \u20ac22 million recognised in 2020 represented the fine issued by the Information Commissioner's Office in the United Kingdom, relating to the theft of customer data at British Airways in 2018. The exceptional charge was been recorded within Property, IT and other costs in the Income statement, with a corresponding amount recorded in Provisions.\n\nThere was no tax impact on the recognition of this charge\n\n## 6 Impairment of fleet and associated assets\n\nThe exceptional impairment reversal of \u20ac21 million includes an amount of \u20ac14 million relating to the reversal of aircraft impairment and an amount of \u20ac7 million relating to the reversal of engine impairment. The aircraft impairment reversal relates to four Airbus A320 aircraft in Vueling, previously permanently stood down in the fourth quarter of 2020, being stood up in the third quarter of 2021 following the successful slot allocation at Paris Orly and the resultant increased capacity. The engine impairment reversal relates to certain engines which had been fully impaired during 2020 having been leased to a third party in the fourth quarter of 2021. Of the exceptional impairment reversal, \u20ac8 million was recorded within Property, plant and equipment relating to owned aircraft and \u20ac12 million was recorded within Right of use assets relating to leased aircraft. The exceptional impairment reversal is recorded within Depreciation, amortisation and impairment in the Income statement.\n\nThe total exceptional impairment expense of \u20ac856 million recorded in 2020 was represented by an impairment of fleet assets of \u20ac837 million and an impairment of other assets of \u20ac19 million. The fleet impairment related to 82 aircraft, their associated engines and rotable inventories that had been stood down permanently and 2 further aircraft which were impaired down to their recoverable value at December 31, 2020, which included 32 Boeing 747 aircraft, 23 Airbus A320 aircraft, 15 Airbus A340 aircraft, 4 Airbus A330-200 aircraft, 2 Airbus A318 aircraft, 1 Airbus A321 aircraft, 1 Airbus A319 aircraft, 2 Boeing 777200 aircraft and 4 Embraer E170 aircraft. Of the fleet impairment, \u20ac676 million was recorded within Property, plant and equipment relating to owned aircraft and \u20ac161 million was recorded within Right of use assets relating to leased aircraft.\n\nIncluded within the impairment of other assets was an amount of \u20ac15 million relating to the landing rights, classified within Intangible assets, that were held by the operations of LEVEL in Paris. Following the decision to cease the operations of LEVEL in Paris, these landing rights were recorded at the lower of their carrying value and their recoverable value.\n\nThe exceptional impairment (reversals)/expenses were recorded within Depreciation, amortisation and impairment in the Income statement. There has been no cash flow impact relating to the exceptional impairment reversals in 2021.\n\nThe related tax charge was \u20ac1 million (2020: credit of \u20ac123 million).\n\n## 7 Air Europa termination agreement\n\nThe exceptional charge of \u20ac75 million represents the amount agreed with Globalia to terminate the agreements signed on November 4, 2019 and January 20, 2021 under which Iberia had agreed to acquire the issued share capital of Air Europa. The exceptional charge has been recorded within Other non-operating charges in the Income statement and was settled prior to December 31, 2021.\n\nThe related tax credit was \u20ac5 million.",

As fuel costs can vary with commodity prices, the Group monitors fuel and non-fuel costs individually. Within non-fuel costs are the costs associated with generating Other revenue, which typically do not represent the costs of transporting passengers or cargo and instead represent the costs of handling and maintenance for other airlines, non-flight products in BA Holidays and costs associated with other miscellaneous non-flight revenue streams. Airline non-fuel costs per ASK is defined as total operating expenditure before exceptional items, less fuel, oil costs and emission charges and less non-flight specific costs divided by total available seat kilometres (ASKs), and is shown on a constant currency basis.\n\n2021\n\nccy\n\n| \u20ac million                                              | Note   | Reported   | adjustment   | 2021 ccy   | 2020 1   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------|--------------|------------|----------|\n| Total expenditure on operations                        | a      | 11,220     | 41           | 11,261     | 15,257   |\n| (Add)/less: exceptional items in operating expenditure | a      | (200)      |              | (200)      | 2,999    |\n| Less: fuel, oil costs and emission charges             | a      | 1,935      | 59           | 1,994      | 2,041    |\n| Non-fuel costs                                         |        | 9,485      | (18)         | 9,467      | 10,217   |\n| Less: Non-flight specific costs                        |        | 815        | 12           | 827        | 851      |\n| Airline non-fuel costs                                 |        | 8,670      | (30)         | 8,640      | 9,366    |\n| ASKs (millions)                                        |        | 121,965    |              | 121,965    | 113,195  |\n| Airline non-fuel unit costs per ASK (\u20ac cents)          |        | 7.11       |              | 7.08       | 8.27     |\n\n## d Levered free cash flow (KPI)\n\nLevered free cash flow represents the cash generated, and the financing raised, by the businesses before shareholder returns and is defined as the net increase in cash and cash equivalents taken from the Cash flow statement, adjusting for movements in Current interest-bearing deposits, less the cash inflows from the rights issue and adding back the cash outflows associated with dividends paid and the acquisition of treasury shares.

This measure is used to monitor the Group's leverage and to assess financial headroom against internal and external security analyst and investor benchmarks.\n\nNet debt is defined as long-term borrowings (both current and non-current), less cash, cash equivalents and current interest-bearing deposits. Net debt excludes supply chain financing arrangements which are classified within trade payables (note 22).\n\nEBITDA is defined as operating profit before exceptional items, interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and impairment.\n\nThe Group believes that this additional measure, which is used internally to assess the Group's financial capacity, is useful to the users of the financial statements in helping them to see how the Group's financial capacity has changed over the year.

RoIC is defined as EBITDA, less fleet depreciation adjusted for inflation, depreciation of other property, plant and equipment, and amortisation of software intangibles, divided by average invested capital and is expressed as a percentage.\n\nInvested capital is defined as the average of property, plant and equipment and software intangible assets over a 12-month period between the opening and closing net book values. The fleet aspect of property, plant and equipment is inflated over the average age of the fleet to approximate the replacement cost of the associated assets.\n\n2021\n\n| \u20ac million                                                       | Note   |         | 2020 1   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|----------|\n| EBITDA                                                          | e      | (1,017) | (2,291)  |\n| Less: Fleet depreciation multiplied by inflation adjustment     |        | (1,777) | (1,921)  |\n| Less: Other property, plant and equipment depreciation          |        | (257)   | (258)    |\n| Less: Software intangible amortisation                          |        | (167)   | (151)    |\n|                                                                 |        | (3,218) | (4,621)  |\n| Invested capital                                                |        |         |          |\n| Average fleet value 3                                           | 13     | 15,241  | 16,020   |\n| Less: average progress payments 4                               | 13     | (729)   | (1,117)  |\n| Fleet book value less progress payments                         |        | 14,512  | 14,903   |\n| Inflation adjustment 2                                          |        | 1.16    | 1.18     |\n|                                                                 |        | 16,893  | 17,520   |\n| Average net book value of other property, plant and equipment 5 | 13     | 2,106   | 2,329    |\n| Average net book value of software intangible assets 6          | 17     | 640     | 652      |\n| Total invested capital                                          |        | 19,639  | 20,501   |\n| Return on Invested Capital                                      |        | (16.4)% | (22.5)%  |",

The Group reviews the results, including revenue and operating costs at constant rates of exchange (abbreviated to 'ccy'). The Group calculates these financial measures at constant rates of exchange based on a retranslation, at prior year exchange rates, of the current year's results of the Group. Although the Group does not believe that these measures are a substitute for IFRS measures, the Group does believe that such results excluding the impact of currency fluctuations year-on-year provide additional useful information to investors regarding the Group's operating performance on a constant currency basis. Accordingly, the financial measures at constant currency within the discussion of the Group Financial review should be read in conjunction with the information provided in the Group financial statements.\n\nThe following table represents the main average and closing exchange rates for the reporting periods. Where 2021 figures are stated at a constant currency basis, they have applied the 2020 rates stated below:\n\n## Foreign exchange rates\n\n|                             |   Weighted average |   Weighted average |   Closing |   Closing |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------|-----------|\n|                             |            2021    |            2020    |   2021    |   2020    |\n| Pound sterling to euro      |               1.15 |               1.13 |      1.18 |      1.1  |\n| Euro to US dollar           |               1.2  |               1.13 |      1.13 |      1.22 |\n| Pound sterling to US dollar |               1.38 |               1.27 |      1.33 |      1.35 |\n\n## h Liquidity\n\nThe Management Committee monitors liquidity in order to assess the resilience of the Group to adverse events and uncertainty and develops funding initiatives to maintain this resilience.\n\nLiquidity is used by analysts, investors and other users of the financial statements as a measure to the financial health and resilience of the Group.\n\nLiquidity is defined as Cash and cash equivalents plus Current interest-bearing deposits, plus Committed general undrawn facilities and committed aircraft undrawn facilities.\n\n| \u20ac million                             | Note   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents             | 21     | 7,892  | 5,774  |\n| Current interest-bearing deposits     | 21     | 51     | 143    |\n| Committed general undrawn facilities  | 27f    | 2,864  | 905    |\n| Committed aircraft undrawn facilities | 27f    | 1,126  | 1,180  |\n| Overdrafts and other facilities       | 27f    | 53     | 52     |\n| Total liquidity                       |        | 11,986 | 8,054  |",

These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts. By their nature, they involve risk and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements.\n\nForward-looking statements often use words such as 'expects', 'may', 'will', 'could', 'should', 'intends', 'plans', 'predicts', 'envisages' or 'anticipates' or other words of similar meaning. They include, without limitation, any and all projections relating to the results of operations and financial conditions of International Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A. and its subsidiary undertakings from time to time (the 'Group'), as well as plans and objectives for future operations, expected future revenues, financing plans, expected expenditure and divestments relating to the Group, discussions of the Group's business plan, and our assumptions, expectations, objectives and resilience with respect to climate scenarios. All forward-looking statements in this report are based upon information known to the Group on the date of this report and speak as of the date of this report. Other than in accordance with its legal or regulatory obligations, the Group does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect any changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\n\nActual results may differ from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements in this report as a result of any number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including, but not limited to, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainties about its impact and duration, many of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond the control of the Group, and it is not reasonably possible to itemise each item. Accordingly, readers of this report are/uni00A0cautioned against relying on forwardlooking statements. Further information on the primary risks of the business and the Group's risk management process is set out in the Risk management and principal risk/uni00A0factors section in this report. All forward-looking statements made on/uni00A0or after the date of this report and attributable to IAG are expressly qualified in their entirety by the primary risks set out in that section. Many/uni00A0of these risks are, and will be, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and any further disruption to the global airline industry and/uni00A0economic environment as a result.",
