All while continuing to be challenged by ongoing COVID disruption. Importantly, our teams have embraced our new operating model and the greater ownership and accountability it provides.\n\nWe remained disciplined and true to our strategy, securing and converting projects in global gateway cities. We also established new investment partnerships that are expected to contribute to the acceleration in development activity and grow our funds under management.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Chairman's Report\n\nAs an international real estate group operating in targeted gateway cities globally, Lendlease is well positioned to understand and respond to the changing nature of cities. Cities have always evolved, but will remain the engine of economic, social and cultural life.\n\nThroughout the period our gateway cities remained resilient despite emerging geopolitical issues, the lingering community health and social instability of the pandemic, and the continuing impacts of climate change. /uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nOur operations have been impacted by these challenges, but the organisation has been able to anticipate, mitigate and adapt to reset our business for future growth.\n\n## First term as Chairman\n\nNow that I am in my second term as Chairman, I have re/flected on the progress we have made over the last three years.\n\nOn becoming Chair, my immediate priority was to lead the Board in a strategic review of the business, which resulted in the Engineering and Services businesses being deemed non core. Plans were enacted to separate them from the Group, with both businesses now divested.\n\nSimultaneously, a comprehensive review of the Board's governance practices identi/fied opportunities to enhance the e/ffectiveness of Board processes. Changes were implemented to increase the focus of the Board on strategy, reputation, customer and our people.\n\nTwo new directors, Robert Welanetz and Nicholas Collishaw, strengthened the Board's experience in real estate investment and development. Nick, along with David Craig and Nicola Wake/field Evans, are seeking re-election at the 2022 Annual General Meeting. The Board remains committed to appointing directors with deep experience in our core sectors and expects to appoint an additional Non executive Director in FY23.\n\nTony Lombardo was appointed Global Chief Executive O/fficer in June 2021 and oversaw executive leadership changes and the refresh of the Group's strategy and organisational structure. The strategy to leverage our competitive advantage in the urban renewal of large-scale, mixed-\n\nuse projects and to grow the investments platform remains at the centre of our /five year roadmap. A streamlined operating structure supports the execution of the strategy, with increased transparency in our reporting.\n\nWe acknowledge it has been a di/fficult\n\nperiod for our securityholders. On behalf of the Board, I recognise we have more to do in rebuilding con/fidence. However, the decisions we have made in the last few years have made a di/fference. The Group is well on the way to meeting its medium term investment and development targets, while maintaining delivery excellence in construction. I am con/fident this will lead to future cash generation, which should deliver sustainable growth in securityholder value over time.\n\n## Health and Safety\n\nThe health and safety of our people, our subcontractors and the communities in which we operate remains our number one priority. We are deeply saddened by the fatality of a subcontractor on one of our construction sites in New York, in an area under subcontractor management. Our sincerest condolences are extended to the family and colleagues of the young man who lost his life. It is a sombre reminder of the importance of our focus on safety for all people who interact with our places. It is also why Lendlease goes well beyond industry practice for reporting fatalities.\n\nOur safety culture, which instils pride among our employees, is exempli/fied by the implementation of innovative solutions. For example, the improvements we have made to the perimeter screens on steel framed buildings has set the industry standard in reducing the risk of falls from height for workers and materials. Further details on health and safety are provided on page 34 of this Report./uni00A0\n\n## Financial result\n\nLendlease reported a Statutory Loss after Tax of $99m. This comprised a Core operating pro/fit of $276m, a loss for Non operating items of $333m and a Non core loss of $42m. While disappointing, the outcome re/flects the challenging global operating environment and the decisions we /flagged to the market in August 2021 that we would be taking to reset the\n\nGroup for future growth and the refocus of our digital activities.\n\nCore operating pro/fit of $276m was down from $377m in the prior year with lower Development segment earnings, in part due to a revised approach to joint venture arrangements, more than o/ffsetting a strong recovery in the Investments segment. While the /financial performance was subdued, a recovery in operating momentum is expected to result in improved /financial performance over coming years. Full year distributions of 16 cents per security re/flects a payout ratio of 40 per cent on Core operating earnings per security.\n\nOur refreshed executive leadership team has simpli/fied the business, created a leaner organisation and improved expected returns as a result of a reduction in annualised overhead costs of approximately $170m and redirecting capital. Restructuring costs associated with these changes were $342m after tax and include allowances for employee redundancies and tenancy exit costs and development impairments on a small number of underperforming projects. The impairment of intangibles relating to our Digital investments was $55m after tax./uni00A0\n\nThe Non core loss primarily re/flects costs associated with the exit of the Services business. We have maintained provisions we consider to be appropriate to complete our share of the retained Melbourne Metro project and for potential warranties associated with the now exited Engineering and Services businesses./uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nThe Group entered FY23 in a strong /financial position with a healthy pipeline of work, cash and cash equivalents of $1.3b and gearing of 7.3 per cent. The strength of our balance sheet positions the Group to increase development activity and grow the investments platform.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nBusinesses must have a clear purpose aligned to a long term strategy for shared value creation to achieve sustainable success. This is re/flected in our purpose statement, creating places where communities thrive. Living our purpose means we help to create the best places for customers and the communities we serve, inspire our people, preserve our",

Our goal is not only to eliminate the use of fossil fuels across our business but also help transform the real estate sector. Decarbonisation mandates have been implemented as we work towards our Net Zero scope 1 and 2 emissions targets by 2025. Initiatives include the use of renewable diesel, the design of all electric buildings, and the switch to 100 per cent renewable electricity for operating assets in Europe. We have also made progress on scope 3 emissions through various supply chain partnerships. Further details on sustainability are provided on page 42 of this Report.\n\nFrom a social sustainability perspective, we have created more than $100m of social value since launching our target of $250m by 2025 two years ago. Our 'shared value' partnerships focus on creating measurable social value by addressing the needs of communities. These include: our partnership with the Australian Red Cross in supporting the delivery of cultural programs, health and wellbeing initiatives and disaster preparedness in remote Australian communities; and Programma 2121 which o/ffers training and paid internships for\n\no/ffenders in the Italian prison system. In addition to our shared value partnerships, we continued to embed commitments to First Nations engagement through our Elevate Reconciliation Action Plan.\n\n## Board program\n\nThe Board program, in addition to its regular cadence of meetings this year, expanded to re/flect the broader range of both operational and strategic issues which required oversight./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nWhile some engagement activities were restricted by the pandemic, the Board was able to assess our Asian operations in person while other parts of the program were maintained virtually. This enabled the Board to engage in programs in all four operating regions including site tours (physical and virtual), project reviews, interactive employee roundtables, leadership discussions and engagement with external stakeholders. The Board /firmly believes these activities, in addition to our formal meetings, are critical for corporate governance. More detail on aspects of the Board's engagement is provided on page 72.\n\n## Looking to the future\n\nFollowing a year focused on resetting the organisation and rebuilding momentum,\n\nthe Group has a clear pathway to meet its /financial and operational targets by FY24. We expect FY23 to be a recovery year with further operating momentum and improved /financial performance.\n\nThe recovery of global gateway cities is increasingly evident and is re/flected in the operating momentum across the Group. Our investment partners share this conviction with a record amount of development Work in Progress, supported by our construction delivery capability.\n\nThe external environment will remain challenging, notably geopolitics and monetary policy settings. The Board will closely monitor these, including the potential impacts on our supply chain, broader in/flation and implications for our products and services. /uni00A0\n\nI would like to thank my Board colleagues and the entire Lendlease team for their continued dedication in navigating the challenges of a global pandemic and the resetting of the organisation. We are now well positioned to create long term value for securityholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nM J Ullmer, AO Chairman",

        "page_content": "## Global Chief Executive Officer's Report\n\nMy thanks to our securityholders, customers, partners, people and the community for your continued support.\n\nDuring the past year our operating environment remained challenging. COVID continued to impact our regions and geopolitical uncertainty generated widespread volatility in global markets.\n\nDespite these headwinds, we made signi/ficant progress in resetting our company for future growth. We entered the new /financial year with a renewed sense of optimism, re/flected in solid operating momentum across the Group./uni00A0\n\n## Business renewal\n\nDelivering the very best real estate products and services drives our purpose. Just as the cities in which we operate undergo constant renewal, so must Lendlease.\n\nIn 2021, I announced our /five-year roadmap: Reset; Create; Thrive to enhance the way we operate to deliver sustained performance.\n\nThis year, we implemented the /first phase, Reset . A new streamlined company structure generated more than $160m in ongoing cost savings and the refreshed management team and simpli/fied operating model has enabled more nimble decision making and increased accountability.\n\nSeveral portfolio divestments supported the focus on our core business and strengthened the Group's balance sheet. More than $1b of capital was recycled including the exit of the Services business, the reduction of our investment in Retirement Living and the introduction of a partner into our Military Housing portfolio.\n\nWe also committed to enhancing our /financial and non /financial disclosure, and providing greater visibility on our contribution to economic, environmental, and social value creation. All three are critical to restoring securityholder con/fidence and value.\n\n## Responding to real estate trends with a focused business model/uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nThe COVID pandemic has had a profound impact on all facets of life. Following its onset, we remained steadfast in our conviction that cities would endure and continue to be the centrepiece of modern society for generations to come. The past couple of years have taught us that the value of human connection, and a sense of belonging, is immeasurable.\n\nWe move to the Create phase of our roadmap in better shape to deliver places and precincts that draw people in while also addressing urban challenges.\n\nWe aim to be an investment led company that responds to continued strong institutional investor demand for real estate. We are scaling up our investment and asset management teams to further grow our product o/ffering, enhance the value of the assets we manage and provide investors with recurring income streams.\n\nOur teams will pursue resilient and sustainable development schemes that leverage our capabilities in placemaking and enhance urban connectivity. The workplace of the future needs to adapt to both changing employee expectations and employers needs for talent retention, collaboration and fostering corporate culture.\n\nCentral city residential markets have begun to recover strongly with residents looking for improved amenity and additional spaces to connect.\n\nIn the construction sector, our goal remains to be a market leader, maintaining the right capability to support operational excellence. We will be more selective by targeting customers whose values align to ours.\n\n## Financial and operating performance\n\nAs foreshadowed at the beginning of this /financial year, addressing legacy issues, and combating the ongoing impacts of a global pandemic suppressed our /financial performance. This was re/flected in a substantial statutory loss and a modest core pro/fit. However, /financial performance rebounded in the second half, providing momentum into FY23. /uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nThe Investments segment performed above target, underpinned by capital recycling. Funds under management grew to $44b and $11b of investment partnerships were established during the year. This includes our pivot to acquiring existing secondary assets on market that utilise our asset management capabilities./uni00A0\n\nDevelopment segment returns were below target due to ongoing COVID challenges, severe weather impacts on Communities settlements and our revised joint venture structuring approach which means pro/fit recognition should more closely align earnings with development milestones and cash going forward. Projects available to start total $42b following planning progress. Commencements exceeded completions, taking Work in Progress to a record $18.4b.\n\nConstruction segment pro/fit was at the lower end of the target range. Ongoing COVID and global supply chain disruptions, along with challenging weather events all impacted our productivity during the year. The construction workbook remains healthy at $10.5b.\n\nRefer to the Performance and Outlook on page 56 for a detailed analysis of our /financial and operating performance.\n\n## Our principles drive an ambition to make a di/fference\n\n## A culture of care\n\nMaking sure people arrive home safely each day continues to be our highest priority. Tragically, a sub contractor on one of our projects in New York lost his life in September 2021. We once again extend our deepest condolences to the man's family, friends and colleagues and everyone impacted by this event.\n\nWe continue to strive to eliminate incident and injury wherever we operate using our refreshed Global Minimum Requirements, or GMRs, as the cornerstone of our global approach to health and safety./uni00A0\n\nWe are extending our culture of care to encompass psychological safety to further support employees.",

While more factors\n\nare within our control going forward, we will be in/fluenced by the external environment of higher in/flation and interest rates.\n\nThe Group remains on track to meet our targets of more than $8b in development completions per annum by FY24 and funds under management of $70b by FY26. We will also maintain delivery capability to support both our integrated projects and construction clients. I believe this will create lasting securityholder returns while delivering on our commitment of leadership in health, safety, and sustainability.\n\nImportantly, we have the capacity to fund our share of this signi/ficant growth potential while maintaining our /financial leverage within target range.\n\nMy thanks to our Board, my management team and the people of Lendlease for your unwavering commitment.\n\nFinally, to our securityholders I restate our commitment to restore securityholder returns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTony Lombardo Global Chief Executive O/fficer",

This purpose centres on forming vibrant and enduring communities that contribute to a more liveable and sustainable future.\n\nWe are committed to creating value for all those who interact with us and to making a positive contribution, beyond just the places we create.\n\nThe actions we take are driven by an understanding that every decision we make has an impact and must be made in collaboration. Working in partnership with a myriad of stakeholders, we are helping to solve some of the biggest challenges confronting people, cities and the planet.\n\n## Strategy\n\nThe cornerstone of our strategy is to create the best urban precincts in targeted global gateway cities. Our point of di/fference is our proven expertise in placemaking and delivering major urban projects through our integrated business model, backed by our /financial strength.\n\nOur strategy is underpinned by an ethos that long term value creation is maximised by achieving social, environmental and economic outcomes. This involves collaborating with customers, investment partners, governments and the communities within which we operate.\n\nA key di/fferentiator from other industry players is our end-to-end capability across all aspects of real estate: from concept and planning to design and delivery, through to funding and investment management.

The past year has seen a signi/ficant resetting of the organisation as our people and our /financial capital has been directed towards leveraging the Group's core capabilities, particularly across urban projects and our investments platform. We have also simpli/fied our structure, exited non-core businesses and reduced our capital in Retirement Living.\n\nOur partnership approach has driven signi/ficant growth in our investments platform. Future growth will be underpinned by the investment grade product we expect to create from the development pipeline. In addition, we have the appetite and global capability to launch new products alongside our investment partners.\n\nWe are targeting invested capital to increase to $6b in each of the Investments and Development segments by FY26.\n\nWe enter the Create phase of our roadmap with con/fidence in our strategic direction. The achievement of two key medium term operational targets;\n\ndevelopment completions of more than $8b per annum from FY24 and funds under management (FUM) of $70b by FY26, remain on track.\n\nThe size of our development pipeline, investment in capability to execute at scale and the resilience of the global cities in which we have a presence, provides us with con/fidence in achieving our development target.\n\nInvestor appetite for the geographically diverse and sustainable product in our development pipeline, as well as deep relationships with global investment partners, underpin our conviction in reaching our FUM target.\n\nOur global operating model provides a framework for implementing best practice consistently, while empowering our teams to lead and innovate. To support our strategic objectives, we are investing in key capabilities with the longer term in mind.\n\n## Resilience\n\nWe understand cities will need to become more a/ffordable, inclusive and sustainable with a greater focus on transport links, security and workplace /flexibility. Our placemaking skills are already adapting to these challenges and the associated changes in consumer, corporate and government behaviour.\n\nOur strategy has been designed to be resilient.

Human interaction drives communities, culture and commerce.\n\nIn last year's Annual Report, we highlighted the importance of cities. The past year has only rea/ffirmed our conviction. The value to society of 'in person' interaction underpins the dominant role that cities play in the global economy. This should come as no surprise given the thousands of years of evolution that rewarded human connection and collaboration.\n\nThe pre-eminence of cities has not been undermined by successive waves of technology. In fact, technological change has enhanced knowledge that is best dispersed through close and personal interaction.\n\nHistory is marked with signi/ficant periodic plagues and pandemics, of which COVID is the most recent. Despite these and other challenges, including natural disasters and economic cycles, cities continue to rebound.\n\n## Bene/fits of agglomeration\n\nThe bene/fits of agglomeration remain as compelling today as they have ever been.\n\nThe extensive social infrastructure and amenity that cities o/ffer make them people magnets. Population density provides the scale to support the best educational institutions and healthcare facilities as well as cultural attractions and mass transit. The strong desire for social interaction and experience spurs vibrancy across the retail, tourism and hospitality/uni00A0sectors.\n\nOur gateway cities strategy is founded on the premise that the most desirable cities will continue to be the driving force of economic, social and cultural life.\n\n## Resilient cities adapt\n\nCOVID, declared a pandemic in early March 2020, has been the greatest global threat this century. The ensuing lockdowns and isolation threw the primary purpose of cities, that is interaction and collaboration, into disarray. This had signi/ficant rami/fications for the way societies live, work and play.\n\nTop: Sydney: Artist's impression, Victoria Cross over station development. Opposite: Boston: Clippership Wharf.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNearly three years since the onset of the pandemic, cities are springing back to life. There is mounting evidence of a return to normality, or what may be described as the new normal, given an acceleration in some societal trends that were already well underway.\n\nHow we live: Central city residential markets witnessed the fastest recovery of all sectors in terms of occupancy and rents. Approximately one per cent of residential properties are vacant across New York City, a record low. There are similar trends in inner parts of London with asking rents up 25 per cent from their low point. Inner city vacancy rates across the East Coast cities of Australia are at or below pre-COVID levels.\n\nHow we play: The rebound in leisure and hospitality has been strong. Visitations across retail centres in our global gateway cities are trending towards 2019 levels and restaurant reservations are approximately 10 per cent above pre-COVID levels. Cultural and sporting events have returned with theatres playing to full houses and major sports taking place in front of capacity crowds. The recovery underway in international\n\ntourism is expected to further bene/fit gateway cities.\n\nHow we work: The return to o/ffice lags most other aspects of global cities' recovery from COVID. While mobility data is much improved, it remains markedly lower than prior to the pandemic. CBD workplace attendance is 10-30 per cent below pre-COVID levels across our gateway cities. We expect a gradual recovery to continue.

In 2009 we committed that Barangaroo South would be a carbon neutral precinct. That vision was realised in 2020, with Barangaroo South recognised as the /first carbon neutral precinct in Australia.\n\nA recent Oxford University-Protiviti 1 survey revealed that business leaders share a very positive view on the increasing importance of cities given their concentrated pools of labour, skills, new talent and knowledge. Almost two thirds believe that by 2030 the role of cities will be more important for their businesses, compared with just six per cent who believe they will be less important.\n\nThe survey results indicate that /first tier, larger and specialised urban economies will bene/fit most and will increase in importance for business operations. This aligns with our strategy to have a presence in gateway cities that demonstrate the most favourable prospects for long term outperformance.\n\n## The upside of urban renewal /uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nA holistic approach to urban renewal is critical for cities to adapt and become more productive, liveable, a/ffordable and sustainable. Higher urban density is linked to improved:\n\n- \u00b7 Economic performance through higher wages, more innovation and lower costs of public service provision\n- \u00b7 Wellbeing via social connection, as evidenced by growing mental health challenges experienced through the pandemic isolation\n- \u00b7 Environmental outcomes via lower pollution and energy consumption.\n\nTransport infrastructure typically determines the urban form of cities and shapes their evolution - think of the two hubs of New York City with Downtown evolving around the port and Midtown shaped by the rail terminals.\n\nSydney is currently in the throes of a rail infrastructure boom with the network set to grow to 338 stations. This provides for a more rapid evolution of the urban environment to create a more liveable, productive and sustainable city.\n\n- 1.

Rethinking Station Precincts - How to create great precincts around rail stations and why this matters for Sydney: Committee for Sydney, April 2022.\n\nA recent Committee of Sydney study 2 indicated that station precinct development could provide almost half of the new dwellings required to meet Sydney's expected population growth over the next two decades.\n\nIt is these types of opportunities across our targeted gateway cities that play to our strengths. Collaboration among government, the private sector and local communities is a must to achieve desired outcomes.\n\nOur global reach, placemaking capabilities, integrated business model and partnering approach all combine to provide a unique skill set.",

Large multi-stage sites that provide the opportunity to craft mixed use precincts is where the breadth of our skills are applied to greatest e/ffect.\n\nOur partnership approach with a demonstrated value proposition has been recognised by being awarded and completing many extraordinary projects. A global platform with locally based real estate expertise has few direct competitors and is di/fficult to replicate. Our current portfolio of 21 major urban projects spans nine gateway cities./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\n## Placemaking a key di/fferentiator/uni00A0\n\n/uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nThrough the places we design, build and curate, we aim to create destinations where people want to be. Improved liveability, environmental sustainability, inclusion, a/ffordability, connectedness, wellbeing and a sense of community are important elements we incorporate to create 'place'.\n\nPlacemaking presents a unique opportunity to generate lasting and positive value for a city and its communities through the way people connect, learn and live. Great places are the product of both physical and experiential attributes which are shaped, delivered and maintained through ongoing curation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur completed projects, along with the current pipeline, provide a suite of proof points of our placemaking credentials and our contribution to urban renewal:\n\n## Waterfront development\n\n- \u00b7 Barangaroo South, Sydney\n- \u00b7 Lakeshore East, Chicago\n- \u00b7 Clippership Wharf, Boston\n- \u00b7 1 Java Street, New York/uni00A0 /uni00A0/uni00A0\n\n## Transport orientated districts\n\n- \u00b7 Paya Lebar Quarter, Singapore\n- \u00b7 International Quarter London\n- \u00b7 Victoria Cross Over Station Development, Sydney\n- \u00b7 Euston Station, London\n\n## Innovation districts\n\n- \u00b7 Melbourne Connect\n- \u00b7 Milan Innovation District\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n>$8b\n\nharvesting the immense potential of our secured pipeline provides ample opportunity to sustain annual completions",

We'll continue to pursue opportunities with an emphasis on replenishing our pipeline in Asian and Australian cities.\n\nOur pipeline is categorised by three phases: In conversion; Masterplanned; and Work in Progress. These phases provide an indication of the likely timing of project commencements given the timeline required to take a project from origination through to completion.\n\n## In Conversion\n\nApproximately half of the pipeline, or $57b, is 'In Conversion'. That is, it has been secured but is yet to receive masterplanning approval from the relevant authorities. As a result, it is not in the potential pool for commencement. The timeframe to achieve masterplanning is typically two to three years from the date the project was secured. On smaller projects, the conversion period may be far shorter./uni00A0\n\n## Masterplanned\n\nApproximately $42b of the pipeline has masterplan approvals. The focus for this stage is: obtaining individual building consents; launching products to secure income via pre-sales and pre-leasing; and working with our partners on investment opportunities that /fit their mandates./uni00A0\n\n## Work in Progress\n\nThe pipeline moves into 'Work in Progress' once delivery of an asset commences. We currently have $18b of Work in Progress which puts us on track to meet our more than $8b completion target in FY24. Maintaining this level of completions is likely to require Work in Progress of more than $20b. /uni00A0/uni00A0\n\n## Resilient product and places\n\nGateway cities are our future, and our portfolio of projects has improved resilience and liveability in mind. We believe well located and high quality product within amenity rich environments will endure. While most of the development pipeline is comprised of mixed use precincts, the key product categories are:\n\n- \u00b7 Apartments for sale c.$38b: a/ffordable to luxury\n- \u00b7 Apartments for rent c.$28b: o/ffering customers the opportunity to live where they want and rent like they own\n- \u00b7 Commercial c.$35b: CBD o/ffices, transport hubs, innovation districts, life sciences and data centres\n- \u00b7 Communities c.$16b: key population growth corridors in Australia\n\n## The evolving workplace\n\nThe most signi/ficant COVID induced change across our real estate platform has been the evolution of the workplace. The working experience since the start of 2020 has demonstrated the capability, and in many cases, preference to partly work from home.\n\nThe employee value proposition, heightened by a tight labour market, is becoming more important for employers to attract and retain the best talent. Employees increasingly prioritise a workplace that is well connected, humancentric, socially aware, environmentally proactive, and amenity rich with a focus on health and wellbeing./uni00A0\n\nWe believe that highly sustainable and digitally enabled workplaces in well connected locations, will remain in demand. Our focus is to create workplaces that facilitate relationships, collaboration and/uni00A0enhance organisational\n\nculture. Occupiers and investors are likely to pay a premium for this product.\n\n## Funding the pipeline\n\nWe aim to work our capital harder as development activity accelerates towards, and beyond, our target of more than $8b of annual completions. More investment partnerships are planned, facilitating greater capital e/fficiency to fund our share of the incremental Work in Progress.\n\nThe proportions of recent commencements funded by investment partners are:\n\n- \u00b7 1 Java Street, New York: 80%\n- \u00b7 Data Centre, Tokyo: 80%/uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0\n- \u00b7 60 Guest Street, Boston: 75%\n- \u00b7 Certis Cisco Centre, Singapore: 51%\n\nOur expectation is that approximately $6b of invested capital is required to consistently fund our share of completions, compared with a current invested capital balance of $5.4b.\n\nThese investment partner funding strategies complement an already capital e/fficient business model. Approximately 90 per cent of our development pipeline has been secured on capital e/fficient terms. It protects downside risks for both ourselves and our investment partners, while providing the /flexibility to adjust production as market conditions vary. This unique feature of our development platform enables $2.8b of capital in land and infrastructure to control our $117b development pipeline.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It starts with disciplined origination that incorporates thorough market assessments and aligns our value proposition with potential opportunities. Diversity by client, contract type and sector forms part of this origination strategy.\n\nSubstantial de-risking takes place prior to commencement of construction. Formulating detailed project briefs, which is our key project management skill, involves selecting a team with the optimal skill set for the project. Depending on contract type, we then go into product design and cost planning./uni00A0\n\nThe delivery phase is about construction management, production and program controls, functional reviews and reporting. Post construction, we apply a rigorous commissioning process for a smooth transition to the client.\n\nWe remain disciplined with our approach to winning work and strive to maintain an industry leading approach to risk management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur construction capability plays a critical role in the delivery of our urban projects.\n\n## Partnership approach with supply chain\n\nWorking collaboratively with our partners is essential to mitigating supply chain risk and achieving our sustainability targets. The signi/ficant disruption caused by COVID and geopolitical uncertainty has emphasised the importance of the supply chain in the successful delivery of our projects.\n\nWe have implemented a range of initiatives to counteract supply chain disruption. By working directly with global steel manufacturers, the material experiencing the greatest price pressure, we have improved certainty and cost of supply. Global agreements have been advanced with a number of strategic partners for glass and aluminium. In addition, we reduced the risk of disruption through a relationship with a large global logistics providers.\n\nKey focus areas include:\n\n- \u00b7 Knowing our suppliers and their suppliers in order to proactively manage risk\n- \u00b7 Developing broader and more advanced strategies for key high risk trades and critical supplies\n- \u00b7 Establishing the right trading partnerships to introduce low embodied carbon materials\n- \u00b7 Building a more connected supply chain via the use of digital technologies.\n\n## Opening the door to business opportunities\n\nNot only has the Construction segment contributed to the origination of integrated projects, it has also introduced new business opportunities to the Group.\n\nAlmost two decades ago, when the US Department of Defense was privatising its military housing portfolio, our US construction business, through its delivery capability, facilitated our entry into the housing privatisation program.\n\nSimilarly, our construction business in Asia has a strong history delivering data centres and life sciences buildings. This provided the entry point for expanding the integrated model into these two growing real estate sectors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The system will use the stabilising temperatures of the land below to provide heat and cooling. In addition, the geothermal system is also expected to reduce ongoing operational costs.\n\nWhen complete, 1 Java Street is anticipated to be one of the largest residential buildings in New York State to use all-electric and geothermal energy.\n\n## Climate resilient\n\nCities built around water are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The project team undertook a climate related risk assessment to address the project's resilience to such impacts. The /findings were incorporated into the design, including raising the building to account for future potential /flood risk.\n\n## Strong social value\n\n1 Java Street will incorporate a diverse range of apartment styles to appeal to a variety of residents. This includes addressing the challenge of a/ffordability, with approximately 30 per cent of the units allocated to a/ffordable housing.\n\nForming partnerships with local not-forpro/fit organisations is also a priority.

Our thoughts continue to be with the family of this worker and those impacted by this event.\n\n## Safety culture\n\nWe undertook an organisation-wide survey which assessed employee perspectives regarding our safety culture. This enabled comparison with the original safety culture survey conducted in FY19.\n\nThe survey results reinforced the outstanding safety culture evident across the organisation. Several key safety and culture climate statements elicited high employee agreement rates including key statements about safety culture above 85 per cent.\n\nOur employees demonstrate great pride in our approach and prioritisation of safety across everything we do. The survey results identi/fied areas for continuous improvement. This included support for greater investment in supply chain capability, and further focus on psychological safety, in step with our approach to physical safety.\n\n## Percentage of operations without a critical incident 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1.

The solution demonstrated our capability to provide perimeter screens, common in concrete frame building construction, to a steel frame building.\n\nThe simplicity of David's design has enabled a reduction in the risks of people or materials falling.

For more detailed information, refer to Performance and Outlook on page 56.\n\n## Sustainable /financing\n\nLendlease is one of the leaders in sustainable /financing in Australia. Of the Group's total facilities, 60 per cent, or $3.1b are green or sustainability linked.\n\nThis includes four sustainability linked loans and three green bonds to help realise our global pipeline of sustainable projects. This highlights a continuing shift in our funding of the thriving places we create.\n\nThese /financings have allowed us to extend the weighted average maturity of\n\nour funding and enter into facilities in the regions in which we operate, providing us with a natural hedge and access to /finance in these regions.\n\nAccessing green and sustainability linked borrowings has allowed us to facilitate the following outcomes:\n\n- \u00b7 Lengthen the maturity pro/file\n- \u00b7 Diversify funding\n- \u00b7 Support the execution of the Group's sustainability strategy\n- \u00b7 Improve lender engagement\n- \u00b7 Provide good access to markets whilst achieving competitive funding costs.\n\n## Measuring /financial performance\n\nWhen measuring /financial performance, we focus on Return on Equity and Earnings per Security on our core operations to measure the returns we generate for securityholders.\n\nThe Framework outlines target returns at a segment level. These returns, combined with an allowance for corporate costs, interest expense and tax, are used to derive a Group Core Operating Return on Equity target within the 8-11 per cent range. Core Operating Earnings per Security forms the basis for securityholder distributions within the payout ratio of 40-60 per cent.\n\nThe elements of the Framework are based on the Group's measure of Core operating pro/fit with both the target EBITDA mix and the target distribution payout ratio assessed accordingly. /uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nSee Note 1 'Segment Reporting' in the Financial Statements for more details on Operating/uni00A0pro/fit.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Detailed /financial performance and outlook\n\nFor detailed information on our FY22 /financial performance, as measured under the Portfolio Management Framework, refer to the Performance and Outlook section and the Financial Statements.\n\n## Portfolio Management Framework\n\n## 1.

Each roadmap has been tailored to account for regional variances in availability of alternative fuel options, renewable energy markets, technology solutions, supply chain maturity and government policies.\n\nCarbon o/ffset guidance and procurement We updated our global Carbon O/ffset Guidance and Criteria in response to price volatility and supply issues in the voluntary carbon o/ffset market. We are now developing a Carbon O/ffset Procurement Strategy to support our Net Zero by 2025 target.\n\nRenewable electricity procurement We also developed global Renewable Electricity Guidance in response to the varied frameworks, purchasing options and recognised certi/fication schemes across our regions of operation. This will help us maintain the highest level of quality and transparency associated with the purchase of renewable electricity as we target 100 per cent renewable electricity use by 2030.\n\nMeasurement and reporting for scope 3 We commenced the drafting of our House View and Position Statement on scope 3 emissions to clearly de/fine our reporting boundaries and planned approach for measurement, tracking and reporting.\n\n## Expanded disclosure and ongoing engagement\n\nIn November 2021 we delivered our third annual Sustainability Investor Brie/fing and released our inaugural ESG Databook. We are working to evolve the ESG Databook to help improve the accessibility of our ESG data set.\n\nWe have been actively monitoring the evolution of ESG reporting standards, including participating in industry submissions on the International Sustainability Standards Board's (ISSB) exposure draft standards. The establishment of ISSB is expected to lead to globally consistent ESG disclosure standards and we will look to align our reporting to these standards.\n\nWe also launched Mission Zero Ready, a global carbon literacy e-learning module to help our people understand the importance of our Mission Zero journey.\n\n## Building collaboration and alignment\n\nTo generate momentum for decarbonising the real estate sector, we participated in industry working groups, joined crosssector initiatives and shared thoughtleadership. Some examples include:\n\n- \u00b7 Participated at several events at COP26 in Glasgow.\n- \u00b7 Established a strategic partnership with Stora Enso, one of the world's leading suppliers of sustainable timber.\n- \u00b7 Joined Built by Nature and continued to be active participants in MECLA and the SteelZero initiative.\n- \u00b7 Partnered with the Green Building Council of Australia to recognise leadership in the transition to fossil fuel free construction sites with a new challenge initiative.\n\n## Mission Zero Roadmap Progress\n\nWe are making progress on our Mission Zero Roadmap initiatives to reduce scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SCOPE 1\n\n## Fuels we burn\n\nWe are working towards our goal of zero fossil fuels in construction activities by using alternative fuels, increasing the use of electric construction plant and equipment and trialling battery storage and charging infrastructure.\n\n## Proof point:\n\n- \u00b7 Implemented an Alternative Fuels Policy to help reduce fossil fuels usage from our UK construction sites. At the end of Q3, renewable diesel accounted for 98 per cent of fuels used in the UK, including sustainably sourced low carbon alternatives such as hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO).\n\nWe are increasing the number of new all-electric developments and have begun the process of identifying legacy gas infrastructure to guide future capex aligned electri/fication upgrades for assets under management. This includes reducing fossil fuels used in asset maintenance and operation.\n\n## Proof point:\n\n- \u00b7 New all-electric projects include 1 Java Street, New York, La Cienega, Los Angeles, and all new homes at the Fort Hood residential community.\n\nAbove: London: The Pavilion, IQL.

We are specifying lower carbon concrete and trialling emerging technologies.\n\n- \u00b7 Targeting an average 40 per cent Portland cement replacement across all three residential towers at One Sydney Harbour is estimated to reduce overall embodied carbon emissions by up to 10 per cent 2 .\n\n## Aluminium and glass\n\nWe have developed an embodied carbon tool in our fa\u00e7ade designs. We are collaborating with suppliers to reduce the embodied carbon of materials by increasing the amount of recycled content in the aluminium and glass we buy.\n\n- 1.

The use of renewable energy saved approximately 2,100 tCO2e compared with primary aluminium manufactured using fossil fuels.\n\n## Timber\n\nAs we look to a low and zero carbon future, we continue to explore the application of alternative materials such as mass engineered timber.\n\n- \u00b7 Achieved a BREEAM Outstanding rating on The Pavilion at International Quarter London (IQL). The building's timber superstructure delivered a 56 per cent reduction in embodied carbon compared with an e/fficient concrete alternative, surpassing industry best practice 3 .\n\n## Green Leasing\n\nTo reduce downstream scope 3 emissions, we continue to engage with tenants and residents on the purchase of renewable electricity and energy e/fficiency initiatives.\n\n- \u00b7 Enhanced our UK commercial green leases to require all new o/ffice tenants to procure 100 per cent renewable electricity. O/ffice tenants at IQL in Stratford should be the /first to use the updated lease.\n\n## Decarbonisation challenges and insights\n\nTo achieve Absolute Zero Carbon by 2040 we will be reliant on sector transformation at scale and pace, however, we recognise there are challenges ahead and that key to /finding solutions is sharing insights we have gained.\n\n## Fossil Fuel Free Construction\n\nWe collaborated with the University of Queensland to research the range of technologies that could drive the transition to fossil fuel free and ultimately zero emission construction sites.\n\nThe research /findings showed that although electri/fication of construction equipment and machinery is underway, the pace will need to accelerate to achieve zero emissions construction by 2040./uni00A0Hence, we will continue to shift our business towards the use of renewable diesel and alternative fuels where viable, while also advocating for acceleration in the electri/fication of construction equipment.\n\n## Existing gas infrastructure/uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nThe major urban regeneration schemes in the UK provide an insight into some of the challenges in eliminating fossil fuels from development projects and assets. Connecting to the local energy infrastructure network is mandated for several of these projects, some of which rely on the combustion of gas. We are working with local authorities and energy providers in developing and executing their decarbonisation strategies for these networks which align with our Absolute Zero Carbon target.\n\nMain: Chicago: Roof Crop at The Cooper.",

The risk management process outlines the governance, risk appetite, accountability for risk management and operational resilience program.\n\n## Risk framework\n\nOur risk framework, underpinned by a 'Three Lines of Defence' model, remains unchanged from a governance perspective. The model provides a structured approach to risk management by de/fining clear roles and responsibilities across the organisation and the relationship between the di/fferent areas.\n\n## Three Lines of Defence\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business Operations\n\nIdentify, manage and own risks relevant to the project / investment\n\n## Regional Leadership Team\n\nAccountable for achieving regional objectives\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group Functions\n\nOutline assurance measures to enable appropriate identi/fication and management of risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Internal and External Audit\n\nProvide assurance independently from the /first and second lines of defence\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk Appetite Framework\n\nThe Risk Appetite Framework articulates the Board's appetite for taking on risk as we implement our strategy. It provides clarity on the types of projects we target, while providing a method for identifying projects nearing or outside of acceptable risk tolerances.\n\nThe Risk Appetite Framework, with a lens on continuous improvement, is periodically reviewed to ensure it continues to evolve and remains /fitfor-purpose. Any changes, including the addition of new statements and tolerances, are reviewed and approved by the Board Risk Committee.\n\n## Enterprise risks\n\nOur Enterprise Risk Framework is designed to inform and support business strategy. The framework provides an important backdrop in setting our strategic objectives and monitoring operational risk assessment throughout the organisation.\n\nThe framework provides a harmonised approach with /five interlinking pillars.\n\nThe connectivity between these pillars creates a risk management ecosystem in which their interaction provides clear and measurable linkages. This ecosystem is supported by our underlying risk systems, managing our exposure via insurance, a resilience framework and a risk intelligent culture.\n\nB o a r d a n d C o m m i t t e e s\n\nG lo b a l L e a d e r s h i p T e a m",

Our disclosure continues to evolve as we enhance management of climate-related risks and as advancements are made in climaterelated /financial disclosures.\n\n## Building strategic resilience\n\nIn FY19 we disclosed our three climate scenarios that we would use to build business strategic resilience. The scenarios were Polarisation (>3 degrees), Paris Alignment (2-3 degrees) and Transformation (well below 2 degrees).\n\nIn FY20 the business identi/fied risks and opportunities that might arise over the next 30 years for each of our climate scenarios and which of these were likely should the scenario manifest in the next 10 years.\n\nThese risks and opportunities were then synthesised into ten Climate-Related Impacts (CRIs) per scenario and disclosed in our FY20 Annual Report.\n\nIn FY21 and FY22 we further enhanced the climate-related strategic resilience of our business by engaging with more than 100 of our senior leaders globally in a series of TCFD Business Impact workshops. The FY21 workshops used the /five CRIs identi/fied as most likely to appear in the next 10 years from each scenario (should the scenario manifest) as the basis of review. The remaining /five were examined in FY22. Participants were asked to identify their business unit's positive and negative sensitivities, by reference to impact to revenue, for each CRI relative to our baseline strategy.\n\nParticipants identi/fied mitigating actions to reduce the sensitivity, if the scenario happened, through building business strategic resilience to either\n\nabsorb, adapt, or transform to the CRIs. An assessment of the remaining residual sensitivities was subsequently undertaken.\n\nEvery e/ffort was taken to engage in a robust scenario analysis process with input from experienced senior leaders in each business around the globe. However, scenario planning is, by its nature, subjective and may be subject to change as key considerations evolve. The following disclosures are subject to these factors. The assessment of our strategic resilience is against a baseline which assumes our Mission Zero strategy.",

        "page_content": "## Our strategic resilience to climaterelated impacts\n\nThe assessment of the second set of /five CRIs indicates a greater /financial resilience (higher residual positive sensitivity) in our business strategy to our Paris Aligned scenario, supported by our continued commitment to being a 1.5 degree aligned business. In particular, our Mission Zero business strategy played a signi/ficant role in both reducing the risks and increasing opportunities in the analysis associated with our Paris Aligned\n\n## Scenario\n\n## Polarisation Scenario (>3 o C)\n\nThis scenario sees a world where climate action is delayed by the polarisation of climate action. This delay results in a world where physical climate changes are the greatest across our three scenarios.\n\nThe integration of 'Leadership in Sustainability' as a strategic priority and our Net and Absolute Zero Carbon targets sees low levels of positive sensitivity from an increased market share from the public sector, as well as access and cost of capital.\n\nHaving experienced similar impacts to international product and labour availability due to COVID, Lendlease recognises a transformation of global supply chains and labour sourcing is needed to reduce supply risks.\n\n## Paris Alignment Scenario (2-3 o C)\n\nThis scenario sees a market led transition to a lower carbon future through global government commitments to the Paris Agreement. This would result in increased regulation of climate action and a reduction of the physical impacts of climate change compared with our Polarisation scenario.\n\nThere are many 'di/fficult to decarbonise' products and materials in our supply chain, including cement, steel, and aluminium. However, our continued work to achieve this goal would result in a signi/ficant positive sensitivity.\n\nOur leadership in sustainability and carbon targets creates positive sensitivities to an increased market share from the public sector. It also provides an advantage whilst leadership in decarbonisation continues to be valued by investors.\n\n## Transformation Scenario (<2 o C)\n\nThis scenario sees a rapid decarbonisation pathway, where global emissions are close to zero in 2040, driven by society.\n\nThe speed of change required to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees is likely to create negative sensitivities in our supply chain as suppliers try to keep pace with decarbonisation demands and shifting preferences towards localisation. Further, however unlikely, a major shift towards community ownership would disrupt most major corporations.\n\nOur leadership in sustainability and innovation creates positive sensitivities to an expectation of greater research and development in decarbonisation. Further, we see positive sensitivities through an increase in partnerships and collaboration in decarbonisation, such as our founding membership of the Materials and Embodied Carbon Leaders Alliance (MECLA), an industry led coalition to decarbonise Australia's building and construction industry.\n\nAbsorb: Current strategy absorbs the impact of the CRI\n\nAdapt: Changes required to current strategy to respond to the CRI Transform: New strategy or signi/ficantly altered strategy required to respond to the CRI\n\nscenario. As with most companies, we have negative sensitivities to global labour and supply chain disruptions in our Polarisation scenario; however, strategies to mitigate these risks have been well established during COVID disruptions. The dramatic shift under a transformation scenario poses both positive and negative sensitivities, depending on the level of transformation.\n\nThe integration of climate risk assessments with investment decision making, combined with continued\n\nprogress in decarbonising our operations and supply chain, has reduced residual negative sensitivities to climate impacts. To help understand the level of mitigating action considered for each climate impact, we have expanded our CRI disclosure to include the level of action required to achieve the residual sensitivity. The level of action identi/fied for the full set of CRIs will be available in the Climate-related Impacts section of our FY22 ESG Databook.\n\nResidual Sensitivity\n\n|                                                                                | Development   | Development   | Development   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Climate-related Impact                                                         | Investments   |               | Construction  |\n| Impact market share  from public sector                                        | Adapt         | Adapt         | Absorb        |\n| Access and cost  of capital                                                    | Transform     | Adapt         | Absorb        |\n| Availability of  international products                                        | Transform     | Transform     | Transform     |\n| Availability and cost  of labour                                               | Adapt         | Adapt         | Adapt         |\n| Reduced availability of  materials and resources                               | Transform     | Transform     | Transform     |\n| Misalignment between  legislation/regulation and  Lendlease strategy           | Adapt         | Absorb        | Absorb        |\n| Demand for negative  emissions and  geoengineering solutions                   | Adapt         | Adapt         | Adapt         |\n| Changing preferences  away from new  build development                         | Transform     | Transform     | Transform     |\n| Demand for zero- carbon infrastructure                                         | Absorb        | Adapt         | Absorb        |\n| Increase market share  from public sector                                      | Adapt         | Adapt         | Adapt         |\n| Availability of  international products                                        | Transform     | Adapt         | Adapt         |\n|                                                                                | Transform     | Transform     | Transform     |\n| Changing preferences  away from new  build development Shift towards community | Transform     | Transform     | Transform     |\n| 'ownership' of companies Expectation of                                        | Transform     |               | Adapt         |\n| R&D investment  for decarbonisation                                            |               | Adapt         |               |\n| Greater need                                                                   |               |               |               |\n| for partnerships  and collaboration  for decarbonisation                       | Adapt         | Adapt         | Adapt         |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHigher negative sensitivity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHigher positive sensitivity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The value of this strategic resilience planning is evident with a few key CRIs beginning to materialise.\n\n## CRI: Industry Leadership in Decarbonisation valued (All scenarios)\n\nLendlease identi/fied that industry leadership in decarbonisation would be valued under all three scenarios. This has been seen in the rise of sustainable format /financing strategies.\n\nWe are a leader in sustainable /financing in Australia with approximately $3.1b or 60 per cent of the Group's total facilities sourced in sustainable formats.\n\nAccessing the sustainable /financing market has supported execution of the Group's strategy, improved lender engagement and is expected to result in lower borrowing costs for the Group./uni00A0\n\nIt is our intention to pursue, where appropriate, sustainable format /financings in the future for new facilities and re/financing of maturing facilities.\n\n## CRI: Increased Cost of Carbon (Paris Alignment scenario)\n\nSince identifying the cost of carbon as a potential CRI under the Paris Alignment scenario in FY20, there has been a substantial increase in the number of net zero commitments made by corporations and governments globally and a corresponding increase in the demand for quality carbon o/ffsets. This has been re/flected in carbon o/ffset markets, with an expectation that pricing will likely increase as the net zero deadlines declared by these entities approach 1 . This is to be expected given some organisations are planning to solely rely on the purchase of carbon o/ffsets to achieve their net zero targets.\n\nOur 2040 Absolute Zero target, which seeks to eliminate emissions from our business altogether without reliance on o/ffsets, helps to mitigate the carbon o/ffset price risk exposure. It is also intrinsic to our near-term Net Zero by 2025 target to reduce our carbon emissions as much as possible and therefore minimise the residual position requiring o/ffset.\n\nTo help achieve our ambitious targets, long term decarbonisation plans (Mission Zero Roadmaps) and short-term carbon mandates have been developed for each business and region. The mandates\n\n- 1. Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets (TSVCM) Final Report, January 2021.\n- 2. Based on our estimated net scope 1 and 2 emissions in FY22 and the current estimated cost of carbon o/ffsets.\n\nseek to reduce our scope 1 and 2\n\nemissions, which will support not being caught by a rising cost of carbon. The mandate actions include shifting to renewable electricity, utilising Power Purchase Agreements, and shifting to renewable diesel or biodiesel alternatives, where these options are available.\n\nCarbon o/ffsets will be centrally managed and procured to achieve net zero emissions starting in FY25 for any remaining unavoidable emissions. For illustrative purposes only, based on our estimated net scope 1 and 2 emissions in FY22, and the current estimated cost of carbon o/ffsets, the potential cost range to achieve net zero in FY22 would have been between $1.2m and $2.4m 2 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This included a loss of $333m from Non-operating items driven by restructuring costs, and a loss of $42m from the Non-core segment.\n\nThe Group recorded Core Operating Pro/fit after Tax of $276m for the year ending 30 June 2022. Core Operating Earnings per Security of 40.1 cents represents a Return on Equity of 4.0 per cent. Distributions per security totalled 16 cents, representing a payout ratio of 40 per cent of Core Operating Pro/fit./uni00A0\n\nGood progress has been made in advancing several strategic priorities which provide momentum into FY23 and beyond. These include approximately $11b of investment partnerships and the commencement of $5.9b of developments.\n\nCore segment EBITDA of $809m was down from $918m 1 . Investment earnings were up substantially with both higher fund management fees and a recovery in investment income. Development pro/fitability remained suppressed with limited completions, and Construction earnings continued to re/flect COVID impacts, cost pressures and lower new work secured in Europe and Americas.\n\nThe Investments segment outperformed with a 9.7 per cent return on invested capital, above our target range of 6-9 per cent, boosted by the part divestment of the asset management income stream of the US Military Housing portfolio, as well as a recovery in portfolio income and higher management fees.\n\nThe lower contribution from the Development segment re/flects fewer completions and the impact of the change in approach to our joint venture projects, which more closely aligns the timing of pro/fit with cash /flow and capital at risk. While the return on invested capital of 2.2 per cent was well below target, albeit within the expected range for FY22, progress continues to be made towards converting the development pipeline with Work in Progress at a record $18.4b.\n\nIn the Construction segment, revenue was up driven primarily by the Australian region. The Americas, where new work secured has reduced signi/ficantly since the onset of COVID, recorded a decline in revenue. The construction EBITDA margin of two per cent was at the bottom of the 2-3 per cent EBITDA target range.\n\nCorporate costs of $180m were higher due to a combination of one-o/ff provisioning in the current year and several oneo/ff bene/fits which reduced reported costs in the prior year. Excluding these one-o/ff items, corporate costs would have declined. Net /finance costs of $116m were lower with reduced committed facilities and lower average drawn debt. The average cost of debt was largely unchanged despite base rate increases due to the high proportion of /fixed rate debt.\n\nThe balance sheet remains in a strong position with gearing of 7.3 per cent and total available liquidity of $3.9b.\n\nThe Non-core loss primarily re/flects costs associated with the exit of the Services business in FY22. We have maintained provisions we consider are appropriate to complete our share of the retained Melbourne Metro project and for potential warranties associated with the now exited Engineering and Services businesses.\n\nAt the beginning of the year the Group announced a /five-year roadmap to deliver long term sustainable performance, with FY22 a Reset year. The roadmap has simpli/fied the business and created a leaner organisation. Restructuring costs associated with these changes, recorded as Non-operating items, were $342m post tax and include allowances for employee and tenancy costs, and development impairments on a small number of underperforming projects. /uni00A0\n\nRecurring annual savings arising from simplifying the Group's operating model were $172m, which have exceeded our target of more than $160m pre tax on an annualised basis. Additional cost savings are anticipated in FY23.\n\nRestructuring charges of $170m pre tax were incurred to generate these savings. A change in development strategy across a small number of projects incurred an impairment expense of $289m pre tax.\n\nA review of the Group's digital business rea/ffirmed the importance of the strategy, along with a more focused product o/ffering. A re/finement to the existing strategy will enable a more e/fficient use of the Group's capital. An impairment expense of $55m post tax was recorded in relation to products that have been discontinued./uni00A0\n\n/uni00A0",

While our integrated model enables a high degree of control regarding executing our strategy, we will be in/fluenced by the external environment of higher in/flation and interest rates./uni00A0 /uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nThe Return on Invested Capital for the Investments segment is expected to be in the range of 6-7.5 per cent for FY23, the lower half of our target range. While the urban development pipeline is expected to continue to provide the predominant source of future growth for the investments platform, new initiatives will be pursued selectively alongside our investment partners.\n\nThe Return on Invested Capital for the Development segment is expected to be in the range of 4-6 per cent for FY23. Higher commencements and a record amount of Work in Progress are driving a recovery in both completions and pro/fit. However, scale bene/fits will not be achieved and the revised approach to our joint venture projects is anticipated to continue to defer pro/fits on some projects in the near term. As a result, returns in FY23 will remain well below our target of 10-13 per cent.\n\nWe remain on track to meet our $8b completion target in FY24, along with the Return on Invested Capital target of 10-13 per cent. Anticipated commencements, along with our assessment of project fundamentals of current Work in Progress, provides con/fidence in achieving both the completion and return targets.\n\nThe EBITDA margin for the Construction segment is expected to be in the range of 1.5-2.5 per cent for FY23, potentially lower than our target range of 2-3 per cent, due to ongoing disruption from the pandemic, cost pressures and supply chain constraints. These risks have been well managed to date but their persistence is likely to impact performance in FY23.",

The Group's assessment of market value of ownership interests.\n\n## Performance\n\nThe Investments segment delivered EBITDA of $497m, up substantially from $276m 1 . The recovery in performance was driven by several components of the segment with higher fund management fees, a recovery in underlying investment income and pro/fits on divestments. Return on Invested Capital of 9.7 per cent outperformed both the anticipated range of 7.5-8.5 provided at the HY22 results and the segment target range of 6-9 per cent.\n\nManagement EBITDA, derived from funds and asset management activities across the Group's investments platform, was $141m, down from $165m 1 .\n\nFunds management EBITDA rose 25 per cent to $94m 1 . Revenue climbed from $145m to $172m, driven by base fees growing in line with funds under management and acquisition fees from investments in Asia. Higher expenses were driven by investment in resourcing to support the $11b in initiatives to underpin our growing platform, including the launch of new products.\n\nAsset management EBITDA of $47m is down from $90m 1 . The prior year includes fees from the $1.3b of redevelopment activity that was secured across the US military housing portfolio. Residential fees across the apartments for rent portfolio continued to rise while commercial asset management fees recovered on fewer abatements.\n\nInvestment portfolio EBITDA was $356m, up from $111m 1 . Improved asset level performance supported a recovery in underlying investment income with an investment yield of approximately /five per cent across the portfolio, up from approximately three per cent in the prior year. This included a recovery in earnings across our co-investment positions, including an improved operating performance from our Retirement Living investment. Pro/fits from capital recycling initiatives included $167m pre-tax associated with the part divestment of the future asset management income stream from the US Military Housing portfolio.\n\nThe Group's investment portfolio is valued at $3.5b. The portfolio was steady against FY21 with the investment into an industrial portfolio joint venture and our participation in the Lendlease Global Commercial REIT capital raising broadly o/ffsetting the Retirement Living divestment. The investment portfolio is well diversi/fied, with exposure across the o/ffice, residential, retail, retirement and industrial sectors.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe Return on Invested Capital for the Investments segment is expected to be in the range of 6-7.5 per cent for FY23, within our target range. Funds under management, assets under management and the investment portfolio are the key operating metrics that drive future /financial performance.\n\nGrowth in funds under management of 12 per cent 1 to $44.4b was underpinned by new partnerships and mandates, fund acquisitions and appreciating asset values. Additional funds include Real Estate Partners 4; an o/ffice partnership at International Quarter London; our industrial portfolio joint venture and acquisitions across the Australian Funds Management platform. In addition to the current funds under management, there is approximately $5b of potential FUM based on development projects currently in delivery via managed funds or mandates. This forms part of the $11b of investment partnerships that were established during the year.\n\nThe Group's urban development pipeline is expected to continue to provide the predominant source of future growth for the investments platform. The existing urban development pipeline includes approximately $64b of institutional investment grade product across commercial and residential for rent assets.\n\nAssets under management rose from $28.5b to $30.0b, primarily driven by foreign exchange rate movements. Fees will be lower in FY23 given our lower interest in the military housing asset management income stream. /uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nThe Group's investment portfolio of $3.5b includes approximately $1b in each of o/ffice and retail assets, $0.7b in residential and $0.5b in retirement, with the remainder in industrial.\n\nThe Group's strategy is to signi/ficantly grow its investment portfolio over time. Growth is expected to be derived from retaining a proportion of completed assets from the development pipeline and investing alongside partners through the launch of new products. Key initiatives progressed in FY22 include the launch of a value-add diversi/fied fund; a partnership to develop the o/ffice precinct at International Quarter London; a US Life Sciences partnership; and an Asian Innovation partnership.",

The prior year pro/fit included contributions from the development joint ventures formed on One Sydney Harbour, Towers One and Two. They generated approximately $325m in EBITDA, including the uplift on our retained interest of 75 per cent. The decision to improve earnings quality by changing our approach to joint venture projects delayed expected pro/fits.\n\nThe subdued operating performance was re/flected in a deterioration in returns. Return on Invested Capital of 2.2 per cent was at the lower end of the expected range of 2-4 per cent expected for FY22 and below our target range of 10-13 per cent.\n\nThe divestment of the remaining 20 per cent interest in our Sydney Place development, along with progress on both leasing and construction delivery milestones, was the largest contributor to the result. Origination fees following /financial close on both the North East Link and Frankston Hospital Public Private Partnerships also contributed to EBITDA.\n\nWe completed $2.5b of developments, down from $3.8b in the prior year, comprised of $2.0b urban projects and $0.5b Communities. Across our urban portfolio, we completed both apartments for sale and rent buildings at Lakeshore East, Chicago, two o/ffice campus style buildings at Milano Santa Giulia and the retirement village in Shanghai. /uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nThe Australian Communities business generated EBITDA of $16m, down from $42m 1 . Planning and weather delays contributed to the decline in settlements from 2,228 to 1,478 lots. /uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nFurther recovery in commencements, which are running well ahead of completions, provides us with the con/fidence that operating momentum will translate into improved /financial performance. Commencements of $5.9b, including a strong recovery in H2 FY22 of $4.4b, were up from $5.6b 1 providing a clearer pathway for completions to achieve our $8b annual target going forward from FY24.\n\nOur apartments for rent project at 1 Java Street, New York commenced against the backdrop of an improved outlook for the inner-city rental market. We are now underway with the third and /final residential tower at One Sydney Harbour, Sydney. The Boston Life Sciences project commenced, along with o/ffice developments in Singapore, London and Sydney. In addition, we commenced phase one of the data centre in Tokyo. Lot sales across Australian Communities rebounded from 1,940 to 3,114 1 as we worked through planning and launched new projects. /uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nInvested capital rose from $4.4b to $5.4b 1 as development expenditure accelerated ahead of higher completions. Key projects utilising additional capital include: One Sydney Harbour; The Exchange TRX, Milan Innovation District and the Australian Communities business. The increase in invested capital is net of a $0.2b reduction related to the impairment of a small number of development projects./uni00A0\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe Return on Invested Capital for the Development segment is expected to be in the range of 4-6 per cent for FY23. The signi/ficant operating momentum we carry into the new /financial year, re/flected in higher commencements and a record amount of Work in Progress, will drive a recovery in both completions and pro/fit. However, neither will be at a su/fficient level to derive the full scale bene/fits from our development platform. In addition, the change in approach to our joint venture projects has shifted the timing of pro/fit recognition. As a result, returns in FY23 will remain well below our target of 10-13 per cent.\n\nThe development pipeline rose from $113.6b to $117b 1 with additional projects and increased scope on existing projects more than o/ffsetting completions and the removal of a few underperforming projects. Our $3b joint venture with Singtel was added to the pipeline. The project comprises two premium grade workplaces totalling approximately 110,000 square metres. Our Kinma Valley community project in South East Queensland received planning approval, adding $0.7b to the pipeline. Master planning and pricing improvements across our existing urban and communities' projects generated an uplift of more than $5b to the pipeline.\n\nThe conversion of the already secured pipeline is critical for achieving our annual completion target of more than $8b. While this alleviates the need for signi/ficant origination, we will continue to pursue attractive opportunities with emphasis on our Asian and Australian cities./uni00A0\n\nWork in Progress, the lead indicator for future completions, has risen to a record $18.4b. Approximately $4.5b is expected to complete in FY23, including Sydney Place and our apartments for sale project at 100 Claremont, New York. The Australian Communities business is recovering with more than $1b of presales carried into the new /financial year. Consequently, we are targeting the lower end of our 3,000 to 4,000 settlement range for FY23.\n\nWe remain on track to meet our more than $8b completion target in FY24. Projects that underpin this level of completions include residential Towers One & Two, One Sydney Harbour, the Melbourne Quarter Tower and TRX in Kuala Lumpur. /uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nMaintaining this completion target will require Work in Progress of more than $20b. This milestone is expected to be reached in FY23, driven by expected commencements of approximately $8b.",

Construction revenue to be earned in future periods (excludes internal projects).\n\n## Performance\n\nThe Construction segment delivered EBITDA of $131m, down from $173m in the prior year. The result was adversely impacted by productivity delays relating to COVID, lower new work secured, and increased cost pressures due to in/flation and supply chain challenges. Notwithstanding these challenges, our strong client relationships, risk management approach and dedicated teams enabled a resilient performance.\n\nRevenue of $6.6b was modestly up on the prior year. This was driven by an 11 per cent uplift from Australia. Asia and Europe were broadly in line with the prior year. Revenue from the Americas was down seven per cent because of reduced new work secured since the onset of COVID, particularly in the northeast residential market.\n\nSeveral health related projects drove higher revenue in Australia. This included the Tweed Heads Valley Hospital and Randwick Campus Redevelopment; and the Pathway to 144 Mental Health Beds project which responds to the Royal Commission into Victoria's Mental Health System. O/ffice and residential buildings in New York and Los Angeles contributed to revenue in the Americas.\n\nThe EBITDA margin was 2.0 per cent, the bottom end of the target range of 2-3 per cent. Australia's margin was strong at 3.8 per cent, while margin pressure was driven by lower productivity across projects in Europe and the Americas. This compares with an EBITDA margin of 2.7 per cent in FY21, which included COVID induced temporary cost reduction measures as well as project completions that boosted the margin./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nNew work secured of $5.3b was well down from $6.9b, with gains in the Australian business o/ffset by continued weakness in the Americas and Europe. In Australia, new work secured of $3.6b was underpinned by the Frankston Hospital Redevelopment, Powerhouse Parramatta and two health related social infrastructure projects./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nNew work secured of $1.1b in the Americas was signi/ficantly below historical averages, re/flecting ongoing subdued activity in key markets, including delays in projects being brought to market.\n\nThe business is preferred for $4.6b in new projects, including several social infrastructure projects in Australia and o/ffice projects in Europe.\n\nExtensive sector expertise and geographic diversity has been critical for the business to navigate a di/fficult operating environment.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe EBITDA margin for the Construction segment is expected to be in the range of 1.5-2.5 per cent for FY23, potentially lower than our expected target range of 2-3 per cent, with the Australian region expected to be the main contributor to earnings. The outlook is subdued with ongoing disruption from the pandemic, cost pressures and supply chain constraints. The Group is closely monitoring these risks and has implemented various mitigation strategies.\n\nBacklog revenue remains solid at $10.5b and is diversi/fied by client type and sector. Public sector projects account for two thirds of the backlog, while three sectors: social infrastructure; defence; and commercial account for more than 85 per cent. /uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nAustralia has a strong workbook, with $7.0b in backlog revenue. Key projects include the Frankston Hospital Redevelopment, RAAF Tindal Stage 6 and USFPI Air/field Works, Powerhouse Parramatta, Liverpool Health and Academic Precinct and the North and South Towers of the Over Station Development at the Sydney Metro Martin Place Integrated Station Development.\n\nThe Americas has backlog revenue of $2.6b. The lagged impact of the pandemic and our decision to remain disciplined in bidding for work has resulted in the Americas backlog declining to signi/ficantly below historic levels. We have maintained capability given our con/fidence that backlog and revenue will recover over time.\n\nBacklog revenue in Europe is $0.7b, and Asia backlog revenue is $0.2b.\n\nThe Construction segment will continue to support the integrated model and target leadership positions in key sectors by leveraging its competitive advantage, focusing on key market trends and maintaining execution excellence.",

Investment properties directly held fell due to the disposal of retail assets at Barangaroo.\n\n## Development Assets\n\nTotal development assets rose 10 per cent as Work in Progress accelerates ahead of higher completions. Inventory decreased by 6 per cent with lower carrying values on underperforming projects following their impairment and the reclassi/fication of International Quarter London to Equity Accounted Investments following the formation of the new investment partnership.\n\nEquity contributions to development projects in delivery, including One Sydney Harbour, The Exchange TRX, and Milan Innovation District also contributed to the 40 per cent increase in Equity Accounted Investment assets. The increase in Investment Properties includes capital expenditure on our Retirement Living asset in Asia.\n\n## Other assets and liabilities\n\nThe movement in other assets and liabilities predominantly relates to the disposal of the Services business. Cash and cash equivalents of $1.3b are moderately below the prior year levels.\n\n## Cash /flow and treasury management\n\nThe Group commenced the year with cash and cash equivalents of $1.7b. Movements during the year comprised Operating cash out/flow of $835m, Investing cash in/flow of $552m and Financing cash out/flow of $106m. The Group closed the year with cash and cash equivalents of $1.3b.\n\nThe Group measures underlying cash /flow to enable an assessment of cash conversion.\n\nThe measures are derived by adjusting statutory cash /flows, with the largest adjustment relating to the impact on cash /flows from investments in development.\n\nUnderlying core operating cash in/flow was $514m, representing a cash conversion ratio of 82 per cent. Investment segment cash /flows were the primary driver with softer Construction cash /flows, a result of subdued activity in international regions, impacting cash conversion. The change in approach to pro/fit recognition has improved the cash conversion ratio.\n\nUnderlying investing cash out/flow was $482m. The major contributors included proceeds from the 24.9 per cent divestment of Retirement Living and the remaining 20 per cent interest in our Sydney Place development, o/ffset by equity contributions to the new Industrial Fund and Lendlease Global Commercial REIT, as well as continued investment across key development projects in delivery. Proceeds received from the sale of the Services business partially o/ffset production spend in the year.\n\nGroup facilities reduced from $5.6b to $5.0b 1 following the decision to reduce the quantum of available committed facilities. The Group remains in a strong /financial position with $3.9b of liquidity comprised of $1.3b of cash and cash equivalents and $2.6b in available undrawn debt. Average debt maturity increased to 6.6 years providing greater /flexibility and access to longer term capital.\n\nGearing of 7.3 per cent is below the target range of 10-20 per cent, re/flecting several divestments in the second half of FY22. This is expected to rise to the middle of the target range during FY23.\n\n## Treasury management\n\n|                                   |       | FY21   | FY22   | Var.   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Net debt                          | $m    | 695    | 1,060  | 53%    |\n| Gearing 1                         | %     | 5.0    | 7.3    | 46%    |\n| Interest cover 2                  | times | 6.4    | 5.6    | (13%)  |\n| Average cost of debt              | %     | 3.6    | 3.6    | -      |\n| Average drawn debt maturity       | years | 4.9    | 6.6    | 35%    |\n| Available liquidity               | $m    | 4,930  | 3,944  | (20%)  |\n| Average debt mix /fixed:/floating | $m    | 87:13  | 88:12  |        |\n\n- 1.

These are scheduled in each of the regions where Lendlease operates.\n\nThe Board views that these program activities - in addition to the formal, scheduled Board and Committee meetings - are important for Board members to receive a greater understanding of our people and our business and a deep understanding of the activities and operations. The Chair works with the Company Secretary to plan the yearly program. Depending on the time of year, the program runs for a minimum of three days and up to /five days where more detailed project reviews are required.\n\n## Program for the reporting period between 1 July 2021 and/uni00A030 June 2022.\n\nBoard program activities undertaken during the reporting period are listed below. The Europe program is not included as this occurred in June 2021 (reported in the FY21 Annual Report) and July 2022 (to be reported in the FY23 Annual Report).\n\nThe Board maintained its regular cadence of meetings despite the challenge of COVID, including intermittent lockdowns, experienced across our operating regions The program was maintained through a mixture of virtual and face to face meetings and visits.\n\n## Asia (virtual and on-site program)\n\n- \u00b7 Virtual site tour of key projects in each of the Asia countries - Singapore, Japan, China and Malaysia.

(November 2021)\n- \u00b7 Engagement with Americas Regional Leadership team. (November 2021)\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nThe Board members, led by the Chairman, maintain an active and extensive engagement program to represent the interests of the Group at various industry functions and bodies. The Chairman acts as a spokesperson and regularly meets with customers, investors, governments and media. In February 2022, the Board endorsed a refreshed investor engagement program to encourage two way communications with the investment community. As part of this, a presentation detailing the scope of the Board activities and focus areas for the Board Committees was made available on the Lendlease website in May 2022.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting (AGM) has always been an important date in our calendar and provides our securityholders with a valuable opportunity to communicate with the Board. For the last two years, the AGM has been held online, due to the COVID pandemic. In 2022, we are planning to hold a hybrid format AGM with both an 'in-person' and virtual component which will provide greater access to our securityholders to participate and vote on all resolutions.\n\n## Board engagement with our people\n\nThe Board members have approved a code of conduct which articulates the standards of behaviour expected of all our people. The tone is 'set at the top' and Board members believe that meeting with our people, in addition to information received in formal meetings on the organisation's culture, is an important element of reinforcing the Lendlease values. Board members plan to meet with employees in all the regions and in more focused groups with the Regional Leadership Teams. Wider employee events were reintroduced in the Australia and Asia regions where employee 'town hall' style events were held, providing the opportunity for open discussion on organisational culture. Sessions between Board members and the Regional Leadership teams occurred in person and virtually. Visits to the Europe and Americas regions with scheduled town hall events are planned for FY23./uni00A0\n\n/uni00A0",

The Board reintroduced its longstanding tradition of visiting the Lendlease regions in person to conduct site visits and reviews of various projects in April 2022.\n\nSite visits allow the Board to speak to project teams about the challenges and opportunities in the delivery of a project, enabling these to be appreciated in a fuller geographic and strategic context.\n\nThese activities undertaken by the Board are examples of how the Board oversees management and delivering projects in accordance with the Group's strategy.\n\n## PLQ Development, Singapore\n\nThe PLQ project assessment is an example of how the Board reviews and evaluates strategic opportunities, sustains competitive advantage of the integrated\n\nmodel to originate, fund and deliver major urban projects.\n\nPaya Lebar Central was identi/fied by the Singapore Government as a new commercial hub for Singapore. This project was /first presented to the Board in 2014, and after careful consideration, an equity commitment for Lendlease's interest in PLQ was approved in 2015. Due to the project's size and signi/ficance, the Board has continued to receive updates on the progress of PLQ and visited the project in 2015, prior to commencement of construction and again in 2017, to view progress. In April 2022, the Board visited the now completed project, one of the largest sustainable business and lifestyle precincts in Singapore. The highly activated integrated commercial realm includes o/ffices, retail, residential and public spaces. In visiting the site over a longer time frame, the Board's discussions on the project's risks and\n\nopportunities were appreciated in a fuller geographic context.\n\nThe Board's interactions with PLQ, before, during and after completion of delivery, including visits, tours, presentations and project team interactions are indicative of the scrutiny and governance undertaken by the Board to oversee the delivery of projects in accordance with the Group's strategy.\n\nTop: Singapore: Board visit.",

Directors are required to allocate su/fficient time to the Group to perform their responsibilities e/ffectively, including adequate time to prepare for Board meetings. During the /financial year ended 30 June 2022, 12 Board meetings were held. Typically, four face to face meetings are held in Australia and one each in the UK, Asia and the Americas to align with the Group's regional operations. In addition, three shorter meetings are scheduled to provide updates to the Board between the longer face to face meeting programs. Given the COVID pandemic, a mixture of face to face and virtual meetings were held during the reporting period. In April 2022, the Board returned to holding meetings in the o/ffshore regions. Matters were also dealt with as required by circular resolution. Special subcommittees were also constituted to deal with speci/fic matters. During the reporting period, 13 such subcommittee meetings were held.\n\n## Overview of Board Committees\n\nThe Board recognises the essential role of Committees in guiding the Company on speci/fic issues. There are /five standing Board Committees to assist, advise and make recommendations to the Board on matters falling within their areas of responsibility. Each Committee consists of independent, Non Executive Directors. The Chair of each Committee is not a Chair of other Committees, or Chair of the Board. Each Committee\n\nis governed by a formal Charter setting out its objectives, roles and responsibilities, composition, structure, membership requirements and operation. During the reporting period a review of the accompanying Charters and Workplans for each of the Committees was undertaken.\n\nThe /five permanent Committees of the/uni00A0Board are:\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board with its oversight responsibilities in relation to accounting policies and practices, tax matters, treasury reporting, monitoring of internal /financial controls, internal and external audit functions and /financial reporting of the Group.\n\n## People and Culture Committee\n\nThe People and Culture Committee assists the Board with its oversight responsibilities in relation to establishing people management, diversity and inclusion, talent and remuneration/ compensation policies for the Group.\n\n## Risk Committee\n\nThe Risk Committee assists the Board with its oversight responsibilities in relation to risk management and internal control systems, risk policies and practices and compliance. The Risk Committee also has the role of considering, and if approved, recommending to the Board for approval major transactions as referred to the Committee by the Global Investment Committee.\n\n## Sustainability Committee\n\nThe Sustainability Committee assists the Board in monitoring the decisions and actions of management in achieving Lendlease's aspiration to be a sustainable organisation. The Committee has oversight of health and safety, ESG matters, the Lendlease Foundation, modern slavery and the Group's Elevate RAP.\n\n## Nomination Committee\n\nThe Nomination Committee has responsibility for Board renewal, composition and Director development and oversees the reviews of Board, Committee and Director performance.",

In addition, greater visibility has been provided on the Group's contribution to environmental sustainability and social value creation. (see Sustainability on page 42.\n\nHealth and safety remain the organisation's highest priority. Our people and contractors have the right to return home safely each day. We were deeply saddened by the fatality of a subcontractor on one of our projects in New York in an area under subcontractor management. We extend our condolences to the young man's family and friends./uni00A0\n\n## Executive Reward Strategy\n\nAs outlined in the 2021 Remuneration Report, signi/ficant changes were made to the Executive Reward Strategy. We engaged with securityholders on the proposed changes, and subsequently received strong support at the 2021 AGM.\n\nKey changes made to the Executive Reward Strategy:\n\n- \u00b7 Removed the restricted securities plan to increase the remuneration portion subject to performance.\n- \u00b7 Rebalanced the remuneration mix to address securityholder concerns over maximum Long Term Award (LTA) quantum.\n- \u00b7 Implemented STA deferral to enable greater alignment of STA to securityholder return.\n- \u00b7 Simpli/fied and reduced the number of KPIs within the Short Term Award (STA) to focus on the measures that are most critical to business success over the long term.\n- \u00b7 Introduced a threshold and maximum performance range, in addition to target for the STA to enable greater pay for performance alignment.\n- \u00b7 Increased the /financial performance weighting under the STA from 50% to 65% to maintain the weighting\n\nto /financial performance post the rebalance of the remuneration mix.\n\n- \u00b7 Simpli/fied the communication of LTAs at maximum opportunity to enhance peer comparability on quantum.\n\nAs well as embedding these changes, focus areas for the People & Culture Committee in FY22 included:\n\n- \u00b7 Supporting improvements to the broader people agenda.\n- \u00b7 Focusing on attracting and fostering exceptional talent, equitably and responsibly rewarding employees, and keeping people decisions central to business strategy.\n- \u00b7 Enhancements to governance on remuneration frameworks via modernising the treatment of LTA awards in circumstances where participating executives cease employment.\n\n## FY22 outcomes and link to performance\n\nRemuneration outcomes relating to the /financial year were determined by business performance during Reset, while having regard to the di/fficult operating conditions.\n\nThe decisive action we took during the year to reset the business strategy, simplifying the organisation structure, recalibrating the cost base, accelerating Development activity, and growing our investments platform has set the Group up for sustainable long term performance. Although /financial performance remains below our Portfolio Management Framework targets, it is consistent with expectations set for FY22.\n\nNotwithstanding strong performance against scorecard KPIs and exceeding expectations on roadmap goals, the Board determined that a downward adjustment to STA outcomes should be made given the /financial results anticipated in this year of strategic reset./uni00A0\n\nAccordingly, as a result of the application of Board discretion, the STA outcome for the Group CEO was 48% of maximum, and for the other KMP ranged between 55% and 61% of maximum STA.\n\nThere was no vesting of the 2020 LTA given the relative TSR and ROE performance hurdles were not met.\n\nWe believe the remuneration outcomes for executives are appropriate, acknowledging the signi/ficant progress made on the /five year roadmap.\n\n## Changes to KMP\n\nSimon Dixon was appointed Group Chief Financial O/fficer, bringing more than\n\n25 years' relevant international industry experience to the organisation. We thank former executives Johannes Dekker and Kylie Rampa for their contributions to the organisation.\n\nAdditionally, we welcomed Nicholas Collishaw to the Board and the People and Culture Committee. Philip Co/ffey and Jane Hemstritch rotated o/ff the Committee during the year.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nAs we move into the Create phase of our roadmap, the organisation is well positioned to deliver on targets for development completions and funds under management. We are also well progressed on our sustainability and broader social value targets. The incentive targets for next year will re/flect this new stage of our strategic plan.\n\nThe Committee is focused on investing in our people in order to deliver for securityholders and customers and support the execution of our strategy.\n\nWe invite you to read the Remuneration Report which details the outcomes for KMP during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nM J Ullmer, AO\n\nChairman\n\nElizabeth Proust, AO\n\nChairman, People & Culture Committee",

The focus of FY22 was to reset the platform for delivery and growth. This involved deploying a more focused business model, optimising the Group operating structure and businesses, recalibrating the cost base, implementing the outcomes of the Development portfolio review and accelerating the conversion of the pipeline, and growing the Investments platform. A change was made to the approach to the structuring of Development joint ventures in order to improve the alignment of pro/fit recognition with realised cash and the risk/reward pro/file. A consequence of this was to defer recognition of Development pro/fits to later years, with a reduced OPAT expected in FY22, building back to our Portfolio Management Framework targets by FY24. The FY22 Operating Plan, which forms the basis for the FY22 STA scorecard KPIs, was aligned to the strategy reset.\n\nKey outcomes delivered in FY22 against the strategic roadmap are:\n\n- \u00b7 Successful consolidation of the Australian businesses into an integrated unit\n- \u00b7 Annualised cost savings in excess of the $160m target\n- \u00b7 Record Development Work in Progress in the second half providing strong momentum as we enter FY23, on the pathway to delivering annual production in excess of $8bn by FY24\n- \u00b7 Growth in the Investment platform ahead of plan\n- \u00b7 Construction margin was at the bottom end of the target range.\n\nIn applying the discretion embedded in the Executive Reward Strategy, the Board had regard to these and other factors when assessing the appropriate balance between pay for performance in the form of STA and securityholder outcomes for FY22. More detail is given in the assessment of performance against the Global CEO STA scorecard set out on page 90.\n\n1 Refer to the ASX Announcement \"Lendlease Strategy brie/fing\" released on 30 August 2021.\n\n|                                                                                      | FY18      | FY19      | FY20      | FY21      | FY22      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Statutory Pro/fit after Tax (PAT) Attributable to  Securityholders ($m)              | 792.8     | 467       | (310)     | 222       | (99)      |\n| Core Operating Pro/fit After Tax (PAT)  Attributable to Securityholders ($m)         | 708.1     | 632       | 206       | 377       | 276       |\n| Total Dividends / Distributions ($m)                                                 | 399.6     | 237       | 191       | 186       | 110       |\n| Statutory Earnings per Stapled Security (EPS)  (cents) excluding treasury securities | 137       | 80        | (51.8)    | 32.5      | (14.4)    |\n| Core Operating Earnings per Stapled Security  (EPS) (cents)                          | 121.4     | 111.5     | 34.2      | 54.8      | 40.1      |\n| Annual Total Securityholder Return (%)                                               | 24        | (33)      | (2)       | (6)       | (19)      |\n| Statutory Return on Equity (ROE) (%) 1                                               | 12.7      | 7.4       | (4.7)     | 3.2       | (1.4)     |\n| Core Operating Return on Equity (ROE) (%) 2                                          | 11.3      | 10.1      | 3.1       | 5.4       | 4.0       |\n| Closing Security Price as at 30 June ($) 3                                           | 19.74     | 13.00     | 12.37     | 11.50     | 9.11      |\n| CEO STA outcome (% maximum opportunity)                                              | 67%       | 0%        | 23%       | 30% 4     | 48%       |\n| Executive STA outcomes (%  maximum opportunity)                                      | 43% - 93% | 17% - 33% | 17% - 27% | 17% - 40% | 55% - 61% |",

The progress on the strategic reset is ahead of expectation, and strong momentum has been generated in the business in the second half. However, having regard to the overall /financial result from the actions taken as part of the reset, in determining the /final STA outcome, the Board have exercised discretion to reduce the outcome on both the /financial and non-/financial KPIs.\n\n- \u00b7 A total downwards adjustment of 33% has been applied on the metricated scorecard outcome for the Global CEO.\n- \u00b7 The /final adjusted Global CEO STA outcome is 48% of maximum opportunity.\n\n## FY22 Short Term Performance Outcomes\n\nThe following table outlines the FY22 STA opportunity and outcomes for each Executive.\n\n| A$'000 1           | Target STA  opportunity   | Maximum STA  opportunity   | Total STA  awarded   | STA awarded -  cash 2   | STA awarded -  deferred 3   | Total STA  awarded as %  of Maximum  STA 4   | Total STA  forfeited as %  of Maximum  STA 4   |\n|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Current Executives |                           |                            |                      |                         |                             |                                              |                                                |\n| Anthony Lombardo   | 1,800                     | 2,500                      | 1,200                | 600                     | 600                         | 48%                                          | 52%                                            |\n| Dale Connor        | 1,200                     | 1,680                      | 1,013                | 507                     | 506                         | 60%                                          | 40%                                            |\n| Simon Dixon 5      | 750                       | 1,050                      | 638                  | 319                     | 319                         | 61%                                          | 39%                                            |\n| Justin Gabbani     | 814                       | 1,140                      | 692                  | 346                     | 346                         | 61%                                          | 39%                                            |\n| Denis Hickey       | 1,528                     | 2,139                      | 1,176                | 588                     | 588                         | 55%                                          | 45%                                            |\n| Frank Krile        | 800                       | 1,120                      | 680                  | 340                     | 340                         | 61%                                          | 39%                                            |\n| Neil Martin        | 1,224                     | 1,713                      | 1,000                | 500                     | 500                         | 58%                                          | 42%                                            |\n\n- 1.

Simon's Maximum Total Remuneration was set in line with the FY22 Executive Remuneration Strategy approach and is as follows:\n\nMaximum\n\n| A$'000   | Fixed remuneration   | Maximum STA   | Maximum LTA   | total remuneration   |\n|----------|----------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------------|\n|          | 1,000                | 1,400         | 1,800         | 4,200                |\n\nSimon was also issued a sign-on award in recognition of the unvested awards forfeited upon resignation from his previous employer.

|\n\nLendlease Corporation Limited (the Company) is incorporated and domiciled in Australia. The consolidated /financial report of the Company for the /financial year ended 30 June 2022 comprises the Company and its controlled entities including Lendlease Trust (LLT) (together referred to as the consolidated entity or the Group). The Group is a for pro/fit entity and is an international property and investments group. Further information about the Group's primary activities is included in Note 1 'Segment/uni00A0Reporting'.\n\nShares in the Company and units in LLT are traded as one security under the name of Lendlease Group on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). The Company is deemed to control LLT for accounting purposes and therefore LLT is consolidated into the Group's /financial report. The issued units of LLT, however, are not owned by the Company and are therefore presented separately in the consolidated entity Statement of Financial Position within equity, notwithstanding that the unitholders of LLT are also the shareholders of the Company.\n\nThe consolidated /financial report was authorised for issue by the Directors on 22 August 2022.",

At June 2022, all values have been rounded o/ff to the nearest/uni00A0million dollars unless otherwise indicated, in accordance with ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191\n- \u00b7 Has re-presented comparative /financial information in the Income Statement, Statement of Comprehensive Income and related Notes for discontinued operations during the year. The comparative information in the Statement of Financial Position, Statement of Changes in Equity, Statement of Cash Flows and related Notes have not been re-presented. Refer to Note 33 'Discontinued Operations' for further details\n- \u00b7 Is prepared under the historical cost basis except for the following assets and liabilities, which are stated at their fair value: derivative /financial instruments, fair value through pro/fit or loss investments, investment properties, and liabilities for cash settled share based compensation plans. Recognised assets and liabilities that are hedged are stated at fair value in respect of the risk that is hedged. Refer to the speci/fic accounting policies within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the basis of valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\n\nSigni/ficant accounting policies have been:\n\n- \u00b7 Included in the relevant notes to which the policies relate, while other signi/ficant accounting policies are discussed in Note 38 'Other Signi/ficant Accounting Policies'\n- \u00b7 Consistently applied to all /financial years presented in the consolidated /financial statements and by all entities in the Group, except as explained in Note 37 'Impact of New and Revised Accounting Standards'.\n\nThe preparation of a /financial report that complies with AASBs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions.\n\n- \u00b7 This can a/ffect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may di/ffer from these estimates\n- \u00b7 Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively\n- \u00b7 The signi/ficant accounting policies highlight information about accounting judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most signi/ficant e/ffects on reported amounts and further information about estimated uncertainties that have a signi/ficant risk of resulting in material adjustments within the next /financial year\n- \u00b7 These signi/ficant accounting estimates and judgements have been considered in the context of the COVID pandemic and the impact of the other economic conditions.\n\nThe Group presents assets and liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position as current or non current.\n\n- \u00b7 Current assets include assets held primarily for trading purposes, cash and cash equivalents, and assets expected to be realised in, or intended for sale or use in, the course of the Group's operating cycle or within the next 12 months. All other assets are classi/fied as non current\n- \u00b7 Current liabilities include liabilities held primarily for trading purposes, liabilities expected to be settled in the course of the Group's operating cycle and those liabilities due within one year from the reporting date. All other liabilities are classi/fied as non current.\n\nAt 30 June 2022, the Group is in a net current de/ficit (current liabilities exceeds current assets) but does not anticipate a signi/ficant liquidity risk in the next 12 months. This is due to the Group's strong /financial pro/file, which includes signi/ficant committed undrawn facilities and low gearing ratios.\n\nThe /financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. In preparing the /financial statements, including assessing the going concern basis of accounting, the Group has considered the ongoing COVID pandemic and other economic conditions.\n\nThe Group has:\n\n- \u00b7 $2,647/uni00A0million in undrawn facilities. See Note 16 'Borrowings and Financing Arrangements'\n- \u00b7 $1,297/uni00A0million in cash and cash equivalents. See Note 14 'Cash and Cash Equivalents'.\n\nFollowing this assessment, the Group is well placed to manage its /financing and future commitments over the next 12 months from the date of the /financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Section A./uni00A0Performance\n\nIn addition to the statutory result, Operating Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (Operating EBITDA) and Operating Pro/fit after Tax (Operating PAT) are the key measures used to assess the Group's performance. This section of the Financial Report focuses on disclosure that enhances a user's understanding of Operating EBITDA and Operating PAT. Segment Reporting below provides a breakdown of pro/fit and revenue by the operational activity and region. The key line items of the Income Statement, along with their components, provide detail behind the reported balances. Group performance will also impact the earnings per stapled security and dividend payout, therefore disclosure on these items has been included in this section. Further information and analysis on performance and allocation of resources can be found in the Performance and Outlook section of the Directors' Report.\n\n## 1./uni00A0Segment Reporting\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nThe Group's segments are Investments, Development, Construction and Non core. The Group has identi/fied these operating segments based on the distinct products and services provided by each segment, the distinct target return pro/file and allocation of resources for each segment, and internal reports that are reviewed and used by the Global Chief Executive O/fficer and Managing Director (the Chief Operating Decision Maker) in assessing performance, determining the allocation of resources, setting operational targets, and managing the Group.\n\nThe Group has presented the segments around business activity due to the Group's business model being broadly consistent in all regions. Additional disclosure has also been included for Operating EBITDA, Operating PAT and Statutory Pro/fit by region.\n\nThe Group reports Operating EBITDA and Operating PAT as its primary earnings metrics, in addition to the statutory result. Operating PAT is de/fined as Statutory pro/fit adjusted for non-cash backed property related revaluation increases or decreases of Investment property, Other /financial assets and Equity accounted investments that are classi/fied in the Investments segment, other non-cash adjustments or non-trading items such as impairment losses relating to goodwill and other intangibles, and nontrading items such as restructuring costs. Operating EBITDA is before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation. Operating EBITDA and Operating PAT includes revaluation increases or decreases of Investment properties under construction that are classi/fied in the Development segment.\n\nThe Chief Operating Decision Maker receives information and assesses segment performance under these metrics. Operating EBITDA and Operating PAT are used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain reportable segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries. The Group does not consider corporate activities to be an operating segment.\n\nThe operating segments are as follows:\n\n## Investments\n\nOperates across all four geographic regions. Services include owning and/or managing investments. The segment includes an investment management platform and the Group's ownership interests in residential, o/ffice, retail, industrial, retirement and infrastructure investment assets.\n\n## Development\n\nOperates in all four geographic regions. Its products and services include the development of inner city mixed use developments, apartments, communities, retirement, retail, commercial assets and social and economic infrastructure. Construction margin earned on development projects is recognised in this segment.\n\n## Construction\n\nOperates across all four geographic regions. Its products and services include the provision of project management, design and construction services, predominantly in the commercial, residential, mixed use, defence and social infrastructure sectors.\n\n## Non core\n\nNon core includes the provision of project management, design and construction services in the Australian infrastructure sector. These products and services represent the retained Engineering and retained Services projects. The discontinued operations referenced throughout the /financial statements are included in this segment. Discontinued operations represent the Services business sold during the period and the Engineering business sold in the prior period, excluding the projects retained by the Group.

This is a key performance measure for the Group. Refer to further details in the Managing and Measuring Value - Financial section of this Annual Report.\n\nBasic EPS/EPSS is determined by dividing Pro/fit/(loss) after tax attributable to members of the Company and Group (excluding any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares/securities) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares/securities outstanding during the /financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares/securities issued during the /financial year.\n\nDiluted EPS/EPSS is determined by adjusting the Pro/fit/(loss) after tax attributable to members of the Company and Group, and the weighted average number of ordinary shares/securities outstanding for the e/ffects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares/ securities. The Group currently does not have any dilutive potential ordinary shares/securities. Dilution occurs when treasury shares and employee share options are included in outstanding shares.\n\nThe issued units of Lendlease Trust (LLT) are presented separately within equity, and therefore the pro/fit attributable to LLT is excluded from the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per Company share presented in the Income Statement.\n\n|                                                                                    |       | JUNE 2022                                            | JUNE 2022                     | JUNE 2021                                            | JUNE 2021                     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                                                                    |       | Shares/  Securities  Excluding  Treasury  Securities | Shares/  Securities on  Issue | Shares/  Securities  Excluding  Treasury  Securities | Shares/  Securities on  Issue |\n| Basic/Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) 1                                           |       |                                                      |                               |                                                      |                               |\n| (Loss)/pro/fit attributable to members of Lendlease  Corporation Limited (Company) | $m    | (239)                                                | (239)                         | 128                                                  | 128                           |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares                                         | m     | 683                                                  | 689                           | 683                                                  | 688                           |\n| Basic/Diluted EPS                                                                  | cents | (35.0)                                               | (34.7)                        | 18.7                                                 | 18.6                          |\n| Basic/Diluted Earnings Per Stapled Security (EPSS) 1                               |       |                                                      |                               |                                                      |                               |\n| (Loss)/pro/fit attributable to securityholders of  Lendlease Group                 | $m    | (99)                                                 | (99)                          | 222                                                  | 222                           |\n| Weighted average number of stapled securities                                      | m     | 683                                                  | 689                           | 683                                                  | 688                           |\n| Basic/Diluted EPSS 2                                                               | cents | (14.5)                                               | (14.4)                        | 32.5                                                 | 32.3                          |\n\n- 1.

Development services include development fees earned on development of inner city mixed use developments, retirement, retail, commercial assets and social and economic infrastructure.\n\nContracts with customers to provide Construction or Development services can include either one performance obligation or multiple performance obligations within each contract. The Group assesses each of its contracts individually and where there are separate performance obligations identi/fied, the transaction price is allocated based on the relative standalone selling prices of the services provided. Typically, the Construction or Development services in contracts are not considered distinct as the services are highly interrelated and an integrated bundle of services and therefore are accounted for as a single performance obligation.\n\nThe transaction price for each contract may include variable consideration in the form of contract variations or modi/fications, and contract claims (collectively, 'Modi/fications'). Variable consideration may also include performance or other incentive fees. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer per the contract.\n\nVariable consideration is only included in the transaction price for a contract to the extent it is highly probable that a signi/ficant reversal of that revenue will not occur, which is an area of accounting judgement. Factors considered in assessing whether the estimated revenue associated with Modi/fications should be recognised include the following:\n\n- i. Status of negotiations with customers\n- ii. The contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the Modi/fications\n- iii. Additional costs incurred were caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and for which entitlement contractually exists\n- iv. Modi/fication related costs are identi/fiable, measurable, and considered reasonable in view of the work performed\n- v. Evidence supporting the Modi/fication is objective and veri/fiable, which may include independent third-party advice\n- vi. Commercial and market factors speci/fic to the Modi/fications\n- vii. Historical experience in resolving Modi/fications.\n\nThis assessment is reviewed each reporting period or when facts and circumstances change during the reporting period.\n\nRevenue is recognised over time, typically based on an input method using an estimate of costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs. These contracts are typically executed on the customer's land so they control the assets as they are being built or the customer bene/fits from the service as the work is performed. Di/fferences between amounts recognised as revenue and amounts billed to customers are recognised as contract assets or liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position.\n\nThe measurement of revenue is an area of accounting judgement. Management uses judgement to estimate:\n\n- i. Progress in satisfying the performance obligations within the contract, which includes estimating contract costs expected to be incurred to satisfy performance obligations\n- ii. The probability of the amount to be recognised as variable consideration for approved variations and claims where the /final price has not been agreed with the customer.\n\nRevenue is invoiced based on the terms of each individual contract, which may include a periodic billing schedule or achievement of speci/fic milestones. Invoices are issued under commercial payment terms which are typically 30 days from when an invoice is/uni00A0issued.\n\nA provision for loss making contracts is recorded for the di/fference between the expected costs of ful/filling a contract and the expected remaining economic bene/fits to be received where the forecast remaining costs exceed the forecast remaining bene/fits.\n\n## Provision of Investment services\n\nInvestment services include funds management, asset management, leasing and origination services.\n\nEach contract with a customer to provide Investment services is typically one performance obligation with revenue recognised over time as services are rendered. Typically, our performance obligation is to manage a client's capital and/or property for a speci/fied period of time and is delivered as a series of daily performance obligations over time.\n\nThe transaction price for each contract may include variable consideration in the form of performance fees. Variable consideration is only included in the transaction price for a contract to the extent it is highly probable that a signi/ficant reversal of that revenue will not occur. The Group assesses probability of receiving variable consideration using a combination of commercial and market factors, and historical experience.\n\nRevenue is invoiced either monthly or quarterly based on the terms of each individual contract. Invoices are issued under commercial payment terms which are typically 30 days from when an invoice is issued.",

        "page_content": "## Accounting Policies continued\n\n## Sale of Development Properties\n\nThe Group develops and sells residential land lots and built form products, including residential apartments, commercial and retail buildings. Sales of residential land lots and apartments typically are recognised at a point in time, with each contract treated as a single performance obligation to transfer control of an asset to a customer. Residential land lots and apartments are recognised on settlement with the customer.\n\nThe sale of retail, commercial and mixed use assets may include land, construction, development management and investment service components. Where there are multiple components within one contract, the transaction price is allocated based on the standalone selling prices of each component, typically using the residual approach, and revenue is recognised based on the policies noted above. Sales of commercial and retail buildings are recognised when the customer obtains control of the asset based on the speci/fic terms and conditions of the sales contract.\n\nThe Group discounts deferred proceeds to re/flect the time value of money where the period between the transfer of control of a development property and receipt of payment from the customer exceeds one year. Deferred proceeds from customers are recognised in trade and other receivables where the right to receive payment is unconditional. Deposits received in advance from customers are recognised as a contract liability until the performance obligation has been met.\n\nThe measurement of revenue from the sale of development properties is an area of accounting judgement as it requires management to exercise judgement in valuing the individual components of a development property sale, given the due consideration to cost inputs, market conditions and commercial factors. The recognition and determination of when control passes requires management judgement and is considered an area of accounting judgement.\n\nProceeds from the sale of residential land lots and apartments are received upon settlement, which typically occurs between 6-12/uni00A0weeks following practical completion on the asset. Proceeds from the sale of retail, commercial and mixed use assets are received in accordance with the speci/fic terms of each contract.\n\nThe Group may enter a PLLACes (Presold Lendlease Apartment Cash Flows) transaction for certain residential apartment buildings from time to time. This involves the Group receiving an upfront cash in/flow from third party investors (investors) in exchange for selling the investors the rights to the cash proceeds that are due from customers once the apartments are completed. When customers settle their apartments the Group does not receive any cash proceeds nor does it pay any amounts to the investors as the customers pay the investors directly. On entry into a PLLACes transaction the cash in/flow is disclosed as an operating cash in/flow in the Statement of Cash Flows which typically occurs over a year in advance of the revenue recognition from the sale of the apartments. At the same time, an Other payables - PLLACes is also recognised within Trade and Other Payables and is derecognised as revenue once settlement of the apartments occurs.\n\n|                                                 | June 2022 $m   | June 2021 1 $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------|\n| Revenue from the provision of services          |                |                  |\n| Core Construction services                      | 6,572          | 6,398            |\n| Non core Construction services                  | 433            | 412              |\n| Construction services                           | 7,005          | 6,810            |\n| Investment services                             | 279            | 282              |\n| Development services                            | 928            | 496              |\n| Total revenue from the provision of services    | 8,212          | 7,588            |\n| Revenue from the sale of development properties | 610            | 1,434            |\n| Total revenue from contracts with customers 2   | 8,822          | 9,022            |\n\n- 1.

A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.\n\nFor associates, this is from the date that signi/ficant in/fluence commences until the date that signi/ficant in/fluence ceases, and for joint ventures, this is from the date joint control commences until the date joint control ceases.\n\n|                                                        | Note   | June 2022 $m   | June 2021 $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| Associates 1,2                                         |        |                |                |\n| Share of pro/fit                                       | 12.a   | 54             | 8              |\n| Joint Ventures 1,2                                     |        |                |                |\n| Share of pro/fit                                       | 12.b   | 127            | 92             |\n| Total share of pro/fit of equity accounted investments |        | 181            | 100            |\n\n## 6./uni00A0Other Income\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nNet gains or losses on sale/transfer of investments, including consolidated entities and Equity Accounted Investments are recognised when an unconditional contract is in place.\n\nNet gains or losses on fair value remeasurements are recognised in accordance with the policies stated in Note 13 'Other Financial Assets'.\n\n|                                                | June 2022 $m   | June 2021 1 $m   |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------|\n| Net gain on sale/transfer of investments       |                |                  |\n| Consolidated entities                          | 2              | 375              |\n| Asset management contract sale 2               | 167            | -                |\n| Other /financial assets at fair value          | -              | 1                |\n| Equity accounted investments                   | 86             | 4                |\n| Investment properties                          | 12             | -                |\n| Other assets and liabilities                   | 13             | 7                |\n| Total net gain on sale/transfer of investments | 280            | 387              |\n| Net gain on fair value measurement             |                |                  |\n| Investment properties 3                        | 4              | 3                |\n| Fair value through pro/fit or loss assets 4    | 65             | 61               |\n| Total net gain on fair value measurement       | 69             | 64               |\n| Other                                          | 9              | 36               |\n| Total other income                             | 358            | 487              |\n\n- 2.

        "page_content": "## 7./uni00A0Other Expenses\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nOther expenses in general are recognised as incurred.\n\n## Employee Bene/fit Expenses\n\nEmployee bene/fits are expensed as the related service by the employee is provided and includes both equity and cash based payment transactions. Employee bene/fits recognised in the Income Statement are net of recoveries.\n\nFor cash bonuses, the Group recognises an accrued liability for the amount expected to be paid. This is based on a formula that takes into consideration the pro/fit attributable to the Group's securityholders after certain adjustments. Refer to Note 35a 'Short Term Incentive (STI)' for further detail.\n\n## Share Based Compensation\n\nThe Group operates equity settled share based compensation plans that are linked to Lendlease's security price. The fair value of the equity received in exchange for the grant is recognised as an expense and a corresponding increase in equity, in the Equity Compensation Reserve. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the securities granted.\n\nThe fair value is primarily determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation model. Refer to Note 35j 'Amounts Recognised in the Financial Statements' for further detail. Management considers the fair value assigned to be an area of estimation uncertainty as it requires judgements on Lendlease's security price and whether vesting conditions will be satis/fied.\n\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the entitlement due. It recognises the impact of revision of original estimates on non market conditions, if any, in the Income Statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period. Changes in entitlement for equity settled share based compensation plans are not recognised if they fail to vest due to market conditions not being met.\n\n## Superannuation Accumulation Plan Expense\n\nAll employees in the Australia region are entitled to bene/fits on retirement, disability or death from the Group's superannuation accumulation plan. The majority of these employees are party to a de/fined contribution plan and receive /fixed contributions from the Group. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee bene/fit expense when they are due. The Group also operates a de/fined bene/fit superannuation plan, membership of which is now closed. Refer to Note 34 'De/fined Bene/fit Plans' for further detail.\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's assets, subject to impairment tests, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. The calculation of this recoverable amount is dependent on the type of asset. The material assets' accounting policies will contain further information on these calculations.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Income Statement.\n\n## Reversals of Impairment\n\nImpairment losses on assets can be reversed (other than goodwill) when there is a subsequent increase in the recoverable amount. The increase could be due to a speci/fic event, the indication that impairment may no longer exist or there is a change in estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.\n\nAn impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n\n## Lease Expense\n\nShort term lease and low value lease payments, including outgoings, are recognised in the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortisation\n\nDepreciation on owned assets is charged to the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment. Amortisation is provided on leasehold improvements over the remaining term of the lease. Most plant is depreciated over a period not exceeding 20 years, furniture and /fittings over three to 15 years, motor vehicles over four to eight years and computer equipment over three years.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term.",

Income tax is recognised in the Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

Temporary di/fferences are provided for any di/fferences in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities between the accounting and tax balance sheets. The following temporary di/fferences are not provided for:\n\n- \u00b7 The initial recognition of taxable goodwill\n- \u00b7 The initial recognition of assets or liabilities that a/ffect neither accounting nor taxable pro/fit\n- \u00b7 Di/fferences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they are not likely to reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nMeasurement of deferred tax is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using applicable tax rates (and tax laws) at the balance sheet date.\n\nRecognition of deferred tax assets is only to the extent it is probable that future taxable pro/fits will be available so as the related tax asset will be realised. Deferred tax assets may include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Deductible temporary di/fferences\n- \u00b7 Unused tax losses\n- \u00b7 Unused tax credits.\n\nManagement considers the estimation of future taxable pro/fits to be an area of estimation uncertainty as a change in any of the assumptions used in budgeting and forecasting would have an impact on the future pro/fitability of the Group. The Group prepares /financial budgets and forecasts, covering a /five year period, which are reviewed on a regular basis. These forecasts and budgets form the basis of future pro/fitability to support the carrying value of the deferred tax assets. The performance of the Group is in/fluenced by a variety of general economic and business conditions, which are outside the control of the Group, including the level of in/flation, interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices, ability to access funding, oversupply and demand conditions and government /fiscal, monetary and regulatory policies.\n\nPresentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities can be o/ffset if there is a legally enforceable right to o/ffset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on di/fferent tax entities, but are intended to be settled on a net basis or to be realised simultaneously.\n\n## Tax Consolidation\n\nThe Company is the head entity of the Australian Tax Consolidated Group comprising all the Australian wholly owned subsidiaries, excluding LLT. As a consequence, all members of the Australian Tax Consolidation Group are taxed as a single entity.",

Mitsubishi Estate currently holds a 19.9 per cent interest in the joint venture. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, this will increase to 66.7 per cent and Lendlease's ownership will reduce to 33.3 per cent. Lendlease will receive an acquisition fee on settlement, earn development management and construction management fees, equity returns on its capital and potentially performance fees.\n\nOn 9 August 2022, the Group exchanged contracts with a third party to acquire a further 13 per cent interest in the asset management income stream of the Group's Military Housing portfolio, through the existing DoD Asset Management Holdings joint venture. The Group received $86/uni00A0million in consideration on /financial close, generating an estimated pre tax gain on sale of $73/uni00A0million.\n\nThere were no other material events subsequent to the end of the /financial reporting period.",

This section includes disclosures for property such as Inventories and indirect property assets such as Equity Accounted Investments and Other Financial Assets contained within the Statement of Financial Position.\n\n## 11./uni00A0Inventories\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\n## Development Properties\n\nProperty acquired for development and sale in the ordinary course of business is carried at the lower of cost and Net Realisable Value (NRV).\n\nThe cost of development properties includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the property, preparing it for sale and borrowing costs incurred.\n\nThe NRV is the estimated selling price, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. Management considers the estimation of both selling prices and costs of completion to be an area of estimation uncertainty, as these estimations take into consideration market conditions a/ffecting each property and the underlying strategy for selling the property.\n\nThe recoverable amount of each property is assessed at each balance date and accounting judgement is required to assess whether a provision is raised where cost (including costs to complete) exceeds NRV.\n\nInventories are expensed as cost of sales in the Income Statement. Management uses accounting judgement in determining the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The apportionment of cost of sales through sales revenue\n- \u00b7 The amount of cost of sales, which includes costs incurred to date and /final forecast costs\n- \u00b7 The nature of the expenditure, which may include acquisition costs, development costs, borrowing costs and those costs incurred in preparing the property for sale.\n\n## Construction Contract Assets\n\nThe gross amount of Construction and Development Work in Progress consists of costs attributable to work performed, including recoverable pre contract and project bidding costs and emerging pro/fit after providing for any foreseeable losses. In applying the accounting policies on providing for these losses, accounting judgement is required.\n\nConstruction contract assets are presented as part of inventories for all contracts in which revenue recognised (costs incurred plus recognised pro/fits) exceed progress billings. If progress billings and/or recognised contract losses exceed revenue recognised, then the di/fference is presented in Trade and other payables as a Construction contract liability.\n\n|                              | Note   | June 2022 $m   | June 2021 $m   |\n|------------------------------|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| Current                      |        |                |                |\n| Development properties 1     |        | 792            | 894            |\n| Construction contract assets | 21.a   | 664            | 565            |\n| Other                        |        | 3              | 10             |\n| Total current                |        | 1,459          | 1,469          |\n| Non Current                  |        |                |                |\n| Development properties 1     |        | 2,320          | 2,404          |\n| Total non current            |        | 2,320          | 2,404          |\n| Total inventories            |        | 3,779          | 3,873          |",

        "page_content": "## 12./uni00A0Equity Accounted Investments\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\n## Equity Accounted Investments (Associates and Joint Ventures)\n\nAs outlined in Note 5 'Share of Pro/fit of Equity Accounted Investments', investments in Associates and Joint Ventures are equity accounted. The share of investment recognised under the equity method is the Group's share of the investment's net assets based on ownership interest held.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are carried at the lower of the equity accounted carrying amount and the recoverable amount. When the Group's share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the equity accounted investment (including assets that form part of the net investment in the associate or joint venture entity), the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has obligations in respect of the associate or joint venture.\n\nDividends from associates and joint ventures represent a return on the Group's investment and, as such, are applied as a reduction to the carrying value of the investment. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investments are eliminated against the investment in the associate or joint venture to the extent of the Group's interest in the associate or joint venture. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. Other movements in associates' and joint ventures' reserves are recognised directly in the Group's consolidated reserves.\n\n## Development - Investment Property\n\nInvestments in this category hold investment property that is under construction and is subject to periodic revaluations. These revaluations represent development pro/fit earned and are recognised in the Development segment.\n\n## Development - Inventory\n\nInvestments in this category contain inventory under development and are held at cost. Revenue is recognised once the inventory settles with the customer and is recognised in the Development segment.\n\n## Service Concession Arrangements (SCAs)\n\nThe Group equity accounts its investment in project companies with SCAs through Public Private Partnerships (PPPs). These arrangements provide facilities management and maintenance services with terms generally of 25 to 30 years. They also incorporate contractual obligations to make available the individual assets for their prescribed use and, where necessary, overhaul or replace major items of plant and equipment related to the assets with payment obtained through periodic draw downs from the relevant government authorities.\n\n## Joint Operations\n\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement.\n\nInvestments in joint operations are accounted for by recognising amounts on a line by line basis in accordance with the accounting standards applicable to the particular assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in relation to the Group's interest in the joint/uni00A0operation.\n\n|                                    | Note   | June 2022 $m   | June 2021 $m   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| Associates                         |        |                |                |\n| Investment in associates           | 12.a   | 598            | 444            |\n| Less:  Impairment                  | 12.a   | -              | (3)            |\n| Total associates                   |        | 598            | 441            |\n| Joint Ventures                     |        |                |                |\n| Investment in joint ventures       | 12.b   | 3,806          | 3,356          |\n| Less:  Impairment                  | 12.b   | (25)           | (39)           |\n| Total joint ventures               |        | 3,781          | 3,317          |\n| Total equity accounted investments |        | 4,379          | 3,758          |",

Under the amortised cost method the di/fference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value is recorded in the Income Statement over the period of the borrowing on an e/ffective interest basis. Borrowings are referred to in this section using their redemption value when describing the terms and conditions.",

        "page_content": "## 17.b./uni00A0Security Accumulation Plans\n\nThe Group's Distribution Reinvestment Plan (DRP) was reactivated in February 2011. The last date for receipt of an election notice for participation in the DRP is 30 August 2022. The issue price is the arithmetic average of the daily volume weighted average price of Lendlease Group stapled securities traded (on the Australian Securities Exchange) for the period of /five consecutive business days immediately following the record date, commencing on 30 August 2022, for determining entitlements to distribution. If that price is less than 50 cents, the issue price will be 50 cents. Stapled securities issued under the DRP rank equally with all other stapled securities on issue.\n\n## 17.c./uni00A0Terms and Conditions\n\nIssued capital for Lendlease Corporation Limited comprises ordinary shares fully paid. A stapled security represents one share in the Company stapled to one unit in LLT. Stapled securityholders have the right to receive declared dividends from the Company and distributions from LLT and are entitled to one vote per stapled security at securityholders' meetings. Ordinary stapled securityholders rank after all creditors in repayment of capital.\n\nThe Group does not have authorised capital or par value in respect of its issued stapled securities.\n\n## 18./uni00A0Capital Management\n\nThe Group assesses capital management as part of its broader strategic plan. The Group focuses on interrelated /financial parameters, including Return on Equity, earnings growth and borrowing capacity. The Group also monitors its gearing ratio, leverage ratio, interest coverage ratio and weighted average cost of debt and maturity pro/file. These are all taken into account when the Group makes decisions on how to invest its capital and evaluate its existing investments.\n\nThe Group's capital includes total equity, borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities. When investing capital, the Group's objective is to deliver strong total securityholder returns and to maintain an investment grade credit rating by maintaining an appropriate /financial pro/file. The Moody's/Fitch long term credit ratings at 30 June 2022 are Baa3/BBB- respectively (June 2021: Baa3/BBB-).\n\nThe capital structure of the Group can be changed by equity issuance, paying distributions to securityholders, the Distribution Reinvestment Plan and changing the level of debt. For further information on how the Group allocates and manages capital, refer to details of the Portfolio Management Framework in the Managing and Measuring Value - Financial section and Performance and Outlook section of this Annual Report.\n\n## 19./uni00A0Liquidity Risk Exposure\n\nFurther information on liquidity risk is disclosed in Note 24 'Financial Risk Management'. As disclosed in Note 27 'Contingent Liabilities', in certain circumstances, the Company guarantees the performance of particular Group entities in respect of their obligations including bonding and bank guarantees. Issued bank guarantees have cash collateralisation requirements if the bank guarantee facility is not renewed by the provider.\n\nAt 30 June 2022, the Group does not anticipate a signi/ficant liquidity risk in relation to the following /financial liabilities. This is due to the Group's strong /financial pro/file, as supported by the signi/ficant committed undrawn facilities and low gearing ratio. Refer to Note 14 'Cash and Cash Equivalents' and Note 16 'Borrowings and Financing Arrangements'.\n\nThe Group has provided collateral of $nil (June 2021: $nil) against letter of credit facilities.",

They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivable. Contract debtors represent receivables where the right to receive payment from customers remains conditional. Other receivables include receivables related to investment management, property development and miscellaneous items.\n\nLoans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest method, which applies the interest rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts over the term of the loans and receivables. Cash /flows relating to short term trade and other receivables are not discounted if the e/ffect of discounting is immaterial. The discount, if material, is then recognised as revenue over the remaining term.\n\nThe Group assesses provision for impairment of loans and receivables based on expected loss, and books a provision if material.

Trade and other payables are settled in the normal course of business. Trade and other payables are carried at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest method, which applies the interest rate that discounts estimated future cash out/flows over the term of the trade and other payables. Cash /flows relating to short term trade and other payables are not discounted if the e/ffect of discounting is immaterial. The discount, if material, is then recognised as an expense over the remaining term.\n\n## Construction Contract Liabilities\n\nConstruction contracts where the total progress billings issued to clients (together with foreseeable losses, if applicable) on a project exceed the revenue recognised (costs incurred to date plus recognised pro/fit) on the contract are recognised as a liability.\n\n## Retentions\n\nRetentions are amounts payable for the purpose of security and for the provision of defects in accordance with contract terms. Release of retention amounts are in accordance with contractual terms.\n\n## Unearned Income\n\nPrimarily relates to unearned income and deposits received in advance on presold apartments. These amounts will be recognised as income in line with the 'Sale of development properties' accounting policy in Note 4 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'.\n\n## Lease Liabilities\n\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. The/uni00A0Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.",

The total transaction price relating to the Group's Unearned income on the Group's development contracts at June 2022 is $439/uni00A0million relating primarily to various UK and Australian projects. The di/fference between the Unearned income amount noted in the table above and this amount primarily relates to the remaining development value of apartments versus the deposit amount received. Revenue from these contracts is expected to be realised as control over each asset is transferred to the customer.\n\nThe total transaction price allocated to unsatis/fied performance obligations on the Group's construction contracts as at June 2022 is $14.8/uni00A0billion. This includes new work secured during the /financial year. Of the total construction backlog, 54 per cent is expected to be realised within the next 12 months to June 2023 (June 2021: 44 per cent to June 2022), 30 per cent to June 2024 (June 2021: 31 per cent to June 2023) and the remaining 16 per cent realised post June 2024 (June 2021: 25 per cent post June 2023).",

Derivative counterparties and cash deposits are limited to recognised /financial intermediaries with a minimum investment grade credit rating as determined by a recognised rating agency\n- \u00b7 Refer to Note 21 'Loans and Receivables' for information relating to impairment on loans and receivables\n- \u00b7 In certain circumstances, the Group will hold either /financial or non /financial assets as collateral to further mitigate the potential credit risk on selected transactions.

A one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have decreased the Group's equity and Pro/fit after tax by $6/uni00A0million (June 2021: $3/uni00A0million decrease in the Group's equity and Pro/fit after tax). The increase or decrease in interest income/(expense) is proportional to the increase or decrease in interest rates. Interest rate derivatives have been included in this calculation.\n\n## 25./uni00A0Hedging\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nThe Group uses derivative /financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operating, /financing and investing activities. Derivative /financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value. Hedge accounting recognises the o/ffsetting e/ffects on pro/fit or loss of changes in the fair value of the derivative /financial instruments and the hedged item. The accounting for hedges that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are classi/fied as either fair value hedges, cash /flow hedges or investment hedges.\n\nThe Group has minimal hedges designated at fair value. The Group primarily uses forward foreign exchange contracts as cash /flow hedges for highly probable sale, purchase and dividend transactions. The Group also uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge cross border intercompany loans and transactions which mainly net o/ff in the Income Statement. Interest rate swaps and interest rate options are used to manage the Group's exposure to interest rates arising from borrowings. These are primarily treated as cash /flow hedges and are mainly on borrowings within equity accounted investments.\n\nThe Group has foreign exchange derivative contracts primarily held in GBP, USD, EUR, SGD and CNY at reporting date to hedge speci/fic foreign currency exposures. The total gross payable exposure is $1,663/uni00A0million (June 2021: payable $1,045/uni00A0million).\n\nThere are 31 foreign currency contracts that will mature in more than one year (June 2021: 62 foreign currency contracts).",

Fair value of unlisted equity investments has also taken the COVID pandemic and other economic conditions into consideration to determine fair value at 30 June 2022. This included valuations of underlying investment properties at balance date\n- \u00b7 The fair values of other /financial assets and /financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) are determined in accordance with generally accepted valuation techniques; these include the use of recent arm's length transactions, reference to other assets that are substantially the same, and discounted cash /flow analysis\n- \u00b7 The fair value of derivative instruments comprises forward foreign exchange contracts, which are valued using forward rates at balance date, and interest rate swap contracts, which are measured at the present value of future cash /flows estimated and discounted based on applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates and include consideration of counterparty risk adjustments.\n\n## 26.b./uni00A0Fair Value Measurements\n\nThe di/fferent levels for valuation method have been de/fined as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: The fair value is determined using the unadjusted quoted price for an identical asset or liability in an active market for identical assets or liabilities\n- \u00b7 Level 2: The fair value is calculated using predominantly observable market data other than unadjusted quoted prices for an identical asset or liability\n- \u00b7 Level 3: The fair value is calculated using inputs that are not based on observable market data.\n\nDuring the /financial year, there were no material transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 fair value hierarchies.",

Such claims and exposures largely arise in respect of claims for defects (including under both contract and legislation), claims for breach of performance obligations or breach of warranty or claims under indemnities. In some claims:\n- - There is uncertainty as to whether a legal obligation exists;\n- - There is uncertainty as to whether a future cash out/flow will arise in respect to these items; and/or\n- - It is not possible to quantify the potential exposure with su/fficient reliability.\n\nThis particularly applies in larger more complex projects, in claims involving a number of parties or in claims made a number of years after completion of a project.\n\nWhere it is probable there will be liabilities from such claims and the potential exposure can be quanti/fied with su/fficient reliability, a provision has been made for anticipated losses arising from such claims.\n\n- \u00b7 In certain circumstances, the Company guarantees the performance of particular Group entities in respect of their obligations. This includes bonding and bank guarantee facilities used primarily by the Construction business as well as performance guarantees for certain of the Company's subsidiaries.\n- \u00b7 Securities Class Action\n\nOn 18 April 2019, Lendlease Corporation and Lendlease Responsible Entity (Lendlease Group) were served with a shareholder class action proceeding /filed in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 18 April 2019 by David William Pallas and Julie Ann Pallas as trustees for the Pallas Family Superannuation Fund, represented by Maurice Blackburn. On 7 August 2019, Lendlease Corporation and Lendlease Responsible Entity (Lendlease Group) were served with a shareholder class action proceeding /filed in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 6 August 2019 by Martin John Fletcher, represented by Phi Finney McDonald. On 21 November 2019 the Supreme Court ordered consolidation of the two class actions into a single proceeding. The consolidated proceeding alleges that Lendlease was in breach of its continuous disclosure obligations under the Corporations Act 2001 and made representations about its Engineering and Services business that were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. It is currently not possible to determine the ultimate impact of these claims, if any, on Lendlease Group. Lendlease Group denies the allegations and intends to vigorously defend this proceeding.",

The disclosures detail the types of entities and transactions included in the consolidation and those excluded.\n\n## 28./uni00A0Consolidated Entities\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nThe Group consolidation comprises all subsidiaries controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company:\n\n- \u00b7 Has the power to direct the relevant activities such as key operating, /financial and investing decisions\n- \u00b7 Has exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee such as dividends, loans and fees\n- \u00b7 Has the ability to use its power over the investee to a/ffect the amount of returns.\n\nIn assessing control, potential voting rights that are presently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. Management uses accounting judgement in determining whether the Group controls an entity by applying the above control criteria and reviewing the substance of its relationship with the entity.\n\nThe /financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated /financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

These vehicles, while not legally controlled, are currently required to be consolidated for accounting purposes.\n\n## 29.a./uni00A0Employee Security Plans\n\nAs at 30 June 2022, employees own approximately 0.9 per cent (June 2021: 0.9 per cent) of the issued capital of the Group through various active Lendlease employee security plans and ownership vehicles, details of which are outlined below:\n\n- \u00b7 Australia: Employee Share Acquisition Plan (ESAP): ESAP was established in December 1988 for the purpose of employees acquiring securities in the Group and is funded by Lendlease subscriptions, and employee salary sacri/fice contributions\n- \u00b7 Americas: US Rabbi Trust (Rabbi Trust) was established in 2004 and updated in 2005 for the acceptance of employee pro/fit share contributions used to acquire Group securities for US based employees. This part of the plan is not currently accepting new contributions\n- \u00b7 Employee Share Acquisition Plan (STI) (ESAP STI): ESAP STI was established in July 2014 for the purpose of acquiring and allocating securities granted as the deferred component of Short Term Incentive (STI) awards, which are funded by Lendlease subscriptions. Securities are currently allocated to employees across Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n## Eligibility\n\nThe eligibility rules for each plan are determined by reference to the regulatory, legal and tax rules of each country in which the Group operates.\n\n## Distributions and/or Voting Rights\n\nGenerally, employees in the various operating security plans are entitled to distributions and voting rights for allocated securities. The plans re/flect this intention subject to regulatory, legal and tax constraints. The trustee may exercise these rights in accordance with any /fiduciary or governance rules pertaining to the deed or trust laws in the legal and tax jurisdiction within which the trust operates.\n\n## 29.b./uni00A0Employee Security Ownership Vehicles\n\nIn addition to the plans discussed above, Lendlease has an employee security ownership vehicle, Lendlease Retirement Bene/fit Fund (RBF):\n\n- \u00b7 RBF was established in 1984 with shareholder approval for the bene/fit of employees. RBF holds Lendlease securities. The Lendlease securities in RBF are not available for allocation to employees other than in the event of a change of control of the Group and, in accordance with RBF's trust deed, the capital of the trust is not available to the Group. The RBF trustee has discretion as to the distribution of the RBF funds. In 1992, a deed poll was executed which allows for the distribution of the income of RBF to the Company to fund employee bene/fit activities through the Lendlease Foundation. As a result of changes to the constitution and governance structure of the RBF trustee on 22/uni00A0June 2017, Lendlease currently does not have control of RBF and therefore RBF is currently not required to be consolidated for accounting purposes\n- \u00b7 The RBF arrangement is subject to periodic review to assess its ongoing role and operation.",

Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets as goodwill. Goodwill on acquisition of associates is included in the carrying value of investments in associates.\n\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.\n\nFor the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (CGUs) (or groups of CGUs) that are expected to bene/fit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. CGUs are an identi/fiable group of assets that generate cash associated with the goodwill. Management considers this is an area of estimation uncertainty as these calculations involve an estimation of the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the goodwill is allocated. The Construction CGUs use the value in use basis, which requires the Group to estimate the future cash /flows expected to arise from the CGUs and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the recoverable amounts.\n\nManagement agreements and other intangible assets acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses (see Note 7 'Other Expenses'). Amortisation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets, ranging from three to 20 years.\n\n|                         | Note   | June 2022 $m   | June 2021 $m   |\n|-------------------------|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| Goodwill                | 32.a   | 1,056          | 1,200          |\n| Management agreements   |        | 24             | 33             |\n| Other intangibles 1     |        | 145            | 223            |\n| Total intangible assets |        | 1,225          | 1,456          |\n\n32.a./uni00A0Goodwill\n\n|                                                                                       | Note   | June 2022 $m   | June 2021 $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| Development                                                                           |        | 33             | 30             |\n| Construction                                                                          |        | 1,023          | 1,170          |\n| Total goodwill                                                                        |        | 1,056          | 1,200          |\n| Reconciliations of the carrying amounts for each category of goodwill are as follows: |        |                |                |\n| Development                                                                           |        |                |                |\n| Carrying amount at beginning of /financial year                                       |        | 30             | 32             |\n| E/ffect of foreign exchange rate movements                                            |        | 3              | (2)            |\n| Carrying amount at end of /financial year                                             |        | 33             | 30             |\n| Construction                                                                          |        |                |                |\n| Carrying amount at beginning of /financial year                                       |        | 1,170          | 1,181          |\n| Disposals                                                                             |        | (151)          | -              |\n| E/ffect of foreign exchange rate/other movements                                      |        | 4              | (11)           |\n| Carrying amount at end of /financial year                                             | 32.b   | 1,023          | 1,170          |",

For the Construction CGUs, the assumptions used for determining the recoverable amount of each CGU are based on past experience and expectations for the future, utilising both internal and external sources of data and relevant industry trends.\n\nNo impairment arose as a result of the review of goodwill for the Construction CGUs for the /financial year ended 30 June 2022. Based on information available and market conditions at 30 June 2022, a reasonably foreseeable change in the assumptions made in this assessment would not result in impairment of Construction goodwill. The foreseeable change in the assumptions took the COVID pandemic and other economic conditions into consideration.\n\nThe following describes the key assumptions on which management has based its cash /flow projections when determining VIU relating to the Construction CGUs:\n\n## Cash Flows\n\nThe VIU calculations use pre tax cash /flow projections based on actual operating results, and /financial forecasts covering a /five year period which have been approved by management. These forecasts are based on management estimates to determine income, expenses, capital expenditure and cash /flows for each CGU.\n\n## Growth Rate\n\nThe terminal value growth rate used to extrapolate the cash /flows beyond the /five year period is 3.0 per cent (June 2021: 3.0 per cent). The growth rate re/flects the forecast long term average growth rate for each CGU and the countries in which they operate.\n\n## Discount Rate\n\nThe discount rates applied to the cash /flow projections vary between 9.2 per cent and 11.0 per cent (June 2021: between 8.9 per cent and 12.4 per cent). The Group's weighted average cost of capital is used as a starting point for determining the discount rate, with appropriate adjustments for the risk pro/file relating to the relevant CGUs and the countries in which they operate. The discount rates used are pre tax.\n\n## 33./uni00A0Discontinued Operations\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nDiscontinued operations relate to a component of the Group including its corresponding assets and liabilities that have been classi/fied as held for sale and represent a separate major line of business or geographical area of operation. The group of assets and their corresponding liabilities (together referred to as a Disposal Group), may only be classi/fied as held for sale once the following criteria are met:\n\n- \u00b7 The carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use\n- \u00b7 The sale must be highly probable.\n\nA Disposal Group is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Where fair value is lower than the carrying amount, the di/fference is recognised as an impairment loss within the Income Statement.\n\nThe results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the Income Statement and Statement of Comprehensive Income. Comparatives have also been re-presented for the Income Statement, Statement of Comprehensive Income and corresponding Notes to separately disclose the results of discontinued operations from continuing operations.",

Management at that time committed to a plan to exit from Non core operations of Engineering and Services.\n\nOn 19 December 2019, the Group entered into an agreement with Acciona to sell its Engineering business and on 9 September 2020 the Group completed the sale. The agreed purchase price for the sale of the Engineering business was $160/uni00A0million which was adjusted by $37/uni00A0million at completion, resulting in total estimated proceeds of $197/uni00A0million. $163/uni00A0million has been received by 30 June 2022. Acciona has not paid the balance of the /final deferred payment which was due on 30 June 2021, claiming various amounts should be set o/ff against that payment. This is disputed by Lendlease and legal proceedings are ongoing to seek recovery of payments due by Acciona.\n\nOn 21 July 2021, the Group entered into an agreement with Service Stream to sell the Services business and on 1 November 2021 the Group completed the sale. The agreed purchase price for the sale of the Services business was $310/uni00A0million which was adjusted by $21/uni00A0million at completion, resulting in total estimated proceeds of $331/uni00A0million. $317/uni00A0million has been received by 30 June 2022. As a result of the sale, the 30 June 2021 results have been re-presented to include the Services business as part of discontinued operations.\n\nThe discontinued operations represent the Services business sold in the current year and the Engineering business sold in the prior year, excluding the projects retained by the Group.\n\nThe major classes of assets and liabilities sold are as follows:\n\n|                                  | SERVICES 1 November 2021   | ENGINEERING 9 September 2020   |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Assets and Liabilities Sold      | $m                         | $m                             |\n| Cash and cash equivalents        | 3                          | 411                            |\n| Loans and receivables            | 84                         | 187                            |\n| Inventories                      | 145                        | 34                             |\n| Other assets                     | 276                        | 215                            |\n| Total assets sold                | 508                        | 847                            |\n| Trade and other payables         | 121                        | 610                            |\n| Other liabilities                | 97                         | 50                             |\n| Total liabilities sold           | 218                        | 660                            |\n| Net assets and liabilities sold  | 290                        | 187                            |\n| Net proceeds from sale           | 331                        | 197                            |\n| Transaction and separation costs | (25)                       | (10)                           |\n| Gain on sale                     | 16                         | -                              |\n\nThe results of the discontinued operations representing the Services and Engineering business for the current and prior period are as follows:\n\n|                                                                                           | SERVICES 1 July to 1 November 2021   | 12 months June 2021 1   | ENGINEERING 1 July to 9 September 2020   | TOTAL 12 months June 2021 1   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Results from Discontinued Operations                                                      | $m                                   | $m                      | $m                                       | $m                            |\n| Revenue from contracts with customers                                                     | 351                                  | 749                     | 283                                      | 1,032                         |\n| Cost of sales                                                                             | (320)                                | (697)                   | (272)                                    | (969)                         |\n| Gross pro/fit                                                                             | 31                                   | 52                      | 11                                       | 63                            |\n| Other income                                                                              | -                                    | 1                       | 1                                        | 2                             |\n| Gain on sale                                                                              | 16                                   | -                       | -                                        | -                             |\n| Other expenses                                                                            | (19)                                 | (32)                    | (13)                                     | (45)                          |\n| Pro/fit/(Loss) before tax for discontinued operations                                     | 28                                   | 21                      | (1)                                      | 20                            |\n| Income tax (expense)/bene/fit                                                             | (1)                                  | (7)                     | 3                                        | (4)                           |\n| Total pro/fit after tax for discontinued operations as  presented in the Income Statement | 27                                   | 14                      | 2                                        | 16                            |",

The plans are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or trustee administered funds as determined by periodic actuarial calculations.\n\nA de/fined bene/fit plan is a pension plan that de/fines the amount of pension bene/fit an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.\n\nThe asset or liability recognised in the Statement of Financial Position in respect of de/fined bene/fit plans is the present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligation i.e. 'the pension liability' at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. The present value of the pension liability is determined by discounting the estimated future cash out/flows using interest rates of high quality corporate or government bonds, that:\n\n- \u00b7 Are denominated in the currency in which the bene/fits will be paid\n- \u00b7 Have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.\n\nThe de/fined bene/fit obligation is calculated at least annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method, which in simplistic terms proportions the bene/fit based on service. Management considers the valuation of de/fined bene/fit plans undertaken by the actuaries to be an area of estimation uncertainty as a number of key assumptions must be adopted to determine the valuation.\n\nActuarial losses/(gains) will arise where there is a di/fference between previous estimates and actual experience, or a change to assumptions in relation to demographic and /financial trends. These actuarial losses/(gains) are recognised in the period they occur, directly in other comprehensive income as remeasurements. They are included in retained earnings in the Statement of Changes in Equity and in the Statement of Financial Position.\n\nPast service costs are recognised immediately in the Income Statement.\n\n|                                        | Note   | June 2022 $m   | June 2021 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| Lendlease Superannuation Plan          |        | -              | -              |\n| Lendlease UK Pension Scheme            | 34.a   | 282            | 243            |\n| Total net de/fined bene/fit plan asset |        | 282            | 243            |\n\n## 34.a./uni00A0Lendlease UK Pension Scheme\n\nLendlease Construction Holdings (Europe) Limited (UK Construction) sponsors a funded de/fined bene/fit pension scheme (the Scheme) for qualifying UK employees. The Scheme is administered by a separate board of Trustees which is legally separate from UK Construction. The Scheme's Trustees are composed of representatives of both the employer and employees. The Trustees are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant bene/ficiaries and are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets plus the day to day administration of the bene/fits.\n\nThe Scheme is a funded de/fined bene/fit scheme, with the /final salary section providing retirement bene/fits based on /final salary and the index linked section providing retirement bene/fits based on career average salary. A separate section, the Personal Investment Section, provides retirement bene/fits on a de/fined contribution basis. The UK Construction's contributions to members' Personal Investment Fund accounts are not included in these disclosures.\n\nThe /final salary section closed to future accruals on 31 August 2008 and the index linked section closed to future accruals on 31 January 2012. There were no Scheme amendments a/ffecting de/fined bene/fits payable, curtailments or settlements during the year./uni00A0UK Construction pays four per cent of members' basic salaries to cover the Scheme's expected administration costs and costs of bene/fits payable on death in service. Following the triennial valuation for 31 March 2020, de/ficit repair contributions are not required to be paid as the scheme is in an actuarial surplus.\n\nThe de/fined bene/fit plan is exposed to actuarial risk and market (investment) risk.

The plan assets can be categorised as Level 1, where the fair value is determined using an unadjusted quoted price for an identical asset, or Level 2, where the fair value is derived either directly or indirectly from observable inputs, or Level 3, where inputs are unobservable (i.e. for which market data is unavailable). At year end, approximately $1,077/uni00A0million (June 2021: $1,428/uni00A0million) and $107/uni00A0million (June 2021: $87/uni00A0million) of total plan assets were categorised as Level 2 and Level 3, respectively. UK Construction and Trustees have agreed to a long term strategy for reducing investment risk as and when appropriate. This includes an asset-liability matching policy which aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the pension plan by investing in assets that perform in line with the liabilities of the plan so as to protect against in/flation being higher than expected. The current targeted benchmark allocation is 22.5 per cent growth assets and 77.5 per cent matching assets (June 2021: 67.5 per cent growth assets and 32.5 per cent matching assets).\n\n|                                          | June 2022   | June 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| vi.

If assets underperform this yield, this will create a/uni00A0de/ficit.\n\nA decrease in corporate bond yield will increase the value placed on the Scheme's liabilities, although this will be partially o/ffset by an increase in the value of the Scheme's corporate bond holdings. The majority of the Scheme's bene/fit obligations are linked to in/flation and higher in/flation will lead to higher liabilities, although in most cases this will be capped to protect against extreme in/flation. The majority of the assets are either una/ffected by or loosely correlated with in/flation, meaning that an increase in in/flation will also increase the de/ficit. The majority of the Scheme's obligations are to provide bene/fits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities. The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for expected future mortality improvements. The assumption is that a member aged 63 will live for a further 25.3 years (June 2021: 25.3 years) if they are male and 26.8 years if they are female (June 2021: 26.3 years).\n\nAt 30 June 2022, the weighted average duration of the de/fined bene/fit obligation was 16 years (June 2021: 18 years).\n\n## vii.

Once in payment, pension increases are linked to RPI but with a zero per cent /floor and di/fferent caps applying to di/fferent periods of pensionable service. The in/flation sensitivity re/flects a change in RPI in/flation and the associated increases in payment.\n\n## 35./uni00A0Employee Bene/fits\n\nDetailed information regarding the Group's Executive Reward strategy is provided in the Remuneration Report within the Directors' Report. The key incentive plans are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Short Term Incentive (STI)\n- \u00b7 Short Term Award (STA)\n- \u00b7 Long Term Incentive (LTI)\n- \u00b7 Long Term Award (LTA)\n- \u00b7 Restricted Securities Award (RSA)\n- \u00b7 Executive Deferred Award (ED Award)\n- \u00b7 Deferred Equity Award (DEA)\n- \u00b7 Pro Rata CEO Grant\n- \u00b7 Google Development Ventures (GDV) Incentive.\n\n## 35.a./uni00A0Short Term Incentive (STI)\n\nThe STI plan is an annual incentive plan whereby a number of employees receive bene/fits which are dependent upon the achievement of both Lendlease /financial and non /financial targets, and individual goals. The total value of the potential bene/fit varies by individual and is tested against relevant market levels for each role.\n\n- \u00b7 The STI plan typically comprises a cash component, which is paid in September following year end. For more senior employees, where the potential bene/fit is typically higher, the plan also includes a deferred component\n- \u00b7 Deferral periods are generally for one or two years. The deferred component is normally awarded as Lendlease securities and in some instances as cash. Securities are held in Lendlease employee security plan trusts on behalf of employees for the deferral period (refer to Note 29a 'Employee Security Plans'). For employees to receive the deferred component in full, they must generally be employed by the Group at the time of vesting.",

        "page_content": "## 35.b./uni00A0Short Term Award (STA)\n\nThe STA plan is an annual incentive plan which replaced the STI for a limited number of senior executives from 2019. It is designed to focus senior executives on priority areas for delivery in the current /financial year, including key Group and regional /financial targets, safety and other non /financial targets aligned to the Group's areas of focus.\n\nWhilst performance is assessed against a set of Group metrics when determining awards, the Board will assess the overall performance and contribution of individual senior executives, with a particular focus on safety.\n\nThe total value of the potential bene/fit varies by individual and is set with reference to both internal peers and external market levels. For FY20 and FY21, the STA plan has been awarded as cash in September following year end. From FY22 onwards, 50 per cent of awarded STA will be a deferred grant of Lendlease securities. The deferred portion will be released in two equal tranches after one and two years.\n\n## 35.c./uni00A0Long Term Incentive (LTI)\n\nThe LTI plan is designed to:\n\n- \u00b7 Motivate executives to achieve the Group's long term strategic goals and provide reward where the Group delivers better value to securityholders than its peers\n- \u00b7 Align the interests of executives and securityholders, given that the reward received is linked to the Group's security price and average Return on Equity performance.\n\n## Arrangements for LTI Awards\n\n| LTI Design

The Group contracts in a variety of ways. Each project has a different risk profile based on its individual contractual and delivery characteristics.\n\nCurrently, global market conditions are uncertain with disruption to supply chains and inflationary pressures. These conditions, combined with the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, continue to create a challenging operating environment impacting productivity, expected timing of completion and expected costs to complete. Other impacts include projects being put on hold in some markets, with some delays in securing and commencement of new projects.\n\nConstruction revenue recognition is a key audit matter as judgement is required to assess the timing of recognition determined by the Group. Revenue on construction contracts is earned over time, typically using costs incurred as a proportion of total forecast costs as the measure of progress.\n\nEstimating total forecast costs to complete during project life is complex and requires judgement. Typical cost estimates include labour, subcontractors, equipment, materials, and project\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluating and testing management's review and approval of revenue and cost forecasting;\n- \u00b7 Selecting a sample of contracts for testing using:\n- -Data Analytic routines based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, related to size and risk of projects; and\n- -the Group's project reporting tool.\n- \u00b7 For the sample selected, we:\n- -conducted visits to a selection of project sites to evidence physical progress;\n- -inquired with key project personnel to assess the project schedule, forecast costs, risks and opportunities, with involvement from KPMG engineering specialists where appropriate;\n- -read relevant contract terms and conditions to evaluate the inclusion of individual characteristics and project risks in the Group's estimates;\n- -tested a sample of incurred costs to supplier invoices or other underlying documentation;\n- -tested forecast costs for labour, subcontractors, equipment, materials, and project overheads by comparing to actual incurred spend, committed future contracts and current market quotes, with specific consideration of inflation in our assessment of contingency;\n- -tested the variations and claims (including COVID-19 related impacts) recognised within revenue against the criteria for recognition in the accounting standards via inspection and assessment of:",

These are recognised on a contract-by-contract basis when evidence supports that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognised will not occur.\n\nThe assessment of revenue on construction contracts resulting from variations and claims was a focus of our audit due to the audit effort in assessing this across bespoke projects and contracting arrangements.\n\n## Sale of development Properties (A$610m)\n\nRefer to Note 4 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' to the Financial Report\n\n## The key audit matter\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nThe Group develops for sale both built form products (for example residential apartments, and commercial and retail buildings) and residential land lots. It is the Group's policy for development revenue to be recognised when control transfers to the purchaser, based on an assessment of the contractual terms of sale.\n\nThis was a key audit matter due to the volume of transactions that occur across multiple jurisdictions. In addition, the assessment of cost of sales includes judgement as cost allocation for site infrastructure costs is typically based on the proportion of revenue for each unit, lot or building as compared to total forecast project revenue.\n\nWhilst there have been delays in timing of residential land settlements due to flooding on the east coast of Australia, these do not impact the Group's revenue recognition policy for residential land lots as revenue is recognised on settlement.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluating and testing management's review and approval of development revenue and cost forecasting;\n- \u00b7 Selecting a sample of settlements, across multiple jurisdictions, during the year. For the sample selected we:\n- -compared revenue recognised to contractual terms of sale and cash settlements;\n- -assessed the Group's determination of when control transfers by a detailed analysis of the contractual terms of sale against the criteria in the accounting standards;\n- -assessed the Group's cost allocation methodology against the requirements of the accounting standards;\n- -tested the application of the cost allocation methodology by comparing allocated costs to revenue recognised in the year relative to the total project revenue; and\n- -assessed total project revenue by comparing expected sales prices to published industry forecasts and comparable sales prices achieved in the year, being alert to the impacts of current challenging market conditions.\n\n- o correspondence between the Group and the customer;\n- o the Group's legal basis for the variations and claims, including, where necessary, external legal opinions; and\n- o the Group's analysis of the amounts they consider meet the recognition requirement of highly probable, using our knowledge of the Group's historical experience in resolving variations and claims, and considering the commercial factors specific to each variation or claim and quality of information underpinning the amounts recognised.",

Development costs include the purchase of land, site infrastructure costs, construction costs for built form products and borrowing costs.\n\nIt is the Group's policy to carry inventory at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The recoverability therefore of these capitalised development costs is a significant judgement made by the Group, and their assessment is based on forecasts of:\n\n- \u00b7 sales prices; and\n- \u00b7 construction and infrastructure costs to complete the development.\n\nWhere a development is forecast to be loss making and the inventory is no longer considered to be recoverable, the Group considers it to be impaired and it is their policy for an expense to be recognised.\n\nThis was a key audit matter for us due to:\n\n- \u00b7 current year Development Property Inventory write-down booked of $289m as a result of the Group's strategic review of four projects increasing our focus in this area; and\n- \u00b7 many developments being long term which increases the level of forecasting judgement and audit complexity in assessing estimated sales prices and future costs to complete the development. We considered the heightened risk in estimating future sales prices, the timing of sales, and future costs as a result of current economic conditions.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Selecting a sample of projects for testing using:\n- -Data Analytic routines based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, related to size, duration and risk of projects; and\n- -the Group's project reporting tool.\n- \u00b7 For the sample selected, we:\n- -compared expected sales prices to published industry forecasts and comparable sales prices achieved in the year, being alert to the impacts of current challenging market conditions;\n- -tested a sample of forecast construction and infrastructure costs to underlying supplier contracts, historical experience of similar costs, and our industry expectation of cost contingency levels and cost escalation assumptions; and assessed expected sales prices, the volumes of sales expected each period and holding costs in light of current challenging market conditions, using our industry knowledge;\n- -for certain asset portfolios, compared long term market assumptions to our in-house macroeconomic view.\n- \u00b7 For projects subject to the Group's strategic review, we challenged key assumptions included in the Group's internal recoverability assessments, such as expected sales prices and exit costs. We did this using our knowledge of the underlying project and knowledge of the market; and by comparing to relevant external sources, such as legal agreements and valuations.\n- \u00b7 Assessing disclosures included in the financial report highlighting the key factors in determining recoverability of development property inventory, using our understanding obtained from our testing and against the requirements of the accounting standards.",

The fair value of the properties held by various investment entities directly impacts the Group's interests in these assets.\n\nValuations of assets are generally performed by the Group using internal valuation methodologies (discounted cash flow or capitalised income approach) or through the use of external valuation experts. External valuations are obtained on a routine basis by the Group each year, with the remaining investments being valued internally.\n\nOther financial assets are predominantly investments in entities which in turn own commercial and retail property. Accordingly, the Group's valuation assumptions are predominantly the capitalisation of earnings rates, discount rates, future rental income, and leasing incentives.\n\nEquity accounted investments include the Group's interest in the retirement living business. The key assumptions used by the Group in determining the value of retirement villages are discount rates, changes in village residents, current units/homes market prices and pricing growth rates.\n\nWhilst interest rates are rising in global markets, real estate valuations have remained relatively stable to date.\n\nThe assessment of the valuations of these assets is a key audit matter as they:\n\n- \u00b7 contain certain forward-looking assumptions, with higher estimation uncertainty given current economic conditions and the pandemic, which are inherently challenging to audit;\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Selecting a sample of valuations performed by the Group, based on the significance of the asset to the Group's financial position and performance;\n- \u00b7 Assessing the scope, competence and objectivity of external valuation experts engaged by the Group for assets valued by external valuation experts;\n- \u00b7 Assessing the impact of market uncertainty caveats included in valuations performed by the Group's external valuation experts on the extent of our testing of key assumptions;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating and testing management's review and approval of internal valuations based on the Group's policies for internally valued assets;\n- \u00b7 Assessing the valuation methodology for consistency with accounting standards and industry practice for the asset's class;\n- \u00b7 Working with our real estate valuation specialists, we c ompare key assumptions with market data published by commercial real estate agents, previous external valuations, our knowledge of the industry, and/or our knowledge of the asset and its historical performance. Key assumptions include:\n- -discount rates\n- -changes in village residents\n- -units/home current market prices\n- -pricing growth rates\n- -capitalisation of earnings rates\n- -future rental income\n- -leasing incentives\n- \u00b7 Assessing disclosures included in the financial report highlighting the estimates and judgements in determining fair values of the Group's equity accounted investments and other financial assets.
