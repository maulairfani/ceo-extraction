        "page_content": "## About this report\n\nWelcome to our FY2021 Annual Report, which forms part of our corporate reporting suite for the 2021 financial year.\n\n## STRUCTURE AND CONTENT\n\nThe elements of the Directors' Report, required by Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Regulatory Guide 247, are covered on pages 04 to 106. This includes the Operating and Financial Review (OFR) which is presented on pages 04 to 69. The basis of preparation of our financial statements is outlined on page 114.\n\nThis report has been prepared with reference to elements of the International Integrated Reporting Council's (IIRC) International Integrated Reporting Framework (IR Framework). We have used the IR Framework to demonstrate how our purpose and our values, as well as consideration of risks and opportunities, drive our strategy. We have also considered how our strategy creates value, beyond financial performance alone. In FY2022, we expect to further enhance our disclosures, and introduce a holistic scorecard of Key Performance Indicators.\n\nThis report covers all Orica operations worldwide over which, unless otherwise stated, we have control for the financial year ending 30 September 2021 (collectively 'the Orica Group', or 'the Group'). Monetary amounts in this document are subject to rounding and are reported in Australian dollars, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## VERIFICATION AND ASSURANCE\n\nThe Remuneration Report (pages 87 to 105) and Financial Statements (pages 108 to 167) have been independently audited by KPMG. Detailed information on the audit process and opinion is provided in the Audit Report on pages 169 to 174.\n\n|\n\nWe also obtain independent limited assurance over our greenhouse gas emissions metrics. Further details, and the Ernst & Young assurance statement, are included in our FY2021 Sustainability Supplement.\n\nAll unaudited information contained in this report has been subject to an internal review and approval process defined by our Corporate Reporting Verification Framework.\n\n## FORWARD/hyphen.caseLOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nThis report contains forward-looking statements, including statements of current intention, opinion and predictions regarding the Group's present and future operations, possible future events, and future financial prospects. While these statements reflect expectations at the date of this report, they are, by their nature, not certain and are susceptible to change. Orica makes no representation, assurance or guarantee as to the accuracy of or likelihood of fulfilling any such forward-looking statements (whether express or implied) and, except as required by applicable law or the ASX Listing Rules, disclaims any obligation or undertaking to publicly update such forward-looking statements.\n\n## Reporting suite\n\nWe have been guided by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Reporting Standards and report across a range of best practice environmental, social, and governance (ESG) indicators. We have aligned our reporting to the Financial Stability Board's TCFD Framework. For the first time, we have published a standalone Climate Action Report.\n\n## Integrating Sustainability\n\nSustainability is at the core of what we do; the decisions we make, our policies and processes, and the actions of our people. To reflect its importance, we have integrated our material sustainability disclosures and metrics into Our Performance section of this report to present a more holistic and transparent view of our performance. We have also initiated the transition from pure environmental and social reporting towards integrated reporting by connecting sustainability directly with our business model and strategy.\n\nThese changes build on the considerable progress in recent years to further embed sustainability into our business strategy, risk management and governance processes.\n\nWe always strive to do better. We want to consistently deliver value for our customers across the value chain, in a way that is safe and sustainable. By leveraging our expertise in technology and digital solutions, we are in a unique position to achieve this.\n\nWe have an obligation to our shareholders, and other stakeholders, to be transparent and demonstrate accountability for how we operate and our contribution to society, as well as detail how we are going to succeed in the mid to long-term energy transition.\n\nSustainability and value creation go hand in hand. In responding to the challenges of today and tomorrow, our approach to sustainability continues to evolve.",

        "page_content": "## Reporting what matters\n\n## Each year, we perform a materiality assessment to understand the topics that matter most to our stakeholders.\n\nThis year our materiality assessment was conducted to align with the IR Framework, identifying the topics that most affect, or have the potential to affect, our ability to operate successfully and to create value. The results of the assessment inform our strategic priorities, help us to identify risks and opportunities, and focus our reporting on what matters over the short, medium, and long-term.\n\nWe engaged with internal and external stakeholders, including customers, investor groups, and senior leaders from Orica, representing a broad range of interests covering government and regulatory affairs, supplier relationships, community, and non-government organisation views. Our assessment was also informed by secondary research such as broader industry and global trends.\n\n## Supplementary disclosures\n\nThe full list of our material topics, as well as the key steps in the materiality assessment process, can be found in our FY2021 Sustainability Supplement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OUR ASSESSMENT INDICATED OVER /three.tf/zero.tf MATERIAL TOPICS THAT WE GROUPED INTO SIX THEMES.\n\n## Business performance and resilience\n\nMaintaining strong economic performance and growth, and ensuring that our operations and supply chains remain resilient by anticipating and managing ongoing disruption events, including impacts of COVID-19 on our people and the communities in which we operate.\n\n## Safety and security\n\nEnsuring the safety of our people, customers, and communities in which we operate, and the security of our products and operations, including managing physical and cyber security risks.\n\n## Responsible and ethical business\n\nOperating ethically, fairly, and in accordance with our operating regulations and values.

We are committed to the SDGs, and our role in advancing them.\n\nIn FY2021, we mapped our material topics against the SDGs to determine which goals best reflect our business context and strategy, our capabilities, as well as our key risks and impacts across our value chain. We identified six priority SDGs for Orica to contribute towards. The SDG goals and targets have informed our sustainability strategy and scorecard.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nORICA",

Disappointingly, our Serious Injury Case Rate increased by 0.03 to 0.19. Preventing serious injuries will remain a key focus this year.\n\nWith COVID-19 continuing to impact our activities, our focus has remained on the health and wellbeing of our people. We have tight COVID-19 infection controls in place, and we continue to provide support for employees and their families in areas most impacted by the pandemic. Sadly, this year we lost 12 colleagues to COVID-19. We extend our deepest condolences to the families and friends of those who lost their lives.\n\nCOVID-19 has also had an impact on the communities in which we operate. In response, we have continued community initiatives and investments, directing our support to where it is needed most.\n\nMalcolm Broomhead AO Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur frontline employees have gone to extraordinary lengths this year, working with customers to protect their workplaces and communities, and ensure uninterrupted operations. As we emerge from the pandemic, we are partnering with customers and governments to proactively introduce vaccination standards and programs across our operations.\n\n## OUR PERFORMANCE\n\n## Business performance\n\nOur financial performance this year has been disappointing. We have felt the impact of COVID-19, a strong Australian dollar and ongoing trade tensions with China. Internally we have experienced delays in stabilising our SAP system. We announced in September individually significant items impacting our FY2021 results by $382 million after tax, which resulted in a statutory Net Loss after Tax (NLAT) (attributable to shareholders of Orica) of $174 million, compared to a",

Underlying Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) were $427 million a decrease of 30 per cent from the prior year.\n\nPositively, we maintained a disciplined approach to our balance sheet and capital management, while stepping up our cash generation and controlling our levels of debt and gearing.\n\nThe final ordinary dividend of 16.5 cents per share unfranked, brings the total dividend to 24.0 cents per share, down 9 cents per share compared with FY2020, reflecting a payout ratio of 47 per cent of underlying earnings.\n\nGearing of 34.6 per cent remains within our target range of 30 to 40 per cent.\n\nWe are pleased that in FY2021, our Burrup plant, a long-term strategic asset positioned in the Pilbara, became fully operational and Exsa, Peru's leading manufacturer and distributor of industrial explosives, acquired in May 2020, was successfully integrated into Orica, and continues to deliver in line with the business case.\n\nOur discrete network and product portfolio optimisation programs have been accelerated, resulting in the closure of several sites and the exit from a number of countries that are not strategically aligned or that could be serviced through alternate internal distribution channels.\n\nWe also commenced the sale of Minova and non-core landholdings. The stabilisation of the recently implemented SAP ERP system continued, with the integrated platform helping us in aligning our overheads and operating model with the current operating environment.\n\nWe achieved our new technology returns target, despite challenges in implementation due to COVID-19. Our digital solutions portfolio continues to grow and is now active across more than 200 customer sites globally, as we expand our scope and capability beyond blasting. In particular, with our RHINO \u2122 technology, we were able to generate orebody intelligence while drilling\n\nblastholes in collaboration with a key customer, improving blast pattern design efficiency in real-time.\n\nWe know that it was a difficult year for our people through a time of significant organisational change as we adapted our business to suit the current operating environment. However, our people rose to the challenge, ensuring that the safety of our operations and fulfilling our customers' needs remained our top priorities. We are especially grateful for this commitment and remain focused on creating a diverse workplace where our people are energised and inspired to shape our future together.\n\n'Our frontline employees have gone to extraordinary lengths this year, working with customers to protect their workplaces and communities, and ensure uninterrupted operations.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nORICA\n\n|",

Metrics that were a particular focus for FY2021 included greenhouse gas emissions, diversity and inclusiveness and community investment.\n\nWe are pleased to report a 13 per cent reduction in our combined Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, and we remain on track to achieve our target of at least 40 per cent reduction in Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. We also launched the Orica Impact Fund, targeting investment to communities most impacted by COVID-19, essential to our operations or with a focus on science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM), driving long-term benefits and positive social and environmental impact. For diversity and inclusiveness, unfortunately, we saw a drop in the percentage of women in senior leadership positions as we restructured the organisation. Despite this, we remain committed to achieving our 2024 target of 35 per cent women in senior leadership and have programs in place that support achieving this target.\n\n## POSITIONING FOR FUTURE GROWTH\n\nIn April 2021, the Board appointed Sanjeev Gandhi as the new Managing Director and CEO of Orica Limited.\n\nOur renewed Executive Committee is now in place, with deep expertise and experience from across the organisation focused on driving forward our refreshed strategy and strategic priorities and positioning Orica for the future.\n\n## Our refreshed strategy\n\nOur refreshed strategy refocuses on driving profitable growth and creating enduring value for our shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nOur strategy is to deliver solutions and technology that drive productivity for our mining and infrastructure customers across the globe.\n\nIt is centred on optimising our operations, delivering smarter solutions, and partnering for progress across our core business and refocusing on our four key business verticals - mining, quarry and construction, digital and mining chemicals. This will allow us to leverage our strengths and create opportunities for growth beyond blasting.\n\nOrganic growth will be pursued from the core, through four dedicated business verticals. We will continue to optimise our manufacturing and supply chains while maintaining commercial discipline and accelerating the adoption of our innovative technologies that promote productivity for our customers.\n\nIn mining, our largest vertical, we aim to grow our presence in future-facing commodities as the world continues to transition to a low-carbon economy, while increasing the adoption of our premium blasting solutions.\n\nIn quarry and construction, we will deliver focused technology, specific to the needs of our customers, diversifying our portfolio and increasing our presence in high-growth economies, such as Asia.\n\nOur mining chemicals business offering will be expanded in high-growth markets across gold and future-facing commodities. Building on our superior global supply chain and customer relationships, we will unlock further capacity to broaden and capture growing demand.\n\nWe will also continue the adoption and expansion of our digital solutions, both upstream and downstream, by providing best-in-class digital products and integrated digital workflow solutions, to unlock greater value for customers across all segments and drive growth for Orica.\n\nOur technology program will also include our second-generation fully wireless technology, WebGen \u2122 200, which entered alpha trials with a commercial product this year. The technology has been engineered for new markets and applications and paves the way for the first stages of blast automation through our world-first Avatel \u2122 technology.",

Our focus remains on empowering our people and partnering with customers and communities to solve shared challenges and champion for a safer and more sustainable industry.\n\n## Sustainability at Orica\n\nIn recognition of the increasing global focus on tackling climate change, this year, we took a significant step in our sustainability journey and established a net zero ambition by 2050.\n\nBuilding on our target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by at least 40 per cent by 2030, this new ambition includes our most material Scope 3 emission sources and provides a clear roadmap that prioritises the decarbonisation of our operations, low-carbon solutions and partnering with our stakeholders to move towards net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nWe are a company with a long history of technical innovation which is already helping our customers improve mine site safety, productivity, and efficiency. We will apply the same approach by deploying low-emissions technologies to our major manufacturing sites and working with our global suppliers and stakeholders to reduce the footprint of our supply chain.\n\nOne example of this innovation in action is at our Carseland ammonium nitrate (AN) manufacturing facility in Canada, which in partnership with the Alberta Government has commissioned an industrial tertiary catalyst abatement process, forecast to reduce emissions by approximately 83,000 tCO2e per year.\n\nWe have assigned approximately $45/uni00A0million over the next 5 years in capital to deploy similar tertiary abatement technology across our Australian AN sites, which could deliver a 750,000 tCO2e reduction annually.\n\nWe are also supporting the construction of a mobile demonstration plant of carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) technology at our Kooragang Island manufacturing facility, led by Mineral Carbonation International (MCi), in partnership with the Federal Government and the University of Newcastle.\n\nOur commitment to sustainability goes beyond just our net zero ambition. We will continue to evolve our approach to deliver long-term value for our stakeholders and will be working to achieve more in delivering on our key social, diversity and environmental targets.\n\n## OUTLOOK\n\nThe fundamentals of our business remain strong. By controlling what we can, optimising our operations and supply chain and embedding our refreshed strategy and growth drivers, we will seize opportunities as the market stabilises.\n\nWe expect commodity demand to remain steady throughout FY2022, translating to stable volume demand for explosives and related products. Our customer's appetite for new technology is high as we look to capitalise on our expanded offering in high-growth and future-facing commodities.\n\nOur refreshed strategy and Executive leadership team have Orica well-positioned to navigate our recovery and deliver profitable growth, focused on improving our return on net assets (RONA) and value for our customers and shareholders through a simpler and more efficient organisation.\n\nOn behalf of our Board and the Executive Team, thank you to the entire Orica team who have been exceptional during this challenging time.\n\nImportantly, we thank you, our shareholders, for your continued support and investment in Orica.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMalcolm Broomhead AO\n\nChairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sanjeev Gandhi\n\nManaging Director and Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

This is supported by analysis on 'megatrends' such as urbanisation and decarbonisation, which will drive high growth across a diverse range of metals and minerals such as copper, lithium, iron ore, metallurgical coal, quarried rock, and nickel. Over time demand for fossil fuels such as thermal coal are forecast to flatten and decline. We are committed to diversifying our commodity exposure and positioning our portfolio towards higher growth commodities, including future-facing commodities. This is highlighted by our investments in a joint venture with Yara International on the Burrup Peninsula (Western Australia) and the acquisition of Exsa in Peru, which strengthen our position in the iron ore, gold, and copper segments.\n\n## DECARBONISATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKey business model inputs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe also believe quarried rock presents a significant opportunity, driven by global infrastructure stimulus linked to the post-pandemic economic recovery. We are well-positioned in our core quarrying regions (North America and Europe) and will now focus on increasing our exposure in developing markets as ongoing urbanisation continues to drive demand.\n\nWe have developed future macroeconomic and climate scenarios to help us understand what future trends, opportunities and risks may emerge as a result of climate change and the potential financial and operational impacts on our business strategy. Our FY2021 Climate Action Report describes the outcomes of our scenario planning and planned responses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKey business model inputs\n\nThe transition to a low-carbon economy is underway, with an increasing number of countries, private organisations, and public companies making significant commitments to decarbonisation and achieving net zero emissions.\n\nWe must adapt to this transition. It will impact our customers, communities, and the way we manufacture, and we are committed to playing our part in the global response. It is also now widely recognised that climate change is a risk to long-term financial stability. In FY2021, Orica has complemented our emissions reduction target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by at least 40 per cent by 2030 with an\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nambition of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 1 . This transition is underway as we prioritise tertiary catalyst abatement initiatives at our Carseland (Canada) and Australian AN plants, and by progressing sourcing of renewable energy.\n\nWe are also working with our customers to help achieve their decarbonisation ambitions as we pursue lower carbonintensity AN, support trials in CCU through MCi and deploy our suite of world-class digital and blasting solutions to drive mine site safety and efficiencies.\n\nFurther reading: FY2021 Climate Action Report\n\n.\n\n- 1 Covers our global Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions under our direct control, and material Scope 3 GHG emission sources.

The year has proved more challenging than we had envisaged.\n\nOur financial performance for the year has been disappointing, reflecting both adverse external events and under-performance in areas outside of our control. Underlying Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) reduced by 30 per cent to $427 million (FY2020: $614 million). Our underlying results were adversely impacted by a strong Australian dollar; reduced mining demand due to trade tensions between Australia and China; and pricing pressure resulting from a long ammonium nitrate market. This was compounded by a highly competitive environment in Latin America, rapidly escalating freight costs and the impact of COVID-19 on customer sites. Importantly, much of the impact was in the first half of the year when we reported an underlying EBIT of $155 million 1 .\n\nChristopher Davis Chief Financial Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe second half showed a significant improvement with an increase in sales volumes, and a focus on cost control that resulted in EBIT increasing 75 per cent to $272 million.\n\nWe recorded a statutory Net Loss after Tax (NLAT) (attributable to shareholders of Orica Limited) of $174 million, compared to a Net Profit after Tax (NPAT) of $82 million in FY2020. This statutory NLAT was mainly driven by asset impairments and changes in accounting standards. More detail about our financial performance is set out on pages 32 to 41.\n\nGiven the challenges, we accelerated our overhead cost reduction program. Regrettably, this program resulted in redundancies across our corporate functions. We never take these decisions lightly; but it was necessary to achieve the efficiencies needed.\n\n'Despite the uncertainty of the external operating environment, our focus on balance sheet discipline has ensured strong cash generation and available liquidity'\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n$619M\n\nNET CASH\n\nfrom operating activities\n\n34.6% GEARING\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Despite the challenges, our teams around the world have rallied to keep Orica operating safely and responsibly and stayed focused on what we could control to start our recovery, whether it be enabling supply chain continuity in the regions, successfully integrating the recently acquired Exsa business in Latin America, or active management of our liquidity position by our corporate treasury team.\n\nIn this respect I am pleased to report our progress toward stabilising the SAP system, a continued focus on debtor collections and improvements to our procurement processes has contributed to a reduction in trade working capital. This allowed us to achieve a strong cash conversion rate of 127.0 per cent compared to 74.4 per cent in FY2020, and strong net cash from operating activities of $619 million. This strong cash generation, as well as our focus on monetising non-core land sales (Villawood and Botany) of $140 million resulted in gearing of 34.6 per cent (FY2020: 38.2 per cent).\n\n## WE HAVE OPERATED WITHIN A DISCIPLINED CAPITAL MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS\n\nOur capital management framework is based on three key objectives:\n\n- -  Maintaining our investment grade credit rating;\n- -  Preserving the flexibility for growth investment and to respond to changes in the external operating environment; and\n- -  Maximising returns to shareholders.\n\nWe maintained our BBB investment grade credit rating from Standard & Poor's, despite revising their outlook to 'negative watch', from 'stable', in March 2021.\n\nOur disciplined approach to capital expenditure continued to support the base business and pursue growth opportunities. Total capital expenditure for the year was $323 million, which was at the lower end of the guidance range of $320 million to $360 million. We have ensured sufficient capital has been allocated to safety and environmental obligations, as well as towards maintaining and improving our existing asset performance.\n\nCapital expenditure allocated to growth opportunities is subject to rigorous review and approval processes. This ensures growth capital is allocated to the opportunities that provide the best value and returns for Orica.\n\nIn FY2021 we spent $121 million in growth capital and $202 million on sustenance capital, which includes $14 million towards reducing our greenhouse gas emissions at Kooragang Island and Carseland.\n\nDespite difficult operating conditions, our capital management rigour has delivered a reduction in net debt to $1,479 million, a decline of $342 million from FY2020; our lowest net debt position in four years. Our liquidity position remains strong, underpinned by undrawn committed debt facilities of $1,486 million and cash and cash equivalents of $594 million.\n\nDuring the year, we repaid $469 million of US Private Placement debt and refinanced and pre-financed a further $365 million of committed debt facilities. Our average drawn debt maturity is 5.4 years and we do not have a material bond maturity until September 2023. We maintain the continued support of our group relationship banks and bondholders.\n\nGearing at 34.6 per cent is well within our target range of 30 to 40 per cent and we have significant headroom against both our Gearing and Interest Cover financial covenants.\n\nOrica seeks to pay dividends within the range of 40 to 70 per cent of underlying earnings and we have achieved that for the past five years. I am pleased to report that despite the challenges and uncertainty of the pandemic, we have maintained the dividend payout ratio within policy range in FY2021 as well.\n\nThe dividend for the first half of the year was 7.5 cents per share. The final dividend is 16.5 cents per share bringing the full year dividend to 24.0 cents per share, a full year payout ratio of 47 per cent.\n\n## WE HAVE INCURRED NON/hyphen.caseCASH ADJUSTMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\n\nAs part of our periodic impairment testing, and in the context of the challenging market conditions, we have written off goodwill of $162 million associated with the Europe, Middle East, Africa (EMEA) business segment.\n\nAdditionally, we concluded it was appropriate to impair our interest in the Pilbara by $277 million after tax.\n\nWhile the Burrup plant contributed positively to our underlying result, the profit margins are lower than the East Coast of Australia and did not fully support its reported carrying value.\n\nDuring the year, we adopted the accounting standards interpretation related to 'accounting for cloud computing arrangements', which requires retrospective application. This resulted in a large portion of our previously capitalised investment in SAP being taken to earnings (in both current and prior periods). Refer pages 164 to 167 within the financial statements for further detail.\n\n## CONTINUING FOCUS ON CASH GENERATION\n\nOur focus on cash generation and managing our capital structure will continue to be a priority. We will continue to focus on trade working capital efficiencies, disciplined capital expenditure and further sales of non-core land assets to release cash. In addition, we will allocate the required investment to support our decarbonisation pathway.\n\nAs we look to the future, we are keeping our sights set on our vision to be the world's leading mining and infrastructure solutions company. To echo the sentiments of our Chairman and CEO, I am energised by our refreshed strategic priorities, and confident that smarter solutions, optimised operations and partnering for progress, realised by our talented people, will create value for our stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Christopher Davis\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nORICA\n\n|",

This has resulted in lower EBIT on translation of foreign-denominated earnings into Australian dollars.\n\n## SAP\n\nIncremental operating costs related to the SAP system were incurred in line with expectations.\n\n## Volume\n\nTotal AN volumes increased 4 per cent on the pcp, driven by the inclusion of a full year of Exsa sales. Despite this, the net volume impact was unfavourable on the pcp given the reduction of high margin Australian East Coast volumes from disrupted thermal coal trade flows, and from lower sales volumes in Colombia and Chile.\n\nTotal initiating system volumes were in line with the pcp, with an increase in premium electronic blasting systems (EBS) offset by a reduction in conventional detonators.\n\nCyanide volumes were 6 per cent down on the pcp, from lower customer demand and shipping constraints.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nReduced volumes adversely impacted manufacturing fixed cost recoveries, particularly at the large continuous plants. Following an incident in the first half at the La Portada manufacturing plant, increased insurance and sourcing costs were incurred.\n\n## Mix & margin\n\nIn the pcp North America benefited from carbon credits that have not repeated in FY2021. A competitive environment in Latin America has resulted in lower contract pricing to customers, while customers' cost constraints have also led to temporary negative mix impacts, particularly in Peru and across Africa.\n\nHigher sea freight costs impacted earnings in Latin America and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) where AN product is sourced offshore.\n\n## Rise & fall lag\n\nIncreases in ammonia input costs, in particular in the second half of the year, had a temporary adverse impact on EBIT in Australia and Asia. While most of these costs are ultimately passed through in sales prices, there is a time delay between rising input cost and the recovery thereof.\n\n## Adjacent businesses (Orica Monitor and Minova)\n\nThe Orica Monitor result was stronger than the pcp from increased radar sales and leases, higher services revenue and lower overhead costs at Nitro Consult following a successful restructuring.\n\nThe result from Minova, which is held for sale, was slightly higher than the pcp, from higher customer demand and the commencement of new construction projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

Over time, Australian coal producers have been able to place product in alternative markets such as India, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan.\n\n|\n\nAsian markets were faced with outbreaks of COVID-19, which led to some full or partial mine closures in countries such as Indonesia, India, Malaysia, Mongolia, and the Philippines. While conditions have been relatively stable over recent months, uncertainty in the Asia region remains.\n\nGlobal ammonia prices increased significantly over the second half of FY2021, with the Fertecon Far East CFR ammonia index on average approximately 85 per cent higher than the pcp.\n\nThe Australian dollar was stronger against most major currencies on average during FY2021 as compared to the pcp.\n\n## Segment performance\n\nExplosives volumes were 1 per cent down on the pcp, mainly as a result of lower coal production on the Australian East Coast in the first half due to disrupted trade flows and the non-repeat of high margin competitor sales in 2020. This was partially offset by new business from Metals customers, both in the Pilbara and on the Australian East Coast.\n\nEBS demand increased on the pcp, mainly from new customer contracts in the Metals business in Australia. Conventional detonator volumes were lower than the pcp due to a four-month suspension of operations at a customer site in the Philippines following a wall failure incident.\n\nEBIT was down 25 per cent on the pcp due largely to the unfavourable market conditions.\n\nThe impact of disrupted thermal coal trade flows which affected high margin volumes was compounded by the under recovery of continuous manufacturing plant fixed costs.\n\nIncreases in ammonia input costs in the second half of the year had a temporary adverse impact on EBIT in Australia and Asia. While most of these costs are ultimately passed through in sales prices, there is a time delay between rising input costs and the recovery thereof.\n\nThe Asia business was impacted by the adverse foreign exchange movements compared to the pcp which has resulted in lower earnings on translation of foreign currency earnings.\n\nDepreciation on the Burrup plant commenced in FY2021.",

The coal market in Colombia has seen a significant downturn in production, with many mines moving into care and maintenance, and one miner relinquishing their coal mining licence to the Colombian government.\n\nPolitical instability continues to impact the region, as strikes in Chile and social unrest in Peru, which were disruptive in the first half, have continued to occur in the second half.\n\nSea freight costs have increased sharply on the pcp, particularly in the second half.\n\nThe Australian dollar was stronger against most major currencies on average during FY2021 as compared to the pcp.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|\n\n## Segment performance\n\nExplosives volumes were 34 per cent up on the pcp, or 1 per cent up on the pcp excluding Exsa which was acquired on 30 April 2020.\n\nThe reduced coal production in Colombia significantly impacted AN and initiating systems demand in the country in FY2021. Strike action in Chile resulted in significantly lower explosives demand on the pcp. In contrast, despite ongoing political instability, sales of explosives volumes in Brazil and Peru increased on the pcp from higher spot sales, demand from new customers and the full year contribution from Exsa.\n\nGrowth in Peru was predominantly driven by lower margin entry level products due to customer cost constraints, mainly in the first half.\n\n## External revenue by commodity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2%\n\nThermal Coal\n\n4%\n\nIron Ore\n\n3%\n\nQ&C\n\n25%\n\nGold\n\n59%\n\nCopper\n\n- 7% Other\n\nTotal initiating systems volumes increased on the pcp, largely driven by customer activity in Brazil and the inclusion of Exsa volumes.\n\nCyanide volumes were lower than the pcp from a decline in a customer's gold production in Peru as the mine approaches end of life.\n\nEBIT was 25 per cent down on the pcp due to unfavourable foreign exchange movements which has resulted in lower earnings on translation of foreign currency earnings and contract pricing in the highly competitive market, which has had an impact on margins.

The reduction of $215 million in the underlying trade working capital is partially driven by a decrease in trade debtors of $92 million from improved billing and collections. Inventory increased by $84 million due to increased sales activity towards the end of the year and rising input prices. Trade creditors increased by $207 million driven by increased purchase activity associated with higher sales volumes as well as tighter credit management and the inclusion of Burrup creditors which were included in non-trade creditors prior to the plant's commissioning.\n\nExcluding the transfer of $46 million of non-trade working capital of Minova to assets held for sale, non-trade working capital liability was $155 million lower due to a $75 million reduction in the defined benefit obligations as a result of an increase in discount rates and the shift of Burrup creditors into trade creditors post plant commissioning.\n\nNet fixed, intangible & right of use assets decreased by $517 million from the pcp due to depreciation and amortisation expense of $370 million, impairment charges of $480 million, disposals of $15 million and the transfer of Minova assets of $85 million to assets held for sale. This was partly offset by additions of $413 million and foreign exchange translation of $19 million.\n\nOther net assets decreased by $68 million from the pcp, driven largely by the revaluation of financial instruments resulting from the strengthening of the Australian dollar of $113 million and the transfer of Minova other net assets of $34 million to assets held for sale, offset by a decrease in provision for income tax of $66 million.\n\n## DEBT MANAGEMENT AND LIQUIDITY\n\n| As at 30 September                                         | 2021  A$M   | Restated   2020  A$M   | Variance  A$M   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------|-----------------|\n| Interest bearing liabilities - excluding lease liabilities | (2,072.7)   | (2,741.0)              | 668.3           |\n| Less: Cash and cash equivalents                            | 593.7       | 920.5                  | (326.8)         |\n| Net debt                                                   | (1,479.0)   | (1,820.5)              | 341.5           |\n| Lease liabilities                                          | (260.4)     | (298.7)                | 38.3            |\n| Net debt - including lease liabilities                     | (1,739.4)   | (2,119.2)              | 379.8           |\n| Gearing % - excluding Lease liabilities                    | 34.6%       | 38.2%                  | -               |\n\nInterest bearing liabilities of $2,073 million comprise $2,069 million of US Private Placement bonds and $4 million of committed and other bank facilities. The average tenor of drawn debt is 5.4 years (September 2020 5.0 years).\n\nCash of $594 million provides for a strong liquidity position, complemented by undrawn committed bank facilities of $1,486 million.\n\nGearing excluding lease liabilities at 34.6 per cent is within the Group's target range of 30 to 40 per cent and is well below the 57.5 per cent covenant default measure. The interest cover ratio at 4.6x also has significant headroom against the debt covenant of 2.0x.\n\nOn 2 March 2021, Standard and Poor's affirmed Orica's credit rating at 'BBB', whilst revising the outlook to 'negative' from 'stable'. S&P's rating methodology adjusts Orica's net debt to incorporate post-retirement benefit obligations, asset retirement obligations (i.e., environmental, and decommissioning provisions) and leases. Orica's debt covenants do not include these items.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

It is considered unlikely that results will improve, therefore the assumption of the future cost saving has been removed from the provision calculation. This has resulted in an increase to the environmental provision with the expense included as a significant item.\n\n## Botany Hexachlorabenzene (HCB) waste\n\nThe provision increased due to a requirement for an additional shipment to complete waste destruction.\n\n## EMEA goodwill impairment\n\nAs part of Orica's periodic impairment testing, and in the context of the ongoing challenging market conditions, a non-cash impairment charge was recognised on the goodwill in the EMEA segment. After the recognition of this impairment charge, $49 million of goodwill remains in EMEA.\n\n## Pilbara impairment\n\nFollowing the impairment recognised by Yara Pilbara Nitrates (Pty) Ltd, the joint venture company that operates the Burrup plant, Orica has reviewed the carrying value of its 50 per cent shareholding. This has resulted in Orica recognising a non-cash impairment of $158 million against Goodwill and $160 million against Property Plant & Equipment.",

We pride ourselves on conducting our business safely and responsibly, from how we work with our suppliers and manufacture our products, to how we deliver for our customers.\n\nOur approach is governed by robust risk management and corporate governance frameworks. For more information, see our FY2021 Corporate Governance Statement and pages 76 to 81 of this report for our risk management approach.\n\n## WORKPLACE SAFETY\n\nWhile we did not meet all our performance targets in FY2021, we remain committed to improving our safety performance by understanding and addressing the causes of incident and injury and by enhancing our safety culture. Implementation of our five-year Safety, Health, Environment and Security (SHES) strategic plan commenced in FY2021.\n\n## Safety performance: zero fatalities but an increase in injuries\n\nFor the fourth consecutive year we achieved zero fatalities and achieved a reduction in the number of Serious Life Changing Injuries 1 . However, our rate of injury, including Serious Injuries 2 and total recordable cases, were above target.\n\nOur Serious Injury Case Rate (SICR) was 0.19, with a total of 35 serious injuries recorded. This is an increase from our FY2020 performance and above our target of 0.14 serious injuries per 200,000 hours worked. While disappointing, we are committed to maintaining our focus on injury prevention in FY2022. Our average days lost per injury reduced by 25 per cent from FY2020.\n\nWe achieved our Serious Life Changing Injury Case Rate (SLCICR) performance target. Five of the six cases recorded as life changing injuries were the result of two incidents: a passenger transport incident in a customer-operated vehicle that resulted in injuries to multiple Orica employees; and a light vehicle incident. As a result, controls aligned to transport and vehicle related incidents will be reviewed.\n\nWe continued to enhance our safety culture and encourage greater reporting of potential issues, achieving our High Potential Incident (HPI) Injury Ratio target. This resulted in a lower number of HPIs involving injury, when compared to FY2020.\n\n## Serious Injury Case Rate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Serious Life Changing Injury Case Rate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNew metric in FY2020.\n\n- 1 Serious life-changing injuries ('SLCIs') are a subset of SIs, being those injuries where time was lost and where there was a potential for fatality or disablement from the injury (regardless of whether it was realised).\n- 2 Serious Injuries ('SIs') are those which result in lost work time, and include fatalities, temporary or permanent disablement, hospitalisations, and less significant injuries where the affected person is unable to attend work for a day or more.\n- 3 Incidents resulting in injury requiring medical treatment, or fatalities, or loss of security sensitive product, or significant financial impact.\n\n|\n\n## Increase in distribution events\n\nThere was an increase in Severity 2 3 transport and distribution events this year and we did not achieve target. Two of these events were within our control, however the remainder were outside our Oricacontrolled network, occurring with product shipped by third-party providers. We will continue to implement controls and focus on addressing third-party transport and distribution risks.\n\n## Distribution incidents\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Distribution incidents not under Orica control (Severity 2+)\n\n## Cultivating a culture of safety through our Major Hazard Management (MHM) Program\n\nOur MHM program is integral to our strategic safety focus areas, defining key safety controls and establishing rigorous verification protocols. This year, our leaders completed over 10,000 independent verifications of our key hazard controls.\n\nMHM is reinforced in everyday work through our Safety Leadership Interaction program. This leverages the relationship between supervisor and worker to enhance communication around safety controls. In FY2021, we completed over 75,000 interactions.",

        "page_content": "Creating a culture of safety in which all employees are empowered, and expected, to call an immediate stop to work if they observe a potentially hazardous situation is core to our MHM program. Over 1,000 stops were called across diverse business lines and geographies, which is a three-fold increase from FY2020. This highlighted our company-wide focus on safety and the willingness of our people to speak up.\n\n## Developing capable safety leaders\n\nTranslating our safety goals into results requires capable leaders. In FY2021, we launched a bespoke safety leadership program, Lead@Orica , to advance safety leadership capacity across all levels of our organisation. The program is being developed in collaboration with the Griffith University Safety Science Innovation Lab and Queensland University of Technology (Australia) and is founded on an evidencebased model for safety leadership. The program aims to develop, recognise, and support leaders who can deploy adaptive leadership styles to drive improved safety performance on the ground.\n\n## FY2022 Priorities\n\n- -  Enhance our MHM procedure for collisions (focusing on high occupancy vehicles and driver distraction) by understanding incident root causes and effective interventions.\n- -  Develop contractor management group procedure and processes.\n\n## THE IMPACT OF CALLING AN MHM STOP\n\nIn February 2021, a Mobile Manufacturing Unit (MMU \u2122 ) operator at a customer site in Penasquito, Zacetas (Mexico), called a stop to operations after noticing the bench ground was unlevel and dangerous to drive and walk on. Two years earlier, a similar condition had resulted in an MMU \u2122 roll-over at the same mine. The customer agreed the ground was unsafe and the ground was levelled before operations continued.\n\nMHM stops are communicated and celebrated internally, ensuring learnings are shared and giving our people the confidence to speak up and call a stop.\n\n## PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH IN THE WORKPLACE\n\n## Managing physical health risks\n\nProtecting our people by managing health risks remains a focus. We implemented a range of activities including:\n\n- -  health risk assessments for continuous manufacturing sites, with controls developed to prevent and mitigate exposure to material harmful agents;\n- -  an enhanced management process for mine dust related health risks by updating our key controls;\n- -  the creation of a working group on mine dust exposure to provide additional oversight; and\n- -  standardised Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs) and Biological Exposure Indices (BEI) across the organisation to align with best practice recommendations (previously, these differed across regions in line with local laws and regulations).\n\n## Managing the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on physical and mental health\n\nUnder the guidance and oversight of our COVID-19 Vaccination Working group, we continued to manage the health, operational, legal, ethical, and social risks related to the pandemic. This included enhancing our controls following advice from relevant international and local health authorities.\n\nOur MHM program has now been expanded to include contractors through the Contractor Management Program. The initial phase was developed and piloted this year, delivering a systematic assessment of high-risk contractors through a pre-qualification process. Appropriate systems and competencies are then put in place to ensure any major hazards that may be present in their work are managed.\n\nControls are managed through the implementation of operational protocols to prevent and mitigate occurrences.\n\nThe mental health and wellbeing of our people continues to be a top priority with many affected by continued social isolation and impact on families and communities. A Global Wellness strategy was developed to support our people in managing their mental health, with oversight from our newly established Global Wellness working group. A communications strategy around reducing mental health stigma is being rolled out with leaders, including our CEO and members of our Executive Committee, leading by example and discussing mental health experiences and challenges.\n\nEmployees are encouraged to reach out to our Employee Assistance Program provider for further support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nORICA\n\n|",

The strategy has four key areas: mental health, physical health, financial health, and social health.\n\nAs part of our focus on mental health, Yes Psychology were engaged to conduct an employee wellness survey to determine the effectiveness of our existing health and wellbeing activities and identify improvements. Yes Psychology also promoted the wellness resources available to our teams, including Optum, our Employee Assistance Program provider. Through Optum's Live Well website, employees can access resources designed to enhance positive mental health, resiliency, and work/life balance.\n\nWe also encouraged our people to engage in wellness webinars delivered by Yes Psychology. Topics included handling change at work, juggling skills for parents, healthy sleep and lifestyle habits, and social connectedness.\n\n## FY2022 Priorities\n\n- -  Conduct a pilot of key control procedures and verification for dust mitigation/suppression for mining services.\n- -  Update and communicate our Health Group Standard to incorporate standardised OEL and BEI.\n- -  Provide ongoing management of COVID-19 through strict risk management protocols.\n\n## PRODUCT SECURITY\n\nAs a manufacturer of commercial explosives and blasting initiating systems, we have specific responsibilities to ensure we partner with and sell to organisations that will use our products for their intended purpose. We also have a responsibility to eliminate or minimise any risks to safety, health, or the environment across the lifecycle of our products and services.\n\nWe take our product security responsibilities seriously and strive to be champions of a safe and secure value chain. We select our partners following detailed due diligence covering security across the product lifecycle, from transport to storage and their final end-use. No product security incidents categorised as a Severity 3 or higher were recorded in FY2021 (FY2020: zero, FY2019: zero).\n\nOf the Severity 2 product security events that occurred, half were related to transport. This vulnerability continues to be an area of focus and is being addressed through several mechanisms, including enhancing product traceability.\n\n## ADVANCED DETONATOR SECURITY WITH WEBGEN \u2122\n\nOur wireless blasting system WebGen \u2122 offers a step change improvement in detonator security compared to electric detonators. Wireless technology provides an additional level of security by requiring four 64-bit encryption codes and a specific voltage for initiation. To prevent tampering, any attempt to initiate with the wrong voltage can destroy the detonator's internal systems, rendering it unusable. The WebGen \u2122 system also requires a specific transmission system and antenna which are not available for consumer purchase.",

We are currently rolling out the technology across all discrete manufacturing sites as a priority to enable our product to be tracked with speed and recovered in the event of loss or theft. This further enhances our product stewardship approach and enables us to provide greater reassurance to stakeholders in our management of security risks.\n\n## FY2022 Priorities\n\n- -  Continuing implementation of track and trace technology.\n- -  Develop and implement a security training program for the Group Standard on Security.\n\n## CYBER SECURITY\n\nCyber security procedures and controls are in place to protect our global information network and limit the potential likelihood and impact of a cyber risk event. Our cyber security strategy is focused on controls to prevent, detect, respond, or recover from attacks that could result in critical services outages or loss of production and business services.\n\nIn FY2021, we continued to mature our cyber security controls to drive three key outcomes:\n\n- -  extend cyber security into customer and manufacturing systems;\n- -  detect and respond rapidly to malicious software or intruders in our network, focusing on ransomware; and\n- -  increase data security, safeguarding our own and our customers data.\n\n## Assuring and improving controls across our business activities\n\nWe undertook several activities to assess the efficacy of existing controls and identify opportunities for improvement across our business activities. This included:\n\n- -  commencing a project to audit and upgrade security of our manufacturing networks;\n- -  maturing our supply chain assurance process and continuing to engage with our material and high-risk third-party service providers to understand their cyber security approach and address control gaps; and\n- -  continued verification and testing of customer products through security assessments.\n\nOur cyber security posture is tested with crisis simulations, penetration testing and by using external cyber professionals to perform 'ethical' hacking exercises.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nORICA\n\n|",

To ensure our network was protected and secure, we enhanced and extended multi-factor authentication to verify the legitimacy of all employees and contractors with IT systems access and updated device security to decrease ransomware risk by improving detection and response controls.\n\nThese measures were supported through an enhanced security awareness program for employees and contractors, including standard training on security controls for everyone with IT system access, and tailored training through, for example, phishing email simulations.\n\nWe continue to evolve legacy network and security architectures toward a unified networking and security service that increases scalability, agility and security in a user and application environment that is highly distributed and mobile across the Internet.\n\nWe will continue to enhance our key cyber security controls in FY2022.\n\n## ETHICAL BUSINESS CONDUCT\n\n## How we conduct business\n\nOur Code of Business Conduct (Our Code) brings our values to life and sets out our expectations for the way we work. This includes compliance with relevant laws and regulations, requirements specific to Orica, and additional company policies, standards, and procedures. This year, we commenced a review of Our Code; with an updated version to be released in FY2022.\n\nThe way we work is governed by Our Code. All employees and contractors who are subject to the requirements of Our Code complete mandatory training upon joining Orica and complete refresher training every two years.\n\nThere are consequences for breaching Our Code and we encourage people to speak up where they suspect a breach.\n\n## Reporting issues and grievances\n\nIncidents or concerns involving a breach of Our Code or work-related grievances can be raised through multiple channels, including our independent, confidential Speak-up service, where reports can be made via telephone or website, or raised through management, human resources or other internal channels. Reports can be made at any time and in multiple languages using the Speak-up service hotline. Reporters have the option to remain anonymous.\n\nOur Whistleblower Policy outlines our commitment to ensuring the identity of reporters remains confidential and they are not subject to detrimental conduct as a result of making a report. This provides protection for reporters and creates an environment where people feel safe and encouraged to report breaches of Our Code, including unethical, illegal, or improper behaviour.\n\nIn FY2021, 73 per cent of cases reported related to workplace and personnel grievances.\n\n## Reports by Category %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen concerns are raised through our available mechanisms, a review process is undertaken, and a response is determined according to the framework in our Group procedure. In FY2021, 25 per cent of reports were substantiated.

This establishes clear requirements and controls around key compliance risks, including anticorruption, anti-bribery, trade sanctions and competition (anti-trust) laws.\n\n## Benchmarking our program to promote continuous improvement\n\nWe aim to continuously improve our Ethics and Compliance approach. This year, we engaged an independent third-party, the Ethisphere Institute, to benchmark our Ethics and Compliance program against international best practice. An improvement program has been developed in response to the assessment results, with implementation to commence in FY2022.\n\n## Creating deeper awareness of the Ethics and Compliance program\n\nIncreasing internal awareness of our key compliance risks and the role of our Ethics and Compliance program in managing these was a key focus in FY2021. We undertook several activities to achieve this including:\n\n- -  hosting an 'Ethics and Compliance Day', where regional business and regional Ethics and Compliance team members facilitated a variety of activities to increase knowledge of topical issues and our approach to compliance; and\n- -  enhancing our online registration portal and supporting processes for how we report, assess, and monitor gifts, entertainment, sponsorships and donations. The new portal promotes greater accessibility and ease of use, automating and streamlining the approval process across the organisation.\n\n## FY2022 Priorities\n\n- -  Update and rollout of our refreshed Code of Business Conduct and associated training.\n- -  Revising our Ethics and Compliance Group Standard and rollout of associated training.\n- -  Enhancing our existing Ethics and Compliance program as identified in the benchmarking activity.\n\n## TAX TRANSPARENCY\n\nTax transparency is a critical element of ethical business behaviour. We are committed to complying with all relevant taxation laws in a responsible manner, with all taxes properly due, accounted for and paid. A tax standard and relevant procedures are in place to ensure our tax compliance obligations are managed.\n\nOur effective tax rate before individually significant items is 32.0 per cent, which is in line with FY2020.\n\nFor more information, refer to our FY2021 Tax Transparency Report .\n\n## HUMAN RIGHTS\n\nWe are committed to respecting and upholding the human rights of our people, and those who may be impacted by our operations and business activities. Our approach to respecting human rights is guided by internationally recognised standards and embedded within our Charter, Our Code, risk management approach and organisational policies.\n\n## Rights of Indigenous Peoples and their cultural heritage\n\nIn May 2020, rock shelters at Juukan Gorge, a significant cultural heritage site for the Traditional Owners in Western Australia's Pilbara region, were destroyed through blasting activities. Their destruction was a substantial loss for First Nations Peoples cultural heritage and Australian history.\n\nFollowing this event and acknowledging the risks that our own operations, products and services pose to cultural heritage sites, we engaged a third party to perform an assessment of our current approach to engaging with First Nations Peoples and cultural heritage management. Our current state was benchmarked against the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and external stakeholder expectations.\n\nThe assessment identified opportunities to reduce risk related to the protection of cultural heritage and more meaningfully engage with our First Nations communities through the enhancement of our governance structure, development of clear policies, practices, and systems, and increasing our cultural competency.\n\nA roadmap to enhance our approach to First Nations engagement will commence in FY2022.\n\n## Empowering our employees to protect cultural heritage\n\nIn addition to safety, we empowered our employees to stop work at mine sites if they held other concerns about a blast, including the risk of cultural heritage impact. This signals a step change for how we approach our responsibility when it comes to cultural heritage protection.\n\nWe continue to work collaboratively with our customers to protect cultural heritage in Australia and internationally.\n\n## Maturing our approach to managing modern slavery risks\n\nIn FY2021, we performed a modern slavery gap analysis to identify opportunities for improvement in our existing modern slavery risk management approach across our operations and supply chain. While the gap analysis recognised progress made to date, including the development and piloting of a supply chain Modern Slavery Risk Management Plan and tools, it also identified opportunities for enhancing our governance, policy, process, and systems. The resulting recommendations have been developed into a future roadmap and implementation plan, which will be rolled out from FY2022.\n\nFor more information on our approach to managing modern slavery risks and the activities undertaken throughout the year, refer to our FY2021 Modern Slavery Statement .\n\n## BOARD FOCUS\n\nOur Board and Board Committees are collectively focused on safety and corporate responsibility in all aspects of the business. Some examples that demonstrate this commitment include promoting a positive health and safety culture, oversight of product security risk and controls, monitoring our cyber security resilience, and the approval of commitments around modern slavery and tax transparency.\n\n- 1 Reports received through the Speak Up service may not be pursued where they do not raise issues of sufficient substance to warrant investigation, do not provide sufficient information to undertake an investigation, or are a repeat of an existing allegation which is already subject to investigation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->",

Cost pressures also necessitated a targeted reduction in our workforce. As we have said farewell to some of our colleagues, we are cognisant of the impact of internal restructuring on our employees.\n\nThe safety, health and wellbeing of our people has been our number one priority. We are proud of our teams, who have demonstrated incredible resilience, and commitment to our purpose and upholding our values, even in the most challenging circumstances. For more information on how we supported our people, refer to Physical and Mental Health in the Workplace on page 43.\n\nSeveral of our initiatives, including our leadership and development programs and employee engagement survey, were paused during FY2021 as we prioritised other critical business activities. We have used this time to reset. As part of the broader business strategy refresh, we reshaped our people priorities to reflect the short and long-term business priorities and to equip our workforce with the skills, competencies and attributes needed to enable our future success.\n\n## CHANGES TO OUR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE\n\nSince Sanjeev Gandhi's appointment to Chief Executive Officer in April 2021, our Executive Committee has undergone some changes, which include both lateral moves and internal promotions.\n\n- -  Germ\u00e1n Morales, previously President Latin America, was appointed President Australia Pacific, and Asia.\n- -  James Bonnor, previously President North America, was appointed President - Europe, Middle East, and Africa.\n- -  Leah Barlow, previously Vice President Global Manufacturing, was appointed to the newly created role of Senior Vice President Discrete Manufacturing and Supply Chain, with responsibility for Orica's Initiating Systems and Packaged Explosives plants and global supply chain.\n- -  Brian Gillespie, previously CEO GroundProbe, was appointed President Latin America.\n- -  James Crough, previously Vice President Finance APA, was appointed President North America.\n\nEarlier in the year, Jennifer Haviland joined the Executive Committee as Chief People Officer, having previously held the role of Vice President Risk and Assurance.\n\nWe are proud to promote the internal mobility and career development of our people, which demonstrates the strength of our talent engine.

The strategy refresh included a companywide survey to understand what motivates and inspires our employees, and what we can do to support our future success. The importance of good leadership and people development opportunities (promoting from within and leadership training) came through strongly.\n\nWe will continue listening to employees in FY2022, deploying an enterprise-wide survey supplemented with pulse surveys.\n\n## ENABLING AN INCLUSIVE CULTURE\n\nIn FY2021, we employed 13,374 people across 49 countries, representing over 90 nationalities and bringing together a diverse range of backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets.\n\nWe are committed to enabling an inclusive work environment, where our differences are valued and our people feel respected, connected, and engaged. Fostering a positive and inclusive culture supports the growth of a sustainable pipeline of diverse talent and ensures we have the right culture and environment to develop and retain a diverse employee population.\n\nOur Diversity and Inclusion Policy can be found in the Governance section of the Orica website. This outlines our vision, commitment, and approach.\n\nDespite our global footprint, cultural diversity at a senior leadership level declined from 48.0 per cent to 40.4 per cent in the number of senior leadership roles held by people who identify their nationality as other than Australian or New Zealander. The same measure, applied to our total workforce, remained in line with last year at 82.7 per cent (FY2020: 81.0 per cent).\n\nWomen as a percentage of senior leadership decreased from 30.9 per cent in FY2020 to 28.3 per cent 1 due to the organisational restructures where more functional management layers were removed, which have a greater female representation. Female representation on our Board remained at 37.5 per cent (three of our eight Directors), exceeding our target of \u226530 per cent.\n\nProgress towards our FY2024 diversity objectives is driven by the commitment of our senior leaders. Each Executive Committee member is setting internal targets and actions for FY2022 to further the attraction, development and retention of key talent including their commitments towards our diversity and inclusion objectives.\n\n## MEASURING WHAT MATTERS\n\nWe have evolved our suite of metrics for FY2022 to reflect our progress to date and to build on commitments for the future. We will extend our focus from gender and cultural diversity across senior leadership to measure gender balance in the wider workforce. We will also measure sense of belonging and inclusion by our people in the workplace.\n\nGender representation across the senior leadership population will be measured with a slightly tightened definition, reflecting our most influential population of decision-makers. A target for gender representation in the workforce will be introduced for FY2022 and beyond, along with the measurement of inclusion in the workplace in the form of an Inclusion Index.\n\nA full scorecard for FY2021, and FY2022 targets, are included in our FY2021 Sustainability Supplement .\n\n## BOARD FOCUS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Human Resources and Compensation Committee oversees human resource strategy and policy, as well as Director and Executive remuneration frameworks. Our People and Culture strategy was refreshed during the year and has been reshaped to reflect our short and long-term business priorities, and to focus on the key enablers to improve organisational culture.\n\nFor further detail on our remuneration policies and focus areas for the FY2021 financial year, refer to the Remuneration Report on page 86.\n\n- 1 Due to the expanded definition of senior leaders from FY2021, our metric for Women in Senior Leadership, reported in our FY2020 Sustainability Report as 25 per cent, has been adjusted to 30.9 per cent for FY2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

Performance is measured on progress towards achieving our target to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 operational emissions by at least 40 per cent by 2030 from 2019 levels.\n\nThe remuneration of our Executive Committee members will also be measured against additional sustainability metrics as part of the strategic component of their respective scorecards. More detail is included in our Remuneration Report on page 86.\n\n## Integrating climate risk and opportunity\n\nWe test our business strategy against a range of plausible future climate scenarios. Our scenario analysis is designed to challenge our strategic thinking and help identify short and long-term responses to mitigate climate risks and capture new opportunities.\n\nIn FY2021, we made important changes to our approach, including updating our Paris-aligned Scenario 1 to a 1.5\u00b0C pathway. We undertook a series of activities to further integrate climate risk into our strategic and financial planning, including:\n\n- -  using the outcomes of our scenario analysis to drive risk and opportunity awareness and management across the business;\n- -  developing additional climate change risk registers to better understand, integrate and manage our climate risks and opportunities at a regional level; and\n- -  strengthening our assessments of the physical impacts of climate change on our major global assets and operating regions.\n\nWe have outlined our approach to climate risk management, outcomes, and responses to scenario planning in our FY2021 Climate Action Report .\n\n## ACCELERATING DECARBONISATION\n\nWe developed an evidence-based decarbonisation roadmap last year to underpin our 2030 target. Work continued this year to understand longer-term technological and economic pathways towards decarbonisation in 2050 and to complete a full Scope 3 emissions inventory.\n\n## Progress against targets\n\nOur global operational Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions for FY2021 were 1.9 MtCO2-e, a 10 per cent decrease from FY2020.\n\nScope 1 emissions decreased by 12 per cent from FY2020, driven primarily by updates to emissions accounting methodology, contributing 53 per cent of the overall decrease.\n\nLower production due to China trade tensions and improvement in emissions abatement performance also contributed to the decrease.\n\nScope 2 emissions increased 3.5 per cent from FY2020. While we continue to implement a range of energy efficiency initiatives, changes in grid electricity intensity factors in Alberta, Canada have contributed to the observed increase since FY2019.\n\nLast year, we set a target to reduce operational Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by at least 40 per cent by 2030, from 2019 levels. We remain on track to meet this target having reduced operational emissions 13 per cent 4 since the FY2019 base year.\n\nOur global GHG emissions intensity (Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3) was 1.64 tCO2-e per tonne of AN sold. We are on track to remain below our FY2022 target (1.7 tCO2-e per tonne of AN sold). With a full Scope 3 emissions inventory completed in FY2021, we will review and consider future targets encompassing Scope 3 emissions sources during the year ahead.\n\nGlobal Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions were 8.9 MtCO2-e. This represents an eight per cent increase from FY2020 primarily due to accounting for additional Scope 3 emission sources and assessing our full value chain emissions boundary for the first time.\n\n## Global GHG emissions and emissions intensity per tonne of AN sold\n\nNote: FY2019 - FY2020 data has been restated to account for changes in emissions accounting methodology.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

Industrial CO2 is produced because of the natural gas-based production of hydrogen as an ammonia feedstock (Kooragang Island, NSW) and in our cyanide plant (Gladstone, QLD).\n\nWhile our medium-term decarbonisation strategy focuses primarily on nitrous oxide and electricity emissions, we continue to explore options to reduce industrial CO2 emissions including alternative methods to obtain hydrogen and carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) technologies. We are a founding participant in the Australian Industry Energy Transitions Initiative (ETI) to work together with other industry leaders in hard-to-abate sectors on shared challenges to accelerate decarbonisation. Switching from the dominant steam methane reforming process to renewable electrolysis for hydrogen production is a promising opportunity to eliminate these emissions over the long term, and is a goal shared by many of our peers, suppliers, and customers.\n\nCoupling CCUS with steam methane reforming could address a large share of CO2 emissions, however, there are currently no oil or gas producing areas near Kooragang Island, Newcastle, suitable for permanent carbon dioxide storage and geo-sequestration. As a result, pursuing carbon capture and storage (CCS) from Newcastle would incur significant infrastructure and transport cost to other suitable areas.\n\nWe are supporting a carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) mobile demonstration plant which is being designed and commissioned by MCi at our Kooragang Island facility (see case study on page 58).\n\nDuring the year, we led a market process and now better understand the risks and opportunities presented by new electrolysis technology and renewable ammonia market opportunities. An internal manufacturing study for early-stage adoption of hydrogen produced via renewable electrolysis was also completed to understand the safety case, barriers and changes required to manufacturing equipment to facilitate adoption.\n\nProgress depends on the cost-effective supply of large quantities of renewable electricity, and the extent and speed of cost reductions for electrolysers. The ETI finds that renewable electrolysis is expected to be the lowest-cost form of hydrogen production by 2040 4 .\n\n- 4 Butler, C, Maxwell, R, Graham, P & Hayward, J 2021, Australian Industry Energy Transitions Initiative Phase 1 Technical Report, ClimateWorks Australia https://energytransitionsinitiative.org/.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

This was primarily due to improvements in methodology associated with completing our full Scope 3 emissions inventory.\n\nScope 3 emissions associated with the sourcing of ammonia and ammonium nitrate from third parties (as reported for FY2020), increased by 12 per cent on FY2020. This was primarily due to increased volumes following the acquisition of Exsa in April 2020.\n\nOur net zero emissions ambition covers Scope 3 emissions from purchased ammonia and ammonium nitrate. Around two-thirds of our ammonia and almost half of our ammonium nitrate is sourced from global suppliers with emissions reduction targets or operations in countries with net zero emissions targets.\n\n|\n\n## MINERAL CARBONATION INTERNATIONAL ATTRACTING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CAPITAL\n\nIn FY2021, MCi, a start-up backed by Orica, secured a $14.6 million Australian Government grant. The cleantech company has developed a scalable carbon platform technology that converts industrial CO2 emissions into valuable materials for construction, industrial and consumer markets. The innovative technology aligns with our goals of catalysing climate action and optimising resource use through circularity. The MCi collaboration also provides us with an avenue to explore CCUS as a means to address our own industrial CO2 waste stream, which represents 22 per cent of our Scope 1 and 2 inventory.\n\nThe grant - one of the largest to be issued from the Australian Government's CCUS Fund - will help fund construction of a mineral carbonation mobile demonstration plant at our Kooragang Island site. The plant will have access to around 250 thousand tonnes of CO2 emissions from our manufacturing operations and will contribute to the decarbonisation of our operations.\n\nWhile we share a commitment to reduce emissions with our strategic suppliers, we have key levers at our disposal to further reduce indirect emissions:\n\n- -  Engage with our suppliers to collect more accurate emissions data and influence the most material suppliers to set their own emissions reduction targets;\n- -  Embed GHG emissions considerations into the supplier selection process over the long-term, as supply chains align on targets and commitments; and\n- -  Evolution in future product and service design and procurement policies.\n\nThe contribution of these longer-term drivers will depend on technology maturity, deployment, and commercialisation. Effective global climate policy and financial incentives will also be required.\n\n'This CCUS grant will fasttrack MCi's plans to help the hard-to-abate industries towards the transition to net zero. The steel, cement, aluminium, mining, and chemical industries need technologies that help with the transition. This is a key focus not only in Australia, but also in the worldwide race to zero emissions.'\n\n- - CEO Marcus Dawe\n\nIn addition to the Australian Government grant, MCi also attracted its first private investor, ITOCHU, the Japanese corporate giant. ITOCHU will help MCi achieve early commercialisation by looking to leverage its networks in Japan to facilitate further demonstration plants and through collaboration on carbon utilisation technology.\n\n<!-- image -->",

By increasing the precision of the blasting process, we can help our customers achieve better recovery rates and reduced energy per tonne (see Design for Outcome case study on page 64).\n\nWe are investigating alternate options for hydrogen production through the Australian Industry Energy Transitions Initiative (ETI), alongside other industry leaders in hard-to-abate sectors.\n\nOur Research and Innovation team has developed a Clean Technology Roadmap. This includes several commercial-inconfidence initiatives being pursued to progress early technological development of decarbonised explosives.\n\nLooking ahead, we will build on the growing employee appetite to support our climate change agenda by creating opportunities for local teams to catalyse employee action into the future.\n\n## Responsible advocacy\n\nOur stakeholders expect strong governance and transparency as they pertain to the climate lobbying positions of the membership organisations we belong to.\n\nWe believe industry plays an important role in helping formulate effective policy frameworks, standards, and practices to facilitate a low-carbon economy. We are members of a range of business and industry associations around the world.\n\nThis year, we continued to review our key industry associations to identify any material differences between the climate change and energy positions we hold, and those held by our relevant industry associations. We discontinued our membership with the International Fertilizer Association given Orica's small contribution across the global fertiliser value chain. This decision was driven by cost reduction initiatives rather than any misalignment on climate change positions.\n\nWhere misalignments have been identified, we are engaging with associations to understand, clarify, or confirm their position. In doing so, we consider the significance of the issue, and the scope Orica has, to influence from within. An important consideration is that divergence on some issues like climate change may be outweighed by the overall benefits of membership.\n\nIf misalignment cannot be addressed through constructive engagement, Orica would further assess whether the membership should continue.

We are adopting the MHM framework to manage our material environmental risks. This includes defining key controls and ensuring verification protocols are in place to systematically mitigate adverse environmental impacts.\n\nOur Global Environmental Steering Committee was established this year to oversee the identification and management of material environmental risks and develop programs to increase environmental awareness and communications. The Committee will augment the current regional approach to environmental management with a broader, company-wide lens.\n\nOur continued focus on spill prevention and response has seen a 50 per cent reduction in environmental Severity 1+ 1 events, and a 40 per cent reduction in loss of containment events from FY2020. We achieved our zero Severity 3+ 2 environmental event target.\n\nThere were no significant events with severity 2 3 or greater.\n\n## Optimising resource use through circularity\n\nWe continually look for opportunities to reduce our environmental footprint through the optimal use of resources and materials. This includes opportunities for increased circularity in our supply chains by maximising the use of recycled water and researching new methods to reuse and recycle key waste types.\n\nWe source water from potable, surface, groundwater and recycled water sources.\n\n## CYCLO \u2122 : RECYCLING USED OIL FOR EXPLOSIVES\n\nThis year we launched Cyclo \u2122 , an innovative service to create value from waste. The process combines our emulsifier technology with used oil processing technology, to transform mine site used oil for application in explosives.\n\nCyclo \u2122 is an example of our strategic focus on optimised resource use through circularity. While used oil/ diesel blends have been utilised in process fuels for more than 15 years, the technique requires tight quality control and regular testing when used to manufacture emulsions. As a result, it has only been feasible at sites with access to external laboratory services. In order to service a broader range of customers, we partnered with CreatEnergy to develop a stand-alone, onsite solution which treats used oil to the quality required for emulsion manufacture.\n\nCyclo \u2122 can reduce total explosives fuel costs by 30 per cent and diesel consumption for the manufacture of bulk explosives by 50 per cent. The process reduces the volume of diesel required to be delivered to our customers' operations and eliminates a used oil waste stream that needs to be removed. This reduces truck movements through local communities and the associated logistical challenges and risks, particularly for remote operations.\n\nWe progressed efforts to minimise waste and maximise diversion from landfill. Building on a review of waste data in FY2020, we commenced a company-wide assessment of waste types and sites to target our actions where they will have the most impact.\n\n- 1 Severity 1 events are minor, reversible environmental effects. Short term impacts only in the immediate vicinity of the release. Minor clean-up required with the total cost of any clean-up is less than $100,000.\n- 2 Severity 3 environmental events result in relatively wide-spread serious environmental damage, with some impairment of ecosystem function that will recover after remediation.\n- 3 Severity 2 environmental events have localised but measurable environmental effect that is reversible after clean-up.\n\n|\n\nThis year our total water consumption fell 3 per cent to 2.84 million Kilolitres (kL) and we increased our use of recycled water to 28 per cent from 26 per cent last year.\n\nWhile our potable water intensity fell by 10 per cent to 0.69 kl per tonne of AN sold, we did not meet our target of 0.67 kl per tonne of AN sold. This was due to fluctuating supply of recycled water at our Kooragang Island site.\n\n## Potable water consumption and intensity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPotable (million kl)\n\nPotable intensity (kl/tonne AN)\n\n## Gross waste disposal by destination (kT)\n\n<!-- image -->",

One method is phytoremediation, an environmentally friendly, sustainable technology harnessing the capability of plants to 'clean up' a variety of soil and water contaminants such as explosives, hydrocarbons, and heavy metals by degrading, storing, or immobilising the contaminants as they grow.\n\n## Brownsburg (Canada) phytoremediation progressing\n\nBuilding on work in FY2020, our partnership with University of Montreal's Institut de Recherche en Biologie V\u00e9g\u00e9tale (IRBV) to pilot an experimental program that uses trees and bacteria to remediate soil contamination, is progressing. The site is mainly contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and trace metal elements and has been planted with fast growing species known to be effective for phytoremediation. Through this process PCBs are degraded into harmless substances while trace elements are accumulated and removed to specialist waste centres when the plants are harvested. This approach requires less initial investment, minimal maintenance once the process commences, and offers a range of co-benefits including increased biodiversity, greenhouse gas capture, improved soil function and improved aesthetics. Over the coming growing seasons, the IRBV and Orica team will monitor plant performance and changes in soil contamination.\n\n## Using indigenous plant species to fight historical contamination in Gomia (India)\n\nIn Gomia, surface water contains elevated concentrations of contaminants such as nitrate, lead and perchlorate. Our teams, with the support of the University of Kalyana, Calcutta University, and a local service provider, have planted indigenous plant species, mainly reeds and grasses, in contaminated areas. These plants consume and absorb contaminants as they grow, with some contaminants, such as nitrate, even promoting growth. Once grown, these plants can be harvested with lead and other contaminants safely removed from surface water.\n\nMore than 50,000 seedlings were selected and planted in late July and early August 2021 as part of this large-scale phytoremediation project. These plants will be harvested four months after initial planting with health and growth monitored closely. Our current crop is thriving under challenging conditions and growth has been promising. Once collected, the biomass will be tested to measure contaminants present, and to understand the effectiveness of the mechanism.\n\n## BOARD FOCUS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Safety and Sustainability Committee assists the Board in its oversight of strategy and policy, compliance and risk, and performance and reporting on all safety and sustainability related matters, including climate risk, and the environment.

We continued to provide our customers with critical support ensuring security of supply while our remote and automated technology solutions portfolio expanded to enable the safe delivery of services. We enhanced our value proposition by investing in technology to help accelerate our customers' performance and sustainability ambitions.\n\n## Improved customer satisfaction\n\nOur Voice of Customers (VoC) program independently and consistently captures customer feedback across our operations, with over 800 customers providing insights in FY2021. The main metric to measure customer loyalty and satisfaction is our NPS, which improved for the fourth consecutive year. Customers recognised three key areas where we delivered outstanding performance:\n\n- -  Value through technology and innovation : improved productivity and safety outcomes of our technology solutions and new technologies;\n- -  Outstanding product quality : continuous improvement in quality, reliability, precision, and durability of our products in response to customer feedback; and\n- -  Superior service quality : responsive, timely service and support.\n\nOur FY2021 NPS increased slightly, with an overall improvement of 57.6 per cent in customer satisfaction since the inception of our VoC program in 2017.\n\n## DESIGN FOR OUTCOME AT ROY HILL\n\nAt Roy Hill mine in Western Australia's Pilbara region, our Design for Outcome (DfO) solution was deployed to improve mining productivity and increase mining profit. DfO is an artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning based technology that learns from operational data to associate rock and ore properties to applied blasting energy and resultant outcomes.\n\nThe technology's predictive algorithm domains the geology in each drill hole and matches explosives energy to each domain, producing tailored hole-by-hole blast designs and generating automated loading rules for blast charging.\n\nThis technology is supported by our smart explosives delivery systems (MMU \u2122 ). The MMU \u2122 retrieves automated loading rules from the cloud to facilitate accurate explosives charging in line with the loading rules generated by the algorithm, with minimal interaction by the operator. This reduces the variability in blast performance, removing overcharging and redeploying explosives energy to under-blasted areas.\n\nAn additional feature was also implemented to measure reduction in CO2-e emissions associated with lower explosives consumption. Now, with each DfO blast, Scope 1 and 3 emissions are aggregated, enabling more precise reporting of emissions reduction outcomes.\n\nThe system will be expanded to further increase productivity, optimise ore fragmentation, and increase performance in the crushing and processing circuits downstream in the value chain.",

This delivers our full suite of technology and blasting services, including WebGen \u2122 , our wireless initiating system, BlastIQ \u2122 , our digital blast optimisation suite of products and Bulkmaster \u2122 7, our smart explosives delivery system.\n\nThe contract recognises the strength of our people and delivery model to manage the risk of transition, our focus on providing outstanding levels of customer service and our innovative technology solutions. It also demonstrates the depth of knowledge of our customers and their operations.\n\nSince Glencore first trialled our WebGen \u2122 alpha system at Ernest Henry Mine (EHM) in 2016, we have been working to understand their needs and key business drivers. After WebGen \u2122 was adopted at EHM in 2018, we ran a technical forum giving Glencore an opportunity to review our full technology suite. It also allowed our technical experts to review Glencore's mining techniques and propose changes to mining methods to deliver improved safety and productivity outcomes and make optimal use of our cutting-edge technology.\n\nOur relationship with Glencore, from management and site teams to functional experts, was critical to successfully mobilising simultaneously across Queensland, New South Wales, and the Northern Territory. With downtime at Glencore measured in minutes, we managed the transition with no disruption\n\nto operations and no downtime, achieved by running our spare assets in parallel to the incumbent plant.\n\nOur ability to mobilise in a short timeframe demonstrates the strength and commitment of our people, with cross-functional teams working together to deliver excellent outcomes for our customers. This included: talent teams who managed recruitment and onboarding of all new employees; engineering teams who set up temporary and permanent facilities and managed transport of equipment to site; technical engineers and product specialists who provided technical support for new technologies at site; and safety teams who ensured best practice safety standards were implemented and people were protected. Our teams continue to support Glencore in delivering on their productivity and sustainability goals.\n\n## AT /two.tf/zero.tf/hyphen.caseYEARS YOUNG, GROUNDPROBE CONTINUES TO ADD INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO\n\n'At GroundProbe, our aim is to keep people, assets and communities safe through better risk management. The RGR-Velox is the ultimate assistant in reactive safety monitoring.'\n\n- - David Noon, CEO GroundProbe\n\nIn October 2021, our geohazard monitoring business celebrated 20 years of moving people from harm's way. GroundProbe boasts the industry's broadest range of geotechnical monitoring technologies and services and continually strives to design and develop new solutions to best meet customer needs.\n\nThis year, RGR-Velox, a reactive monitoring, and alarming system that complements GroundProbe's predictive monitoring technologies, was added to the product suite.

        "page_content": "## COMMUNITY\n\nFY2021 marked the transition of our community program, with the completion of some corporate partnerships and the implementation of our revised Community Impact and Investment Framework to build safe, resilient and thriving communities.\n\nOur community investment totalled $2.4 million in FY2021. Our contributions this year reflected a more even distribution across regions, better aligned to our operational footprint, with 30 per cent of our contributions outside the Asia Pacific region compared to only 12 per cent in FY2020.\n\n## Community investment by year ($m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Community investment by region (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The Orica Impact Fund\n\nThe Orica Impact Fund (OIF) was launched this year, replacing our previous community partnerships program, with $1 million in grants made available annually to fund selected community projects and programs. The OIF is part of our revised Community Investment and Impact Framework, enhancing our existing regional community investment activity, and targeting strategic investments in our communities of operation to drive long-term benefits and positive social and environmental impact.\n\nThis year, we received 30 funding applications requesting between $10,000 and $100,000 per year (up to a maximum of 3 years). Each application was assessed against a range of criteria, including impact, need and capability of the delivery partner. Of these, 24 initiatives seeking to drive positive impact in education, equality, environment, and wellbeing were approved for funding, including initiatives in Australia, Canada, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Peru, South Africa, Sweden, and the USA. Some of these OIF funded initiatives are described below.\n\n|\n\n## Creating opportunities for women in STEM\n\nWe are passionate about driving gender equality in STEM and equipping the next generation of women with the tools and training required for success in a technology-driven world. In Indonesia, female students account for only two per cent of the total number of students in STEM-based vocational high schools.\n\nThe innovative digital learning program is designed to increase digital literacy for young female students. In partnership with Yayasan Cinta Anak Bangsa (YCAB) Foundation and funded by the OIF for three years, the program will provide 100 high school science teachers and 7,000 students with training. Students will have access to a gamified, interactive digital learning platform, with core objectives of igniting their passion for technology and encouraging them to consider STEM-based career pathways.\n\n## A stepping-stone to a bigger vision\n\nIn Sweden, our manufacturing facility is located in the picturesque town of Gyttorp. The town is small, with limited job opportunities, activities, and amenities available, and many locals opt to travel outside the town for leisure time.\n\nWith our community partners, Kottabergets v\u00e4nner, the goal is to drive local economic development in the town by creating opportunities for tourism. Initially, the project will transform deforested land into a mountain bike trail, attracting cyclists from the local community and from across Sweden and developing an alternate industry in the region.\n\nWhile it may take some years to fully realise the benefits, the project embodies our approach of creating long-term, shared value community partnerships.\n\n## Education in focus\n\nCreating long-term positive impact includes investing in the next generation. In FY2020, community investment in education initiatives formed our second highest category of contribution, outside of emergency relief funding. Once again, many of our initiatives, through the OIF and our site-led social investment programs focus on education. We proudly support communitybased organisations and non-profit organisations around the world as they build pathways for disadvantaged students, encourage equality in STEM education, and develop future change-makers.\n\n## SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES THROUGH COVID/hyphen.case/one.tf/nine.tf\n\nMany of our communities continue to feel the effects of COVID-19, particularly with the rapid spread of the Delta variant. Among the hardest hit areas were our sites in Gomia (India), Bontang (Indonesia), and Lurin (Peru) where health systems and infrastructures have been overwhelmed.\n\nWith our teams on the ground consulting directly with community leaders and organisations about areas of critical need, we provided emergency funding to procure vital medical equipment and services, including personal protective equipment, transportation services, provision of oxygen and medicine supply.\n\n## Collaborating with business community partners in Lurin, Peru\n\nIn Lurin, Peru, the high demand for oxygen to treat COVID-19 patients coupled with low supply resulted in a shortage of medical oxygen. In early 2021, local council and religious leaders began working with locally based companies, requesting assistance to fund and source an oxygen plant for Lurin and surrounding communities.\n\nWith the request prioritised for approval internally, our onsite, group sustainability and supply chain teams immediately commenced the search for an oxygen plant. With high demand, these were difficult to find, however, a call to a local manufacturer yielded the last oxygen plant available within the region.\n\nWith four partners in Lurin's business community, we helped fund the purchase of the oxygen plant enabling medical oxygen to be produced locally, providing vital treatment to those suffering the physical impacts of COVID-19 in Lurin and the surrounding community.",

In 2018, we partnered with the Smith Family to bring their Learning for Life program to Gladstone, Queensland, for the first time. The program recognises the challenges students from disadvantaged backgrounds face as they move through the school system, and provides support in the form of financial assistance, connections to local learning opportunities, and access to Smith Family educational programs.\n\nThis year, we broadened our support by working with the charity to facilitate the Work Inspirations program. This connects students with businesses, building their career aspirations by showcasing opportunities available post-education. Over three days, 13 Orica employees hosted 19 students for a 'day in the life at Orica' highlighting potential career pathways.\n\nIn FY2021, we signed a new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Smith Family to extend our support for the Learning for Life program in Gladstone by a further two years. Our volunteer team at Yarwun will welcome more students in FY2022.\n\n## Empowering the next generation of STEM champions\n\nWith the demand for STEM skill sets growing, we continue to seek community and education partners who are working to spark the interest and passion of students looking to pursue a career in STEM.\n\nThrough our partnership with the Academy of Technology and Engineering (ATSE) in Australia, we support the Science and Technology Education Leveraging Relevance (STELR) project. This program aims to address low participation rates in STEM subjects at a high school level by engaging students through learning modules to investigate and solve real-world science and technology problems.\n\nIn FY2021, Orica supported the establishment of a STELR education program aimed at developing a new generation of Australian sustainability leaders. The education program included developing a new on-line sustainable housing module, challenging students to consider what it would take to build a low energy home. Through this exercise, students learn about the different types of heat transfers and the thermal properties of matter. This is particularly relevant to the Australian context, where sustainable building design is an important tool used to withstand the country's harsh weather conditions, reduce building waste, and lower the greenhouse gas emissions associated with building and powering a home.\n\n## FY2022 Priorities\n\nOur enhanced materiality process in FY2021 has given us a better insight to what is material to our stakeholders and shapes our priorities for FY2022, which include:\n\n- -  Enhancing our approach to First Nations engagement and cultural heritage protection;\n- -  Continued efforts to meaningfully respond to the impacts of COVID-19 (and other emergencies and disasters) on our local communities; and\n- -  Maintaining community investment spend towards achieving our target (at least $15 million by FY2025).\n\n## SUPPLIERS\n\nOur suppliers are a critical part of our value chain and ensure we maintain a secure service for our customers. We work with our suppliers to mitigate sustainability impacts and promote sustainable practices across our value chain.\n\nIn FY2021, we procured products and services from 8,500 suppliers in 53 countries around the world, with a total procurement spend of $2.9 billion. The reduction of our supply base from FY2020 is a result of active consolidation of spend through our strategic sourcing programme targeted at optimising cost, improving security of supply of quality products and services, and developing supplier relationships that are strategically aligned with our objectives.\n\n## Minimising Supply Chain Disruption Risks\n\nCOVID-19 continued to impact global supply chains throughout FY2021, with increasing freight costs, container shortages, lack of space on vessels and low levels of reliability of vessel schedules resulting in transportation and shipping challenges. Despite this, Orica's unique global network allowed us to achieve continuity of supply and minimise freight impacts, while maintaining vessel standards and product quality. This was achieved through:\n\n- -  Maintaining an agile internal chartering desk responsible for adjusting shipping modes as required to maintain security of supply to customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nORICA\n\n|",

The statement enhances the principles outlined in our Code of Business Conduct and details our expectations of suppliers on ethical business practices, human and labour rights, and social and environmental impacts.\n\n## Modern slavery response\n\nLast year, we performed a risk assessment on our supply chain to identify goods and services with a high potential risk of modern slavery. We have now commenced activities to mitigate those risks. This includes tools developed for use through the source-to-contract process to better understand modern slavery risks prior to engaging a supplier.\n\nThe tools were part of a pilot program on Modern Slavery Risk Management. The results of the pilot have been incorporated into a comprehensive modern slavery gap analysis of our response to managing modern slavery risks throughout our supply chain to provide recommendations for improvement. These recommendations have now been incorporated into our Modern Slavery roadmap and will be implemented over the next three years.\n\nFor more information, refer to our FY2021 Modern Slavery Statement .\n\n## Working towards a decarbonised supply chain\n\nTo meet our ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 1 , we are prioritising and addressing the most material emission sources in our upstream supply chain. As new and emerging technologies scale and become commercial, we will partner with suppliers to source lower emissions intensity AN and ammonia products. The purchase of these products currently accounts for approximately 70 per cent\n\nof our total Scope 3 emissions.\n\nWe continue to directly engage our strategic suppliers, to better understand their activities in managing emissions, identify pathways for future collaboration, and work together towards technological solutions for decarbonisation.\n\n## Responsible sourcing of palm oil\n\nOur purchased bulk palm oil product is sustainably certified, meeting the criteria set out by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). This not-for-profit organisation draws membership from across the palm oil industry, from producers, processors and manufacturers to retailers, and its certification criteria is the most widely accepted standard for certified sustainable palm oil. Our product meets the 'segregated' certification criteria and is sourced from a variety of certified sources.\n\nWe concluded a concept study into the removal of palm oil from emulsions, resulting in the complete removal of palm oil from an emulsion utilised in underground blasting. We continue to investigate the removal of palm oil from other products, ensuring that where substitutions are made, the total environmental impact is reduced.\n\n<!-- image -->",

No Director or officer of the Company has received benefits under an indemnity from the Company during or since the end of the year.\n\nThe Company has paid a premium in respect of a contract insuring officers of the Company and of its controlled entities, against a liability for costs and expenses incurred by them in defending civil or criminal proceedings involving them as such officers, with some exceptions. The insurance contract prohibits disclosure of the nature of the liability insured against and the amount of the premium paid.\n\n## NON/hyphen.caseAUDIT SERVICES\n\nDuring the year, KPMG, the Company's auditor, performed certain other services in addition to its audit responsibilities.\n\nThe Board is satisfied that the provision of non-audit services during the year by the auditor is compatible with, and did not compromise, the auditor's independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 for the following reasons:\n\n- -all non-audit services were subject to the corporate governance procedures adopted by the Company and have been reviewed by the Board Audit and/uni00A0Risk Committee to ensure they do not impact the integrity and objectivity of the auditor; and\n- -the non-audit services provided do not undermine the general principles relating to auditor's independence as set out in APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (Including Independence Standards) , as they did not involve reviewing or auditing the auditor's own work, acting in a management or decision-making capacity for the Company, acting as an advocate for the Company or jointly sharing risks and rewards.\n\nA copy of the lead auditor's independence declaration as required under Section 307C of the Corporations Act 2001 is contained on page 106 of the Annual Report and forms part of this Directors' Report.\n\nDetails of the amounts paid to the auditor of the Company, KPMG, and its related practices for audit and non-audit services provided during the year are disclosed in note 21 to the Annual Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nORICA\n\n|",

With the impact of/uni00A0COVID-19 more prolonged than previously anticipated, we have remained focused on the safety and wellbeing of our people and are also/uni00A0making good progress towards becoming a/uni00A0more sustainable organisation. We have seen significant change at an executive leadership level and our commitment to talent development and succession planning in recent years resulted in all new Executive Committee members being drawn from internal candidates.\n\nGiven our financial performance, the following key decisions were made during the year:\n\n- -On appointment of Sanjeev Gandhi as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Board took the opportunity to reshape the CEO remuneration package. In addition to decreasing fixed annual remuneration (FAR) compared to the previous incumbent, a/uni00A0substantial portion of the CEO's FAR is now/uni00A0provided in equity which ensures immediate and ongoing alignment with the shareholder experience. We also addressed feedback from our investors and decreased the CEO's maximum short-term incentive (STI) opportunity from 200% to 150%, and the long-term incentive (LTI) grant opportunity from 215% to 200%.\n\n|\n\n- -No remuneration increases were received by/uni00A0Executives who remained in the same role/uni00A0during FY2021. For those individuals whose role changed as part of the reshaping of our Executive Committee, their fixed annual remuneration was set lower than the/uni00A0prior incumbent.\n- -Board fees did not change in FY2021 and will remain at the same level for FY2022. In/uni00A0addition, Malcolm Broomhead elected to/uni00A0forfeit his Board Chair fees from 1 June to/uni00A030 September 2021 in support of our cost/uni00A0reduction focus in the second half of/uni00A0FY2021.\n\n## OUTCOMES UNDER ORICA INCENTIVE PLANS\n\nThe average Executive STI scorecard outcome was 56.7% driven by positive safety and environmental performance, and progress during FY2021 against key strategic objectives. As in prior years, we consider the non-financial components of the Executive STI scorecards to be of the utmost importance to running a safe and sustainable business. However, given financial performance over FY2021, the Board exercised its discretion not to award any payments under the Executive STI plan to the CEO or other Executives so as to better align with the shareholder experience.\n\nThe FY2018 LTI award (1 October 2017 to 30 September 2020) did not vest following testing in November 2020, with average Return on Net Assets (RONA) performance below the required threshold.\n\n## EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION IN FY2022\n\nAs foreshadowed last year, during FY2021 the/uni00A0Board undertook a formal review of our Executive Remuneration Framework, engaging with shareholders and other stakeholders as part of this process to better understand their view of our current framework and practices. In/uni00A0addition to the revised CEO remuneration structure on Sanjeev Gandhi's appointment, two key changes will be made to our incentive plans from FY2022.\n\n## Relative Total Shareholder Return (rTSR) introduced into the LTI\n\nThe LTI previously included an rTSR metric. This,/uni00A0along with Return on Capital (ROC), was replaced in 2018 with the current RONA metric to better support the implementation of our/uni00A0transformation program. Last year, we committed to reviewing the LTI metrics as part of the Executive Remuneration Framework review, resulting in a decision to introduce rTSR to complement RONA as a second equally weighted metric. The Board believes that RONA remains the most appropriate internal financial metric given the need for improved operating and capital efficiency, however, we recognise our investors are seeking more direct shareholder alignment through the current recovery phase.\n\n## Focusing on sustainability\n\nRecognising the importance of monitoring the environmental impact of our operations, in FY2021 we introduced Loss of Containment (LOC) as an environmental metric within our STI scorecard. For FY2022, the renamed 'Safety and Sustainability' component of our STI scorecard will include a greenhouse gas emissions-based metric in addition to LOC. The new metric is aligned with our stated objective to reduce Scope 1 and 2 operational emissions by at least 40% by FY2030. To ensure sufficient weighting on each STI metric we have focused our safety performance on the Serious Injury Case Rate (SICR) which will have a higher weighting for FY2022 and the High Potential Incident (HPI) Injury Ratio will be removed from our scorecard. HPIs will continue to be closely monitored internally as a leading indicator to focus on sustained performance. We have also adjusted the weighting of metrics within the financial component of the STI scorecard. Detail on our FY2022 CEO STI scorecard, including weightings, is shown in Section 2.6.\n\nWe appreciate your ongoing support and I look forward to engaging with you again in FY2022.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Maxine Brenner\n\nChairman, Human Resources and Compensation Committee",

KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL\n\n## 1.1  Executive Key Management Personnel\n\nThe table below lists the Executives of the Company who, together with the Non-Executive Directors, were defined as Key Management Personnel (KMP) under Australian Accounting Standards for FY2021. For the purpose of this Remuneration Report, references to Executives are to the Executive KMP and other Executive Committee members with the same remuneration arrangements as the Executive KMP.\n\nIn addition to appointing a new Managing Director and CEO, several changes were made to our Executive KMP during FY2021, including the transition of individuals into new roles and the creation of a new Chief Technology Officer position with accountability for our customer-facing technology and innovation agenda. As a result of changes to the manufacturing structure, the Chief Manufacturing Officer position has also ceased to exist, and a new Senior Vice President Discrete Manufacturing and Supply role was created that is not considered to be KMP.\n\n| Name                 | Role in FY2021                             | Commencement date in role    | Country of residence   |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Executive Director   |                                            |                              |                        |\n| Sanjeev Gandhi       | Managing Director and CEO                  | 1/uni00A0April/uni00A02021   | Australia              |\n|                      | President - Australia Pacific & Asia       | 20/uni00A0July/uni00A02020   | Australia              |\n| Executive KMP        |                                            |                              |                        |\n| Christopher Davis    | Chief Financial Officer                    | 1/uni00A0October/uni00A02018 | Australia              |\n| James Bonnor (1)     | President - Europe, Middle East and Africa | 1/uni00A0July/uni00A02021    | United Kingdom         |\n|                      | President - North America                  | 1/uni00A0October/uni00A02015 | United States          |\n| Brian Gillespie (2)  | President - Latin America                  | 3/uni00A0May/uni00A02021     | Australia              |\n| Angus Melbourne      | Chief Technology Officer                   | 1 April 2021                 | Australia              |\n|                      | Chief Commercial Officer                   | 1 October 2016               | Australia              |\n| Germ\u00e1n Morales (2)   | President - Australia Pacific & Asia       | 1 April 2021                 | Australia              |\n|                      | President - Latin America & Supply         | 1 September 2018             | Chile                  |\n| Former Executive KMP |                                            |                              |                        |\n| Alberto Calderon (3) | Managing Director and CEO                  | 19/uni00A0May/uni00A02015    | Australia              |\n| Darryl Cuzzubbo (4)  | Chief Manufacturing Officer                | 7/uni00A0October/uni00A02019 | Australia              |\n| Thomas Schutte (5)   | President - Europe, Middle East and Africa | 1/uni00A0October/uni00A02017 | United Kingdom         |\n\n- (1) James Bonnor continued to act in the President - North America role until James Crough's appointment as President - North America on 1 October 2021.\n- (2) Germ\u00e1n Morales continued in the President - Latin America role until his relocation to Australia in May 2021.

KEY STAKEHOLDER QUESTIONS\n\n## 2.1  How is Executive remuneration structured?\n\nOur Executive Remuneration Framework is weighted towards variable (at-risk) remuneration to align with the interests of our shareholders and drive performance against short-term and long-term business objectives.\n\nAssuming target STI and the face value of LTI granted to Executives, the current policy remuneration mix is:\n\n- -CEO : 75.0% variable based on performance, 62.5% of which is delivered as deferred shares or performance rights; and\n- -Other Executives : 64.3% variable based on performance, 50.0% of which is delivered as deferred shares or performance rights.\n\n## Previous Mix\n\n## Current Mix\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.2  What is the new CEO's fixed equity component?\n\nAs Sanjeev Gandhi was appointed as CEO within 12 months of joining Orica, the Board considered it important to deliver a portion of his FAR in the form of Orica equity to ensure immediate and ongoing alignment with shareholders. The fixed equity component is equal to 17.6% of total FAR and is granted in the form of restricted rights which vest monthly in alignment with the payment of fixed cash. For FY2021, a pro-rata grant was made post-half-year results as outlined below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Apr 2021   | May 2021                                          | Jun 2021                                          | Jul 2021                                          | Aug 2021                                          | Sept  2021   | Grant of restricted rights                               | Vesting date                                             |\n|------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fixed Cash | Fixed Cash                                        | Fixed Cash                                        | Fixed Cash                                        | Fixed Cash                                        | Fixed Cash   |                                                          |                                                          |\n|            | Fixed Equity  - monthly vesting in equal tranches | Fixed Equity  - monthly vesting in equal tranches | Fixed Equity  - monthly vesting in equal tranches | Fixed Equity  - monthly vesting in equal tranches |              | Holding lock until CEO holds 150% x FAR in vested equity | Holding lock until CEO holds 150% x FAR in vested equity |\n\nFor FY2021, the actual number of restricted rights granted was determined based on the VWAP of Orica shares over the five days up to and including the effective date of appointment. For the FY2022 grant, the VWAP period will be the five days following full-year financial results, consistent with the approach for the allocation of equity under the deferred STI and LTI plans. Vested Rights are exercisable for a five-year period from grant, with the underlying shares subject to a holding lock until the CEO exceeds his minimum shareholding requirement, except where the sale of shares is required to meet tax obligations.\n\nIn setting the new CEO remuneration package and in recognition of the new fixed equity component, the minimum shareholding requirement was increased from 100% to 150% of FAR and the time period allowed to reach this holding was reduced from six to five years from appointment. Further information on the CEO's fixed equity is detailed in Section 3.1.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report (continued)\n\n## 2.5  What were the termination arrangements for the former CEO?\n\nAlberto Calderon ceased as CEO on 31 March 2021 however he remained in employment with Orica from 1 April to 31 May 2021 to support the transition of the CEO role to Sanjeev Gandhi. While contractually entitled to receive a separation payment equivalent to six months' salary, it was mutually agreed this payment would not be made. On termination, he forfeited any entitlement to the FY2021 STI and all unvested equity awards (including the FY2020 STI deferred shares and FY2021, FY2020 and FY2019 LTI awards) lapsed. The FY2019 and FY2018 STI deferred shares, which vested prior to termination in December 2019 and December 2020 respectively, remain on foot and subject to the original disposal restrictions aside from a portion of shares that were released to cover a tax liability on termination.\n\n## 2.6  What were the outcomes of the Executive Remuneration Framework review?\n\nAs flagged in our FY2020 Remuneration Report, the Board undertook a formal review of our Executive Remuneration Framework during FY2021, with a/uni00A0focus on ensuring the framework supports our business strategy, aligns with shareholders' interests, enables us to attract, engage and retain talent, and/uni00A0motivates our people to deliver their best performance.\n\nFollowing the 2020 AGM and throughout the review process, we engaged with investors and proxy advisors to understand their views. The new CEO remuneration framework took into account the feedback received on quantum, structure and shareholder alignment. We also recognise that direct alignment of executive remuneration with share price is critical over the near term and for this reason, rTSR will be introduced as a second measure (in/uni00A0addition to RONA), linking 50% of the CEO and other Executives' LTI outcomes to our share price performance.\n\nIn relation to the STI, we have shown our commitment to reducing the impact of our business on the environment through the introduction of the Loss of Containment/uni00A0metric in FY2021. In further support of this and aligned with our stated 2030 emissions reduction objective, the revised Safety and Sustainability component of FY2022 STI scorecards will include a new greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions metric. With Serious Injury Case Rate the primary safety metric,/uni00A0the weighting on this metric has also been increased. For other Executives, the Strategic component of their FY2022 STI scorecard will include an additional sustainability-based metric aligned to their specific role within the organisation.

FY2021 outcomes against the STI metrics within the FY2021 CEO scorecard are summarised below.\n\nOther Executive KMP FY2021 STI scorecard outcomes would have delivered payments between 51.7% and 62.6% of target. The scorecard outcomes were predominantly driven by safety and environmental performance, and delivery of strategic priorities. These priorities were determined and approved by the Board at the commencement of FY2021 based on their role and included enhancing Orica's development and use of technology, and operating efficiency.\n\nNotwithstanding the importance of ensuring an ongoing focus on safety, sustainability and long-term strategic activities, considering the degree to which our FY2021 annual financial results were below expectations, the Board has exercised discretion not to make any payments under the FY2021 Executive STI plan to the CEO or other Executives. The Board's decision also took into account the shareholder experience over the financial year.\n\n2021 performance\n\n|                                            |

REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE\n\n## 5.1  Responsibility for setting remuneration\n\nThe HR&C (the Committee) is delegated responsibility by the Board for reviewing and making recommendations on our remuneration policies, including policies governing the remuneration of Executives.\n\nActivities of the Committee are governed by its Terms of Reference, which are available on our website at www.orica.com. Among other responsibilities, the Committee assists the Board in its oversight of:\n\n- (a) remuneration policy for Executives;\n- (b) level and structure of remuneration for Senior Executives, including STI and LTI plans;\n- (c) the Company's compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in respect of remuneration matters; and\n- (d) approval of the allocation of shares and awards under Orica's equity programs.\n\n## 5.2  Use of remuneration advisors during the year\n\nNo remuneration recommendations were received from remuneration advisors as defined under the Corporations Act 2001 .\n\n## 5.3  Securities dealing policy and Malus\n\n## Securities dealing\n\nAll Executives are required to comply with our Securities Dealing Policy at all times and in respect of all Orica shares held, including any defined employee share plans. Trading is subject to pre-clearance and is not permitted during designated blackout periods unless there are exceptional circumstances. Executives are prohibited from using any Orica shares as collateral in any margin loan or derivative arrangement.\n\n## Malus\n\nOrica's Malus Standard allows the Board to require any Executive to forfeit in full or in part, any unvested LTI or deferred STI award as a result of:\n\n- -a material misstatement in financial results;\n- -behaviour that brings Orica into disrepute or has the potential to do so;\n- -serious misconduct; and\n- -any other circumstance, which the Board has determined in good faith.\n\nIn considering whether any adjustment is necessary in respect of any or all participants, the Board may take into account the individual's level of responsibility, accountability or influence over the action or inaction, the quantum of the actual loss or damage, any impact on our financial soundness or reputational standing, the extent to which any internal policies, external regulations and/or risk management requirements were breached, and any other relevant matters.\n\n## 5.4  Executive and Director share ownership\n\nThe Board considers that an important foundation of our Executive Remuneration Framework is that each Executive and Director accumulate and hold a significant number of Orica shares to align their interests as long-term investors.\n\n## Executives\n\nThe Executive Minimum Shareholding Guideline requires each Executive to accumulate a minimum vested equity holding in Orica over a fixed time period from their appointment. During FY2021, the CEO requirement was increased to 150% of FAR (from 100%) with the time period decreased to five years from appointment (from six years). The requirement for other Executives was unchanged from FY2020 at 50% of FAR over six years from appointment (by 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02022 for Executives employed prior to 1/uni00A0January/uni00A02015, the effective date of the guideline). Under the current Executive Remuneration Framework, at target performance and vesting, Executives would exceed these guidelines.\n\n## Non-Executive Directors\n\nTo create alignment between Directors and shareholders, Directors are required to hold (or have a benefit in) shares in the Company equivalent in value to at least one year's base fees. Such holdings must be acquired over a reasonable time using personal funds.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nORICA\n\n|",

Where appropriate, comparative information has been reclassified to conform to changes in presentation and to enhance comparability.\n\nDisclosure may be considered material and relevant if the dollar amount is significant due to size or nature, or the information is important to understand the:\n\n- -Group's current year results;\n- -impact of significant changes in Orica's business; or\n- -aspects of the Group's operations that are important to future performance.\n\nExcept as described in note 24, the financial statements have been prepared using consistent accounting policies in line with those of the previous financial year and corresponding interim reporting period.\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to the overall financial statements\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\n## Functional and Presentation Currency\n\nThe Company's functional and presentation currency is Australian dollars. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.\n\n## Transactions and Balances\n\nTransactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company or entity concerned are recorded using the exchange rate on the date of the/uni00A0transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies at the balance date are retranslated at closing exchange rates. Non-monetary assets are not retranslated unless they are carried at fair value. Gains and losses arising on the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities/uni00A0are included in the income statement, except where the application of hedge accounting requires inclusion in other comprehensive income (refer/uni00A0to note/uni00A010).\n\n## Consolidation of Group Entities\n\nOn consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars at the closing rate at balance date. The results of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars at average exchange rates for the period where these do not materially differ from rates applicable on the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign operations are recognised directly in a separate component of/uni00A0equity.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nApplication of the Group accounting policies requires management to make judgements, and to apply estimates and assumptions to future events. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and which are material to the report, are highlighted in the following/uni00A0notes:\n\nNote 3\n\nNet debt\n\nNote 5 Working capital\n\nNote 6 Provisions\n\nNote 7\n\nProperty, plant and equipment\n\nNote 8\n\nIntangible assets\n\nNote 9 Impairment testing of assets\n\nNote 11  Taxation\n\nNote 14  Businesses and non-controlling interests acquired\n\nNote 19  Defined benefit obligations\n\nNote 20  Contingent liabilities",

If the consideration includes a variable amount (net of trade discounts and volume rebates), the Group estimates the amount of consideration to/uni00A0which it will be entitled. The majority of the Group's operations are conducted under Master Service Agreements which require customers to place orders for goods or services on a periodic basis. The performance obligations are identified at the point that the customer places the order.\n\n## Supply of products and provision of services\n\nRevenue is derived from contractual agreements for either:\n\n- -the supply of products; or\n- -the supply of products and the provision of services.\n\nContracts for the supply of products are one performance obligation; and contracts for the supply of products and services include one or two separate performance obligations depending on whether the customer can benefit from the products independently of the services.\n\nProduct revenue is recognised when the goods are delivered to the contracted point of delivery as this is the point at which the customer gains control of/uni00A0the product and the performance obligation is satisfied by the Group.\n\nService revenue is recognised over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Group's performance. Where products and services are combined into one single performance obligation, revenue is recognised over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance.\n\n## Contracts to provide a designated output\n\nThe provision of goods and services in contracts that provide a designated quantity of output results in the identification of a single performance obligation to deliver an integrated service to the customer. Revenue from this performance obligation is recognised over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Group's performance.\n\n|",

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\nOrica's objectives when managing capital (net debt and total equity) are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and to ensure that the capital structure enhances, protects and balances financial flexibility against minimising the cost of capital. This section outlines the principal capital management initiatives that have been undertaken, current year drivers of the Group's cash flows, as well as the key operating assets used and liabilities incurred to support financial performance.\n\n## 3.  NET DEBT AND NET FINANCING COSTS\n\nIn order to maintain an appropriate capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, utilise a dividend reinvestment plan, return capital to shareholders such as a share buy-back or issue new equity, in addition to incurring an appropriate level of borrowings. Currently, Orica maintains a dividend payout ratio policy and expects the total payout ratio to be in the range of 40%-70% of underlying earnings. It is also expected that the total dividend paid each year will be weighted towards the final dividend.\n\nOrica monitors debt capacity against a number of key credit metrics aligned to debt covenants, principally the gearing ratio (net debt excluding lease liabilities divided by net debt excluding lease liabilities plus equity) and the interest cover ratio (EBIT excluding individually significant items, divided by net/uni00A0financing costs excluding lease interest). These ratios, together with performance measure criteria determined by Standard & Poor's, are targeted in/uni00A0support of the maintenance of an investment grade credit rating, which enables access to borrowings from a range of sources. Standard & Poor's key/uni00A0measures include Funds from Operations (FFO)/Debt and Debt/EBITDA. Of note, Standard & Poor's rating methodology adjusts Orica's net debt to incorporate post-retirement benefit obligations, asset retirement obligations (i.e. environmental and decommissioning provisions) and leases. Orica's debt covenants are exclusive of these items.\n\nThe Group's current target for gearing is 30%-40% and interest cover is 5 times or greater.

Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing liabilities are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the liabilities on an effective interest basis, unless they are liabilities designated in a fair value relationship in which case they continue to be measured at fair value (refer to note 10).\n\n## Financing costs\n\nBorrowing costs are expensed as incurred unless they relate to qualifying assets where interest on funds are capitalised. Interest income and interest expense relating to interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps are presented on a net basis.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nThe Group recognises all lease liabilities and corresponding right of use assets, with the exception of short-term (12 months or less) and low-value leases, on the balance sheet. Lease liabilities are recorded at the present value of fixed payments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, amounts payable under residual value guarantees and extension options expected to be exercised. Where a lease contains an extension option which the Group can exercise without negotiation, lease payments for the extension period are included in the liability if the Group is reasonably certain that it will exercise the option. Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate are excluded from the liability. Lease payments are discounted at the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee unless the rate implicit in the lease can be readily determined.\n\nLease liabilities are remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate, or a change in the assessed lease term. A corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right of use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount has been reduced to zero.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->",

NET DEBT AND NET FINANCING COSTS (continued)\n\nThe Group applied judgement to determine the incremental borrowing rates as well as the lease term for some lease contracts that include extension or termination options. The assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right of use assets recognised.\n\nThe Group recognises depreciation of the right of use assets and interest on the lease liabilities in the income statement over the lease term. Repayments of lease liabilities are separated into a principal portion (presented within financing activities) and interest portion (presented within operating activities) in the cash flow statement.\n\nExpenses relating to short-term and low-value leases of $38.2 million (2020 $31.7 million) and variable lease payments not included in lease liabilities of $52.7 million (2020 $115.9 million) have been recognised in the income statement. Total cash outflow for leases was $164.0 million (2020 $221.2 million).\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\n- -Determination of the discount rate to use\n- -Determination of whether it is reasonably certain that an extension or termination option will be exercised\n\n## 4.

The Group continuously looks to improve working capital efficiency in order to maximise operating cash flow.\n\n|                        | Consolidated   | Consolidated   |\n|------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                        | 2021  $m       | 2020  $m       |\n| Inventories (i)        | 635.8          | 610.0          |\n| Trade receivables (ii) | 678.2          | 837.7          |\n| Trade payables (iii)   | (876.5)        | (739.7)        |\n| Trade working capital  | 437.5          | 708.0          |\n\n## (i) Inventories\n\nThe classification of inventories is detailed below:\n\n|                  | Consolidated   | Consolidated   |\n|------------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                  | 2021  $m       | 2020  $m       |\n| Raw materials    | 223.2          | 219.8          |\n| Work in progress | 0.1            | 2.3            |\n| Finished goods   | 412.5          | 387.9          |\n|                  | 635.8          | 610.0          |\n\n## Recognition and Measurement\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on a first-in first-out or weighted average basis. For manufactured goods, cost includes direct material and fixed overheads based on normal operating capacity. Inventories have been shown net of provision for impairment of $38.3 million (2020 $45.7 million).\n\n## (ii)  Trade receivables\n\nThe ageing of trade receivables and allowance for impairment is detailed below:\n\n|                        | Consolidated    | Consolidated        | Consolidated    | Consolidated        |\n|------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------|\n|                        | 2021  Gross  $m | 2021  Allowance  $m | 2020  Gross  $m | 2020  Allowance  $m |\n| Not past due           | 611.9           | -                   | 750.7           | -                   |\n| Past due 0 - 30 days   | 65.6            | -                   | 78.5            | -                   |\n| Past due 31 - 120 days | 20.6            | (19.9)              | 37.3            | (28.8)              |\n| Past 120 days          | 48.7            | (48.7)              | 47.1            | (47.1)              |\n|                        | 746.8           | (68.6)              | 913.6           | (75.9)              |\n\n## Recognition and Measurement\n\nThe collectability of trade and other receivables is assessed continuously, specific allowances are made for any doubtful trade and other receivables based/uni00A0on a review of all outstanding amounts at year end. The expected impairment loss calculation for trade receivables considers both quantitative information from historic credit losses as well as qualitative information on different customer/debtor profiles and segments. The net carrying amount of/uni00A0trade and other receivables approximates their fair values. A risk assessment process is used for all accounts, with a stop credit process in place for most/uni00A0long overdue accounts.\n\n|",

WORKING CAPITAL (continued)\n\n## (iii)  Trade payables\n\n## Recognition and Measurement\n\nTrade and other payables are recognised when the Group is required to make future payments as a result of the purchase of goods or as services provided prior to the end of the reporting period. The carrying amount of trade payables approximates their fair values due to their short-term nature.\n\n## (b) Non-trade working capital\n\nNon-trade working capital includes all other receivables and payables not related to the purchase of goods and is recognised net of provisions for impairment of $28.0 million (2020 $20.9 million).\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nIn the course of normal trading activities, management uses its judgement in establishing the carrying value of various elements of working capital - principally inventory and accounts receivable. Provisions are established for obsolete or slow moving inventories. Actual expenses in/uni00A0future periods may be different from the provisions established and any such differences would impact future earnings of the Group.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nWhilst the impact of COVID-19 has been considered, it did not have a material impact on the expected impairment loss on the closing receivables balance for the Group.\n\n## 6.

The present value of/uni00A0the estimated costs of dismantling and removing the asset and restoring the site on which it is located are recognised as a depreciable asset with a/uni00A0corresponding provision being raised where a legal or constructive obligation exists.\n\nAt each reporting date, the liability is remeasured in line with changes in discount rates, timing and estimated cash flows. Any changes in the liability are/uni00A0added to or deducted from the related asset, other than the unwinding of the discount which is recognised as a finance cost.\n\n## Environmental\n\nEstimated costs for the remediation of soil, groundwater and untreated waste are recognised when there is a legal or constructive obligation to remediate and the associated costs can be reliably estimated.\n\nWhere the cost relates to land held for resale then, to the extent that the expected realisation exceeds both the book value of the land and the estimated cost of remediation, the cost is capitalised as part of the carrying value of that land, otherwise it is expensed.\n\nThe amount of provision reflects the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation having regard to a range of potential scenarios, input from subject matter experts on appropriate remediation techniques and relevant technological advances.\n\n|",

PROVISIONS\n\n(continued)\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\n## Botany groundwater remediation\n\nOrica's historical operations at the Botany Industrial Park resulted in contamination of the soil and groundwater. Due to the complex nature of the chemicals involved and its distribution e.g. Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (DNAPL), the lack of known practical remediation approaches and the unknown scale of the contamination, a practical solution to completely remediate the contamination has not been found. Orica continues to/uni00A0work in close cooperation with the New South Wales (NSW) Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) to address the contamination.\n\nOrica has a current obligation to contain and mitigate the effects of the contamination on the groundwater at the site. Orica and the NSW EPA entered into a Voluntary Management Proposal to contain groundwater contamination while an effective remediation approach to the DNAPL source contamination is identified.\n\nThe findings from the 2018 review of costs and operational duration of the Groundwater Treatment Plant (GTP) indicated that the cessation of/uni00A0groundwater extraction using the GTP is possible within an 18-year timeframe. The review considered existing remediation technologies which/uni00A0would augment the existing 'pump and treat' methodology, with the expectation that the operating costs of the GTP would reduce. This/uni00A0assumption had been included as a future cost saving within the provision calculation.\n\nOne of these remediation technologies has been piloted, however the performance of the trials to date has been limited by lower biological activity than expected. It is considered unlikely that results will improve, therefore the assumption of the future cost saving has been removed from the provision calculation. This has resulted in an increase to the environmental provision which has been reflected in the Financial Statements with the expense included as a significant item.\n\n## Provisions for other sites\n\nFor other sites where Orica has recognised a provision for environmental remediation, judgement is required in determining the future expenditure required to settle the obligation due to uncertainties in the assumptions regarding the nature or extent of the contamination, the/uni00A0application of relevant laws or regulations and the information available at certain locations where Orica no longer controls the site. Changes/uni00A0in/uni00A0these assumptions may impact future reported results. Subject to those factors, but taking into consideration experience gained to/uni00A0date regarding environmental matters of a similar nature, Orica believes the provision balances are appropriate based on currently available information. However, considering the uncertainties noted above the costs incurred in future periods may be greater than or less than the amounts provided.\n\n## Contingent environmental liabilities\n\n## Botany - remediation of source contamination\n\nSpecifically related to the remediation of DNAPL source contamination a reliable estimate of the costs to complete remediation is not possible given the lack of proven remediation techniques that can be effectively deployed at the site and uncertainty of the scale of the DNAPL contamination. This position was confirmed during the year when management held a strategy workshop with both remediation experts and/uni00A0the/uni00A0NSW EPA to review developments in applicable technology, the level of assessed contamination and whether alternate remediation approaches could be implemented.\n\n## Other sites\n\nIn respect of historical and current operations, certain sites owned or used by the Group may require future remediation actions.\n\nSites with significant uncertainties relating to the following are disclosed as contingent liabilities:\n\n- -Sites where contamination is known or likely to exist, however the impact cannot be reliably measured due to uncertainties related to the extent of Orica's remediation obligations or the remediation techniques that may be utilised; or\n- -Sites where known contamination exists but does not pose a current threat to human health or the environment, therefore no regulatory or/uni00A0formal remediation action is probable.\n\nAny costs associated with these matters are expensed as incurred.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nORICA\n\n|",

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (continued)\n\n## Recognition and Measurement\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the item and includes capitalised interest (refer to note 3). Subsequent costs are capitalised only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nThe right of use asset at initial recognition reflects the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made before the commencement date plus any make good obligations and initial direct costs incurred (refer to note 3). The leases recognised by the Group under AASB 16 predominantly relate to property leases including offices and storage as well as plant & equipment leases including vehicles and rail cars.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nManagement reviews the appropriateness of useful lives of assets at least annually, any changes to useful lives may affect prospective depreciation rates and asset carrying values. Depreciation is recorded on a straight line basis using the following useful lives:\n\n|                                | Owned assets   | Right of use assets - leased   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------|\n| Land                           | Indefinite     | 1 to 70 years                  |\n| Buildings and improvements     | 25 to 40 years | 1 to 20 years                  |\n| Machinery, plant and equipment | 3 to 40 years  | 1 to 15 years                  |\n\n## 8.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)\n\n## Individually significant items\n\nThe $122.7 million spend on the SAP project in 2020 that was retrospectively expensed following the IFRIC agenda decision on implementation costs relating to Software as a Service platforms has been separately disclosed as a significant item.\n\nAn impairment expense was recognised against goodwill in the segments EMEA ($162.4 million) and Pilbara ($158.0 million) in 2021. Refer to note 9 for further detail.\n\n## Recognition and Measurement\n\n## Unidentifiable intangibles - Goodwill\n\nWhere the fair value of the consideration paid for a business acquisition exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, the difference is treated as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortised but the recoverable amount is tested for impairment at least annually.\n\n## Identifiable intangibles\n\nDevelopment expenditure is capitalised only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset. Otherwise, it is recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Identifiable intangible assets with a finite life are amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful life to the Group, being up to thirty years. Expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits of the specific asset to which it relates and which the Group controls (therefore excluding Software as a Service). All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nManagement reviews the appropriateness of useful lives of assets at least annually, any changes to useful lives may affect prospective amortisation rates and asset carry values.\n\n## 9.  IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF ASSETS\n\n## Recognition and Measurement\n\n## Methodology\n\nFormal impairment tests are carried out annually for goodwill. In addition, formal impairment tests for all assets are performed when there is an indication of impairment. The Group conducts an internal review of asset values at each reporting period, which is used as a source of information to assess for any indications of impairment. External factors, such as changes in expected future prices, costs and other market factors, are also monitored to assess for indications of impairment. If any such indication exists, an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount is calculated.\n\nIf the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and an impairment loss is charged to the income statement to reduce the carrying amount in the balance sheet to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined using the higher of value in use or fair value less costs to dispose. Value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows. Value in use is determined by applying assumptions specific to the Group's continued use and does not consider future development. The value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on actual operating results, the operating budgets and cash flow forecasts approved by the Board of Directors and a terminal value calculated with reference to long term growth rates. Fair value less costs to dispose is the value that would be received in exchange for an asset in an orderly transaction.\n\nIn testing for indications of impairment and performing impairment calculations, assets are considered as collective groups and referred to as cashgenerating units (CGU). CGUs are the smallest identifiable group of assets, liabilities and associated goodwill that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets with each CGU being no larger than a segment. CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. The test of goodwill and its impairment is undertaken at the segment level, except for the Pilbara CGU, a subcomponent of the Australia Pacific & Asia segment, which contains goodwill related to the establishment of the joint operation with Yara International ASA Group.\n\nThe estimated capital outflows required to meet the Group's commitment to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions by at least 40% by 2030 have been included in the testing. As part of the Group's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting, scenario analysis was performed over climate change risk, which we consider within our impairment modelling. As the Group's TCFD reporting plans develop and quantitative analysis is performed, financial implications will continue to be considered and built into future cash flow assumptions used within impairment modelling.",

YPN owns and operates a 330,000 tonnes per annum industrial grade technical ammonium nitrate plant on the Burrup Peninsula (Western Australia). For accounting purposes YPN is a joint operation and Orica recognises its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses in the consolidated financial statements along with goodwill related to the establishment of the joint operation and capitalised interest.\n\nThe Group's asset base in the Pilbara consists of the TAN plant, the equity accounted investee Orica Mining Services Pilbara Pty Ltd and the Pippingarra emulsion plant. Following a review of product movement and cashflows post the commissioning of the TAN plant on 1 October 2020, management have concluded that the Pilbara is a separate CGU. The recoverable amount for the plant and other assets in the region are below their carrying value and therefore an impairment has been recognised against goodwill of $158.0 million and property, plant and equipment of $159.6 million.\n\nAny variation in the key assumptions of the cash flows would result in a change in the assessed value in use. If the impact of the change had a/uni00A0negative impact, it could, in the absence of other factors, require a further impairment to property, plant & equipment. The key assumptions underlying the value in use calculations are as follows:\n\n- -EBIT growth of $24 million within five years primarily due to volume and price growth.\n- -A terminal growth of 1.2%.\n- -A post-tax discount rate of 8.1%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nORICA\n\n|",

The key assumptions underlying the value in/uni00A0use calculations are as follows:\n\n- -Growth in EBIT to $79 million within five years primarily due to easing of COVID-19 impacts, new technology and growth in Africa and the CIS.\n- -A weighted average terminal growth in line with local country economic forecasts of 3.8%.\n- -A weighted average post-tax discount rate of 14.1%\n\n## LATAM\n\nBased on the latest projected cash flows of the Group, the carrying value of the Latin America segment is approximately equal to its value in use. The value in use calculations are sensitive to earnings forecasts, changes in discount rates and terminal growth rates.\n\nAny variation in the key assumptions of the cash flows would result in a change in the assessed value in use. If the impact of the change had a/uni00A0negative impact, it could, in the absence of other factors require an impairment to goodwill. The key assumptions underlying the value in use calculations are as follows:\n\nGrowth in EBIT to $87 million within five years. This is reliant on achieving future growth in earnings primarily due to easing of COVID-19 impacts, securing new or expanded contracts and delivery of value added services.\n\n- -A weighted average terminal growth in line with local country economic forecasts of 3.1%.\n- -A weighted average post-tax discount rate of 8.9%.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThe Group continues to actively monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impact on economic activity and financial reporting. Significant judgement is required in determining the following key assumptions used to calculate the value in use, which has been updated to reflect uncertainty and the current risk environment:\n\n- -Revenue growth\n- -Foreign exchange rates\n- -Discount rates\n- -Future cash flows\n\nThe potential impact of COVID-19 has been considered in formulating these assumptions.\n\nUltimately due to the ongoing uncertainty as to the extent and duration of COVID-19 restrictions and the overall impact on economic activity, actual results may materially differ from the Group's internal assumptions. This may result in reassessment of indicators of impairment for the Group's assets in future reporting periods.\n\n## 2020\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nAs part of the impairment review and the transition to the new SAP operating system, Orica identified $63.4 million of historic IT assets that would no longer be utilised by the business.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nThe Group is undertaking a global project to rationalise its product portfolio, simplify and reduce its different technologies, and enable the optimisation of the initiating system (IS) plant network. This project is expected to result in a substantial increase in the IS plant network's utilisation by 2024.\n\nAs part of these plans, the Minden, Hallowell and Tappen plants will cease production, with further rationalisation of other manufacturing facilities planned.\n\nThis has resulted in an impairment charge of $33.1 million. In calculating the impairment charge management has used a value in use model to/uni00A0forecast the remaining cashflows to be generated by these plants before they cease production.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Financial Statements Section D.  Managing financial risks\n\nFor the year ended 30 September\n\n## SECTION D.  MANAGING FINANCIAL RISKS\n\nOrica's Review of Operations and Financial Performance highlights funding and other treasury matters as material business risks that could adversely affect the achievement of future business performance.\n\nThis section discusses the principal market and other financial risks that the Group is exposed to and the risk management program, which seeks to mitigate these risks and reduce the volatility of Orica's financial performance.\n\n## 10.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## Financial risk factors\n\nFinancial risk management is carried out centrally by the Group's treasury function under policies approved by the Board.\n\nThe Group's principal financial risks are associated with:\n\n- -interest rate risk (note 10a);\n- -foreign exchange risk (note 10b);\n- -commodity price risk (note 10c);\n- -credit risk (note 10d); and\n- -liquidity risk (note 10e).\n\n## (a)  Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.\n\nThe Group is primarily exposed to interest rate risk on outstanding interest bearing liabilities. Non-derivative interest bearing assets are predominantly short-term liquid assets. Interest bearing liabilities issued at fixed rates expose the Group to a fair value interest rate risk while borrowings issued at a variable rate give rise to a cash flow interest rate risk.\n\nInterest rate risk on long-term interest bearing liabilities is managed by adjusting the ratio of fixed interest debt to variable interest debt. This is managed within policies determined by the Board via the use of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps. As at September 2021, fixed rate borrowings after the impact of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps were $1,268.5 million (2020 $1,462.7 million), representing a fixed/floating split of 61% and 39% respectively (2020 53% and 47%).\n\n## Interest rate sensitivity\n\nA 10% movement in interest rates without management intervention would have a $4.1 million (2020 $5.0 million) impact on profit before tax and a/uni00A0$2.9/uni00A0million (2020 $3.5 million) impact on shareholders' equity.\n\n## (b)  Foreign exchange risk\n\n## i)  Foreign exchange risk - transactional\n\nForeign exchange risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial commitment, recognised asset, liability or cash flow will fluctuate due to changes in/uni00A0foreign currency rates.\n\nThe Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk due to foreign currency borrowings and sales and/or purchases denominated, either directly or indirectly, in/uni00A0currencies other than the functional currencies of the Group's subsidiaries.\n\nForeign exchange risk on foreign currency borrowings is managed using cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. As at September 2021, the notional balance of derivative contracts hedging foreign currency debt was $1,003.4 million (2020 $1,477.1 million).\n\nIn regard to foreign currency risk relating to sales and purchases, the Group may hedge up to 100% of committed exposures utilising a declining percentage over time methodology. Only exposures that can be forecast to a high probability are hedged. Transactions can be hedged for up to five years. The derivative instruments used for hedging purchase and sale exposures are bought vanilla option contracts and forward exchange contracts. Forward exchange contracts may be used only under Board policy for committed exposures and anticipated exposures expected to occur within 12 months. Bought/uni00A0vanilla option contracts may be used for all exposures. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are recognised at their fair value. At reporting date, Orica held foreign exchange contracts with a net asset value of $4.9 million (2020 net asset of $6.8 million).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nORICA\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\nForeign exchange sensitivity\n\nThe table below shows the Group's main exposure to foreign currency transactional risk (Australian dollar equivalent) and the effect on profit or loss and equity had exchange rates been 10% higher or lower than the year end rate with all other variables held constant.\n\nThe analysis takes into account all underlying exposures and related hedges but not the impact of any management actions that might take place if these events occurred.\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n|                                    | USD  $m   | EUR  $m   | USD  $m   | EUR  $m   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents          | 182.4     | 13.4      | 123.4     | 18.5      |\n| Trade and other receivables        | 232.0     | 17.7      | 186.2     | 18.2      |\n| Trade and other payables           | (302.1)   | (16.5)    | (173.0)   | (11.3)    |\n| Interest bearing liabilities       | (1,342.1) | (61.5)    | (1,765.5) | (62.2)    |\n| Net derivatives                    | 1,390.6   | 66.8      | 1,858.3   | 51.7      |\n| Net exposure                       | 160.8     | 19.9      | 229.4     | 14.9      |\n| Effect on profit/(loss) before tax |           |           |           |           |\n| If exchange rates were 10% lower   | 5.5       | 1.0       | 8.8       | 1.3       |\n| If exchange rates were 10% higher  | (4.5)     | (0.8)     | (7.2)     | (1.0)     |\n| Increase/(decrease) in equity      |           |           |           |           |\n| If exchange rates were 10% lower   | 12.5      | 1.5       | 17.8      | 1.2       |\n| If exchange rates were 10% higher  | (10.2)    | (1.3)     | (14.6)    | (0.9)     |\n\n## ii)  Foreign currency risk - translational\n\nForeign currency earnings translation risk arises primarily as a result of earnings generated by foreign operations with functional currencies of CAD, USD, MXN, PEN, RUB and KZT being translated into AUD. Derivative contracts to hedge earnings exposures do not qualify for hedge accounting under Australian Accounting Standards. Board approved policy allows hedging of this exposure in order to reduce the volatility of full year earnings resulting from changes in exchange rates. At reporting date, Orica held no derivative contracts to hedge earnings exposures (2020 nil).\n\n## Net investment in foreign operations\n\nHedging of foreign investment exposures is undertaken primarily through originating debt in the functional currency of the foreign operation, or by raising debt in a different currency and swapping the debt to the currency of the foreign operation using derivative financial instruments. The remaining translation exposure is managed, where considered appropriate, using forward foreign exchange contracts, or cross currency interest rate swaps. As at reporting date, 37.0% of the Group's net investment in foreign operations was hedged (Restated 2020 36.2%).\n\n## (c)  Commodity price risk\n\nCommodity price risk refers to the risk that Orica's profit or loss or equity will fluctuate due to changes in commodity prices.\n\nNatural gas or ammonia are the primary feedstocks in Orica's production process. Orica manages its contract portfolio so that on a mass balance basis it seeks to maintain a low risk position across the contract cycle such that material input cost variations are passed through to customers in price variations through rise and fall adjustments contained in all significant contracts.\n\nThe Group may enter into derivative contracts to hedge commodity price risk that is not eliminated via contractual or other commercial arrangements. At/uni00A0reporting date, Orica held no commodity derivative contracts (2020 nil).\n\n## (d)  Credit risk\n\nCredit risk represents the loss that would be recognised if counterparties failed to meet their obligations under a contract or arrangement. The Group is exposed to credit risk from trade and other receivables and financial instrument contracts.\n\nThe creditworthiness of customers is reviewed prior to granting credit, using trade references and credit reference agencies. Credit limits are established and monitored for each customer, and these limits represent the highest level of exposure that a customer can reach. Trade credit insurance is purchased when required.\n\nThe Group manages bank counterparty risk by ensuring that actual and potential exposure is monitored daily against counterparty credit limits, which have been assigned based on counterparty credit ratings. The Group does not hold any credit derivatives to offset its credit exposures.\n\n|",

These fair values are categorised into hierarchy levels that are representative of the inputs used in measuring the fair value.\n\n| Valuation method   | Level 1 - uses quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.                                                    |\n|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                    | Level 2 - uses inputs for the asset or liability other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. |\n|                    | Level 3 - uses valuation techniques where one or more significant inputs are based on unobservable market data.              |\n\nAt reporting date, other assets and other liabilities on the balance sheet included derivatives carried at fair value and categorised as Level 2 as the inputs are observable. There has been no movement between levels since prior year.\n\nValuation techniques include, where applicable, reference to prices quoted in active markets, discounted cash flow analysis, fair value of recent arm's length transactions involving the same instruments or other instruments that are substantially the same, and option pricing models. Changes in default probabilities are included in the valuation of derivatives using credit and debit valuation adjustments.\n\nThe fair values of forward exchange contracts are calculated by reference to forward exchange market rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles at/uni00A0the time of valuation.\n\nThe fair values of cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps and other financial liabilities measured at fair value are determined using valuation techniques which utilise data from observable markets. Assumptions are based on market conditions existing at each balance date. The fair value is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows using an appropriate market-based yield curve, which is independently derived and representative of Orica's cost of borrowings.\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n| Derivative financial instruments                      | Current  $m   | Non-Current  $m   | Current  $m   | Non-Current  $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|\n| Derivative assets                                     |               |                   |               |                   |\n| Designated as a hedge of interest bearing liabilities | -             | 48.9              | 67.0          | 70.4              |\n| Other                                                 | 8.0           | -                 | 14.8          | -                 |\n| Total                                                 | 8.0           | 48.9              | 81.8          | 70.4              |\n| Derivative liabilities                                |               |                   |               |                   |\n| Designated as a hedge of interest bearing liabilities | -             | (60.6)            | -             | (43.4)            |\n| Other                                                 | (5.1)         | -                 | (3.7)         | -                 |\n| Total                                                 | (5.1)         | (60.6)            | (3.7)         | (43.4)            |\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost\n\nThe fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables (note 5), and trade and other payables (note 5) approximates their carrying amount due to their short maturity.\n\nInterest bearing liabilities excluding lease liabilities have a carrying amount of $2,072.7 million including discontinued operations (note 15) (2020 $2,741.0 million). The carrying amount of bank and other loans which are primarily short-term in nature approximates fair value. Private Placement debt which is primarily long-term in nature has a carrying amount of $2,068.8 million (2020 $2,587.9 million) and a fair value of $2,122.2 million (2020 $2,696.3 million). Fair value of Private Placement debt is determined as the present value of future contracted cash flows discounted using standard valuation techniques at applicable market yields having regard to timing of cash flows.\n\n|",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n(continued)\n\n## Offsetting financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet where Orica currently has a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. No financial assets or liabilities are currently held under netting arrangements.\n\nOrica has entered into derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association ('ISDA') master agreements that do not meet the criteria for offsetting but allow for the related amounts to be set-off in certain circumstances, such as the event of default. As Orica does not presently have a legally enforceable right of set-off, derivatives are presented on a gross basis on the balance sheet.\n\n## Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group uses derivatives and other financial instruments to hedge its exposure to currency, interest rate and commodity price risk exposures arising from operational, financing and investing activities. Where applicable, these instruments are formally designated in hedge relationships as defined by AASB 9. To qualify for hedge accounting the Group formally designates and documents details of the hedge, risk management objective and strategy for entering into the arrangement and methodology used for measuring effectiveness.\n\nHedge accounting relationships are categorised according to the nature of the risks being hedged:\n\n| Hedge type           | Description                                                                                                                                                      |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fair value hedge     | Hedges the change in fair value of recognised assets and liabilities.                                                                                            |\n| Cash flow hedge      | Hedges the exposure to variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk associated with an asset, liability or highly  probable forecast transaction. |\n| Net investment hedge | Hedges the foreign currency translation exposure of the net assets of foreign operations.                                                                        |\n\nCritical terms of hedging instruments and hedged items are transacted to match on a 1:1 ratio by notional values. Matching critical terms enables economic offset thereafter to be determined qualitatively.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness arises primarily from the counterparties' and the Group's own credit risk which is included in the fair value of the derivative hedge instrument but not the hedge item. During the current and prior financial years, there was no material impact on profit or loss resulting from hedge ineffectiveness.\n\nAASB 9 also allows certain costs of hedging to be deferred in equity. Gains or losses associated with 'currency basis' cost of hedging are deferred in the cash flow hedge reserve as they are not material for separate disclosure. The amounts are systematically released to the income statement to align with the hedged exposure.\n\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is expected to be replaced by alternative risk-free rates (ARR) as part of inter-bank offer rate (IBOR) reform. IBOR reform impacts Orica's interest rate swaps, which reference 3-month US LIBOR. At 30 September 2021, the notional value of hedging instruments that reference 3-month US LIBOR is US$170m and Orica has not transitioned any of its existing interest rate swaps to ARR's. It is anticipated that 3-month LIBOR will continue to be published until June 2023 and Orica's interest rate swaps will only transition to ARR once US LIBOR publication ceases. Orica is in the process of developing action plans to ensure a smooth transition to ARR.\n\n## Effects of hedge accounting on financial position and performance\n\n## Fair value and cash flow hedges\n\nThe table below shows the carrying amounts of the Group's Private Placement debt and the derivatives which are designated in fair value and/or cash flow hedge relationships to hedge them:\n\n- -The carrying amount of the Private Placement debt includes foreign exchange remeasurements to year end rates and fair value adjustments when included in a fair value hedge;\n- -The breakdown of the hedging derivatives includes remeasurement of foreign currency notional values at year end rates, fair value movements due to/uni00A0interest rate risk, foreign currency cash flows designated into cash flow hedges, costs of hedging recognised in other comprehensive income and ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement; and\n- -Hedged value represents the carrying amount of the Private Placement debt adjusted for the carrying amount of the designated derivatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nORICA\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->",

TAXATION\n\nThis section outlines the taxes paid by Orica and the impact tax has on the financial statements.\n\nOrica has operations in more than 50 countries, with customers in more than 100 countries. In 2021, Orica paid $219.7 million (2020 $175.6 million) globally in corporate taxes and payroll taxes. Orica collected and remitted $127.1 million (2020 $122.1 million) globally in GST / VAT.\n\nAs Orica operates in a number of countries around the world, it is subject to local tax rules in each of those countries.

TAXATION (continued)\n\n## Recognition and Measurement\n\nIncome tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax and is recognised in the income statement.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates applicable at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nDeferred tax balances are determined by calculating temporary differences based on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their amounts for taxation purposes. Where amounts are recognised directly in equity the corresponding tax impact is also recognised directly in equity.\n\nThe amount of deferred tax provided will be based on the expected manner of realisation of the asset or settlement of the liability, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at reporting date.\n\nA deferred tax asset will be recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets will be reduced to the extent it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\n\n## Tax consolidation\n\nOrica Limited is the parent entity in the tax consolidated group comprising all wholly-owned Australian entities.\n\nDue to the existence of a tax sharing agreement between the entities in the tax consolidated group, the parent entity recognises the tax effects of its own/uni00A0transactions and the current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax credits assumed from the subsidiary entities.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nThe Group is subject to income taxes in Australia and jurisdictions where it has foreign operations and is subject to periodic challenges by local tax authorities on a range of tax matters during the normal course of business. These include transfer pricing, indirect taxes and transaction-related issues. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations undertaken during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.\n\nThe Group recognises liabilities for tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax provision in the period in which such determination is made.\n\nIn addition, deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable profits are available to utilise those temporary differences and losses, and the tax losses continue to be available having regard to the nature and timing of their origination and compliance with the relevant tax legislation associated with their recoupment.\n\nAssumptions are also made about the application of income tax legislation. These assumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty and there is a/uni00A0possibility that changes in circumstances or differences in opinions will alter outcomes which may impact the amount of deferred tax assets and/uni00A0deferred tax liabilities recorded on the balance sheet and the amount of tax losses and timing differences not yet recognised. In these circumstances, the carrying amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change, resulting in an impact on the earnings of the Group.\n\n## Contingent tax liabilities\n\nIn the normal course of business, contingent liabilities may arise from tax investigations or legal proceedings. Where management are of the view that potential liabilities have a low probability of crystallising or it is not possible to quantify them reliably, they are not provided for and are disclosed as contingent liabilities.\n\nConsistent with other companies of the size and diversity of Orica, the Group is the subject of ongoing information requests, investigations and/uni00A0audit activities by tax and regulatory authorities in jurisdictions in which Orica operates. Orica co-operates fully with the tax and regulatory authorities. It is possible that Orica may incur fines and/or other penalties as a consequence of these investigations and audits.\n\n## (i) Brazilian Tax Action\n\nThe Brazilian Taxation Authority (BTA) is claiming unpaid taxes, interest and penalties of approximately $25 million for the 1997 financial year relating to an alleged understatement of income based on an audit of production records. Orica believes BTA has misinterpreted those production records and recently received a favourable decision from the Brazilian Civil Court in relation to an excise dispute based on the same factual matter. This decision should support the income tax dispute.\n\nICI plc, the vendor of the business to Orica, has been notified to preserve Orica's rights under the tax indemnity obtained upon acquisition of the business which provides indemnity for amounts exceeding certain limits. The BTA has been granted a bank guarantee of up to approximately $25/uni00A0million.",

GROUP STRUCTURE\n\nOrica has a diverse spread of global operations, which includes controlled entities incorporated in over 50 countries, as well as entering strategic partnering arrangements with certain third parties. This section highlights the Group structure including Orica's controlled entities, as well as those where Orica holds less than 100% interest.\n\n## 12.  INVESTMENTS IN CONTROLLED ENTITIES\n\n## Recognition and Measurement\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared by combining the financial statements of all the entities that comprise the Group, being the Company (the parent entity) and its subsidiaries as defined in AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements .\n\nOn acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.\n\nWhen the Group relinquishes control over a subsidiary, it derecognises its share of net assets. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any/uni00A0interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the information and results of each subsidiary from the date on which the Company obtains control until such time as the Company ceases to control such entity. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, all intercompany balances, transactions and unrealised profits arising within the Group are eliminated in full.\n\nRefer to note 23 for the list of investments in controlled entities.\n\n## 13.

A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control.\n\n## Joint operations\n\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. Orica recognises its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses in the consolidated financial statements under applicable headings.\n\n## 14.  BUSINESSES AND NON/hyphen.caseCONTROLLING INTERESTS ACQUIRED\n\n## Consolidated - 2021\n\n## Acquisitions of business and controlled entities\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group, in accordance with AASB 3 Business Combinations . On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any/uni00A0excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. The transaction costs are expensed in the income statement.\n\nAs part of Orica's technology development strategy, the Group acquired the shares of Hopper Industrial Group and assets from OreControl Blasting Consultants LLC and OrePro Holdings LLC for total consideration of $22.3 million. No Goodwill was recognised on these transactions.\n\nSince 1 October 2020, the Group has acquired an additional 1.9% of Exsa, for the consideration of $2.8 million. The ownership at 30 September 2021 is/uni00A098.7%.\n\n## Consolidated - 2020 (restated)\n\nAccounting standards permit a measurement period of up to one year during which acquisition accounting can be finalised following the acquisition date. The Group have finalised the accounting of the Exsa S.A. ('Exsa') acquisition which occurred on 30 April 2020, resulting in an adjustment to the fair values below and a corresponding increase in goodwill.\n\n|                                                                                                  | Exsa S.A.  $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Goodwill as at 30 September 2020                                                                 | 6.3             |\n| Adjustments to fair value of net assets property, plant and equipment provision for deferred tax | 36.2            |\n|                                                                                                  | (3.3)           |\n| non-controlling interest                                                                         | (1.0)           |\n| Goodwill as at 30 September 2020 (restated)                                                      | 38.2            |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nORICA\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->",

It/uni00A0represents a separate major line of operations and is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of operation or business.\n\nClassification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal date or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.\n\nWhen an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative income statement and statement of comprehensive income is re-presented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.\n\nDisposal groups comprising assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use.\n\nSuch disposal groups are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Once classified as held for sale, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are no longer amortised or depreciated.\n\n|",

REWARD AND RECOGNITION\n\nOrica operates in more than 50 countries and has more than 13,000 employees. This section provides insights into the reward and recognition of/uni00A0employees, in addition to the employee benefits expense and employee provisions disclosed in the income statement and note 6 respectively.\n\nThis section should be read in conjunction with the Remuneration Report, contained within the Directors' Report, which provides specific details on/uni00A0the/uni00A0setting of remuneration for Key Management Personnel.\n\n## 18.  EMPLOYEE SHARE PLANS AND REMUNERATION\n\nThe following plans have options or rights ('instruments') over Orica shares outstanding at 30 September 2020 and 30 September 2021:\n\n## The Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)\n\nRefer to Remuneration Report.\n\n## Sign-on Rights\n\nFor a select group of senior managers who join Orica post allocation of an LTIP grant (and who generally have forgone at-risk remuneration from their previous employer) rights may be allocated at the discretion of the Orica Board.\n\n## Recognition and Measurement\n\nThe issued instruments are measured at fair value based on valuations prepared by PwC. The fair value is recognised in the income statement over the/uni00A0period that employees become entitled to the instruments.\n\n## Key Management Personnel compensation summary\n\nAs deemed under AASB 124 Related Parties Disclosures , Key Management Personnel (KMP) include each of the Directors, both Executive and Non-Executive, and those members of the Executive Committee who have authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the/uni00A0activities/uni00A0of Orica.\n\nA summary of the KMP compensation is set out in the following table:\n\n|                              | Consolidated   | Consolidated   |\n|------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                              | 2021  $000     | 2020  $000     |\n| Short-term employee benefits | 10,085.5       | 11,463.1       |\n| Other long-term benefits     | 40.1           | 73.5           |\n| Post employment benefits     | 281.3          | 306.2          |\n| Share based payments         | 1,019.7        | (409.1)        |\n| Termination benefits         | 437.5          | -              |\n|                              | 11,864.1       | 11,433.7       |\n\nInformation regarding individual Directors and Executives compensation and some equity instrument disclosures as permitted by Corporation Regulations 2M.3.03 are provided in the Remuneration Report.\n\n## 19.  DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS\n\n## Recognition and Measurement\n\nContributions to defined contribution superannuation funds are recognised in the income statement in the year in which the expense is incurred.\n\nFor each defined benefit scheme, the cost of providing retirement benefits is expensed in the income statement so as to recognise current and past service costs, interest cost on net liabilities, and the effect of any curtailments or settlements. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income. The Group's net liabilities in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the future benefit employees have earned, less the fair/uni00A0value of any plan assets.\n\n## (a)  Defined benefit pension plans\n\nThe Group participates in several Australian and overseas defined benefit post-employment plans that provide benefits to employees upon retirement. Plan funding is carried out in accordance with the requirements of trust deeds and the advice of actuaries. Information within these financial statements has been prepared by the local plan external actuaries. Orica were assisted by Willis Towers Watson to consolidate those results globally. During the year, the Group made employer contributions of $30.7 million (2020 $27.3 million) to defined benefit plans. The Group's external actuaries have forecast total employer contributions and benefit payments to defined benefit plans of $26.8 million for 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nORICA\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->",

While management believes the assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used may impact the earnings and equity of the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nORICA\n\n|",

OTHER\n\nThis section includes additional financial information that is required by Australian Accounting Standards and which management considers to be relevant information for shareholders.\n\n## 20.  CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\n\nContingent liabilities relating to environmental uncertainties are disclosed in note 6 and those relating to taxation in note 11. All others are disclosed below.\n\n## (a)  Guarantees, indemnities and warranties\n\n- -The Group has entered into various long-term supply contracts. For some contracts, minimum charges are payable regardless of the level of operations, but the levels of operations are expected to remain above those that would trigger minimum payments.\n- -There are guarantees relating to certain leases of property, plant and equipment and other agreements arising in the ordinary course of business.\n- -Contracts of sale covering companies and assets which were divested during the current and prior years include commercial warranties and indemnities to the purchasers.\n\n## (b)  Legal, claims and other\n\nThere are a number of legal claims and exposures which arise from the ordinary course of business. There is significant uncertainty as to whether a future liability will arise in respect of these items. The amount of liability, if any, which may arise cannot be reliably measured at this time.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nWhere management are of the view that potential liabilities that arise in the normal course of business have a low probability of crystallising or it is not possible to quantify them reliably, they are not provided for and are disclosed as contingent liabilities.\n\n## Legal proceedings\n\nThe outcome of currently pending and future legal, judicial, regulatory, administrative and other proceedings of a litigious nature ('Proceedings') cannot be predicted with certainty. Proceedings can raise complex legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case, issues regarding the jurisdiction in which each Proceeding is brought and differences in applicable law. Thus, an adverse decision in Proceedings could result in additional costs that are not covered, either wholly or partially, under insurance policies and that could significantly impact the business and results of operations of the Group. Therefore, it is possible that the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Group could be materially affected by an unfavourable outcome of those Proceedings. Proceedings are evaluated on a case-by-case basis considering the available information, including that from legal counsel, to assess potential outcomes.\n\n## Warranties and Indemnities\n\nIn the course of acquisitions and disposals of businesses and assets, Orica routinely negotiates warranties and indemnities across a range of commercial issues and risks, including environmental risks associated with real property. Management uses the information available and exercises judgement in the overall context of these transactions, in determining the scope and extent of these warranties and indemnities. In assessing Orica's financial position, management relies on warranties and indemnities received, and considers potential exposures on warranties and indemnities provided. It is possible that the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Group could be materially affected if circumstances arise where warranties and indemnities received are not honoured, or for those provided, circumstances change adversely.",

EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO BALANCE DATE\n\n## Acquisition of business\n\nOn 29 October 2021, the Group entered a contract to acquire 100% of the shares of RIG Technologies International Pty Ltd and Resources Innovation Group Pty Ltd, based in Western Australia, who design and build downhole measurement technology. The purchase price comprises $12 million upfront and potential earn out payments based on the achievement of revenue targets over the next five years. The financial effect of this transaction is not included in the financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2021 and will be recognised in the FY2022 financial statements.\n\n## Dividends\n\nOn 10 November 2021, the Directors declared a final dividend of 16.5 cents per ordinary share payable on 22 December 2021. The financial effect of this dividend is not included in the financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2021 and will be recognised in the FY2022 financial statements.\n\nThe Directors have not become aware of any other significant matter or circumstance that has arisen since 30 September 2021, that has affected or may affect the operations of the Group, the results of those operations, or the state of affairs of the Group in subsequent years, which has not been covered in/uni00A0these financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nORICA\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->",

NEW ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\n\n## Changes in accounting policies\n\nThe Group assessed and applied a number of new and revised accounting standards issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) which were required to be applied from 1 October 2020. Except as described below, the accounting policies applied by the Group in its financial statements are the same as those applied by the Group in its financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2020.\n\n## (i) New and amended accounting standards and interpretations adopted\n\nEffective from 1 October 2020 the Group adopted the following new accounting standards.\n\n## AASB 2019-3 Amendments to Australia Accounting Standards - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Phase 1)\n\nThe interest rate benchmark reform results in the replacement of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs) with Alternative Reference Rates (ARRs), which is expected to occur from 1 January 2022.\n\nThe amendments in AASB 2019-3, which are effective from 1 October 2020, modify specific hedge accounting requirements to allow hedge accounting to continue for affected hedges during the period of uncertainty caused by the interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nThe amendments are relevant to the Group given that it applies hedge accounting to its interest rate exposures, however the Group's hedge profile and approach to the transition minimises any material uncertainty caused by the reform.\n\n## IFRIC Agenda Decision on Configuration or Customisation Costs in a Cloud Computing Arrangement (SaaS)\n\nIn April 2021, the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) issued a final agenda decision relating to the application of/uni00A0IAS 38 Intangible Assets to Configuration or customisation costs in a cloud computing arrangement. Based on the IFRIC decision, Orica considers costs incurred in relation to the configuration and customisation of Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms do not meet the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset, as the supplier of the software and not Orica, controls the software. As a result, these costs should be expensed as incurred.\n\nUnder Orica's previous accounting policy, costs relating to cloud computing arrangements (including the 4S Project costs) were capitalised as intangible assets and amortised on a straight-line basis over the length of time the benefits were expected to be received. Orica has updated its accounting policy to/uni00A0comply with the IFRIC agenda decision, and applied AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors to reflect this change in/uni00A0its financial statements.",

Following the change in CGU, the Group reassessed the recoverable amount of the Pilbara CGU using a value in use discounted cash flow model.  This  model  identified  that  the carrying value exceeded the recoverable amount resulting in an impairment charge against goodwill and property, plant and equipment  of  $317.6  million  (pre  tax). This increased our audit effort in this area.\n\n## EMEA CGU\n\nAs described in Note  9  to the  financial statements,  the  performance  of  the EMEA business was impacted by COVID19 and the latest forecasts project that recovery in the region will be slower than previously  anticipated.  Accordingly,  the Group reassessed the recoverable amount of the EMEA CGU using a value in use discounted cash flow model. This model identified that the carrying value exceeded the recoverable amount resulting in an impairment charge against goodwill of $162.4 million (pre tax).  This increased our audit effort in this area.\n\nWe  involved  valuation  specialists  to supplement our senior audit team members  in  assessing  this  key  audit matter.\n\n- \u00b7 We considered the sensitivity of the models by varying key assumptions such as forecast operating cash flows, terminal  growth  rates  and  discount  rates,  within  a reasonably possible range, to identify those assumptions at higher risk of bias or inconsistency in application and to focus our further procedures.\n- \u00b7 We challenged the Group's significant forecast cash flow and  terminal  growth  rate  assumptions  in  light  of  the impacts of COVID-19 and the expected rate of recovery in  specific  regions.    We  used  our  knowledge  of  the Group's  operations,  their  past  performance  and  our industry experience to evaluate the feasibility of these plans.  We  also  compared  forecast  growth  rates  to authoritative  published  studies  of  industry  trends  and expectations,  considering  differences  for  the  Group's operations.\n- \u00b7 We recalculated the impairment charge relating to the Pilbara and EMEA CGUs against the recorded amount disclosed.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the disclosures in the financial report using our understanding of the matter obtained from our testing and  against the requirements  of  the  accounting standards.\n\n|",

The Directors are responsible for the Other Information.\n\nOur opinion on the Financial Report does not cover the Other Information and, accordingly, we do not and will not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon, with the exception of the Remuneration Report and our related assurance opinion.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the Financial Report, our responsibility is to read the Other Information. In doing so, we consider whether the Other Information is materially inconsistent with the Financial Report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nWe are required to report if we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this Other Information, and based on the work we have performed on the Other Information that we obtained prior to the date of this Auditor's Report we have nothing to report.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report\n\nThe Directors are responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 preparing the Financial Report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001;\n- \u00b7 implementing necessary internal control to enable the preparation of a Financial Report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and\n- \u00b7 assessing the Group and Company's ability to continue as a going concern and whether the use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate. This includes disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group and Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Report\n\nOur objective is:\n\n- \u00b7 to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and\n- \u00b7 to issue an Auditor's Report that includes our opinion.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.\n\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the Financial Report.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Report is located at the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board website at: https://www.auasb.gov.au/admin/file/content102/c3/ar1\\_2020.pdf.
