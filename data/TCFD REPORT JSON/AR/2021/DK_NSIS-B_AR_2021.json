Sales growth was supported by the two Human Health-related acquisitions, PrecisionBiotics Group and\n\nMicrobiome Labs, and was insignifi -\n\ncantly impacted by the Synergia transaction that closed mid-December. Full-year growth was broad-based, with all subareas growing organically in the double digits. Growth in Food was mainly driven by market penetration and was particularly strong for health-focused solutions such as acrylamide reduction in baking, sugar reduction in dairy and solutions for plant-based protein extraction. Additionally, in baking in particular, sales benefited to some extent from raw material optimization and ingredient substitution. Beverages benefited from a recovery in global brewing volumes following last year's COVID-19 lockdown measures whereas growth in Human Health was strong and driven by cross-selling of in-house and acquired solutions as well as geographical expansion.\n\n## Product launches in 2021\n\n- \u00b7 Alflorex\u00ae Immune - a probiotic supplement that supports the human immune system.\n\n## Key trends\n\n- \u00b7 Growing consumer focus on preventative solutions in health and nutrition.\n- \u00b7 Concerns around environmental issues and a desire for healthier lifestyles is driving interest in plant-based alternatives.\n- \u00b7 Consumers and food producers increasingly commit to reducing food waste.\n- \u00b7 Requirements for quality, taste, texture and freshkeeping in foods and beverages continue to push the need for innovative biological solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Did you know?\n\nPlant-based food and beverages is one of the fastest growing retail categories in the U.S. We support the adoption of plantbased products in global diets to ensure better use of the available arable land, and we do this with solutions that reduce the need for sugar and salt, improve the taste and the texture of protein and eliminate additives.

Our solutions support the production of biofuels by helping our customers get the most value out of corn, for example. Enzymatic and microbial solutions play an important role in the production of bioethanol, corn oil, feed protein, as well as biodiesel, by turning oil seeds and corn into valuable fuel for transportation.\n\n## 2021 performance\n\nSales in Bioenergy grew 11% organically and 7% in reported DKK in 2021. U.S ethanol production gradually recovered following last year's severe disruption of gasoline and, subsequently, ethanol demand caused by COVID-19 restrictions. Yet, U.S. ethanol production in 2021 still ended below the 2019-level. The main factors behind the strong performance in\n\nBioenergy were the recovery of the U.S. ethanol industry in combination with growth from innovation, capacity expansion of corn-based ethanol production in Latin America, and market penetration with enzymatic solutions for biodiesel production.\n\n## Product launches in 2021\n\n- \u00b7 Innova\u00ae Element - a yeast for ethanol plants seeking the highest level of starch and glucose conversion for their fermentation process.\n- \u00b7 Fiberex\u00ae F2.5 - an enzymatic solution designed to efficiently extract and convert the cellulose found in corn kernels.\n\n## Key trends\n\n- \u00b7 Increasing global demand for cleaner fuels opening the door for alternatives such as renewable diesel, biodiesel, and carbon capture.\n\n- \u00b7 Growing demand for biofuel in emerging markets.\n- \u00b7 Producers are diversifying into value streams beyond ethanol, such as feed protein, corn oil, renewable diesel, and  biogas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Did you know?\n\nToday's transport sector is a key area for reducing carbon emissions, as it accounts for about 25% of global energyrelated CO 2 emissions. Our solutions for biorefineries and other green technologies play an important role in the pursuit of a carbon-neutral world. The ethanol production enabled by Novozymes' biosolutions results in the displacement of 8 billion gallons of gasoline.

These industries focus on process optimization, reducing environmental footprints and increasing yields, which makes the world's resources go further. Our portfolio of solutions improve yields and save energy as well as reducing chemicals, water usage, steam, and electricity.\n\n## 2021 performance\n\nFull-year sales in Grain & Tech Processing grew 13% organically and 11% in reported DKK. Sales in both Grain and Tech grew by double digits with strong performances across subareas. Growth in Grain was mainly driven by increased market penetration with solutions for vegetable oil processing, innovation in starch and particularly in grain milling, as well as increased end-market demand for\n\nstarch-derived products, especially in emerging markets. Growth in Tech was primarily the result of a recovering global textile industry following last year's severe COVID-19-related disruption complemented by good performance in areas such as pulp & paper, diagnostics, and leather.\n\n## Key trends\n\n- \u00b7 Producers focus on cost reductions, process optimization and yield enhancement.\n- \u00b7 Growing demand for effective solutions to address waste handling, water pollution, emissions, and excessive chemical use.\n- \u00b7 The textile industry is slowly responding to changing consumer demand for clothes and fabrics with a lower environmental footprint, with renewed interest in biological alternatives to the chemicals currently being used in the textile industry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSales in both Grain and Tech grew by double-digits with strong performances across subareas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Did you know?\n\nOur Frontia\u00ae technology in grain milling can help reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy, water, and waste generation. In fact, Frontia\u00ae helps customers cut 9 kilograms of CO 2 equivalents per metric tonne of corn, while still generating higher yields.

Our solutions improve yields in agriculture by improving plants' absorption of nutrients in the soil, while reducing the need for chemical insecticides and pesticides. They also improve animals' intake of energy, proteins, and minerals in their feed. The result is better use of arable land for food and feed production, reduced use of chemicals, and reduced emissions to the environment from manure in livestock production.\n\n## 2021 performance\n\nSales in Agriculture, Animal Health & Nutrition declined 3% in reported DKK and ended the year flat organi -cally compared to 2020. This was despite a negative base effect from the DKK ~60 million one-off related to the former BioAg setup that positively impacted the second quarter of 2020.\n\nSales performance in Animal Health & Nutrition was primarily driven by innovations such as Balancius\u00ae and ProAct 360\u2122, while sales in Agriculture declined due to the aforementioned base effect. Adjusted for the base effect, sales in Agriculture increased led by strong growth in Latin America.\n\n## Product launches in 2021\n\n- \u00b7 ProAct  360\u2122 - protease solution helping poultry producers to achieve responsible and profitable production by improving animals' intake of nutrients.\n- \u00b7 Optimize FXC\u00ae - liquid inoculant increases nitrogen fixation, acces -sibility to soil nutrients and water absorption in soybean plants, thereby reducing the need for fertilizer.\n- \u00b7 BioniQ\u00ae - a family of inoculants that enhance nitrate, phosphate, and potassium availability for corn, sorghum, canola, all cereal crops, mustard, barley, and pulse crops, also reducing fertilizer-usage.\n- \u00b7 Taegro\u00ae 2 - broad-spectrum, foliar fungicide for fruit and vegetable crops that works as a pesticide replacement and protects against powdery mildew and botrytis, among other things, to maximize yields.\n\n## Key trends\n\n- \u00b7 Farmers increasingly need to enhance crop performance and support healthier animals through more efficient production.\n- \u00b7 Tightened regulations for use of pesticides, insecticides, and antibiotics, combined with an increased focus on chemical replacement and organic farming, create opportunities for biological solutions.\n- \u00b7 As the world population grows and demand for protein increases, so does the need for higher performing animals and better animal welfare to ensure responsible and profitable production.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Did you know?\n\nSynthetic fertilizers that are currently used in agriculture can be replaced by biological alternatives that are non-pollutant to water quality and marine wildlife. We are developing biological solutions that boost natural nitrogen absorption, allowing replacement of 50-60lbs of fertilizer per corn-acre per year. If all corn in the U.S. were produced this way, we could potentially save more than 2 million tonnes of chemical fertilizer annually.

Despite continuing uncertainties throughout the year, our employees showed resilience, commitment, and adaptability, helping Novozymes to achieve even greater impact and strong results for the year.\n\nThe big picture\n\nOur business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2021, Food, Beverages & Human Health delivered strong double-digit growth supported by good market conditions. Bioenergy's double-digit sales growth was supported by recovering U.S. ethanol production and expansion of starch-based ethanol production in Latin America, while double-digit sales growth in Grain & Tech Processing came from strong demand for ag-processing solutions and a recovery in textile. Household Care and Agriculture, Animal Health & Nutrition performed much as expected.\n\nOur organic sales growth came in at 6% for the year, and the reported EBIT margin was at a solid 26.8%. We also saw a strong free cash flow at DKK 2.9bn before acquisitions and excellent returns to our shareholders. These strong results have enabled us to make important strategic moves, such as growing our capabilities in BioHealth, and we have much to be proud of when we look back on 2021.\n\n## A strong foundation for future growth\n\nIf there is one specific takeaway from 2021 it is this: Now is the time for businesses with a sustainability platform to be focused and agile, while staying true to their purpose. At Novozymes, we live through our purpose - Together we find biological answers for better lives in a growing world. And it's the power of that purpose that gives us the right to dream - to imagine a better world with the help of biotechnology. But for those dreams to become reality and have the biggest possible impact, we must be bold in our ambitions and continue to invest to unleash our growth potential. In an everchanging world, we need to combine a clear direction with a level of agility that can keep pace with change. That's how we\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThroughout 2021, we made important moves to better position Novozymes, and our employees showed an impressive ability to bring new innovations to market and keep our production running and delivering on time.\n\ngenerate value for our shareholders, but it's also how we best contribute to the world.\n\nIn September, we launched Unlocking growth - powered by biotech, to meet our growth ambitions and unleash Novozymes' full potential. With this refreshed strategy, we now have a roadmap to ensure our solutions will have maximum impact, by guiding us in how we invest, how we innovate and how we interact with our customers and partners. But a world of opportunity requires attentive prioritization: we must boldly decide what we will do more of and where we intend to invest less to ensure our resources are spent where they matter most.\n\nUltimately, our expertise reaches far beyond enzymes. We have a world-class biotech toolbox, from enzymes to proteins and microorganisms, oneof-a-kind scale-up ability, and a global presence in more than 130 countries. We are a biotech powerhouse, and it is on this solid foundation that we are now building our future.\n\n## Delivering despite uncertainty\n\nThroughout 2021, we made important moves to better position Novozymes, and our employees showed an impressive ability to bring new innovations to market and keep our production running and delivering on time.\n\nNovozymes is a growth company, and we made significant investments and progress during the year to ensure future growth.\n\nWe strengthened our commitment to alternative proteins with the announcement of a DKK 2 billion investment in a new state-of-the-art production line for advanced protein solutions in Blair, Nebraska. With this investment, we tap into the growing market need for alternative sources of protein. Meanwhile, in\n\nBioHealth, we accelerated our capabilities by acquiring a majority stake in Synergia Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd., a leading player in the field of spore probiotics and vitamin K2-7. This followed our acquisition earlier in the year of Microbiome Labs and our purchase of the Biota technology asset, which further added to our microbe innovation capability. In emerging markets, we increased our reach and achieved strong growth, for example with our yeast platform in Latin America. Our new Global Powder Center based in India will also help us to support our customers in this region on their journey towards greener deter -gent formulation.\n\nWe made numerous exciting product launches, such as Pristine\u00ae, which helps eliminate sources of bad odor in fabrics, answering consumer calls for clothes that smell and feel fresh for longer. For poultry producers, our new protease solution ProAct 360\u2122, launched through the DSM - Novozymes Alliance, helps them to achieve responsible and profitable pro -duction by improving animals' intake of nutrients and ensuring greater retention of nitrogen in the metabolism of the animals, lowering nitrogen emissions to the environment. And for our customers in bioenergy, we not only expanded our yeast platform with Innova\u00ae Element for their fermentation processes, we also enabled them to make the most of new revenue streams with Fiberex\u00ae F2.5, which makes even better use of the cellulose found in corn kernels, so it can be used not only for animal feed but also for extracting corn oil and cellulosic ethanol.\n\nOver the next few years, we will continue to strengthen our understanding of our customers' needs, for example by making key investments in customer co-creation centers in food and health. These centers will allow us to immerse ourselves in the world of our nutrition customers and better understand their needs. We will also further develop our",

We now offer the on-line pre -diction tool SmartBake\u00ae, which helps Baking custom -ers with their fresh-keeping dosage trials by providing quick and easy access to the right enzymes and dosage. And in June, we launched Front Sight\u00ae, a digital program which provides ethanol producers with live data and real-time analytics to help dose corn and enzymes in their production processes, ensuring they can achieve higher production yields with the right support throughout the process.\n\n## Working together for change\n\nAs a global leader and a responsible corporate citizen, we encourage and drive change across our entire value chain, including the societies in which we operate. Our solutions play an important role in helping our customers contribute to a healthier planet, but we can't stop there; we must look beyond our solutions. We do this by setting ambitious targets, and by working together with others to drive a sustainability agenda.\n\nIn shaping our strategy, we took an honest look at our operational targets and asked ourselves how we could best embrace our leadership position in sustainability. We are proud of what we have accomplished, with a 42% reduction in CO 2 emissions (scope 1 and 2), relative to our 2018 baseline, and we know we can do more to set the tone in the markets in which we operate. The result is that we now aim to reduce absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% by 2030, not just for Scope 1 and 2 but also for Scope 3, taking stock of our entire supply chain when measuring our impact. In addition, we commit to maximize the percentage of our sales that enables a better world, and we will report the percentage of our sales that contributes to accelerating a carbon-neutral world, transforming food systems, and enabling healthier lives respectively.\n\nThis year also marked 20 years of our collaboration with the U.N. Global Compact, the world's largest corporate sustainability initiative. We were again chosen by the U.N. Global Compact as one of the few global companies to achieve LEAD status, thanks to our commitment to sustainability and our leadership in defining good practices for this. We continue to support the U.N. Global Compact in its work on climate change, such as by working with the Science Based Targets initiative, and Business Ambition for 1.5 Degrees. At COP26, Novozymes was awarded the Terra Carta Seal by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, thus being recognized along with other international corporations that have made serious and action-oriented commitments towards a better future. To ensure we can all live within the boundaries of a healthy planet, we must work together, as the efforts of many far outweigh the efforts of one. We will continue to actively advocate for change by engaging in dialogue and offering our expertise when working with organizations like the UN Global Compact, the World Economic Forum, the International Chamber of Commerce, The B Team, the UN Foundation, Business Fights Poverty, and many other wonderful organizations.\n\nSolving some of the world's most pressing challenges also means we need to attract the brightest minds and retain the most talented people. As an innovation company seeking to catalyze change for the planet and people, we can only achieve our aim if different perspectives have a seat at the table and if their voice is heard. Therefore, we have set ourselves clear targets to drive an inclusive and diverse workforce where employees stay safe, thrive and grow, while also having the opportunity to pledge 1% of their time to community outreach.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe uncertainties experienced this year, whether it be from supply chain issues, rising price of raw materials or COVID-19, is something our employees have handled with an incredible spirit and determination.\n\n## Moving forward\n\nThe uncertainties experienced in 2021, whether it be from supply chain issues, rising price of raw materials or COVID-19, is something our employees have handled with an incredible spirit and determination. It's thanks to their diligence, planning and care for each other that we can look back on a year in which Novozymes delivered such strong results and kept the trust of our customers. We speak on behalf of the whole Board and Executive Leadership Team when we say that this makes us extremely proud and thankful.\n\nIn 2022, we have set an organic sales growth expectation of 3% to 7%, the broad range reflecting con -tinued uncertainty related to the pandemic situation and volatile market conditions.\n\nGoing forward, we will continue to build on a foundation for growth and we will continue to invest in innovation and new ventures, our people, our partnerships, and our communities to ensure we live up to our purpose every day.\n\nWe thank our employees, customers and partners for the progress we made together in 2021 and we look forward to taking the next steps on our strategic journey in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJ\u00f8rgen Buhl Rasmussen\n\nChair\n\nEster Baiget CEO\n\n<!-- image -->",

In order to address how we meet the increasing demand for proteins with lower environmental footprint, we are investing in a new state-of-the-art production line at our site in Blair, Nebraska, strengthening our commitment to the strategic opportunity area of Advanced Protein Solutions.\n\nThis DKK 2 billion investment follows an agreement to enter into a long-term contract with an anchor customer and key player in the plant-based industry. The new plant at Blair will enable Novozymes to capitalize on decades of experience with fermented catalytic proteins while also taking us closer to realizing our commitments for 2030.\n\n## Strengthening and accelerating  our BioHealth business\n\n## Setting  new standards for efficiency in ethanol production\n\n## Advancing  biological solutions for agriculture and livestock\n\nIn December, we acquired a majority stake in Synergia Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd., a leading player in the field of spore probiotics and vitamin K2-7, thereby accelerating our position in human health and functional foods.\n\nSince mid-2020, we have made two other acquisitions in the BioHealth space; first with PrecisionBiotics Group, then Microbiome Labs and, in March of 2021, we strengthened our data science approach to our Novozymes OneHealth business with the purchase of the Biota technology asset.\n\nThese additions are helping to leverage our strong scientific capabilities and ability to combine microbes - pre- and probiotics with enzymes and other biological solutions to develop innovative, effective, and clini -cally-proven solutions that improve human health in a growing world.\n\nOur enzymes, yeast, and technical service platforms allow ethanol producers to generate the highest levels of ethanol, diversify, lower input costs, and achieve significant process efficiency gains, thereby making better use of the planet's resources.\n\nIn 2021, we added a new solution to our ambitious yeast platform: Innova\u00ae Element. We also launched Fiberex\u00ae F2.5 for convert -ing fiber more efficiently into its value-add components, such as cellulosic ethanol and corn oil, and Front Sight\u00ae, a digital turnkey solution, providing ethanol producers with live data and real-time analytics to help dose corn and enzymes correctly, every time.\n\nThere is increasing pressure on the agricultural industry to replace chemical pesticides with biological solutions. In 2021, we entered a strategic collaboration with FMC, a leading global agricultural sciences company, to research, co-develop, and commercialize novel enzyme-based crop protection solutions for farmers around the world. The new collaboration with FMC, alongside our existing toolbox of bioyield and biocontrol solutions, cements our position as a pioneer and enabler of a biological transformation in agriculture.\n\nThe feed industry is also experiencing an accelerated customer focus on sustainability and we have solutions that respond to these needs. Together with DSM, we launched ProAct 360 \u2122 which helps feed producers be more flexible in their raw materials selection and significantly enhances the digestibility of protein, ensuring greater retention of nitrogen in the metabolism and therefore lower nitrogen emissions to the environment. In China, Novozymes' key feed enzymes were approved, enabling access to a key strategic market.",

We support plans that ensure a just and equitable transition to a net-zero economy. At COP26, we were also one of the international corporations awarded the Terra Carta Seal by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales for our commitment to a sustainable future.\n\nOur presence at COP26 ties in with the work we already do every day with various policymakers, helping to define enabling policy frameworks. We have close partnerships and collaborations with the World Economic Forum, the International Chamber of Commerce, The B Team, the UN Foundation, Business Fights Poverty and many more.\n\nOur position as a leader in safer and more environmentally friendly solutions was also reinforced when we were chosen as a 2021 Safer Choice Partner of the Year by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\n## Addressing   consumer laundry challenges with Pristine\u00ae\n\n## Smarter solutions for lowering  GHG emissions\n\nNovozymes has long been at the forefront of exploring laundry benefits beyond stain removal. With the launch of our new laundry solution Pristine\u00ae in September, we took a significant step towards delivering those benefits through biological solutions to more customers.\n\nPristine\u00ae breaks down invisible layers of body grime and releases dirt and odor that might be trapped in fabrics, tackling the root cause of consumer challenges with hygiene, malodors, and color dullness in textiles. As fabrics washed with Pristine\u00ae become hygienically clean and are less prone to yellowing and decolorization, they last longer and need not be discarded as fast, which helps to tackle the challenges of overconsumption and waste in a growing world.\n\nWe recently announced our collaboration with Saipem, an advanced technological and engineering platform for complex infrastructure and plants, for the development of innovative solutions for enzymatic carbon capture.\n\nEnzymatic carbon capture is a cleaner and more cost-effective method of carbon cap -ture compared to traditional CO 2 capture processes, as enzymes enable lower temperature input and more moderate use of chemicals.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Saipem - which owns an enzyme-based CO 2 capture technology - will be responsible for providing process, mechanical and equipment design, while Novozymes will provide enzymes in addition to further optimizing the process through enzymes innovation.\n\nEnzymatic carbon capture is a cleaner and more cost-e/ffective method of carbon capture compared to traditional CO/two.denominator capture processes",

Our solutions contribute to several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), directly or indirectly. The SDGs represent both responsibilities and opportunities for Novozymes. They have been an integral part of how we drive our business, innovate, run our operations, and work with our employees and the communities we are part of.\n\nSustainability has been a priority for Novozymes for decades. In 2002, we were the first company to have a fully integrated triple bottom line report. In 2012, when the SDGs creation process started, we were actively engaged in developing the set of goals for the global community as it was also highly relevant to Novozymes as a business. We were so inspired by the draft text of SDGs that it influenced the formulation of a purpose, strategy, and targets which we launched in January 2015, nine months before the SDGs were finally concluded by the 193 nations participat -ing in the UN process. Today, we are still guided by that purpose, Together we find biological answers for better lives in a growing world - Let's rethink tomorrow, and we have contributed significantly to the SDGs since then.\n\nWith our refreshed strategy Unlocking growth - powered by biotech, we will strengthen our contributions to making the SDGs a reality by delivering on three new commitments to a healthy planet. We are committing to accelerate towards a climate-neutral society, transform food systems, and enable healthier lives.\n\nThrough strong collaborations, we encourage and drive change across our entire value chain, including our employees and the societies in which we operate. Our solutions help our customers contribute to a healthier planet, so they can produce more from less, often reducing CO2 emissions and the use of water, energy, or chemicals. Our solutions also address modern human health challenges and food system sustainability. We actively seek to reduce the environmental footprint of our operations and supply chain, and we continue to invest in our employees as part of building an inclusive, thriving, and inspiring workforce.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor an overview of our contributions to the SDGs, read more on Novozymes.com",

At Novozymes, we believe - and have shown - that our biological solutions can contribute significantly to decarbonization. Many of our solu -tions reduce the carbon intensity of the processes where they are applied.\n\nWe can already see that the low-carbon transition is creating demand for new goods and services across all sectors. This demand is driven by favorable policy developments and changing consumer needs alike. For example, in 2020, the EU Commission proposed a plan which includes a target of reducing the use of pesticides by 50% over the next decade. Likewise, consumers are increasingly making conscious choices when purchasing products. For example, consumers are seeking better and healthier protein solutions, and are ready to pay for it.\n\nNovozymes fully recognizes the potential to grow our business while innovating transformative solutions for the climate. We have therefore decided to invest in strategic opportunity areas, including biological alternatives to synthetic fertilizers, carbon capture and advanced protein solutions.\n\n## Biological solutions supporting climate smart agriculture\n\nDecarbonizing the industrial agriculture production brings a specific opportunity to deliver significant CO 2 savings from higher yields, resulting from the application of biological solutions for agriculture. For example, if Novozymes' inoculants were to be used on all corn grown in the U.S., it could potentially reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 3.9 million tonnes of CO 2 .*\n\nThere is also a great opportunity to reduce environmental impact by using biological alternatives to the synthetic fertilizers that are currently used in\n\nagriculture to ensure plant growth. We are developing biological solutions that boost natural nitrogen absorption and enable the replacement of 50-60lbs of fertilizer per corn-acre per year. If all corn in the U.S. were produced this way, we could potentially save more than 2 million tonnes of chemical fertilizer annually. At the same time, our solutions are non-pollutant to water quality and marine wildlife.\n\n- *  Kl\u00f8verpris et al.

In the energy sector, current technologies and capacity need to be expanded significantly to reduce industrial emissions, even after renewable energy is widely adopted. The International Energy Agency (IEA) states that carbon capture and storage technologies can cover 12% of the reductions in GHG emissions needed by 2050 for the sector to achieve net zero emissions by 2070. And we believe enzymes can help make this process less energy intensive and more environmentally friendly.\n\nTraditional carbon capture methods that extract CO 2 from flue gas rely on hazardous chemicals and highly capital-intensive assets, creating products that can harm people and the environment. By using enzymes (carbonic anhydrase) instead of conventional chemicals, we can enable a more reliable carbon capture process that requires less energy and produces no toxic waste, aerosols, or contaminants. In addition, carbon captured this way can then be used as feedstock or sent to storage. Novozymes is investing in developing such solutions for enzymatic carbon capture, for example through our collaboration agreement with Saipem, an advanced technology and engineering company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Advanced protein solutions\n\nThe climate crisis, along with population and income growth, shifting lifestyles and increased focus on healthier food alternatives, all leave our society with an inescapable challenge: the need for more protein within the boundaries of what our planet can provide. Advances in biotechnology for precision fermentation, for example, are enabling tailor-made enzymes which maximize the extraction of protein, enhancing taste and texture, as well as advanced proteins ultimately resulting in desirable, cost-competitive, plant-based and animal-free nutrients.\n\nNovozymes can play a key role in enabling a transition to a more diversified protein supply with alterna -tive proteins. This includes enzymes that enable the next generation of plant-based alternatives, as well as high-value fermentation-based proteins.\n\nNovozymes will invest in technologies focused on improving the nutritional, functional and sensorial attributes of advanced protein solutions to drive and accelerate protein diversification in our diets.",

Organic sales in Food, Beverages & Human Health is expected to grow by a high-single digit rate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Bioenergy\n\nOrganic sales growth is expected to be driven by the continued recovery of U.S. ethanol production, market penetration enabled by innovation, capacity expansion of corn-based ethanol production in Latin America, and market penetration with enzymatic solutions for biodiesel production. Bioenergy is projected to grow in the low-to-mid-single-digits. Uncertainties related to the pandemic and volatile market conditions are the main reasons for the relatively broad range. The mid-point of the range assumes moderate growth in U.S. ethanol production with full-year volumes still slightly below 2019 production levels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Grain & Tech Processing\n\nOrganic sales are expected to develop more moderately following a very strong performance in 2021. Performance is expected to be driven by growth in Grain mainly led by market penetration in vegetable oil processing and innovation in\n\nstarch, such as solutions for grain milling. The sales development in Grain & Tech Processing is expected to range from flat to low-single-digit growth. Uncertainties related to the pandemic and volatile market conditions are the main reasons for the sales growth range.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Agriculture, Animal Health & Nutrition\n\nOrganic sales growth will be led by double-digit growth in Agriculture. Good market conditions and a beneficial sus -tainability pull are expected to drive higher usage of inoculants supporting increased market penetration of both bioyield and biocontrol solutions that will also be enabled through innovation and a more direct go-to-market model. Growth in Animal Health & Nutrition will primarily be driven by innovation as well as end-market-driven volume growth. The indication for Agriculture, Animal Health & Nutrition is to grow at a rate in the high-single-digits to low-teens. Uncertainty related to the pandemic and volatile market conditions are the main reasons for the relatively broad range.",

The division of responsibilities between the Board of Directors and the Executive Leadership Team is clearly outlined and described in the Rules of Procedure for the Board of Directors and the Rules of Procedure for the Executive Leadership Team. Both of these rule sets are available at Novozymes.com\n\nNovozymes' Articles of Association require the Board of Directors to have from four to eight members, who are elected at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The Board of Directors currently has seven  shareholder-elected members, elected for terms of one year. Nominations are based on an evaluation of factors such as competencies, diversity, independence, and performance. In accordance with Danish law, the Board of Directors also has a number of employee-elected members, corresponding to half of the number of directors elected by the shareholders, who serve four-year terms. In 2021, the number of employee-elected members increased from three to four.\n\nThe Board of Directors is accountable to the company's shareholders for the management of the company. The composition of the Board of Directors must therefore ensure that the combined competencies of the Board enable it to inspire, guide and oversee Novozymes' development, and diligently address and resolve the issues and challenges facing Novozymes at any given time.\n\nThe individual competencies of the members of the Board of Directors are shown in the presentation of the Board. Novozymes' statutory report on diversity pursuant to section 107d of the Danish Financial Statements Act is available on our website .\n\n## Governance structure\n\nIn accordance with the Articles of Association and the Rules of Procedure for the Board of Directors, the Board has a Chairmanship consisting of two members - the Chair and the Vice Chair - who are responsible for assisting the Board in matters concerning the Executive Leadership Team's operational management and for reporting back to the Board. The Chairmanship is also responsible for planning and preparing the meetings of the Board.\n\n## 2021 with the Board of Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Extraordinary board meetings\n- Board meetings\n- Monthly reports\n- Annual Shareholders' Meeting\n- Strategy work\n- Evaluation of collaboration between the Board of Directors and the Executive Leadership Team\n- Organizational performance review and succession planning\n- Next year's budget\n- Review of financial performance\n\n## The Board of Directors' main responsibilities are to:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensure the right management and organizational structure.\n- \u00b7 Oversee financial, environmental, social, and governance performance, and the Executive Leadership Team's operational management of Novozymes.\n- \u00b7 Supervise the overall management and strategic development of Novozymes.\n- \u00b7 Ensure succession planning at Board and management level.",

Therefore, the Board Competency Profile has been updated with new and additional targets, and targets have now been defined for all competencies required on the Board.\n\nFirst, there is a new target for board tenure to strike a balance between renewal and continuity. Consequently, a person should not be nominated for election or re-election if such board member has served on the Novozymes board for 12 years. Another new target is that the Board of Directors must consist of at least one member that has lived and worked outside the Nordic countries for a substantial period of time. Thirdly, it is now a target that the Board of Directors consists of at least two shareholder-elected Board members of Nordic nationality and at least two shareholder-elected Board members of a nationality other than Nordic. Lastly, the target for board gender diversity has been revised to the effect that 40% or more of the shareholder-elected board members must be female and 40% or more must be male no later than by the annual shareholders meeting to be held in 2023.\n\nAll targets were met or on track by the end of 2021, except for the target to have no board members with a tenure of more than 12 years. With Mathias Uhl\u00e9n not seeking re-election in 2022, the Board will again fulfill this target. The composition of the Board of Directors meets the gender diversity requirements set out in Danish legislation.

A detailed review of Novozymes' position on each of the recommendations, and a description of the internal control and risk management system relating to financial reporting, can be found in the statutory report on corporate governance prepared pursuant to section 107b of the Danish Financial Statements Act. These recommendations require companies to comply or explain any deviations. The recommendations were revised effective for the financial year 2021. The changes have been implemented and Novozymes continues to follow 39 of the 40 recommendations, the one exception being:\n\n- \u00b7 Due to the limitations imposed by the Novo Nordisk Foundation's Articles of Association and Novozymes' ownership structure, the Board of Directors reserves the right in certain circumstances to reject takeover bids without consulting shareholders. (Recommendation 1.3.1).\n\nIn addition, under the Danish Financial Statements Act (sections 99a and 99b), it is mandatory for large companies to report on corporate social responsibility and equal opportunities as defined by the Act. Novozymes is committed to the ten principles of the UN Global Compact (UNGC) and as a continuing member of the UNGC we prepare an annual Communication on Progress (CoP). The Novozymes Report together with ' Novozymes & the UNGC 2021 ' serves as our CoP and meets the requirements of\n\nsections 99a and 99b of the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\nIn 2021, Novozymes adopted a data ethics policy. This policy sets the overall principles for the ethical management of data by Novozymes and supplements our commitment to integrity and compliance. The basic principles identified to support the commit -ment to ethical data management are universal principles relevant for all categories of data processed in and by Novozymes. The statutory report on Novozymes' policy for, and work with, data ethics pursuant to section 99d of the Danish Financial Statements Act can be found on our website .\n\n## Other Board-related information\n\nThe Board of Directors held 12 meetings in 2021, with an overall attendance rate of 97%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAny amendments to the Articles of Association require that shareholders representing at least two thirds of the total number of votes in the company are represented at a shareholders' meeting, and that at least two thirds of the votes, as well as two thirds of the voting capital represented at the meeting, are cast in favor of the proposal to amend the Articles of Association.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board of Directors has been authorized by the shareholders to allow the company to acquire treasury stock on an ongoing basis, provided the nominal value of the company's total holding of treasury stock does not exceed 10% of its share capital at any time, cf. section 198 of the Danish Companies Act. The purchase price must not deviate by more than 10% from the price quoted on Nasdaq Copenhagen at the date of acquisition. This authorization applies until April 1, 2022. In addition, the Board of Directors is authorized to reduce the share capital.\n\nThe Board of Directors held 12 meetings in 2021, with an overall attendance rate of 97%.\n\nEach year, one of the responsibilities of the Board of Directors is to assess whether the capital and share structure of Novozymes is optimal. The Board of Directors believes that the share structure with A and B common stock continues to be the best way in 2021 to safeguard Novozymes' long-term strategy and development for the benefit of the company's shareholders and other stakeholders. Regarding its capital structure, Novozymes will continue to favor a rather modestly leveraged balance sheet, as reflected by a target for net interest-bearing debt of around 1x EBITDA. Thus, the capital structure is in line with the target.\n\nNovozymes is party to several partnership contracts that can be terminated by the other party in the event of significant changes to the ownership or con -trol of Novozymes. A few of these contracts contain provisions that restrict Novozymes' licenses to use specific forms of technology in such situations.\n\n## Evaluation of the Board of Directors\n\nFor 2021, the Board of Directors commissioned an external third party to conduct the evaluation, consistent with the recommendations of the Danish Committee on Corporate Governance that companies conduct an external objective evaluation at least every third year. The evaluation was based on the input of eleven board members and eight executives and relied on in-depth personal interviews, online questionnaires, analysis of how time was spent during board meetings, board composition mapping and board composition benchmarking. As part of the evaluation, the board members and the executives were provided with feedback on their individual performance regarding how they add value to the Board of Directors. The result of the general board evaluation was discussed in a board meeting in October.",

Within an evolving risk management framework, we identify and mitigate key risks to secure our business and our impact now and in the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nO ur risk management process ensures that we identify, assess and mitigate key business risks that may impact our ability to grow our business, be a profitable company, and be a reliable partner to our customers and the communities we operate in.\n\nIn addition to addressing key enterprise risks which could potentially materialize in the short term i.e. within the next three years, we also monitor longer-term threats and trends, like climate change and technology development. We seek to have an integrated and holistic approach of assessing and prioritizing financial, reputational and ESG risk on similar terms.\n\nTo manage businesses responsibly and have an impact, climate-related risks, such as supply disruptions owing to extreme weather events, should be addressed in a structured way. Hence, in 2021, we focused on further integrating and developing climate change risk management as part of our risk management framework, which was presented to and discussed by the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee, in alignment with our commitment to TCFD (Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures). In 2022, we will continue to work on how to further strengthen our management of ESG risks to our business, including climate-related risks, and explore how best to address such risks in a longer-term perspective.\n\nIn shaping our refreshed strategy Unlocking growth - powered by biotech, opportunities identified as part of our assessment of climate-related risks provided the foundation for our 2030 commitments. Our solutions could be key in addressing many of the climate-related risks facing the world today.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact supply chains and societies around the globe, leading to uncertainties in 2022 and beyond. To safeguard our people, operations, and communities, the Executive Leadership Team monitors and addresses potential business risks arising from the pandemic, e.g., changed consumer behaviors and declining GDP growth.\n\n## Risk management framework\n\nThe Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for overseeing risks and for maintaining a robust risk management and internal control system. Novozymes operates an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process whereby the key enterprise risks (financial, repu -tational and ESG) facing the company are identified, assessed, and mitigated at different levels of the organization. Each key risk is assigned to a risk owner from the Executive Leadership Team and a Risk Responsible, usually a Vice President, in charge of mitigating all risks relevant to their respective areas.\n\nThe Risk Management & Controls department is responsible for ensuring that senior management promotes risk awareness, engagement, and ownership across the organization. Risks are assessed based on a two-dimensional heat map rating system that estimates the potential impact of a given risk on financials and reputation, and the likelihood of that risk materializing.\n\nThe most significant key risks are reviewed and assessed by the Executive Leadership Team and the Board of Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We could face increased competition from other enzyme manufacturers offering new solu -tions or from new players with technology platforms that are broader than ours. The recent instability of global supply chains has the potential to favor local suppliers and we continue to see a risk of competitors operating under less regulated market conditions.\n\nAlthough consolidation can make the market more stable, it could also increase a competitor's financial strength and bargaining power.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nIn 2021, we enhanced our go-to-market strategies, accelerating regionally relevant innovations and upgrades, and strengthening customer relationships. We also acquired new businesses, entered into strategic partnerships and launched new innovations. Despite pressure on supply chains, we managed to deliver our orders to customers throughout 2021, without compromising on our fast response and dedicated service, thereby further improving the customer experience. As part of our refreshed strategy, we will form regional customer co-creation centers to work with local customers and cater to their needs.\n\nIn 2022, we will continue to improve our go-to market strategies, invest in consumer insights, accelerate regional innovations to strengthen our position in selected markets, and build on our strong relationships with key customers and partners. We will also further strengthen our ability to deliver the broader biotech solutions that set us apart from the competition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Volatility of agriculture-related business\n\n## Description of risk\n\nOur agriculture-related business is affected in particular by numer -ous elements, such as weather conditions, commodity prices, political mandates for ethanol blends, etc. However, many of our businesses may potentially be affected by agriculture-related issues, as can be seen from the supply issues in the agriculture value chain.\n\nIn the U.S., the new infrastructure bill currently in progress may end up challenging our ability to grow in the bioenergy market if the bill favors electric vehicles over other alternatives to gasoline.\n\nWith the growing impact of and increasing mitigation efforts towards - climate-related changes, this risk is likely to shift over the coming years.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nIn 2021, we continued to work with ethanol customers to explore alternative value streams (e.g., protein, oil), as well as diversified applica -tions (e.g., jet fuel, biodiesel, feedstocks for biobased derivatives) with the help of our enzyme, yeast and fiber technologies, such as Innova\u00ae Element and Fiberex\u00ae F2.5.\n\nWe continue to nurture and invest in our valuable partnerships in the agriculture industry. In 2021, the DSM - Novozymes Alliance launched ProAct 360\u00ae, a new industry benchmark for pro -tease technology to reduce even further the environmental footprint of poultry production and deliver greater cost savings to customers. We also announced a strategic partnership with FMC, a leading global agricultural sciences company, to research, co-develop, and commercialize enzyme-based crop protection solutions.\n\nIn 2022, we remain focused on leveraging our expertise to help customers find biological solu -tions to agricultural challenges and diversify their revenue streams, as well as optimizing our internal commercial competences, including technical sales support and digital tools for production optimization.",

Preserving business continuity and safeguarding sensitive business data and critical assets against this global threat is extremely important. Accelerating digitalization continuously exposes Novozymes to such threats and cybercrime could have a negative impact on our productivity if systems are inaccessible for an extended period of time. Our business could also be adversely impacted if information about our unique technologies or production strains is disclosed.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nThis threat continues to intensify but so has our ability to identify, protect, detect, and respond to cyberattacks. In 2021, we implemented and tested initiatives on IT emergency response and will continue to improve on these regularly. We have also increased our focus on measuring our actual security level and obtaining better transparency in infrastructure and system management.\n\nTo protect our business opportunities from the threat of global theft, we have a strong focus on patents and IP management, as exemplified by our more than 7,000 granted or pending patents.\n\nIn 2022, we will continue to improve and develop our many IT security initiatives, including our OT (Operational Technology i.e. production systems) Cyber Security Strategy. A thorough understanding of OT risks is the foundation for making the right decisions on how to protect our production facilities to ensure they stay operational at all times.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Global political and economic instability\n\n## Description of risk\n\nNovozymes' global footprint exposes our business to the consequences of global political and economic instability. Significant instability persists in the global economy and trade conditions but as the risk of a hostile trade environment has not ramped up, we have assessed the short-term likelihood of this risk to have reduced relative to 2020. Still, political uncertainty and low growth remain in many regions, compounded by the uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nIn 2021, Novozymes closely monitored political and economic developments with an agile mindset to ensure fast action could be taken when needed. We also employed global versus local considerations in short- and long-term capacity planning, to ensure we could continue to deliver orders to customers even in challenging conditions.\n\nWe continue to champion the benefits of global -ization and a shared commitment to sustainability on the global stage, such as at COP26 in Glasgow. And we work collaboratively with many valuable partners to drive a responsible business agenda, such as the World Economic Forum, the International Chamber of Commerce, The B Team, the UN Foundation and Business Fights Poverty.\n\nIn 2022, several potential conflicts need to be settled to ensure political stability and free trade. With the help of improved data analysis, general monitoring and the commitment and drive of our employees, we will improve the monitoring of these events as well as our speed of response.",

Such risks span different ESG risks including technologies, financials, and sustainability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVia our integrated sustainability trendspotting exercise , we identify long-term risks and opportunities, and the risks are jointly assessed through our enterprise risk management process.\n\n## Concerns regarding new and emerging technologies\n\n## Description of risk\n\nIndustrial biotechnology is a key enabling technology for the delivery of natural, low-carbon and biobased solutions. Over the coming years, we expect to see further significant biotech innovation, includ -ing the use of gene editing, which could be met with increasing government and NGO scrutiny. This can limit or slow the application of biotechnology. Novozymes' research and business are based on bio-innovation and through these technologies, we find safe and innovative answers to some of the planet's most pressing challenges, such as carbon capture, sustainable food systems or replacing chemicals with biodegradable solutions.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nWe apply and promote safe and responsible use of biotechnology. We are committed to sharing our knowledge about the potential of biology and industrial biotechnology with external stakeholders. Through proactive engagement with influencers and policy makers we broaden the understanding of the potential of technology, paving the way for future solutions to pressing challenges.\n\nThrough our growing cooperation with the Novo Nordisk Foundation, we are exploring ways to provide new documentation and insights into biotechnology. Together, we engage with the World Economic Forum's community to promote biosolutions, while advocating for science-based and innovation-friendly policy frameworks for the introduction of solutions based on new gene technologies. We also drive the innovation agenda through business and industry organizations.\n\nLearn more in Note 7.6 and our position\n\nstatement on industrial biotechnology.\n\nWe engage with relevant stakeholders in a timely manner to develop strategies and ensure that we are prepared to take adequate action and respond to those key emerging risks.  The following continue to be some of the most significant emerging risks:\n\n## Water-constrained future\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Description of risk\n\nIncreased long-term pressure on our water resources is a key chronic risk driven by climate change. We rely on water to maintain our production capacity. Many of our raw materials are agricultural and water intensive to produce. A severe drought or reduced water supply could impact our production and limit our ability to meet customer demand by directly impacting our own operations or our supply chain.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nTo continue addressing this long-term risk, we are developing context-based water programs for our production sites and piloting the drafted Science Based Targets method -ology for water. We support our water stewardship agenda further with external engagements including the UN Global Compact, the CEO Water Mandate, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN).\n\nOur solutions in laundry, technical industries and agriculture also enable reduced aquatic pollution by reducing the load on wastewater treatment in these industries.\n\nWe disclose more details annually in CDP's Climate Change and Water Security questionnaires.

We actively invest in lowering our own carbon footprint and delivering low-carbon solutions.\n\nIn alignment with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we include climate-related disclosures throughout this report. For ease of reference, these are summarized below around the four themes from TCFD recommendations. In the coming years, we aim to integrate more detailed climate-related disclosures.\n\n## Governance\n\nClimate is a significant topic which the Board of Directors and Executive Management take into consideration in managing the company. Novozymes has Board-level oversight of its management of climate-related issues, as a part of its responsibility to oversee financial and environmental, social and gov -ernance (ESG) performance. The Board of Directors is also responsible for reviewing and signing off on our climate strategy and targets and has overall responsibility for overseeing risk management and control, including climate-related risks.\n\nTo ensure the integration of sustainability into Novozymes' business strategies and innovation pipeline and, consequently, our ability to deliver solutions\n\nthat meet the needs of society and drive sales growth, we have established a Corporate Sustainability Committee, comprising of various executive and senior leaders. The committee is also responsible for setting Novozymes' strategic direction, ambitious sustainability targets, and securing a strong internal foundation of responsible business practices.\n\n## Strategy\n\nOur biological solutions offer many opportunities to support the transition to a low-carbon economy, and climate change action forms an integral part of our business strategy. In 2021, as part of our refreshed strategy, we invested to develop solutions for climate-related opportunities in Advanced proteins and Carbon Capture.\n\nSpotlight story:\n\nInnovating for a climate-neutral society\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, go to:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Currently, we are undertaking a project to determine climate-related risks in our agricultural value chain and the potential financial and non-financial impacts to our business and operations. While we presently use scenario analysis for qualitative assessments, we also expect to conduct quantitative assessments using relevant numerical models in the coming years.\n\n## Risk management\n\nClimate change is an important factor when we look at the risks to our business. Our production processes are water-intensive and many of the raw materials sourced are agriculture-based and water-intensive to produce. Agriculture is affected by more frequent extreme weather conditions and other climate-related impacts. A severe drought could impact our production and limit our ability to meet customer demand by directly impacting our own operations or our supply chain.\n\nAs part of our risk management process, climate-related risks are identified, managed, and reported at different levels of the organization. At the asset level, Novozymes identifies climate-related risks based on a systematic risk mapping process that includes risks such as fire, earthquakes, drought, flooding, policy and regulatory changes. We also conduct periodic assessments of environmental impact at all signifi -cant production sites, with third parties being engaged to conduct periodic risk assessments and reviews.\n\nWe will continue to work on how to further strengthen our management of ESG risks in our business, including climate-related risks.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nNovozymes is committed to the Science-Based Targets Initiative and to our long-term goal of achieving net zero across operations and value chain by 2050, a goal we set in 2019.\n\nConsidering new scientific findings reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2021, we are accelerating our net zero journey and significantly raising our ambition on climate change. Consequently, we commit to:\n\n- \u00b7 a 50% reduction* in absolute CO 2 emissions from our operations (Scopes 1 & 2) and supply chain (Scope 3) by 2030.\n- \u00b7 source 100% renewable electricity by 2030.\n- * From a 2018 baseline\n\n## Reporting on the EU Sustainable Finance Taxonomy\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation requires listed companies to disclose the share of their turnover, capital and operational expenditure associated with environmentally sustainable economic activities. Despite the positive environmental impact from our biological solutions and our focus on minimizing our environmental footprint, Novozymes' activities do not fall within the scope of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and we have no activities eligible for this reporting requirement.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Remuneration of the Board of Directors\n\nThe remuneration of the Board of Directors comprises a fixed fee and is not incentive-based. This ensures that the Board of Directors safeguards the company's long-term interests without taking into consideration what this may mean in terms of the value of incentive-based remuneration. The Board of Directors' fee is set at a market-conformant level that reflects the competencies and efforts required of the role, given the complexity of the Novozymes Group, the scope of the work, and the number of Board meetings held.\n\nThe fixed base fee increased from DKK 500,000 to DKK 510,000 in 2021, the first change in base fee since 2015. The Chair receives a fee that is three times the base fee and the Vice Chair a fee that is two times the base fee.\n\nFor committee work, the committee Chair and other committee members receive a further base fee and half a base fee respectively. However, the Chair and the Vice Chair of the Board of Directors do not receive such additional fee if appointed to the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe size of the Board of Directors increased from 10 to 11 members in 2021, now consisting of seven shareholder-elected members and four employee-elected members. The total remuneration paid to the Board of Directors in 2021 amounted to DKK 9.8 million compared to DKK 8.2 million in 2020. The increase is a result of the full-year impact of the Innovation Committee that was established in August 2020, the increase in the number of employee representatives from three to four and the increase in the fixed base fee.\n\nThe individual board members' fees and their shareholdings can be found in the Novozymes Remuneration Report 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe individual board members' fees and their shareholdings can be found in the Novozymes Remuneration Report 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Remuneration of the Executive Management\n\nAs per December 31, 2021, the Executive Management of Novozymes A/S consisted of:\n\n- \u00b7 Ester Baiget, President & Chief Executive Officer (CEO)\n- \u00b7 Lars Green, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer (CFO)\n\nThomas Videb\u00e6k, former Executive Vice President & COO, left Novozymes at the end of April 2021.\n\nThe total remuneration to members of the Executive Management comprises:\n\n- \u00b7 A base salary plus pension, a company car and certain other benefits\n- \u00b7 A short-term incentive program (cash bonus) - STIP\n- \u00b7 A long-term incentive program (stock-based program) - LTIP\n\nIn 2021, the members of the Executive Management received a 2.3% increase in their base salary.\n\nEster Baiget and Lars Green will in addition to their regular remuneration receive compensation for lost incentives from their previous employers. The compensation is subject to certain conditions. Over the period 2020-2023, Ester Baiget may receive up to a total of DKK 9.6 million in extraordinary sign-on compensation for lost incentives from her previous employer, of which DKK 4.2 million was paid out in 2020 and DKK 1.4 million was paid out in 2021. Over the period 2020-2023, Lars Green may receive up to a total of DKK 14.5 million in extraordinary sign-on compensation for lost incentives from his previous employer, of which DKK 0.7 million was paid out in 2020 and DKK 4.3 million was paid out in 2021.\n\nThomas Videb\u00e6k left Novozymes at the end of April 2021. His severance package, totaling DKK 35 million, was fully expensed in 2020. Severance pay of DKK 9 million was paid out in 2020, while the remaining DKK 26 million was paid out in 2021.\n\nThe targets for the short-term incentive program (STIP) are typically set by the Board of Directors in connection with the review of the business plan for the year. Good performance will result in target payout (65%) while the maximum payout is only achieved for delivering extraordinary performance. Maximum payout equals 9.5 months' salary.\n\nIn 2021 the targets for the STIP were split on the financial performance of the company at 60% weight (EBIT 45% weight and cash flow 15% weight) and tar -gets for the individual executives at 40% weight.\n\nThe financial performance of Novozymes in 2021 resulted in both the EBIT target and the cash flow target beeing exceeded. The payout related to these targets was 100% and 77%, respectively.\n\nThe level of achievement of individual performance targets and thus the size of remuneration payment to the individual executive is determined by the Board of Directors based on recommendations from the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.\n\nBased on its assessment, the Board determined that the pay-out based on individual targets would be 95% for Ester Baiget and 85% for Lars Green.",

This allows the Board of Directors to re-assess targets for each annual grant cycle to ensure the targets are suffi -ciently demanding, incentivizing and aligned with the strategy.\n\nThe new LTIP for the Executive Management covering the performance period 2021-2023 took effect in 2021. The LTIP consists of 50% shares and 50% share options. Like the previous LTIP, the targets of the LTIP 2021 reflects 40% weight on the target on organic sales growth, 40% weight on the target on economic profit generation, and 20% weight on non -financial targets. The targets are aligned with the refreshed strategy and the measures of business success for the period 2021-2023.\n\nThe annual LTIP cannot exceed 19 months' base salary. Further, the program includes a maximum-value clause allowing the Board of Directors to choose to limit the total allocation of stock options and stock if the intrinsic value exceeds twice the full annual conditional grant.\n\nThe members of the Executive Management have contracts of employment containing standard\n\nconditions for executive officers of Danish listed com -panies, including the periods of notice that both parties are required to give and noncompetition clauses. If an executive officer's contract of employment is terminated by the company without any misconduct on the part of the executive officer, the executive offi -cer has a notice period of 12 months. In addition to the notice period, the executive officer has a right to termination compensation of 12 months' base salary and pension contributions.\n\nFurther details on the Executive Management's remuneration and their shareholdings etc. can be found in the Novozymes Remuneration Report 2021.\n\n## Remuneration of senior leadership\n\nThe remuneration of Novozymes' senior leadership (185 vice presidents and directors) is consistent with the general remuneration policy. Incentive programs for vice presidents and directors have been established for the 2021-2023 period. The programs follow the same mechanisms as the program for the Executive Management. Further information on the incentive programs for these employee groups can be found in Note 6.2 to the consolidated financial statements, which also includes an overview of outstanding stock options.",

In 2021, Food, Beverages & Human Health delivered strong double-digit growth supported by good market conditions. Bioenergy's double-digit sales growth was supported by recovering U.S. ethanol production and expansion of starch-based ethanol production in Latin America, while double-digit sales growth in Grain & Tech Processing came from strong demand for ag-processing solutions and a recovery in textile. Household Care and Agriculture, Animal Health & Nutrition performed much as expected.\n\n## Sales and sales growth\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gross profit and margin\n\nGross profit increased by 10% to DKK 8,623 million from DKK 7,853 million in 2020. The gross margin was 57.7%, up from 56.0% in 2020. The increase was mainly due to improved production efficiency, price/mix and acquisitions, which was partly offset by higher input costs and adverse currency developments.\n\n## Operating costs\n\nOperating costs increased by 13% to DKK 4,804 million. Operating costs as a percentage of sales were 32%.\n\n- \u00b7   Sales and distribution costs increased by 22%, accounting for 13% of sales.\n- \u00b7   Research and development costs increased by 4%, accounting for 13% of sales.\n- \u00b7   Administrative costs increased by 16%, accounting for 6% of sales.\n\nThe increase in operating costs in 2021 was mainly due to increased commercial activities, the inclusion of acquisitions and one-offs including reorganization within research and development.\n\n## Other operating income\n\nOther operating income was DKK 188 million, compared with DKK 56 million in 2020. Other operating income in 2021 was positively impacted by DKK 62 million from the contingent income related to the divestment of a pharmarelated royalty, and DKK 60 million from the sale of a building classified as held for sale.\n\n## EBITDA\n\nEBITDA increased by 10% to DKK 5,423 million, up from DKK 4,918 million in 2020. Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses were DKK 1,416 million in 2021, up 12% from DKK 1,266 million in 2020. The increase was mainly due to amortization related to the PrecisionBiotics Group and the Microbiome Labs acquisitions.\n\n## EBIT and EBIT margin\n\nEBIT increased by 10% to DKK 4,007 million, up from DKK 3,652 million in 2020.

The lower cash flow from operating activities of DKK 293 million compared to 2020 was mainly due to changes in working capital, somewhat mitigated by the higher net profit and improved earnings quality. The change in net working capital was caused by higher receivables and inventories, partly offset by higher payables.\n\n## Net investments\n\nNet investments excluding acquisitions were DKK 1,116 million, up from DKK 936 million in 2020. Net investments in property, plant and equipment amounted to DKK 1,071 million, compared with DKK 794 million in 2020, partly due to the investment in the new production line in Blair, Nebraska, U.S.\n\n## Cash flow from operating activities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Free cash flow before\n\n## acquisitions and divestments\n\nThe free cash flow before acquisitions and divestments amounted to DKK 2,946 million, compared with DKK 3,419 million in 2020. The decrease of 14% was mainly driven by the development in cash flows from operating activities and an increase in net investments.\n\n## Free cash flow\n\nThe free cash flow was DKK 1,315 million in 2021, compared with DKK 2,831 million in 2020. Free cash flow was negatively impacted by the acquisition of Microbiome Labs and Synergia Life Sciences.\n\n## Net investments\n\nDKK million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNet investments\n\nNet investments (% of sales)\n\n## Financing activities\n\nThe cash flow from financing activities was negative at DKK 1,586 million, compared with a negative cash flow of DKK 2,314 million in 2020. The negative cash flow from financing activities was mainly due to the 2021 stock buyback program of DKK 1,500 million and dividend payments of DKK 1,466 million, partly offset by net borrowings.\n\n## Cash position\n\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2021, amounted to DKK 963 million, down from DKK 1,181 million at December 31, 2020.

The increase was mainly driven by net investments, an increase in net working capital, and the acquisitions of Microbiome Labs and Synergia Life Sciences, partly offset by amortization and depreciation.\n\n## Invested capital\n\nInvested capital increased from DKK 15,094 million in 2020 to DKK 18,118 million in 2021. This was mainly a result of an increase in intangible assets from the acquisitions of Microbiome Labs and Synergia Life Sciences.\n\n## ROIC and average invested capital\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ROIC\n\nReturn on invested capital (ROIC), including goodwill, was 19.3%, up 0.4 percentage point from 18.9% in 2020. The increase was mainly driven by the higher net profit after tax which more than offset an increase in invested capital following the PrecisionBiotics Group, Microbiome Labs and Synergia Life Sciences acquisitions.\n\n## Net working capital\n\nNovozymes' net working capital increased to DKK 3,535 million, up from DKK 2,901 million in 2020, due to an increase in inventories and trade receivables, partly offset by higher other payables.\n\n## Net working capital\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Net interest-bearing debt\n\nNovozymes had net interest-bearing debt of DKK 5,225 million at December 31, 2021, compared with DKK 3,871 million at December 31, 2020.\n\nNet interest-bearing debt was impacted by cash outflows from stock buybacks of DKK 1,500 million, dividend payments of DKK 1,466 million and the acquisitions of Microbiome Labs and Synergia Life Sciences as well as the investment in the new production line in Blair, Nebraska, U.S.\n\n## Net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) and net interest-bearing debt-to-EBITDA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Net interest-bearing debt-to-EBITDA\n\nNet interest-bearing debt-to-EBITDA was 1.0x at December 31, 2021, compared with 0.8x at December 31, 2020.",

The increase was a result of the higher net profit.\n\n## Treasury stock\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the holding of treasury stock was 4.9 million B shares, equivalent to 1.7% of the common stock.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual Shareholders' Meeting approve a dividend of DKK 5.50 per share for the 2021 financial year, corresponding to an increase of 5% compared with 2020. This will result in an expected total dividend payment of approximately DKK 1,524 million, corresponding to a payout ratio of 48.5%.\n\n## Shareholder return\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Stock buyback program\n\nIn 2021, Novozymes bought back 3.4 million B shares at an aggregate transaction value of DKK 1,500 million under the stock buyback program initiated on February 8, 2021, and completed on August 30, 2021. The shares acquired under the program will be used to reduce the common stock and to meet obligations arising from employee stock-based incentive programs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about the Novozymes stock in The Novozymes stock",

Of the total electricity the renewable part accounted for 68% in 2021.\n\n## Water\n\nNovozymes' water consumption increased by 7%, from 7,998,000 m 3 in 2020 to 8,538,000 m3 in 2021.\n\n## Energy by source 2021 (2020)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe total volume of wastewater generated in 2021 increased by 2%.\n\n## Waste\n\nIn 2021, 99% of our biomass was re-circulated as compost, fertilizer, feedstock for biogas or the like, compared to 97% in 2020.\n\nFor non-biomass waste, the rate of recycling across our global production sites increased to 62%, from 48% in 2020. The improved recycling rate was the result of a large number of improvements across sites  identified in the zero waste initiative launched in 2020.\n\n## Environmental compliance\n\nThe number of breaches of regulatory limits recorded worldwide in the Novozymes organization decreased to 13 in 2021 from 20 in 2020. Most of these breaches were related to wastewater treatment. Novozymes is addressing these incidents. In addition, we received seven neighbor complaints in 2021, compared with ten in 2020, mostly related to minor temporary odor and noise issues.\n\nIncrease in recycling of non-biomass waste (kg)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1,800,000",

With this investment, Novozymes taps into the growing market need for alternative and healthier sources of protein.\n\nThe capital investment of roughly DKK 2 billion will span over the period 2021-2023, which started in the second half of 2021 and with expected completion by the end of 2023.\n\nReference is made to Note 3.2 .\n\n## Strengthening and accelerating  our BioHealth business\n\nOn January 7, 2021, Novozymes acquired Microbiome Labs, adding a broad range of proprietary microbiome solutions securing an attractive entry point into the North American probiotics market. On December 10, 2021, Novozymes acquired the majority stake in Synergia Life Sciences, a leading player in the field of spore probiotics and vitamin K2-7.\n\nBoth acquisitions are related to the BioHealth business, which also comprises the 2016 acquisition of Organobalance GmbH, the 2020 acquisition of PrecisionBiotics Group along with research and development activities based on Novozymes' existing technology. These acquisitions will leverage our strong scientific capabilities and ability to combine microbes - pre- and probiotics - with enzymes and other biological solutions to develop innovative, effective, and clinically-proven solutions that improve human health in a growing world.\n\nReference is made to Notes 3.5 , 3.6 and 6.5 for a description of the acquisitions and their impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accounting policies and critical accounting estimates and judgments are described in the notes to which they relate to enhance understanding. The descriptions of accounting policies in the notes form part of the overall description of accounting policies.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Novozymes A/S (the Parent Company) and subsidiaries controlled by Novozymes A/S, prepared in accordance with Group accounting policies. The consolidated financial statements are prepared by combining\n\nitems of a uniform nature and subsequently eliminating intercompany transactions, internal stockholdings and balances, and unrealized intercompany profits and losses.\n\nNon-controlling interests' share of subsidiaries net profit for the year and equity are included in the Group's net profit and total equity, but are disclosed separately.\n\nConsolidation of the environmental, social and governance data follows the same principles as the financial reporting.\n\n## Translation of foreign currencies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in Danish kroner (DKK).\n\nExchange rate differences arising between exchange rates at the transaction date and the reporting date are recognized as Financial income or Financial costs.\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency defined for each company using the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date.\n\nFinancial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into DKK at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date for assets and liabilities, and at average exchange rates for income statement items.\n\nThe following exchange rate differences, arising from translation using the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date, are recognized in Other comprehensive income:\n\n- \u00b7   Translation of foreign subsidiaries' net assets at the beginning of the year\n- \u00b7   Translation of foreign subsidiaries' income statements from average exchange rates\n\n## iXBRL reporting\n\nNovozymes is required to file its annual report in the European Single Electronic Format ('ESEF') and The Novozymes Report is therefore prepared in the XHTML format that can be displayed in a standard browser. The primary statements in the consolidated financial statements are tagged using inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (iXBRL). The iXBRL tags comply with the ESEF taxonomy, which is included in the ESEF Regulation and developed based on the IFRS taxonomy published by the IFRS Foundation. Where a financial statement line item is not defined in the ESEF taxonomy, an extension to the\n\ntaxonomy has been created. Extensions are anchored to elements in the ESEF taxonomy, except for extensions which are subtotals.\n\nThe Novozymes Report submitted to the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority consists of the XHTML document together with certain technical files, all included in a file named NOVOZYMES-2021-12-31.zip.\n\n## Non-IFRS financial measures\n\nNovozymes uses certain financial measures that are not defined in IFRS to describe the Group's financial performance, financial position and cash flows. These financial measures may therefore be defined and calculated differently from similar measures in other companies, and may thus not be comparable.\n\nThe non-IFRS financial measures presented in The Novozymes Report are:\n\n- \u00b7   Organic sales growth\n- \u00b7 Operating  costs\n- \u00b7   Economic profit\n- \u00b7   ROIC\n- \u00b7    Free cash flow before acquisitions\n\nDefinitions of non-IFRS financial measures are provided in the Glossary.",

The estimates and underlying assumptions are based\n\non historical experience and various other factors. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based, or if more detailed information becomes available. Such changes are recognized in the period in which the estimate in question is revised.\n\nThe table below shows critical accounting estimates and judgments and their level of potential impact on the consolidated financial statements:\n\n| Note                                                    | Critical accounting estimates  and judgments   | Estimate/  judgment   | Potential impact from  estimates and judgments   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| 2.2 Revenue                                             | Revenue recognition                            | Estimate              |                                                  |\n| 2.6 Tax                                                 | Group tax charge                               | Estimate              |                                                  |\n| 3.1  Intangible assets and  impairment test of goodwill | Impairment of intangible  assets and goodwill  | Estimate              |                                                  |\n| 3.5 Business acquisitions                               |                                                |                       |                                                  |\n| 3.6 Contingent consideration                            |                                                |                       |                                                  |\n| 6.5 Non-controlling interests                           | Fair value measurement                         | Estimate              |                                                  |\n| 4.1 Inventories                                         | Cost of work in progress and  finished goods   | Estimate              |                                                  |\n| 4.2  Trade receivables and  contract assets             | Allowances for doubtful trade  receivables     | Estimate              |                                                  |\n\nThe application of the Group's accounting policies may require Management to make judgments that can have a significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.

The fiscal year for the Group is January 1 - December 31.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, with the exception of derivatives, securities, contingent consideration and share purchase liability, which are measured at fair value. The accounting policies are unchanged from last year.\n\nThe consolidated environmental, social and governance data have been prepared in accordance with principles that adhere to internationally recognized voluntary reporting standards and principles such as the UN Global Compact (UNGC). Novozymes is a signatory to the UNGC, a voluntary policy initiative for businesses that are committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption. We also take inspiration from the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework for climate-related disclosures.\n\nOur reporting and materiality assessments were also inspired by the GRI framework.\n\nThe principles are unchanged from last year.\n\n## Defining materiality\n\nThe Novozymes Report is based on the concept of materiality, to ensure that the content is material and relevant.\n\nIf items are individually immaterial, they are aggregated with other items of a similar nature in the statements or in the notes. Novozymes provides the specific disclosures required by IFRS unless the information is considered immaterial to the economic decision-making of the readers of The Novozymes Report.\n\nAs for environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, we disclose information on issues that are identified by our materiality assessment. The disclosures in the notes include information on our management approach, targets, initiatives, and related progress.\n\nNovozymes' materiality assessment is a systematic and rigorous process that has been aligned with the principles of double materiality. It allows us both to evaluate whether Novozymes has an impact on environment and society and to\n\nidentify how ESG issues affect the creation of long-term value. The process integrates input from external stakeholders, trend analyses and internal engagement with relevant departments including Investor Relations, Risk Management & Controls, Quality, Sustainability and our commercial divisions. This process results in a materiality matrix of economic and ESG issues. The matrix reflects the importance of those issues to our key stakeholders versus their impact on Novozymes, and it is used to guide our strategy and reporting.\n\nAs a result of the materiality assessment performed in 2021, two new issues were added: Supply chain security and Diversity & Inclusion. Further information on diversity and inclusion are disclosed in a separate note for the first time in this report (see Note 8.2).\n\nIn the past couple of years, various global movements and the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased focus on how companies manage social issues, like diversity and inclusion and labor practices. As a responsible corporate citizen, Novozymes continuously strive to strengthen our governance and management of these material issues.\n\nIn the illustration on the following page, we highlight some of the material issues, for which, we have external targets/flagship initiatives. For more information, refer to www.novozymes.com/ en/about-us/sustainability/materiality.\n\n## Limited reporting scope\n\nThe environmental data cover those activities that could have a significant impact on the environment. Sites with activities considered not to have a significant environmental impact are not included. Such sites comprise sales offices, R&D labs, and sites with limited blending and storage of products. However, measures are taken to ensure that at least 97% of the total Novozymes quantity of the measured environmental parameter is included in the reported numbers.\n\nIn the reporting of environmental, social and governance data, companies acquired in 2021 are only included in number of employees, as appropriate procedures for recording data on other measures have not yet been established.",

Novozymes expects to adopt the accounting standards and interpretations as they become mandatory. None of the new or amended standards or interpretations are expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.",

This setup consolidates functions by type, and Management reviews the results of the Group as a whole to assess performance. Thus, there is only one operating segment.\n\n## Worldwide operations\n\nThe Group operates in four geographical regions: Europe, Middle East & Africa, North America, Asia Pacific and Latin America. From a revenue perspective, U.S. is the largest single country,\n\ncontributing ~29% of the Group's revenue (2020: ~29%).\n\nThe geographical distribution of revenue is based on the country in which the goods are delivered. For a number of customers, central deliveries are made to specified locations and the final destination is unknown. The stated geographical distribution of revenue may therefore vary from year to year if delivery destinations for these customers change.\n\nMost of the Group's intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are located in Denmark, U.S., India and China at ~44%, ~25%, ~13% and ~10% respectively (2020: ~48%, ~27%, ~3% and ~13%).\n\n## Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment 2021 (2020)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, largest  single countries:   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Denmark                                                                           | 44%    | 48%    |\n| U.S.                                                                              | 25%    | 27%    |\n| India*                                                                            | 13%    | 3%     |\n| China                                                                             | 10%    | 13%    |\n\n- * The increase in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in India is related to the acquisition of Synergia Life Sciences, see Note 3.5.",

Revenue includes the sale of goods and related services and royalties, and is recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which Novozymes expects to be entitled. Revenue from the straightforward sale of goods to customers is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, i.e. when goods are delivered. Variable considerations are included in revenue to the extent that they are not subject to significant uncertainty.\n\nThe performance obligations in the contracts are to deliver enzymes, microorganisms and probiotics to customers, and each batch delivered is considered a separate performance obligation, as each batch is distinct.\n\n## Rebates\n\nEnzymes, microorganisms and probiotics are sometimes sold at a rebate. A rebate agreement can be set up in various ways, but common to all agreements is that revenue is recognized based on the price specified in the contract, net of the estimated rebate. The rebates are estimated\n\nbased on experience, as well as information related to expected orders 3-12 months in advance. The estimated rebates are reassessed at the end of each reporting period.\n\n## Returns\n\nA few of Novozymes' markets are granted a right of return. No revenue is recognized for the goods expected to be returned, as a refund liability is recognized. Estimates of the expected level of returns are based on analysis of historical returns and knowledge of the relevant markets/ products. These estimates are updated at the end of each reporting period. As the goods returned are usually scrapped, no inventory asset is recognized.\n\n## Profit split\n\nNovozymes has entered into partnerships where Novozymes manufactures and sells products to a partner, who undertakes the sales to end customers. The profit on products sold to end customers is shared between the partner and Novozymes based on predetermined profitsharing mechanisms.\n\nRevenue from these arrangements consists of sales of products to the partner and the shared profit, and is recognized in full when the goods are delivered to the other contracting party. This is done by calculating the expected profit based on insights, experience and other input factors. The calculated profit is recognized as a contract asset or contract liability until an invoice is issued. The realized profit is settled periodically.\n\n## Commission\n\nNovozymes has entered into commission agreements where agents undertake sales to third parties in return for a commission on realized sales. Revenue from such agreements is recognized when the goods are delivered, as the nature of the performance obligation is to provide the specified goods.\n\n## Other\n\nRevenue collected on behalf of third parties is not recognized as revenue.\n\nNovozymes' obligation to provide a refund for products that are not of the agreed quality or according to agreed specifications under the\n\nstandard warranty terms is recognized as contract liabilities.\n\nA trade receivable is recognized when the customer obtains control of the goods and an invoice is issued, as this is the point in time when the consideration becomes unconditional and only the passage of time is required before payment is due. Typical payment terms are around 60 days.\n\nContract liabilities consist of advance payments, deferred revenue and liabilities for refund goods. The contract liabilities are recognized as revenue as the performance obligations under the contracts are fulfilled.",

This leads to transactions between group companies. Novozymes follows the OECD principles in setting internal transfer prices for these transactions. This is a complicated area and entails a tax risk, because the transactions are subject to judgment in each country. The tax controversy risk for Novozymes is significantly reduced through the use of bilateral advance pricing agreements (APAs).\n\n## Bilateral APAs\n\nAs stated in our tax policy, Novozymes proactively engages in bilateral APAs negotiated at competent authority level to increase predictability and to mitigate transfer pricing risks. Most of the intercompany transaction value within the Novozymes Group is covered by bilateral APAs.\n\nAn APA is an agreement between a taxpayer and a tax authority determining the transfer pricing methodology for pricing the taxpayer's international transactions for future years.\n\nThe methodology is applied for a certain period based on the fulfilment of certain terms and conditions (called critical assumptions). An APA can be unilateral or bilateral. Novozymes only enters into bilateral APAs, meaning that they are negotiated between the competent tax\n\nauthorities of the two countries involved in the transaction. An APA provides assurance with respect to the tax outcome of our international transactions, by determining in advance arm's length pricing and the pricing methodology to be applied to the international transactions.\n\nNovozymes has entered into bilateral APAs with the tax authorities in the countries where internal transactions are most significant. Included in APA-covered transactions are group internal transactions between Denmark and the U.S., China or India, respectively.\n\n## Joint taxation\n\nNovozymes A/S and its Danish subsidiaries are jointly taxed with the Danish companies of the Novo Holdings A/S Group. Joint taxation also covers withholding taxes in the form of dividend tax, royalty tax and interest tax. The Danish companies are jointly and individually liable for the joint taxation liability. Any subsequent adjustments to income taxes and withholding taxes may increase the liability. Tax for the individual companies is allocated in full on the basis of the expected taxable income.\n\n## Tax in the income statement\n\nTransfer of intellectual property from Switzerland to Denmark had a positive impact on the effective tax rate of 2.7% in 2021 (2020: 2.9%). This is recognized in Difference in foreign tax rates.\n\n## Tax in the income statement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| DKK million                                     | DKK million                                     | 2021    | 2020    |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Tax payable on net profit                       | Tax payable on net profit                       | (941)   | (817)   |\n| Change in deferred tax                          | Change in deferred tax                          | 139     | 144     |\n| Prior-year adjustments - current tax            | Prior-year adjustments - current tax            | (41)    | 98      |\n| Prior-year adjustments - deferred tax           | Prior-year adjustments - deferred tax           | 64      | (120)   |\n| Tax in the income statement                     | I/S                                             | (779)   | (695)   |\n| Calculation of effective tax rate:              | Calculation of effective tax rate:              |         |         |\n| Corporate tax rate in Denmark                   |                                                 | (22.0)% | (22.0)% |\n| Non-taxable income less non-deductible expenses | Non-taxable income less non-deductible expenses | 0.5%    | 0.2%    |\n| Difference in foreign tax rates                 | Difference in foreign tax rates                 | 2.1%    | 2.5%    |\n| Other adjustments                               | Other adjustments                               | (0.5)%  | (0.4)%  |\n| Effective tax rate                              | Effective tax rate                              | (19.9)% | (19.7)% |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nAs the Group operates across many different countries, the calculation of the Group's total tax charge in the income statement inherently involves estimation.

As a result, there may be substantial differences between the tax charge recognized in the consolidated income statement and actual tax payments.",

Uncertain tax positions are assessed individually and recognized if it is probable that an amount will be paid or received. Deferred tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method and comprises all temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax base of assets and liabilities. No deferred tax is recognized for goodwill, unless amortization of goodwill for tax\n\npurposes is allowed. The tax value of tax loss carry-forwards is included in the calculation of deferred tax to the extent that the tax losses can be expected to be utilized in the future.\n\nDeferred tax is measured according to current tax rules and at the tax rate expected to be in force on elimination of temporary differences. Changes in deferred tax due to tax rate changes are recognized in the income statement, unless they relate to items recognized either in Other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\n## 2.7 Earnings per share\n\n| DKK million                                                            | 2021        | 2020        |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Net profit for the year                                                | 3,145       | 2,826       |\n| Less net profit attributable to non-controlling interests              | 1           | (1)         |\n| Net profit attributable to the shareholders of Novozymes A/S           | 3,146       | 2,825       |\n| Average number of shares                                               |             |             |\n| Weighted average number of shares in circulation                       | 277,919,162 | 280,427,908 |\n| Average dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and  stock awards | 2,308,943   | 1,595,499   |\n| Average number of diluted shares                                       | 280,228,105 | 282,023,407 |\n| Earnings per share, DKK                                                | 11.32       | 10.07       |\n| Earnings per share, diluted, DKK                                       | 11.23       | 10.02       |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nEarnings per share is calculated as net profit attributable to shareholders of Novozymes A/S divided by the average number of shares in circulation.\n\nDiluted earnings per share is calculated as net profit attributable to shareholders of Novozymes A/S divided by the average number of shares in circulation, including the dilutive effect of stock options 'in the money'.",

The impairment loss has been recognized in Research and development costs.\n\nIn 2020, an impairment loss of DKK 32 million on patents was recognized and included in Research and development cost. The impaired asset was\n\npart of a project that was terminated, and the asset was fully written off.\n\n## Impairment test of goodwill\n\nAn impairment test of goodwill of Novozymes' cash-generating units (CGUs) is performed for the entire Group, as cost bases of the cash-generating units cannot be measured at CGU level.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nManagement assesses the risk of impairment of the Group's intangible assets. This requires judgment in relation to the identification of cash-generating units (CGUs) and the underlying assumptions in the Group's impairment model.\n\nIf there is any indication of impairment, value in use is estimated and compared with the carrying amount. The calculation of value in use is based on the discounted cash flow method using estimates of future cash flows from the continuing use. The key parameters are the expected revenue streams and the rate used to discount the cash flows.\n\nAs the market value of Novozymes is significantly higher than its equity, no further key assumptions are used to determine whether impairment of goodwill exists (2020: no impairment).",

Goodwill and IT development projects in progress are not subject to amortization.\n\nCosts associated with large IT projects for the development of software for internal use are capitalized if incurred with a view to developing new and improved systems.\n\nAmortization is based on the straight-line method over the expected useful lives of the finite-lived assets, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7   Completed IT development projects are amortized over their useful lives. IT development assets are amortized over a period of 3-5 years\n- \u00b7   Acquired patents, trademarks, licenses, know-how, customer relationships and brands are amortized over their useful lives. The useful lives of patents and trademarks are normally identical to the patent period. Licenses are amortized over the agreement period. Recognized patents, trademarks, licenses, know-how, customer relationships and brands are amortized over a period of 7-20 years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExpected useful lives are reassessed regularly.\n\nThe Group regularly reviews the carrying amounts of its finite-lived intangible assets to determine whether there is an indication of an impairment loss. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the asset's carrying amount exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are reversed only to the extent of changes in the assumptions and estimates underlying the impairment calculation.\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired.",

If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of any impairment loss. If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be lower than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount. Impairment losses are reversed only to the extent of changes in the assumptions and estimates underlying the impairment calculation.",

If, at inception, it is assessed that a contract contains a lease, a lease asset is recognized. Lease assets are initially measured at the present value of future lease payments, plus the cost of obligations to refurbish the asset. Payments include fixed payments, variable lease payments depending on an index or a rate and the exercise price of purchase options that are reasonably certain to be excercised.\n\nLease assets are depreciated using the straightline method over the shorter of the expected lease term and the useful life of the underlying asset. Lease assets are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that the assets may be impaired.\n\nLease assets are depreciated as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  Buildings: 1-12 years\n- \u00b7  Land: 10-90 years\n- \u00b7  Plant and machinery: 1-10 years\n- \u00b7  Other equipment: 1-10 years\n\nShort-term leases and leases of low value are recognized as expenses in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nNovozymes' portfolio of leases covers leases of land, buildings and other equipment such as cars and transportation containers.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nLease liabilities are initially recognized at the present value of future lease payments including payments from extension or purchase options that are considered reasonably certain to be exercised.\n\nThe lease liability is measured using the implicit borrowing rate in the contracts or, where this is not available, the marginal borrowing rate in the countries in which Novozymes operates. Novozymes applies a single discount rate to portfolios of leases in the countries in which Novozymes operates based on contract currency and loan periods.\n\nIf a lease contract is modified, the lease liability is remeasured. For building leases, lease terms are estimated taking the size of the building and its\n\nstrategic importance into consideration. Novozymes has entered into several open-ended building leases and building leases with extension options. Lease terms of such agreements are estimated based on the strategic importance of the buildings and the estimated time frame necessary to vacate the premises. The estimated lease term is reassessed at each reporting date. The estimated lease terms for such contracts do not exceed 12 years.",

Novozymes aims for its production sites not to have a negative environmental impact. These liabilities relate to established circumstances, and the costs are expected to be incurred either when concrete measures are implemented or when a site is vacated. The expected costs and timing are inherently uncertain.\n\n## Legal and other obligations\n\nNovozymes is involved in a number of ongoing legal disputes, and provisions are made for the estimated costs based on a current evaluation of\n\nthe outcomes. Current ongoing cases are expected to be finalized in 2022-2024. In Management's opinion, the outcomes of these cases are not expected to give rise to any significant losses beyond the amounts provided for at December 31, 2021.\n\nOther obligations include other long-term employee benefits and other contractual obligations.\n\nAdditions from business acquisitions of DKK 50 million is related to the acquisition of Synergia Life Sciences.\n\nIn 2021, contingent consideration of DKK 62 million related to the divestment of a pharmarelated royalty was recognized in Other operating income. The remaining consideration was reversed because certain patent registrations were not obtained in 2021.\n\nOther long-term employee benefits account for only a minor amount, as most of Novozymes' pension plans are defined contribution plans, covering approximately 99% of employees. These obligations are mainly expected to be incurred over a relatively long period of time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nProvisions are recognized where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred as a result of past events and it is probable that it will lead to an outflow of financial resources.\n\nProvisions are measured at the present value of the expected expenditure required to settle the obligation.",

There are only minor changes to the opening balance as presented in The Novozymes Report 2020.\n- 2. The fair value and allocation of acquired assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests are provisional, pending receipt of the final valuations.\n\n## Microbiome Labs\n\nOn January 7, 2021, Novozymes acquired all shares in Microbiome Labs. Microbiome Labs offers a comprehensive suite of proprietary probiotic and microbiome solutions targeting gastrointestinal, immune, metabolic and cognitive health. The solutions are marketed under both the company's own supplement brands and in private label products. The branded products are sold exclusively through the company's access to an extensive network of healthcare practitioners predominately consisting of medical doctors, nutritionists and naturopaths.\n\nBy acquiring Microbiome Labs, Novozymes added a broad range of proprietary microbiome solutions to its human health activities. The acquisition also created an attractive entry point into the North American probiotics market accessed through the company's network of healthcare practitioners. Goodwill of DKK 338 million is attributable to expected synergies with Novozymes' existing business operations and technologies within probiotics and enzymes for human health. The goodwill is tax deductible.\n\nThe following valuation techniques have been applied in the fair value assessment of significant assets acquired:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nFair value measurement of the acquired assets and liabilities as well as contingent consideration requires Management to make estimates and use assumptions, as\n\nobservable market prices are not available. The determined fair values are associated with uncertainty and may be subject to subsequent adjustments.\n\n- \u00b7   Customer relationships; The Multi-period Excess Earnings Method (MEEM)\n- \u00b7   Technology; The Relief from Royalty (RfR) method\n- \u00b7   Brands; The Relief from Royalty (RfR) method\n\nThe purchase agreement includes a contingent consideration of up to DKK 825 million at the acquisition date. The consideration is contingent on the achievement of sales targets for 2022 and is recognized at the anticipated fair value of DKK 338 million at the acquisition date. Fair value is assessed by using the earn-out from the most probable sales estimates in 2022 discounted at a rate of 8%.\n\nThe contribution from Microbiome Labs would not be significantly different if the acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2021. For further details, please refer to Note 3.5 in The Novozymes Report 2020.\n\nThe transaction costs incurred in 2020 amounted to DKK 29 million and are included in Sales and distribution costs.",

Synergia Life Sciences has a global footprint and adds strong developing and manufacturing capabilities in spore probiotics and vitamin K2-7 from three production sites in India. Synergia Life Sciences is the producer and supplier to Microbiome Labs, which was acquired by Novozymes early in 2021.\n\nThe vitamin K2-7 portfolio is a strong complementary enabler to support growth in Novozymes' BioHealth platform. The acquisition offers a scientifically proven spore strain portfolio that strengthens Novozymes' human health business and accelerates its functional food offerings.\n\nGoodwill of DKK 507 million is attributable to expected synergies with Novozymes' existing business operations and technologies within spore probiotics for human health and is highly synergistic to the previous acquisition of Microbiome Labs within the human health business. The goodwill is not tax deductible.\n\nThe fair value and allocation of acquired assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests are provisional, pending receipt of the final valuations. The following valuation techniques have been applied in the fair value assessment of significant assets acquired:\n\n- \u00b7   Technology; the Relief from Royalty (RfR) method\n- \u00b7   Customer relationships; The Multi-period Excess Earnings Method (MEEM)\n- \u00b7   Brands; The Relief from Royalty (RfR) method\n\nThe remaining 40% of the shares in Synergia Life Sciences are held by non-controlling interests. The non-controlling interests are recognized at its proportionate share of the acquired net identifiable assets and amount to DKK 368 million. The remaining 40% is to be acquired in 2025. Reference is made to Note 6.5 to the Consolidated financial statements concerning Non-controlling interests.\n\nThe purchase price includes a deferred consideration of DKK 77 million, which is expected to be paid in 2022.\n\nNet revenue and profit contributed from Synergia Life Sciences to the consolidated income statement are immaterial for the reporting period. On a pro forma basis, if the acquisition had been effective from January 1, 2021, Synergia Life Sciences would have contributed DKK ~130 million to revenue (adjusted for Novozymes related sales) and an EBIT margin above Novozymes' EBIT margin.\n\nThe transaction costs incurred in 2021 amounted to DKK 46 million and are included in Sales and distribution costs.\n\n## Acquisition in 2020\n\nOn June 25, 2020, Novozymes acquired all shares in PrecisionBiotics Group at a purchase price of DKK 798 million. PrecisionBiotics Group holds a leading position within probiotics for human gut health and is well positioned with several clinically-backed products already on the market. PrecisionBiotics Group has strong expertise within clinical development, upscaling and commercialization and is well situated in Cork, Ireland, home to a leading academic society within human gut health.\n\nThe purchase price allocation led to recognition of goodwill of DKK 158 million, intangible assets of DKK 639 million and deferred tax liabilities of DKK 80 million. Goodwill is attributable to expected synergies with Novozymes' existing business operations and technologies within probiotics and enzymes for human health. The goodwill is not tax deductible.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nOn acquisition of companies, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair values at the acquisition date. The consideration transferred includes the fair value at the acquisition date of any contingent consideration arrangement.\n\nNon-controlling interests in an acquired company is recognized either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquired company's net identifiable assets.\n\nThe purchase agreement includes a contingent consideration of up to DKK 298 million at the acquisition date. The consideration is contingent on the achievement of sales and EBITDA for 2023 and is recognized at the anticipated fair value of DKK 146 million at the acquisition date. Fair value is assessed by using the earn-out from the most probable sales and EBITDA estimates in 2023 discounted at a rate of 7%.\n\n## Adjustment to prior-year business acquisition\n\nThe most probable sales and EBITDA related to PrecisionBiotics Group have been reassessed in 2021, which led to an increase of the fair value at the acquisition date of DKK 44 million in contingent consideration and goodwill.\n\nThis decision is made on an acquisition-byacquisition basis.\n\nGoodwill may subsequently be adjusted for changes in the fair value of the consideration transferred and/or changes in the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired until 12 months after the acquisition date, to the extent such changes relate to facts and circumstances present at the acquisition date. Acquired companies are consolidated from the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.",

Fair value is assessed by using the earn-out from the most probable sales in 2022 discounted at a rate of 8%.\n\nThe sales target for 2022 has been reassessed after the acquisition date which led to a decrease of the contingent consideration of DKK 62 million.

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 5.1 Financial risk factors and risk management\n\nDue to the international nature of Novozymes' operations, our earnings and financial position are exposed to a number of financial risk factors. Financial risks are managed centrally for the entire Group. The Treasury Policy is approved by the Board of Directors and sets the limits for the various financial risks and the derivatives used to hedge risk. The Treasury Policy is adjusted on an ongoing basis to adapt to the market situation, and contains rules on which derivatives can be used for hedging, which counterparties can be used, and the risk profile that is to be applied.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nCurrency risk arises due to imbalances between income and costs in each individual currency and because Novozymes has more assets than liabilities in foreign currencies in connection with its global operations.\n\nHedging of currency risk is carried out in the currencies in which Novozymes has the largest exposure. Hedging is managed by entering into derivatives such as forward contracts, currency options and swaps. Loans and deposits in foreign currencies are also utilized for hedging purposes. Hedge effectiveness is assessed on a regular basis by comparing changes in the timing and value of the expected exposure in the relevant currencies with the timing and value changes for the designated cash flow hedging transaction.\n\nWhere deemed appropriate, currency risk related to net investments in foreign subsidiaries is\n\nhedged by taking out loans and entering into swaps. Currently, there are no open transactions used to hedge equity investments.\n\n## Foreign exchange sensitivity - 2021\n\nThe sensitivity analysis shows the impact on net profit and other comprehensive income of a 5% change in DKK versus the key currencies to which Novozymes was exposed at December 31, 2021. For other comprehensive income, the analysis shows the impact on currency translation of net investments and does not include the impact of cash flow hedges, as these relate to future commercial transactions.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis reflects the transaction and translation risk, and assumes that exchange rates change on December 31, 2021, while all other variables remain constant. The table shows the effect of an increase in exchange rates. A decrease in the exchange rates would have the opposite effect.\n\n## Foreign exchange sensitivity - 2022 estimate\n\nOperating profit (EBIT) is exposed to exchange rate developments, as the effect of hedges is included in financial income/costs. EBIT is mainly exposed to USD and EUR. A movement of 5% in the USD/ DKK exchange rate would result in a change in the expected EBIT for 2022 of around DKK 130-160 million (2021: DKK 130-160 million). A 5% movement in the EUR/DKK exchange rate would result in a change in expected EBIT for 2022 of around DKK 200 million (2021: DKK 200 million).\n\n## Foreign exchange sensitivity analysis\n\n|             |                              | 2021                   | 2021                                      | 2020                   | 2020                                      |\n|-------------|------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| DKK million | Increase in  exchange  rates | Change   in net profit | Change in   other com- prehensive  income | Change   in net profit | Change in   other com- prehensive  income |\n| CHF         | 5.0%                         | -                      | 48                                        | -                      | 49                                        |\n| CNY         | 5.0%                         | (1)                    | 127                                       | (3)                    | 113                                       |\n| USD         | 5.0%                         | 1                      | 244                                       | (2)                    | 227                                       |\n| Other       | 5.0%                         | (2)                    | 117                                       | -                      | 68                                        |\n| Total       |                              | (2)                    | 536                                       | (5)                    | 457                                       |\n\nOf the expected USD cash flows for 2022, 88% has been hedged by forward contracts at an average rate of DKK 6.26. As a result, the impact on net profit from changes in the USD/DKK exchange rate has been reduced significantly compared with the impact on EBIT.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk arises in relation to interestbearing assets and liabilities. In accordance with Novozymes' Treasury Policy, a minimum of 30% of loans must be at fixed interest rates. Hedging of the interest rate risk is managed by entering into fixed-rate loans and interest rate swaps.\n\nWith the current hedging of interest rate risk, an increase of one percentage point in the average interest rate on Novozymes' net interest-bearing debt would have a negative effect on net profit of DKK 12 million (2020: negative effect of DKK 2\n\nmillion). At December 31, 2021, 62% (2020: 69%) of the loan portfolio carried fixed interest rates.\n\nNo loans, credit facilities or other financial instruments held by Novozymes are impacted by the IBOR reform.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk arises especially for cash and cash equivalents, derivatives, trade receivables and contract assets. The credit risk on trade receivables and contract assets is countered by thorough, regular analysis based on customer type, country and specific conditions. The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents as well as on derivatives is mitigated by the Treasury Policy, which limits exposure solely to counterparties that have an investment-grade credit rating. Credit risk is calculated on the basis of net market values and is governed by the Treasury",

Novozymes has entered into netting agreements (ISDA or similar) with all banks used for trading in financial instruments, which means that Novozymes' credit risk is limited to net assets. At December 31, 2021, the Group considered its maximum credit risk to be DKK 4,219 million (2020: DKK 4,021 million), which is the total of the Group's financial assets. At December 31, 2021, the maximum credit risk related to a single counterparty was DKK 330 million (2020: DKK 399 million).\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nIn connection with the Group's ongoing financing of operations, including refinancing, efforts are made to ensure adequate and flexible liquidity. This is effected by using committed credit facilities and placing free funds in deposits, government bonds or ultra-liquid mortgage bonds in accordance with the Treasury Policy.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, Novozymes' financial resources amounted to DKK 4,748 million (2020: DKK 6,522 million), consisting of net cash, cash equivalents, and undrawn committed credit facilities of DKK 3,785 million, which expire in 2022-2025.\n\nWith the exception of debt to credit institutions, the maturity dates are primarily within one year.\n\n## Capital structure\n\nNovozymes favors a modestly leveraged balance sheet which is reflected by a target for net interest-bearing debt of around 1x EBITDA. At December 31, 2021, the ratio was 1.0 and thus the target is considered as met in 2021. The capital structure is mainly managed using two instruments: 1) Dividend payments where Novozymes aims for a payout ratio of around 50%. For 2021, the payout ratio is expected to be 48.5% which is in line with the communicated target. 2) Stock buybacks, a program for DKK 1,500 million was executed in 2021. A new program of up DKK 500 million is planned for 2022.\n\n## 5.2  Financial income and  Financial costs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInterest income and Interest costs are measured at amortized cost for financial assets and liabilities.\n\nFinancial income and Financial costs also include fair value adjustments of derivatives used to hedge assets and liabilities, and income and costs relating to cash flow hedges that are transferred from Other comprehensive income on realization of the hedged item.\n\n| DKK million                                          | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Interest income                                      | 18     | 10     |\n| Fair value adjustments of contingent consideration   | 62     | -      |\n| Gains on cash flow hedges                            | 31     | 15     |\n| Gains on fair value hedges                           | 63     | 1      |\n| Financial income                                     | 174    | 26     |\n| Interest costs                                       | (31)   | (39)   |\n| Interest on lease liabilities                        | (21)   | (24)   |\n| Interest on contingent consideration                 | (50)   | -      |\n| Other financial costs                                | (20)   | (31)   |\n| Other foreign exchange losses, net                   | (98)   | (51)   |\n| Fair value adjustments of cash-settled stock options | (33)   | (8)    |\n| Financial costs                                      | (253)  | (153)  |\n| Financial income/(costs), net                        | (79)   | (127)  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nFinancial income and Financial costs comprise interest income and interest costs, realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses, as well as fair value adjustments of cash-settled stock-based incentive programs and contingent consideration, which are offset against Other liabilities and fair value adjustments of Other financial assets.",

The derivatives are not traded in an active market based on quoted prices but on individual contracts. The fair value of these assets is determined using valuation techniques that utilize market-based data such as exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk and volatilities.\n\nOther financial assets, contingent considerations and share purchase liability are measured at fair value based on non-observable data (level 3 input).

Further, significant proportions of their remuneration packages are\n\nbased on performance-related pay through short and long-term incentives. Most of the variable remuneration is weighted towards the long-term, in line with Novozymes' strategic focus and mirroring the long-term nature of Novozymes' investments in the business.\n\nThe short and long-term incentive programs are designed to incentivize performance against selected financial, environmental, social and operational key performance indicators and individual objectives, which are directly linked to Novozymes' strategy, and to incentivize long-term value creation and alignment with the long-term interests of shareholders, customers and other stakeholders. The annual cash bonus cannot exceed 9.5 months' fixed base salary, of which\n\n65% is expected to be payable at target performance. The stock-based incentive programs are described in Note 6.2.\n\nMembers of the Executive Leadership Team have contracts of employment containing standard conditions for executives of Danish listed companies, including the periods of notice that both parties are required to give and noncompetition clauses. If an executive officer's contract of employment is terminated by the company without any misconduct on the part of the executive officer, the executive officer has a notice period of 12 months. In addition to the notice period, the executive officer has a right to termination compensation of 12 months' base salary and pension contributions.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nThe remuneration of the Board of Directors comprises a fixed fee and is not based on incentives.\n\n## Changes to the Executive Leadership Team\n\nIn April 2021, Amy Byrick joined as EVP of Strategy & Business Transformation and Morten Enggaard Rasmussen joined as EVP of People, Sustainability & Brand. Former EVP and COO Thomas Videb\u00e6k, who had been acting as interim EVP for those areas, left Novozymes in April in accordance with an agreement made in 2020.",

The purpose of these programs is to ensure an alignment of interests of the Management, employees and shareholders. Allocation of programs has been, and remains, dependent on profit, value-creation and, in some cases, sustainability targets being achieved, and are made based on individual base salary. The exercise price and the share price of a stock option are identical at the date of grant. In order to exercise the options, the employee must still be employed at the exercise date. This does not apply to persons who have retired, taken voluntary early retirement or been given notice.\n\nIn 2020, Novozymes introduced annual long-term incentive-based program grants with overlapping three-year performance periods, and so in 2021 a new incentive program for the Executive Leadership Team was established, covering the performance period 2021-2023. The program is a combination of stock options and stock, with half of the incentive program allocated in stock options and half in stock. The total number of stock options and stock achievable is divided into two categories: 'target stock options and target stock' and 'extra stock options and extra stock'. The target stock options and target stock correspond to 65% of the maximum stock options and stock, and extra stock options and extra stock correspond to 35% of the maximum stock options\n\nand stock. The following perfomance targets have been set for 2021-2023: Economic profit (weight 40%), organic sales growth (weight 40%) and sustainability targets (weight 20%). Sustainability covers measures in relation to Climate, Water & Circular, Workplace and Employees. Each of the sustainability targets carry a weight of 5%. The performance targets are as protocolled in the minutes of the board meeting approving the annual group financial statements for the year prior to the performance period.\n\n- \u00b7   If Novozymes reaches the targets for 20212023 for sales growth and economic profit in line with business plans and long-term aspiration and on all four measures for the sustainability targets, then the target stock options and the target stock will be granted.\n- \u00b7   If Novozymes manages to outperform the targets, then target stock options and target stock will be granted and some or all of the extra stock options and extra stock may be granted.\n- \u00b7   If Novozymes does not meet the targets for 2021-2023 or if Novozymes performs significantly below the targets on one or more of the four sustainability targets, then none or only part of the target stock options and target stock will be granted.\n\nThe program contains a maximum-value clause, allowing the Board of Directors to choose to limit the total allocation of stock options and stock if\n\nthe intrinsic value of the program exceeds twice the full annual conditional grant.\n\nThe total target-level fair value of the program at the date of grant was approximately DKK 40 million. The value of the stock will be expensed over the three-year qualifying period (2021-2023) and will be released in 2024. The stock options have a vesting period of four years, followed by an exercise period of five years. The fair value of the stock options will be expensed over the four-year vesting period.\n\nA new program was also established in 2021 for vice presidents and directors covering the performance period 2021-2023 (185 vice presidents and directors). The total target level fair value at grant date was DKK 55 million and based on the same requirements and targets as for the Executive Leadership Team. The program is a combination of stock options and stock, with half of the incentive program allocated in stock and half in stock options. The stock options have a four-year vesting period and an exercise period of five years. The stock will be released in 2024.\n\nThe program contains a maximum-value clause, allowing the Board of Directors to choose to limit the total allocation of stock and stock options if the intrinsic value of the program exceeds twice the full annual conditional grant.\n\nVice presidents, directors and employees covered by the 2021 programs\n\n## 5,563\n\nFor other employees, a new stock option-based incentive program was also established in 2021 covering the performance period 2021-2023. The employee program follows the same requirements and targets as the program for the Executive Leadership Team and the program for vice presidents and directors.\n\nThe Executive Leadership Team, vice presidents and directors, who are already included in an existing incentive program, are excluded from the employee program. The awarded stock options have a vesting period of four years, after which there is an exercise period of five years. The target level value of the program is approximately DKK 40 million.\n\nThe 2020 programs covering the period 20202022 follow the same principles as those described for the 2021 programs, and the fair value at grant date of the programs was approximately the same.",

If allocations under the\n\nprograms are made in countries where ownership of foreign stock is not permitted, the value of stock options is settled in cash instead, and a liability of DKK 44 million was recognized for this in 2021 (2020: DKK 15 million).

Volatility is estimated using the historical volatility over the last three years. The risk-free interest rate is based on Danish government bonds with a maturity equivalent to the option's term to maturity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe Group has established stock-based incentive programs comprising equity-settled and cash-settled programs.\n\nThe fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of stock options and stock awards is measured with reference to the fair value of the stock options and stock awards granted. The fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\n\nThe fair value of stock-based payment at the grant date is recognized as an employee cost over the period in which the stock options vest. In measuring the fair value, account is taken of the\n\n## Stock awards\n\nThe stock allocated under the programs is used for stock awards. In 2021, 106,381 stock awards with a fair value of DKK 41 million were granted (2020: DKK 38 million) which will be expensed over the three-year period (2021-2023).\n\nThe total number of outstanding stock awards at December 31, 2021 was 209,193 (2020: 108,242). The fair value of these at December 31, 2021 was DKK 112 million (2020: 38 million).\n\nnumber of employees expected to gain entitlement to the options as well as the number of options the employees are expected to gain. This estimate is adjusted at the end of each reporting period such that only the number of options to which employees are entitled or expected to be entitled is recognized.\n\nThe value of equity-settled programs is recognized in equity. The value of cash-settled programs, which are recognized as Other liabilities, is adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period, and the subsequent adjustment is recognized in the income statement under Financial income or Financial costs.",

See details in Note 3.5.\n\n## Share purchase liability\n\nThe remaining 40% of the shares in Synergia Life Sciences is to be acquired in 2025 and a liability of DKK 717 million is recognized in 2021.\n\nThe redemption amount is contingent on the achievement of sales targets for Synergia Life Sciences for the period April 1, 2024 to March 31, 2025.\n\nThe consideration will be within the range of DKK 652 million to DKK 1,174 million and includes payment of the non-controlling interests' stake of the net working capital and cash balances at the acquisition date of Synergia Life Sciences.\n\nFair value of the Share purchase liability is assessed by using the most probable redemption amount, discounted at a rate of 11%. The share purchase liability is denominated in INR.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nFair value of the share purchase liability is based on non-observable data (level 3 input) that requires Management to make estimates and use assumptions.\n\nEstimates are based on updated information since the initial recognition of the liability such as budgets, sales forecasts, discount rates etc. The fair value of the share purchase liability is calculated as the present value of the most probable redemption amount using the discounted cash flow method. The determined fair value is associated with uncertainty and may be subject to subsequent adjustments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nShare purchase liability is Novozymes's obligation to purchase non-controlling interests in subsidiaries and is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date. The fair value of the most likely redemption amount is initially recognized within liabilities with a corresponding charge directly to Equity. Interest and fair value adjustments resulting from events after the initial recognition are recognized in Retained earnings within Equity.\n\n## 6.6 Fees to statutory auditors\n\n| DKK million                 | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Statutory audit             | 9      | 9      |\n| Other assurance engagements | -      | -      |\n| Tax assurance services      | 3      | 6      |\n| Other services              | 1      | 3      |\n| Fees to statutory auditors  | 13     | 18     |\n| Group audit fee ratio       | 0.4    | 1.0    |\n\n## Audit fee policy\n\nIt is Novozymes' policy that the annual fee for nonaudit services provided by the statutory auditors should not exceed the annual fee for statutory audit services measured at Group level. The Group audit fee ratio may only exceed 1 with the approval of the Audit Committee.\n\nNo such approvals were given in 2021 or 2020.\n\nImplementation of the EU audit reform has led to restrictions on the nonaudit services that the auditors elected at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting may perform, including a 70% CAP. The fee for nonaudit services performed for Novozymes by PricewaterhouseCoopers Statsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab is DKK 1 million (2020: DKK 3 million) and does not exceed the 70% CAP. The services comprise tax advisory services concerning transfer pricing, M&A support and other general financial reporting and tax consultancy.",

We take relevant measures to address climate impacts across our operations and value chain. Through the application of our solutions, we enable our customers and end users to reduce their CO 2 emissions.\n\n## Our approach\n\nOur ambitious climate commitment, Accelerate towards a climate-neutral society, was launched under our refreshed strategy as part of our commitments to a healthy planet, and it guides our approach to addressing climate change issues.\n\nNovozymes is committed to the Science-Based Targets Initiative and to our long-term goal of achieving net zero across operations and value chain by 2050, which was set in 2019. In light of recent scientific findings reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we are now accelerating our net zero journey and significantly raising our ambition on climate change. We have committed to a 50% reduction in absolute CO 2 emissions from our operations (scope 1 + 2) and supply chain (scope 3) by 2030 compared to a 2018 baseline, and to source 100% renewable electricity by 2030. To guide implementation, we have set internal annual targets.\n\nWe are also implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). For further information on our work on the TCFD, and on climate risks and opportunities please refer to the 'Governance' section of this report.\n\nWe conduct peer-reviewed cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) studies to document the environmental impact of our solutions. These studies are used to keep our stakeholders informed and to demonstrate to our customers ways to reduce their CO 2 emissions and leverage the positive impact on climate change that Novozymes' solutions can enable. Our published LCAs are available at our website.\n\nWe disclose our climate change impacts through CDP every year, and in 2021, Novozymes was rated \"A-\" (recognized in the leadership band for our strong climate action efforts and transparent disclosures).\n\n## 2021 highlights\n\nIn 2021, CO 2 emissions from our operations (scope 1 + 2) increased by 8% to 253,000 tonnes from 234,000 tonnes in 2020, mainly driven by higher sales, thus higher production activity. Despite this increase, we reduced our absolute emissions (scope 1+2) by 42% relative to our 2018 baseline, and we are on track to achieve our\n\n2022 mid-term target of reducing absolute CO 2 emissions from our operations by 40% by 2022 (relative to 2018). This reduction is driven by our\n\ncontinued focus on energy efficiency, changes to emission factors, and changes to our production processes.\n\n| CO2-equivalent emissions  1,000 tonnes                         | /two.tlf/zero.tlf/two.tlf/one.tlf   | /two.tlf/zero.tlf/two.tlf/zero.tlf   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Natural gas                                                    | /three.tlf/eight.tlf                | /three.tlf/three.tlf                 |\n| Gas oil, light fuel oil and diesel oil                         | /three.tlf                          | /four.tlf                            |\n| HCFCs                                                          | /two.tlf                            | -                                    |\n| Scope 1                                                        | /four.tlf/three.tlf                 | /three.tlf/seven.tlf                 |\n| District heat                                                  | /one.tlf                            | /two.tlf                             |\n| Electricity                                                    | /one.tlf/four.tlf/seven.tlf         | /one.tlf/four.tlf/eight.tlf          |\n| Steam                                                          | /six.tlf/two.tlf                    | /four.tlf/seven.tlf                  |\n| Scope 2 (market-based)                                         | /two.tlf/one.tlf/zero.tlf           | /one.tlf/nine.tlf/seven.tlf          |\n| Scope 1 and 2, total                                           | /two.tlf/five.tlf/three.tlf         | /two.tlf/three.tlf/four.tlf          |\n| Ship                                                           | /seven.tlf                          | /four.tlf                            |\n| Truck                                                          | /one.tlf/nine.tlf                   | /two.tlf/zero.tlf                    |\n| Air freight                                                    | /nine.tlf                           | /one.tlf/zero.tlf                    |\n| Scope 3                                                        | /three.tlf/five.tlf                 | /three.tlf/four.tlf                  |\n| Emissions, total                                               | /two.tlf/eight.tlf/eight.tlf        | /two.tlf/six.tlf/eight.tlf           |\n| Market-based vs. location-based scope 2 emissions 1,000 tonnes | /two.tlf/zero.tlf/two.tlf/one.tlf   | /two.tlf/zero.tlf/two.tlf/zero.tlf   |\n| Scope 2 CO2 emissions (market-based)                           | /two.tlf/one.tlf/zero.tlf           | /one.tlf/nine.tlf/seven.tlf          |\n| Scope 2 CO2 emissions (location-based)                         | /three.tlf/five.tlf/one.tlf*        | /four.tlf/four.tlf/five.tlf          |",

We requested the suppliers to provide carbon footprint or best available data for the products they deliver to Novozymes. Some of them were able to deliver product-specific greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) data, and many had targets to save energy and/or reduce GHG emissions in the coming decade.\n\nGoing forward, we will define how to further drive supply chain emission reductions. We will continue to focus on executing our renewed climate commitment by exploring renewable energy opportunities for all our sites, by investing in energy efficiency and energy recovery opportunities, and by engaging with our suppliers.\n\n## Five-year operational emissions (CO2-eqv.)\n\n1,000 tonnes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScope 1\n\nScope 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nReported CO 2 emissions comprise scope 1, scope 2 and emissions from outbound transport of products.\n\nCO2 from internally generated energy (scope 1) is calculated based on the amount of fuel consumed using local emission factors.\n\nCO 2 from externally generated energy (scope 2) is reported in accordance with both the marketbased and the location-based methods, as defined by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. The marked-based method assumes zero CO 2 emissions from the sourced renewable energy and uses CO 2 factors from International Energy Agency (IEA) for non-renewable energy. The location-based method uses CO 2 factors from IEA.\n\nTransport-related CO 2 emissions (scope 3) are calculated based on principles described in the GHG Protocol. Reported quantities comprise CO 2 emissions related to transport from all primary enzyme production sites to customers where Novozymes pays for the freight. Transport between production sites is also included. Transport of raw materials to a production site is not included. CO 2 emissions generated at external warehouses are not included. Emissions data are calculated based on distance and emission factors from the GHG Protocol.\n\nThe environmental impact potentials for global warming and ozone layer depletion are calculated on the basis of data published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Montreal Protocol published by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).",

Many of our biosolutions enable downstream users to save energy in certain applications compared with conventional methods, such as in laundry and dishwashing detergents and textile applications.\n\n## Our approach\n\nWe manage energy in our operations through a two-pronged approach: increasing the sourcing of renewable energy and reducing energy use in production by implementing optimization or\n\nenergy-saving projects. Relevant targets drive our performance in these areas.\n\nNovozymes' Operations, Supply and Quality function manages and monitors all energy efficiency and renewable energy-sourcing efforts. Through the RE100 initiative, we have committed to source 100% renewable electricity by 2030.\n\nIn addition to the internal energy savings, Novozymes pursues a strategy to recover energy that would otherwise go to waste and distribute it to local communities.\n\n| Energy consumption by primary source  1,000 GJ   | Energy consumption by primary source  1,000 GJ   | /two.tlf/zero.tlf/two.tlf/one.tlf        | /two.tlf/zero.tlf/two.tlf/zero.tlf     |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Natural gas                                      | Natural gas                                      | /seven.tlf/one.tlf/seven.tlf             | /six.tlf/four.tlf/four.tlf             |\n| Biogas                                           | Biogas                                           | /two.tlf/zero.tlf                        | /six.tlf/three.tlf                     |\n| Gas oil, light fuel oil and diesel oil           | Gas oil, light fuel oil and diesel oil           | /two.tlf/nine.tlf                        | /three.tlf/nine.tlf                    |\n| Internally generated energy, total               | Internally generated energy, total               | /seven.tlf/six.tlf/six.tlf               | /seven.tlf/four.tlf/six.tlf            |\n| Electricity - conventional                       | Electricity - conventional                       | /eight.tlf/six.tlf/one.tlf               | /eight.tlf/zero.tlf/six.tlf            |\n| Electricity - renewable                          | Electricity - renewable                          | /one.tlf,/eight.tlf/zero.tlf/zero.tlf    | /one.tlf,/seven.tlf/five.tlf/eight.tlf |\n| District heat - conventional                     | District heat - conventional                     | /seven.tlf/seven.tlf                     | /eight.tlf/nine.tlf                    |\n| District heat - renewable                        | District heat - renewable                        | /one.tlf/four.tlf/one.tlf                | /one.tlf/one.tlf/two.tlf               |\n| Steam                                            | Steam                                            | /one.tlf,/zero.tlf/five.tlf/four.tlf     | /nine.tlf/six.tlf/four.tlf             |\n| Externally purchased energy, total               | Externally purchased energy, total               | /three.tlf,/nine.tlf/three.tlf/three.tlf | /three.tlf,/seven.tlf/two.tlf/nine.tlf |\n| Energy consumption, total                        | ESG                                              | /four.tlf,/six.tlf/nine.tlf/nine.tlf     | /four.tlf,/four.tlf/seven.tlf/five.tlf |\n| Energy production from waste                     | Energy production from waste                     | /seven.tlf/six.tlf                       | /eight.tlf/nine.tlf                    |\n\n## 2021 highlights\n\nEnergy consumption increased by 224,000 GJ or 5% compared to 2020. This was driven by higher production volumes as sales grew organically by 6%.\n\nIn 2021, projects driving process optimization and energy efficiency undertaken at our sites throughout the year resulted in energy savings of 83,000 GJ. We had a new axial flow compressor installed at our Hongda site in China, which will produce energy savings of approximately 31,000 GJ per year. Another project implemented at our Kalundborg site, which required no CAPEX investments but only interventions in the way a compressor is run, resulted in energy savings of 14,000 GJ in 2021 (compared with the 2019 baseline year for this project).\n\nThe share of renewables in our total energy consumption decreased to 42% from 43% in\n\n2020, due to shifts in energy sources. Electricity is more than half of the total energy consumed, and 68% of the electricity came from renewable sources.\n\nWe have developed a new renewable electricity strategy with elevated focus on accelerating decarbonization of fossil-fuel-intensive grids. Through this, we are taking a further holistic approach towards the end-to-end sourcing process, ensuring high quality and impactful projects for our local communities. Moreover, new projects have been matured for several sites across Novozymes' global footprint, with a new agreement securing I-RECs to the Hongda manufacturing site, starting from 2022 onwards.\n\nGoing forward, in addition to further investing in renewable energy, we will continue to explore energy saving opportunities at all sites as well as energy efficiency and energy recovery initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Fuel consumption comprises all types of fuel used to produce electricity, heat and steam on site and converted to energy using factors supplied by utility providers or local authorities. Fuel for transportation is not included.\n\nExternally generated energy is the input to Novozymes of externally generated electricity, heat and steam.\n\nEnergy produced from waste or wastewater is renewable and corresponds to the total energy (heat, electricity or steam) produced by an internal or external utility provider. An example is energy produced from biomass waste or biogas.\n\nReported quantities are based on meter readings, with the exception of steam, which may be subject to calculation.\n\nThe renewable energy percentage is calculated by dividing renewable energy consumed by total energy consumption. Renewable energy used at Novozymes sites comprises energy generated from natural processes and continuously replenished. Sources include solar, wind and hydropower-based electricity and energy from biogas and biomass.\n\nDistrict heat - renewable is primarily generated from biomass.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We rely on agriculture-based raw materials that require freshwater for production and processing. Our product quality and safety is directly dependent on the quality of the freshwater we receive at our facilities. Additionally, the production of our solutions results in generation of wastewater.\n\nOur solutions enable our customers to reduce their water consumption, improve efficiency and wastewater quality by replacing chemicals. They also have the capabilities to provide improvements in the wastewater treatment industry by replacing hazardous chemicals.\n\n## Our approach\n\nAs part of our commitments to a healthy planet, our refreshed strategy re-emphasized our commitment to responsible water management and our ambitious target to manage water in balance with local conditions by 2030.\n\nWe are committed to ensure water is respected as a shared resource, while contributing to long-term water security. Therefore, we are developing contextual water management programs for all production sites by 2022 to help us further focus our efforts where we can make the maximum impact.\n\nIn our operations, we are focused on ensuring wastewater compliance and improving our operational efficiency to optimize water consumption, while addressing site-specific water-related challenges. Our wastewater is treated internally or externally in biological wastewater treatment systems before being discharged.\n\nExternally, we collaborate with organizations and communities for collective action to address water challenges in our surrounding communities such as depleting water quality, WASH (water, sanitization and hygiene) and watershed restoration.\n\nThe table provides a breakdown of total water consumed.\n\n| Water by primary source  1,000 m3   |     | /two.tlf/zero.tlf/two.tlf/one.tlf        | /two.tlf/zero.tlf/two.tlf/zero.tlf      |\n|-------------------------------------|-----|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Drinking water                      |     | /five.tlf,/nine.tlf/zero.tlf/six.tlf     | /five.tlf,/four.tlf/seven.tlf/three.tlf |\n| Industrial water                    |     | /two.tlf,/two.tlf/four.tlf/nine.tlf      | /two.tlf,/one.tlf/seven.tlf/seven.tlf   |\n| Steam                               |     | /three.tlf/eight.tlf/three.tlf           | /three.tlf/four.tlf/eight.tlf           |\n| Water consumption, total            | ESG | /eight.tlf,/five.tlf/three.tlf/eight.tlf | /seven.tlf,/nine.tlf/nine.tlf/eight.tlf |\n\nWe disclose our water security impacts through CDP every year.

Our biological solutions enable our customers to adopt more responsible use of resources. We are committed to minimizing waste from our operations, while utilizing precious resources in a circular manner.\n\n## Our approach\n\nAs part of our commitments to a healthy planet, our refreshed strategy re-emphasized our commitment to responsible waste management. By 2030, we aim to have zero waste from operations. To pave the way, by 2022 all production sites should have programs to reach zero waste by 2030.\n\nGuided by our aim to achieve zero waste, we have adopted a site-specific management approach. The localized approach allows us to manage the complex issue in alignment with local regulations and external service providers.\n\n## 2021 Highlights\n\nDespite increased business activities, the generated waste was on par with 2020.\n\nThe total recycling and composting rate of the waste was 98%, and only 2% was sent to landfill or incineration without energy recovery.\n\nA breakdown of the total waste generated at our production sites is provided in the figure below.\n\n## Total waste by disposal method 2021 (2020)\n\n- Used in agriculture 96.5% (93.5%)\n- Recycling 1.9% (1.5%)\n- Incineration with energy recovery 0.6% (0.0%)\n- Landfill and incineration without energy recovery 1.0% (5.0%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Biomass\n\nMost of the waste generated from the production of our solutions is biomass. The biomass generated from our operations has essential nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, making it ideal for supporting agricultural activities. We have set a target of achieving 100% circular management of our biomass by 2022.\n\nIn 2021, 99% of our biomass was managed in a circular manner, with utilization as a raw material in fertilizer production for agriculture with or without prior biogas production. We work with\n\nlocal farming communities to distribute biomass for utilization at farm level. In order to facilitate transportation and application, we adjust water content in biomass in accordance with local requirements. The biomass upon exit from our\n\nfacilities has a water content in the range of 5% to 85%. In 2021, the total dry matter content for biomass used in agriculture was 51 tonnes (2020: 47 tonnes), and for biomass sent to landfill it was 1 tonnes (2020: 10 tonnes).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Waste  1,000 tonnes       | /two.tlf/zero.tlf/two.tlf/one.tlf      | /two.tlf/zero.tlf/two.tlf/zero.tlf      |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Biomass                   |                                        |                                         |\n| Used in agriculture       | /four.tlf/six.tlf/three.tlf./five.tlf  | /four.tlf/four.tlf/eight.tlf./eight.tlf |\n| Landfill                  | /two.tlf./four.tlf                     | /one.tlf/six.tlf./two.tlf               |\n| Biomass, total            | /four.tlf/six.tlf/five.tlf./nine.tlf   | /four.tlf/six.tlf/five.tlf./zero.tlf    |\n| Nonhazardous waste        |                                        |                                         |\n| Incineration              | /two.tlf./one.tlf                      | /two.tlf./five.tlf                      |\n| Landfill                  | /two.tlf./two.tlf                      | /four.tlf./five.tlf                     |\n| Recycling (external)      | /six.tlf./five.tlf                     | /four.tlf./two.tlf                      |\n| Nonhazardous waste, total | /one.tlf/zero.tlf./eight.tlf           | /one.tlf/one.tlf./two.tlf               |\n| Hazardous waste           |                                        |                                         |\n| Incineration              | /one.tlf./one.tlf                      | /zero.tlf./eight.tlf                    |\n| Landfill                  | /zero.tlf./one.tlf                     | /zero.tlf./two.tlf                      |\n| Recycling (external)      | /zero.tlf./one.tlf                     | /zero.tlf./four.tlf                     |\n| Recycling (internal)      | /two.tlf./five.tlf                     | /two.tlf./seven.tlf                     |\n| Hazardous waste, total    | /three.tlf./eight.tlf                  | /four.tlf./one.tlf                      |\n| Waste, total              | /four.tlf/eight.tlf/zero.tlf./five.tlf | /four.tlf/eight.tlf/zero.tlf./three.tlf |",

In 2021, the recycling rate of non-biomass waste was 62% compared with 48% in 2020. The remaining 38% of the waste (5,500 tonnes) was sent to landfill or incineration.\n\nWe are working actively with local experts and service providers to explore site-specific opportunities for better waste management. In 2021, 10 of our 15 production sites had developed plans to reach zero waste by 2030.\n\nIn 2021, we undertook initiatives that have led to a reduction of our waste as well as an increase in recycling. These initiatives include process improvements, optimal utilization of resources and process planning, waste sorting to allow more recycling, etc.\n\n## Circular packaging\n\nWe are committed to minimizing the impact of the waste generated by our packaging materials by making our packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable. Therefore by 2022, we aim to have circular plans developed for all our key packaging materials. We are progressing as planned for the development of circular plans and are on track to fulfill our target for 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nBiomass is measured or calculated based on volume or weight produced.

Novozymes is committed to complying with all environmental regulations and maintaining high standards of environmental management in various aspects, including pollution prevention, resource conservation and waste reduction.\n\n## Our approach\n\nOur commitment to environmental compliance is outlined in our Sustainability Policy. All activities to ensure environmental compliance are anchored in the Quality, Environment & Safety function. Novozymes' production sites are certified to the ISO14001 Environmental Management Systems standard. Our Management System is based on this standard and applies to all our operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nBreaches of environmental regulatory limits are measured as the number of incidents in the reporting year considered not to be in conformity with environmental permits or requirements under environmental law.\n\nEnvironmental incidents and neighbor complaints are recorded in CAPTURE, our global incident management system. This system enables us to implement suitable remedial actions to correct and prevent their occurrence in the future. We strive to minimize the number of noncompliances and neighbor complaints.\n\n## 2021 highlights\n\nIn 2021, 13 environmental incidents were registered across our facilities, compared with 20 in 2020. Most of these were related to wastewater treatment. None of them have resulted in environmental fines. Plans for preventive action to avoid such incidents have been agreed with the relevant authorities.\n\nNovozymes received seven neighbor complaints in 2021, compared to 10 received in 2020.\n\nBreaches related to annual control measurements of spills reported in previous years are not included, as they are not indicative of performance during the reporting year.\n\nNeighbor complaints refers to the number of registered environmental complaints, primarily odor and noise related.\n\nNovozymes' products are based on technologies found in nature and our business is based on biotechnology. As a biotechnology leader developing solutions and applications for customers, we explore the available biodiversity of fungi, bacteria and enzymes and take samples from nature via a process called bioprospecting. The nature-based samples are assessed and optimized using biotechnological research and used to develop new biological solutions that help our customers improve their products and reduce their environmental footprint.\n\n## Our approach\n\nNovozymes' position paper on Biodiversity and Gene Editing captures the method in which we interact with biodiversity and how we contribute towards sustainable development. We are committed to sharing our knowledge about the potential of biology and industrial biotechnology with the public and other stakeholders outside of Novozymes.\n\nWe support a science-based regulatory framework for products involving gene editing, operating in compliance with legislation and following any guidance and requirements from regulatory authorities on biotech innovation\n\nclassification. We are committed to using scientifically-sound tools in a way that is safe to humans, animals and the environment.\n\nIn line with our approach to taking biological samples in nature, we ensure that local laws are followed, and safeguard the globally recognized principles on the utilization of genetic resources. We continuously discover new microbes that are valuable solutions for more environmentallyfriendly industrial processes. Novozymes' position paper on biodiversity articulates how we endorse, acknowledge and respect the principles of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity and the complementary Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefits Sharing. We have established systems and processes that ensure we comply with the relevant regulations, guidelines and international protocols.\n\n## 2021 Highlights\n\nWe continue to closely monitor the ongoing dialogue on nature and biodiversity loss. In 2021, we became a member of the Science Based Targets Network Corporate Engagement Program and are closely following the developments related to new methodologies for companies to manage their impacts and dependencies on nature.",

Many of our biological solutions serve as ingredients in consumer goods (e.g. in laundry detergents) or are used for manufacturing consumer products such as food, textiles, and livestock, and hence this is a material issue for us.\n\nNovozymes' ambition is to continue making our products safer for humans, animals and the environment. We seek to substitute hazardous substances in our operations with safer alternatives wherever feasible and constantly strive to reduce the risk of enzyme allergies and the risk involved in handling microorganisms.\n\n## Our approach\n\nProduct stewardship is an integral part of Novozymes' Quality Management System, and our approach is outlined in our Quality and Product Safety Policy. Procedures ensuring product stewardship for customers and end-users are enforced globally and audited by an independent external body - Bureau Veritas. We collaborate with our customers, suppliers, and various trade associations to drive product safety and stewardship.\n\nNovozymes has set internal targets on product stewardship that guide our progress. We measure performance particularly in the areas of product safety and hazardous substance management.\n\nThrough a rigorous and comprehensive crossfunctional process, new and existing chemicals are screened annually for environmental, health and safety impacts, followed by risk and feasibility assessments to determine candidates for potential phase-out.\n\nNovozymes has a clear position and a structured approach to related topics such as product information and labeling, traceability, industrial biotechnology, REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals), FIAP (Food Improvement Agents Package) and animal testing. Novozymes is a leading REACH registrant and remains firmly committed to maintaining high-quality dossiers that document product safety and provide transparency.\n\n## 2021 highlights\n\nREACH-like legislation has now been implemented in the U.K., Turkey, and Korea where registration dossiers must be submitted in collaboration with other registrants. In these countries, in 2021, Novozymes arranged a 'REACH Only Representative' service for our customers, which will ensure customer compliance with these regulations and a continued supply of products into these markets.\n\nIn 2021, within our annual process cycle to explore the potential phase-out and substitution of hazardous substances and materials, we identified three hazardous chemicals, one of\n\nwhich was phased out and a new, safer formulation of the material was adopted. In this process, we also reinforced the relevance of our work towards reducing or even removing hazardous preservatives from our enzyme products. This work is not straightforward, as enzymes are readily biodegradable and hence often require preservatives. It also meets the society's concern and wish for 'preservative free' products.\n\nNovozymes North America was recognized as an outstanding Safer Choice Innovator by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2021, recognizing our commitment to produce safe solution.\n\nNovozymes is also accelerating the implementation of titanium dioxide-free enzyme products for laundry detergents and collaborating with our customers for further phase-out.\n\nGoing forward, we will continue to prioritize product stewardship practices at Novozymes. We will begin to implement a state-of-the-art Regulatory Information Management (RIM) system, which will provide a strong foundation for our product stewardship commitment. This flagship project will increase the capacity, efficiency, and quality of our core regulatory processes, such as dossier compilation and submissions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The rate af absence is calculated as the number of registered days of absence as a percentage of the total number of normal working days in one year, less vacation and public holidays.\n\nThe rate of employee turnover is calculated as employee turnover divided by the average number of permanent employees. Employee turnover is measured as the number of permanent employees leaving the Group during the preceding year (excluding employees at divested entities transferred to the acquiring company.\n\nappropriate measures to mitigate the identified risks and gaps. In 2022, we will perform the assessment for the Asia Pacific region.\n\nNovozymes believes that respectful, professional conduct furthers Novozymes' mission and is fundamental to a good workplace. In 2021, we conducted company-wide global training for all employees on non-discrimination and antiharassment.\n\nAverage age and seniority are calculated as the sum of employees' total age/seniority in whole years at the reporting date, divided by the number of employees.\n\nExpatriation refers to Novozymes employees temporary reassigned within Novozymes from the country of original employment for periods of more than six months.",

Nurturing an inclusive and diverse organization where Zymers thrive is the foundation from which we can continue to bring the power of biotech to the world.\n\n## Our approach\n\nWe are committed to nurture a culture of inclusion and belonging, where Zymers can be themselves. We recognize that focusing on diversity of representation alone is not enough. For diverse teams to succeed, people need to feel that they are valued and have a sense of shared purpose, and therefore we focus on inclusion.\n\nAt Novozymes, we have a policy for diversity and equal opportunities, which covers the entire workforce. To improve diversity, we monitor and implement measures across all layers of management. Our People and Organization function, together with leaders across Novozymes, is responsible for ensuring equal rights and for promoting Diversity & Inclusion (D&I).\n\nIn 2021, as part of our refreshed strategy update, we set ambitious targets to nurture a diverse, inclusive, engaging and thriving working environment. Specifically, we aim to achieve gender balance across all professionals and in senior leadership by 2030. This means that, as a minimum, we will have 45% women and 45% men across all professionals and in senior leadership.\n\nNovozymes is taking a regional approach to developing and defining representation programs based on local demographics, to address diversity dimensions beyond gender. We have a target to achieve a score of 86 on our Nurture Diversity Index by 2022.\n\n## 2021 highlights\n\nIn 2021, we made progress to ensure gender diversity. The number of women in senior management, management and professional levels increased compared to 2020. Furthermore, we achieved 85 on our Nurture Diversity Index, and we are on track to achieve our 2022 target.\n\nIn 2021, we engaged in various forums to learn about and promote D&I. On the International Women's Day, Novozymes' CEO, Ester Baiget, participated in the sixth UN Women Gender Diversity Roundtable on the theme of driving diversity and inclusion. During the United Nations' General Assembly Summit, Novozymes featured on a virtual panel discussing D&I that was hosted by Business Fights Poverty. This panel featured Novozymes' CEO and four Novozymes' regional employee representatives. They shared local insights on how sustainability-driven corporations can bring out the best in their workforce by applying D&I principles.\n\nFurthermore, we engaged in different projects and initiatives to ensure a diverse workforce at Novozymes. We provided unconscious bias training material in recruitment to hiring managers with\n\ninformation on how to strengthen diversity in recruitment with a focus on bias, and addressing screening, interviewing, and evaluating candidates.\n\nThis year, WorldPride was hosted in Copenhagen. To show our support for the cause and symbolize our commitment to human rights, equity, diversity, and inclusion, we raised the pride flag at our Danish sites and 17 Zymers volunteered at the events.\n\nIn North America, we created a Regional Touch Value \"Choose to Include\" and launched three Zymer Resource Groups (ZRG) to promote D&I:\n\nLGBTQ+, African American Culture and Alliance Empowering Women. ZRG's are voluntary, employee-led and aim to encourage opportunities for professional and personal development. In India, we launched a Zym(H)ers club, a female ZRG, and we have entered in a partnership with JobsForHer, a portal that champions an alternate workforce for women who want to re-enter the workforce after a career break.\n\nTo monitor compliance to our diversity and equal opportunity policy, we continously track the impact of our initiatives, e.g. gender diversity of new hires and internal transfers.\n\n| Gender diversity             |    | /two.tlf/zero.tlf/two.tlf/one.tlf   | /two.tlf/zero.tlf/two.tlf/zero.tlf   |\n|------------------------------|----|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Women in senior management   | %  | /three.tlf/four.tlf                 | /three.tlf/three.tlf                 |\n| Women in management          | %  | /three.tlf/nine.tlf                 | /three.tlf/seven.tlf                 |\n| Women at professional levels | %  | /four.tlf/four.tlf                  | /four.tlf/one.tlf                    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nWomen in senior management measures the percentage of women in director positions or higher (i.e. director, vice president or executive vice president).\n\nWomen in management measures the percentage of women in middle management and specialist positions.\n\nWomen in professional levels measures the percentage of women in positions typically requiring an academic background and team leaders.\n\nNurture Diversity index measures the ratio of women and international employees at both Senior management and Management level. If women and international employees were represented at the same ratio in all management layers as in the academic population (\"professionals\")  in Novozymes as such, the index would be 100.",

Our strong safety culture provides the foundation. We want all Zymers to have a good work/life balance, so they have the energy to bring out their best, at home with their loved ones as well as at work.\n\n## Our approach\n\nWe are committed to helping our employees thrive across various stages of their work life whether it is staying safe, healthy and stress free or learning new skills to advance in their careers.\n\nIn 2021, as part of our refreshed strategy, we reinforced our commitment to create a workplace where Zymers can stay safe, thrive, and grow. To support our safety and wellbeing culture, we have our global People Policy and global Health and Safety Policy, along with internal standards and procedures.\n\nOur Health & Safety strategy aims to ensure that robust safety processes, equipment, standards, tools, and training form an integral part of the way we work, both at global and local level.\n\nWe monitor our performance and work to ensure continuous improvement through benchmarking of both internal and external key performance indicators. Novozymes' Quality, Environment and Safety function is responsible for supporting the organization in ensuring a safe and healthy working environment.\n\nInjury prevention is key to our strategy. Our global incident handling system CAPTURE provides us insights to continuously work smarter, and implement targeted and theme-based safety initiatives. Our preventive program for enzyme safety continues to work effectively. Our learnings enable us to further improve the enzyme safety program Zero Enzyme Allergy and our biological safety program Zero Biological Reactions for the benefit of employees and customers.\n\nWe have global and regional cross-functional wellbeing groups to bring solutions that address local health and wellbeing challenges. It is the responsibility of each manager to focus on Zymers' continuous learning and development, supported by our People & Organization function.\n\nOur employee survey is an important tool that enables us to track the organizational mood and have better and more relevant team talks focusing on how we work together at Novozymes. This is critical for ensuring our success as a business and for sustaining our reputation as a great place to work.\n\n## 2021 highlights\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to pose challenges to Novozymes around the world. We are addressing the different local challenges to keep our employees safe and our production running. Teams have handled changes related to COVID-19 well, achieving a score of 91 out of 100 in our employee survey.\n\nIn 2021, in our employee survey, we achieved a score of 82 points on our Zymer spirit index (81 in 2020), on track to achieve our target of 81 by 2022.\n\n## Safety\n\nIn 2021, we launched a mandatory safety e-learning module for all employees, which focused on safety challenges across Novozymes. We implemented a medical application in CAPTURE which allows EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliant management of all medical cases.\n\nIn 2021, the lost-time injury frequency was 1.5 while the three-year rolling average (2019-2021) of lost-time injury frequency rate was 1.2, which means we are on track to meet our target <1.5 in 2022.\n\n## Wellbeing\n\nIn 2021, we launched a Wellbeing portal, where employees can access a variety of materials, tools, training, and information addressing general wellbeing, including a stress prevention toolbox. With working from home on the increase, we have continued to focus on mental wellbeing activities such as BrainSpace, which aim to help and inspire our leaders and employees.\n\n| Consequences of occupational injuries No.   | /two.tlf/zero.tlf/two.tlf/one.tlf   | /two.tlf/zero.tlf/two.tlf/zero.tlf   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Return to original job                      | /one.tlf/six.tlf                    | /one.tlf/three.tlf                   |\n| Return to a different job                   | -                                   | -                                    |\n| Out of work or early retirement             | -                                   | -                                    |\n| Case pending                                | /one.tlf                            | /one.tlf                             |\n| Occupational injuries with absence, total   | /one.tlf/seven.tlf                  | /one.tlf/four.tlf                    |\n\n| Occupational injuries                        |                            | /two.tlf/zero.tlf/two.tlf/one.tlf   | /two.tlf/zero.tlf/two.tlf/zero.tlf   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Days of absence due to occupational injuries | No.                        | /four.tlf/one.tlf/four.tlf          | /five.tlf/five.tlf/one.tlf           |\n| Frequency of occupational injuries           | Per million  working hours | /one.tlf./five.tlf                  | /one.tlf./three.tlf                  |",

We promote a strong compliance culture and take relevant measures to ensure compliance to the highest standards across all material environmental, social, governance and financial related issues.\n\nWe have a Corporate Business Integrity Committee responsible for the oversight of business integrity matters across Novozymes. Members of the committee include executive and senior management representatives from both business and compliance functions. They meet on a regular basis to make strategic decisions and prioritizations and to follow up on the state of business integrity compliance and relevant initiatives.\n\nNovozymes works proactively to prevent, detect and respond to fraud, corruption and other violations of the business integrity principles. Novozymes has seven business integrity principles, which lay the ground rules for engaging with third parties and apply to all employees across the world. The business integrity principles underline Novozymes' zero tolerance approach to bribery and define clear rules for gifts and hospitality. They act as Novozymes' code of conduct in business integrity matters and form the basis of our efforts to eliminate all forms of corruption. All employees have access to relevant guidance on business integrity and are encouraged to raise any concerns through the relevant grievance channels.\n\nNovozymes provides annual compliance training in business integrity and competition law, which is mandatory for employees in scope. It is based on questions raised during the year and includes real-life studies to ensure relevance and applicability.\n\nNovozymes has a global corporate whistleblower system which allows employees and external\n\npartners to report any concerns on illegal or unethical misconduct or other violations of Novozymes' business integrity principles. The whistleblower system is supplemented by various internal reporting channels and screening activities. All allegations of fraud, corruption and other business integrity violations are thoroughly investigated. Substantiated violations lead to proportionate disciplinary sanctions for the parties involved.\n\nNovozymes has an ethical and responsible approach to the data we handle. We respect data privacy rights and the integrity and confidentiality of personal data and ensure ethical management of data in the Novozymes Group as a supplement to our general commitment to integrity and compliance.\n\nNovozymes' responsibility for ensuring ethical business practices also extends to our business partners. Our third-party due diligence processes seek to ensure that our commercial partners conduct business with integrity and share our values regarding legal compliance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The competition law compliance training in 2021 served as a general reminder of do's and don'ts and had a focus on competition law aspects associated with the application of specific contractual tools.\n\nAs in previous years, Novozymes had no violations of competition law in 2021. The number of potential fraud and corruption cases investigated increased in 2021 due to the continued development of digital tools for proactive identification of potential cases.

There was no material business or financial impact of the substantiated cases.\n\nIn 2021, Novozymes adopted a data ethics policy covering personal data and other categories of data, and implemented a governance supportive hereof, as a supplement to the policies and procedures already in place to ensure compliance with rules regarding data protection and privacy.\n\nThe number of reports in Novozymes' whistleblower system remains fairly low, reflecting inter alia that employees use other internal grievance channels. Promotional initatives are planned for 2022 to ensure general awareness of the whistleblower system. Novozymes' Audit Committee reviews quarterly information on all whistleblower reportings and channels and consequences for fraud and\n\nother tip-offs on potential fraud and corruption. The charts provide further details of the reporting corruption cases.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nCompletion of business integrity training refers to the percentage of employees in scope who have undergone business integrity training in the last training period. New entities are included within six months of acquisition. Business integrity training is conducted for employees who can potentially influence third-party interactions or decisions as part of their job role. This comprises employees in professional, managerial or administrative positions.\n\nThe reporting criteria for a competition law violation is whether it has been established by an authority, which is a member of the International Competition Network or by a competent court anywhere in the world that a company in the Novozymes Group has violated applicable anti-trust regulations.\n\nNovozymes defines fraud and corruption as a deliberate misconduct with the intent to gain a direct or indirect personal advantage.",

Therefore, customer engagement and partnerships is material for our business. We seek to continue being a trusted business partner that delivers reliable products and innovative solutions.\n\n## Our approach\n\nCustomer co-creation and commercial leadership are some of the main drivers behind our strategy Unlocking growth - powered by biotech. To meet increasing customer needs, Novozymes proactively engages with customers in different ways.\n\nWe co-create with our customers to find new solutions and applications to help improve their products and processes. Our Technical Service and Customer Co-creation teams have a deep understanding of our customers' needs. They optimize product use by making the necessary adjustments, tailored to the needs of individual customers. Lastly, we engage strategically with customers across various industries to jointly develop sustainable biological solutions.\n\nWe constantly seek new ways to connect with our customers. We aim to bring value in a more flexible manner through online services and tools designed to be easy to use, inspirational and available whenever our customers need them.\n\nThroughout the year, we respond to several information requests from customers in areas such as governance, strategy, sourcing practices, safety, quality and sustainability. We provide information on products, services and corporate policies, commitments, targets, and initiatives in a transparent manner.\n\nWe believe that getting feedback from our customers is crucial in determining our performance. It assists us in gauging customer expectations and driving improvements to our products and service offerings.\n\n## 2021 Highlights\n\nWe are on a journey to accelerate our digital offering to customers. This includes transparency on our product offerings and easy access to sample and buy products, and digital collaboration on technical services. In 2021, half of our sales opportunities were generated digitally, and we launched a new portal for technical collaboration to meet customer needs for trials collaboration, product documentation, and trouble shooting. We will expand the collaboration portal to the majority of customers in 2022.\n\nIn 2021, we also launched Front Sight\u00ae, a digital solution for our bioenergy customers which combines real-time data and analytics with state-of-the-art instrumentation and automation; reducing variability, maximizing conversion, and\n\nresulting in more consistent liquefaction for every batch.\n\nWe continue to partner with our customers to jointly develop and deliver better biological solutions.  As one example, in 2021, Novozymes expanded its partnership in homecare & industrial cleaning as well as the food & beverage markets (U.S, Canada and Latin America), with Univar Solutions Inc., a leading global specialty chemical and ingredient distributor. Together we will deliver biological solutions to address demand for eco-friendly products that minimize the use of resources while optimizing performance in homecare & industrial cleaning, and growing health consciousness and reducing chemical raw materials in food & beverages.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe Net Promoter Score (NPS) is derived from an annual questionnaire measuring on a scale from 1-10 how likely the customer is to recommend Novozymes to others. The NPS is calculated as the share of promoters (rating us 9 or 10) less the share of detractors (rating us 1-6). The resulting score is a value between -100 and +100.\n\nThe Customer Satisfaction Survey resulted in a Net Promotor Score ('NPS') of 69 in 2021. The score shows that our customers value our long-term relationship, close collaboration, products, and strong technical services. It also demonstrates how Novozymes' teams responded incredibly well despite operating in a challenging environment following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs part of our refreshed strategy, Novozymes will make further investments to staff and operate new Customer Co-creation Centers in key markets, allowing for deeper engagement with customers to better understand their world and help create products that will delight consumers. Particular focus will be on the food and health space.\n\nThe criteria for selection of customers to include in the Customer Satisfaction survey has been changed in 2021. Therefore result is not comparable to the surveys performed in previous years.",

We inspire each other to make change happen in order to deliver on our promise of better lives in a growing world, both inside and outside the workplace.\n\n## Our approach\n\nAs part of our refreshed strategy, we set ambitious targets to nurture an inclusive and thriving working environment that 'Inspire' the world.  As part of 'Inspire', Zymers are empowered to drive outreach initiatives they are passionate about, such as nature. All regions have 'Inspire' groups coordinating the local agenda in alignment with the regional leadership teams. 'Inspire' has three key areas: pledge 1% of our time to community outreach, help educate the next generation and enable employees to live more sustainably.\n\n## 2021 highlights\n\nPledge 1% of our time to community outreach We continued supporting our communities disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We funded two community oxygen centers in India and we donated 500 oximeters to the Health Department of Paran\u00e1, Brazil, and masks and hand sanitizer to schools and hospitals in North America.\n\nOur Zymers joined forces and helped raise funds to support UNICEF, through COVAX, to deliver COVID-19 vaccines to low- and middle-income\n\ncountries. The campaign was conducted together with the Novo group companies, including Novo Nordisk Foundation, Novo Holdings and Novo Nordisk. In total we raised DKK 23 million enough to fully vaccinate 800,000 people.\n\nSince 2020, the Novozymes Water Opulence (NOWO) project in India has been working towards strengthening the water supply and systems in villages situated around our Patalganga site. In 2021, the NOWO project received a Special Jury Mention in the WASH (Small) category of the 7th CSR Impact Award, organized by CSR Box and Dalmia Bharat Foundation and a Bronze award in the 'Water Conservation and Management' category of the CSR Times Award 2021.\n\nIn North America, our TrashWalking Campaign mobilized employees to clean up trash and beautify our local neighborhoods while also supporting charities. We cleaned the beach of Chongming Island in Shanghai and Makuhari Beach in Japan. Zymers in Turkey and Switzerland also organized activities supporting local biodiversity.\n\n## Help educate the next generation\n\nAll over the world, our employees continued to engage with local university students to share our knowledge on biotechnology and creating better lives via webinars, lectures and case competitions. For example, 81 people joined a webinar with Novozymes experts on industrial\n\nenzymes, organized for students at Taylor's University in Malaysia.\n\nOur Zymers inspired the next generation of Sustainability Professionals by mentoring social innovators in different countries towards finding solutions to sustainable development challenges and create tangible impact to local communities via UNLEASH's Hackathons and Sustania's Arctic Opportunity Explorer 2.0.\n\nIn Denmark, for the 7th year in a row, we hosted 'Girls' Day in Science' and invited 50 girls from the 8th and 9th grades to interact with our female scientists. In the United States, we hosted two public school teachers through the Kenan Fellow for three-week biomanufacturing internships; and we funded a mobile science Innovation Lab with Franklin County United Way for kids in Franklin County Schools.\n\nEnable employees to live more sustainably On Earth Overshoot Day, Zymers around the world made personal pledges to change some of their habits to reduce their environmental footprint, such as eating less meat.\n\nIn Brazil, employees got together monthly to learn about the implementation of SDGs at the professional and personal level. In APAC & MEA, as part of the 'Waste Not, Want Not' campaign, our employees participated in activities to address food waste at home, in the office, and in their communities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## COVID-19\n\nOur Zymers joined forces and helped raise funds to support UNICEF, through COVAX, to deliver COVID-19 vaccines to low- and middle-income countries.",

Agricultural raw materials are a major component of our production processes and a responsible and secure supply of them is crucial to Novozymes' production.\n\n## Our approach\n\nNovozymes' sourcing department drives our supplier management and responsible sourcing program, anchored within Novozymes Operations, Supply and Quality function. Our approach to responsible sourcing is defined by our Responsible Purchasing Standards (RPS) and managed through our Supplier Performance Management (SPM) process and the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (SEDEX) platform.\n\nThrough the SPM process, Novozymes screens suppliers and classifies their risk based on spend, country and category. In case a supplier does not meet our assessment criteria, either an action plan is established, or an alternate supplier is identified. Novozymes uses the SEDEX collaboration platform to engage with suppliers and manage sustainability risks in our supply chain.\n\nNovozymes requires all contracted suppliers to comply with our RPS, as well as, when requested, to complete questionnaires and to accept visits and audits relevant for confirmation of\n\ncompliance with the standards. These standards cover various ESG criteria including respect for human and labor rights, business ethics, employee health and safety and environmental stewardship. All our suppliers of directly sourced agricultural raw materials are required to adhere to our deforestation requirements by not contributing to further deforestation and to have zero tolerance for land grabbing.\n\nResponsible sourcing is a key driver of Novozymes' journey towards becoming carbon neutral, and we continue to focus on our commitment of securing 100% renewable electricity by 2030 as well as reducing our Scope 3 CO 2 emissions together with suppliers.\n\n## 2021 highlights\n\nNovozymes continued to expand the use of the SEDEX platform to enhance the transparency of our supply chain. In 2021, we continued to onboard both high-risk and high-spend suppliers, identified by the results of the hotspot analysis conducted the previous year, for all categories of direct sourcing of raw materials across different regions. This year, we conducted a similar hotspot analysis with a regional focus on all categories of indirect sourcing. The results will serve as input to future responsible sourcing strategies.\n\nDuring 2021, to advance towards sourcing 100% renewable electricity by 2030, we focused on progressing on the existing renewable opportunities and on identifying further\n\nlong-term solutions. These initiatives require years of preparation. In 2021, 68% of the total electricity consumption came from renewable sources, and are well on track to meet our target for 2030.\n\nDuring 2021, we also engaged with our key suppliers regarding supply chain emission reductions.\n\nAs a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), 100% of the palm oil we sourced in 2021 was RSPO-certified.\n\nSpecifically in Denmark, we have undertaken various responsible sourcing efforts that include having a centrally managed return process for all plastic bottles used for cleaning and using doormats made from recycled materials such as fish nets. In internal logistics, we have ensured that majority of the fleet used is green by replacing diesel vans with electric vans and bicycles.\n\nFurthermore, we also completed a Human Rights & Impact assessment of our operations and supplier base in China. Read more about these assessments in Note 8.1 Labor Practices & Human Rights.",

We did not identify any material misstatement in Management's Review.\n\n## Management's responsibilities for the Financial Statements and the Environmental, Social and Governance Data\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act and for the preparation of parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nFurthermore, Management is responsible for preparing the Environmental, Social and Governance Data in accordance with the accounting policies for the Environmental, Social and Governance Data, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Environmental, Social and Governance Data that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the Financial Statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements and the Environmental, Social and Governance Data\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements and the Environmental, Social and Governance Data as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements and the Environmental, Social and Governance Data.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements and the Environmental, Social and Governance Data, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is\n\nhigher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\n- \u00b7   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the Group's and the Parent Company's internal control.\n- \u00b7   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.\n- \u00b7   Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Parent Company to cease to continue as a going concern.",

The nature, timing and extent of procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material departures from the requirements set out in the ESEF Regulation, whether due to fraud or error. The procedures include:\n\n- \u00b7   Testing whether the annual report is prepared in XHTML format;\n- \u00b7   Obtaining an understanding of the company's iXBRL tagging process and of internal control over the tagging process;\n- \u00b7   Evaluating the completeness of the iXBRL tagging of the Consolidated Financial Statements;\n- \u00b7   Evaluating the appropriateness of the company's use of iXBRL elements selected from the ESEF taxonomy and the creation of extension elements where no suitable element in the ESEF taxonomy has been identified;\n\n- \u00b7   Evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements to elements in the ESEF taxonomy; and\n- \u00b7   Reconciling the iXBRL tagged data with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn our opinion, the annual report of Novozymes A/S for the financial year January 1 to December 31, 2021 with the file name NOVOZYMES-2021-12-31.zip is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the ESEF Regulation.\n\nHellerup, February 1, 2022\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers\n\nStatsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab CVR No 3377 1231\n\n## Lars Baungaard\n\nState Authorized Public Accountant mne23331\n\n## Michael Groth Hansen\n\nState Authorized Public Accountant mne33228",

For a description of the Group's accounting policies, please refer to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nNo separate statement of cash flows has been prepared for Novozymes A/S; please refer to the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n## Recognition and measurement in general\n\nIncome is recognized in the income statement as earned.\n\nAll costs incurred in generating the year's revenue are also recognized in the income statement, including depreciation, amortization and impairment losses.\n\nValue adjustments of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or amortized cost are also recognized in the income statement.\n\nAssets are recognized in the balance sheet when it is considered probable that future economic benefits will flow to the company and the value of the asset can be measured reliably. Liabilities are recognized in the balance sheet when they are\n\nconsidered probable and can be measured reliably. At initial recognition, assets and liabilities are measured at cost. Assets and liabilities are subsequently measured as described below for each item.\n\nThe recognition and measurement principles take due account of predictable losses and risks occurring prior to the presentation of financial statements that confirm or refute the conditions prevailing at the reporting date.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nThe accounting policies for intangible fixed assets follow those of the Group with the exception of goodwill, which is amortized over a period of 10 years using the straight-line method.\n\nAn amount equal to the total capitalized development costs after tax is recognized under Equity in Reserve for development costs.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries and investments in associates are recognized initially at cost and subsequently measured using the equity method. The company's share of the equity of subsidiaries, based on the fair value of the identifiable net assets at the acquisition date, less or plus unrealized intercompany profits or losses, with the addition of any residual value of goodwill, is recognized under Investments in subsidiaries and Investments in associates respectively in the balance sheet. If the equity of subsidiaries or\n\nassociates is negative and Novozymes A/S has a legal or constructive obligation to cover the company's negative equity, a provision is recognized.\n\nNet revaluation of investments in subsidiaries and associates is recognized under Equity in the Revaluation reserve according to the equity method. The reserve is reduced by payments of dividends to the parent company and adjusted to reflect other changes in the equity of subsidiaries.\n\nThe proportionate share of the net profits of subsidiaries less goodwill amortization is recognized under Income from investments in subsidiaries in the income statement. Goodwill in subsidiaries is amortized over a period of 10 years using the straight-line method.\n\nShare purchase liabilities are obligations to invest in subsidiaries and are disclosed as a contractual obligation. The derivative embedded in the share purchase obligation is measured at fair value through the income statement.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe dividend proposed for the financial year is shown as a separate item under Equity.\n\n## Treasury stock\n\nTreasury stock is used to reduce the common stock and to hedge employees' exercise of granted stock awards and stock options.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Forward-looking statements are associated with words such as, but not limited to, 'believe,' 'anticipate,' 'expect,' 'estimate,' 'intend,' 'plan,' 'project,' 'could,' 'may,' 'might' and other words with a similar meaning\n\nForward-looking statements are by their very nature associated with risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations, both positively and negatively. These risks and uncertainties may include unexpected developments in i) the ability to develop and market new products; ii) the demand for Novozymes' products, marketdriven price decreases, industry consolidation, and launches of\n\ncompeting products or disruptive technologies in Novozymes' core areas; iii) the ability to protect and enforce the company's intellectual property rights; iv) significant litigation or breaches of contract; v) the materialization of the company's growth platforms, notably the opportunity for marketing biomass conversion technologies or the development of microbial solutions for broad-acre crops; vi) political conditions, such as acceptance of enzymes produced by genetically modified organisms; vii) global economic and capital market conditions, including, but not limited to, currency exchange rates (USD/DKK and EUR/DKK in particular, but not exclusively), interest rates and inflation; and viii) significant price decreases for inputs and materials that compete with Novozymes' biological solutions. The company undertakes no duty to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of future developments or new information.",
