We  report  on  the  main  achievements aligned with the strategy and the goals to be met. We present the Global Reporting Initiative  (GRI)  content  index,  the  economic,  environmental,  and  social  indicators that contribute to the compilation of a sustainability report. We also report on the Sustainable  Accounting  Standards  Board  (SASB)  indicator  index  to  estimate structured reporting of these indicators in this first year, in the final segment.\n\nThis document has been prepared per the Core option of the GRI Standards. We are committed  to  working  under  this  methodology  to  deliver  a  report  on  our administration  that  is  increasingly  tailored  to  the  different  stakeholders  and  to continue learning. This report was verified by a third party who reviewed its content adaptation to the Global Reporting Initiative's Sustainability Reporting Standard (GRI Standard).\n\nLikewise, we account for the commitment we have to sustainability through the work done by the volunteer management of the 10 UNGC Principles, the contribution to the fulfillment of the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals), the commitments of the Paris Agreement, and participation in benchmark frameworks such as the DJSI, Equator  Principles,  United  Nations  Environmental  Program  -  Financial  Initiative (UNEP FI), Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI),  Principles  for  Responsible  Banking,  UN  Women,  Partnership  for  Carbon Accounting  Financials  (PCAF),  Net  Zero  Banking  Alliance  (NZBA),  Task  Force  on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), and the Global Investors for Sustainable Development (GISD) Alliance, among others.",

We want our shareholders to share the excellent benefits their investments  have  on  the  country,  in  economic  terms, when  they  are  asked  why  they  are  Bancolombia's shareholders.

A  company  that  contributes  COP  1.62 trillion in taxes to the country.\n\nThere are millions of people and companies that have trusted  Bancolombia.  We  have  created  30,000  direct jobs  and  more  than  15,000  indirect  jobs  in  Colombia and  Central  America.  Today,  we  can  say  that  we generate quality  of  life  for  people  with  these  figures. We  create  development  and  inclusion  opportunities. We  build  a  solid  organization  model  as  an  employer brand.\n\nIn 2021, we made our commitment to make well-being for all a reality. Our  22,000  suppliers, 28,000 correspondents  banks,  and  25  million  customers counted  on  their  bank  as  their  main  ally  to  ensure employment,  access  to  credit,  and  leverage  the recovery.  We  offered  everyone  financial  services  and comprehensive solutions for their day-to-day needs.\n\nWe were working with haste on the future vision while accompanying  those  who  needed  it  most  on  this journey.  A  digital  future  in  which  mobile  banking  is critical for people and having a payments ecosystem is fundamental for business growth.\n\nProof of the digital future we build is each of the 6.5 million People App users. There was a 32% increase in the number of transactions in 2021.\n\nAlmost 6 million Colombians opened their first account through our 'A La Mano' product. From their cellphones and at no cost, they can make transfers to receive their salary, pay bills, and add funds to their transport card.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, we welcomed two million customers.\n\nMore  than  10  million  Nequi  customers,  a  digital banking service we developed six years ago, can send money for free anywhere in the country, pay physically or digitally, have a savings plan, and withdraw cash from ATMs.\n\nWe are the bank of the people and the companies. We generate  new  possibilities  to  receive  payments  and increase  sales.  Some  of  these  are  Wompi,  Bot\u00f3n Bancolombia, and QR codes, which are already available in all Colombian  municipalities  and  have  grown significantly in Central America.\n\nWe  are  the  ally  of  companies  and  governments  that need  our  expert  advice  in  investment  banking,  trust, stocks, and treasury to implement large mega-projects that are key to the country's competitiveness. We have accompanied  the  development  of  21  4G  road concessions, representing works for COP 43.5 trillion. Last year, we announced our participation in the first 5G road APP in the country in Valle.\n\nWe are on track. Bancolombia has a presence in 99% of Colombian municipalities and still has work to do. As Colombians' leading bank, we boldly and promptly lead to building the foundations for growth and employment.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We invested  resources  in  health  and  education.  We supported  the  government  in  its  efforts  to  leverage housing  construction  and  sales.  We  transformed  our business to meet the needs of a new era.\n\nUndoubtedly, credit was one of the key instruments for economic  reactivation.  Last  year  alone,  we  disbursed COP  87.1  trillion,  equivalent  to  50.3%  of  the  taxes collected by the country's Directorate of National Taxes and  Customs  (DIAN).  These  resources  reached  all corners of the economy. They represented an answer for someone,  covering  the  needs  of  individuals  in  their different stages of life, for entrepreneurs or contingent workers  who  needed  capital  to  boost  their  business, including  all  size  companies  that  could  leverage projects relevant to countries' growth.\n\nBancolombia has a presence in 99% of Colombian municipalities and still has work to do.\n\nAlmost a million people accessed loans from Bancolombia for their consumption needs and individual  and  family  projects.  More  so,  these  loans helped 278,000 people to purchase homes. Moreover, this was the first formal credit for many people. Before, they resorted to schemes such as loan sharking \"gota a gota.'  We  allocated  more  than  COP  6  trillion  to initiatives led by women. We are convinced that women have  a  multiplier  effect  on  the  economy  and  can generate well-being for families.\n\nCredit  was  one  of  the  instruments  to  boost  business activity.  157,514  independent  workers,  38,500  SMEs, 3,500 companies, and 1,760 corporate received disbursements  of  COP  63.5  trillion.  These  resources were  used  in  working  capital  and  projects  that strengthen the productive fabric of countries, generate opportunities  for  people,  and  build  more  stable  and diverse economies in the long term.\n\nWe supported the  agricultural  sector,  providing  more than  220,000  clients  with  financial  and  non-financial solutions  to  adapt  to  their  conditions  and  business cycles.  We  also  contributed  with  impact  investing, financial education, and a scholarship program that has benefited 1,900 young people.",

We support projects that incorporate  environmental,  social,  and  corporate governance  (ESG)  criteria.  We  disbursed  COP  36.9 trillion in 2021 for these projects.\n\nFor instance, we provided COP 1.8 trillion in a credit line  tied  to  sustainability  indicators  for  companies committed  to  specific  goals  in  improving  their environmental and social indicators.

We co-create with our clients according to their  budget,  terrain,  and  community  needs.  Therefore,  each  product  is customized.' This is how Santander businessman Juan Camilo Ortiz defines his company. Mr. Ortiz and his wife, Lina A\u00f1ez, started this business in 2014 when they began importing parks from Europe and China.\n\nAfter  five  years,  they  felt  they  were  ready  to  specialize  in  local  design  and production. In 2019 they decided to compete with the children's playground market  that  leads  Europe.  In  Colombia,  there  is  no  other  company  in  this sector. For that reason, they got advice, attended international fairs, and met suppliers.\n\n'All the parts of our projects are brought from Europe because they are the best quality. But we do the whole design, painting, and installation process here. We stand  out  for  making  inclusive  playgrounds.  We  have  had  clients  such  as schools where they have children in wheelchairs or with special conditions. We take everything into account and create playgrounds with ramps, with different accesses with specialized games.'\n\nIn 2020, Parques Infantiles grew exponentially and had financial products with different entities. However, all quotas and credit cards were canceled when the pandemic hit.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe made it through that difficult year thanks to the support we received from the bank in different areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJuan Camilo says: 'During the pandemic, we had products with several banks. They all closed our quotas. Bancolombia was the only one who continued to provide us with all the services, naturally with our supporting documents. We made it through that difficult year thanks to the support we received from the bank in different areas. We accessed the PAEF payroll subsidy, corporate credit cards,  and  the  severance  credit  line.  They  also  provided  us  with  consulting services with Sura, training, and much more than financial products.'\n\n'On the other hand, we also relied on an outstanding advisor, who always cared for us and helped us manage and identify what was useful. The truth is that everything  with  Bancolombia  is  straightforward.  Its  platform  is  almost intuitive, user-friendly, and makes our relationship with customers much easier because most of them use it,' says Lina.\n\nCurrently,  Parques  Infantiles  has  40  employees.  It  has  developed  projects between the Amazon and San Andres Islands. It recently won a project from Procolombia to help them in the process to start exporting.",

In most of the region's economies, evident signs of recovery emerged in the first half of the year.\n\nSubsequently, moderating with the onset of new contagion peaks and mitigating statistical effects based on the comparison.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMuch  of  the  economic  recovery  was  based  on  the vaccination programs' progress and the great response of  economic  policy  (fiscal  and  monetary  policy). However, they were of lesser magnitude  than high-income  economies,  which  increased  the  gap between them.\n\nDespite  this  challenging  context,  the  IMF  estimates that the region would have grown during 2021 at 6.8%, bringing  production  only  0.6%  below  the  2019  level. The  lag  and  latent  weaknesses  in  the  labor  market imply  that  economic  activity  has  yet  to  return  to pre-pandemic trends.\n\nRegardless, 2021 had favorable external conditions for the region, thanks to the increase in commodity prices and  the  strengthening  of  international  aggregate demand, which boosted exports recovery.\n\nUncertainty and risks remained high, mainly due to the re-emergence  of  new  and  more  contagious  strains  of COVID-19. That was the beginning of a tightening trend in  international  financial  conditions.  Thus,  putting external financing under pressure, significant increases in public debt levels, and sociopolitical instability with historical  changes  in  the  economic  direction  of  the leaders who won the presidential elections in Peru and Chile.",

        "page_content": "## Colombia\n\nDespite the materialization of relevant risks that accentuated the country's vulnerability, the evolution of Colombia's economic activity in 2021 was characterized by a predominant recovery trend.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe availability of surplus liquidity that households accumulated during 2020 boosted consumption, the primary economy strengthening driver.\n\nWe estimate that full-year GDP growth was close to 10%, which would have recovered all the ground lost in 2020 and reached a level of aggregate output 2.5% higher than in  2019.  This  recovery  was  substantially  higher  than expected a year ago.\n\nAll this was possible even though the second quarter had a very adverse epidemiological and public order context, with  multiple  social  mobilizations  and  infections,  ICU occupation, and deaths from COVID-19 that reached new peaks  and  subjected  the  health  system  to  tremendous pressure. This implied a breakdown of the recovery trend and a labor market stagnation.\n\nOnce the public order crisis returned to normal and the epidemiological figures dropped to the lowest levels of 2021 during the third quarter, the economy resumed its accelerated recovery. In particular, the level of aggregate production achieved by the country during this quarter was  higher  than  the  pre-pandemic  benchmark  for  the fourth  quarter  of  2019.  With  the  progress  of  the vaccination  program,  the  restrictions  that  remained  in place on the operation of many sectors were finally lifted.\n\nIn the second half of the year, mobility and the operating capacity of all economic activities and services, especially tourism  and  out-of-home  entertainment,  were  almost entirely  back  to  normal.  In  addition,  the  availability  of surplus  liquidity  that  households  accumulated  during 2020  boosted  consumption,  the  primary  economy strengthening driver.\n\nThis  became  a  slight  inflation  acceleration  driver. Although, the primary determinant of the rise in prices was  the  market  basket.  In  the  second  quarter,  the disruption of public order and its effect on agricultural production  and  distribution  began  to  affect  food inflation.  Afterward,  heightened  stress  in  international logistics  chains,  high  exchange  rates,  and  shortages  of critical  raw  materials  for  the  sector  continued  to  push food prices upward until the end of the year. This led to total annual inflation closing 2021 at 5.62%, a high point since 2016.\n\nSince September, the response to this rising inflation and faster-than-expected  economic  recovery  began  the monetary policy stance adjustment. Thus, in the last 4 months of 2021, the level of intervention rate rose from its historical low of 1.75% to 3%.\n\nIn addition,  the  country's  greater  macroeconomic vulnerability was the third element that contributed to the beginning of monetary adjustment. During the past year,  Colombia  lost  its  investment-grade  status  due  to the  significant  increase  in  public  debt,  the  high  fiscal deficits of 2020 and 2021, and the challenging outlook on  this  front.  In  addition,  the  economic  recovery significantly fueled the import of goods and the outflow of  factor  income.  The  current  account  deficit  rose  to  a level that exceeded 5% of GDP for the entire year. These two elements create twin deficits, which have resulted in local  asset  prices  becoming  more  vulnerable  to  the evolution of foreign financial markets.",

Despite  this  good  economic  performance,  Panama  will  take longer to recover than the average of the countries in the region, given the unprecedented contraction the economy suffered during 2020 (-17.9%). The economy has become increasingly diverse during the past year, with higher mining, transportation, finance, and agriculture participation. According to the latest economic activity data (measured by the Monthly Index Economic Activity  'IMAE'),  4Q21  is  also  expected  to  have  enjoyed  a  good  recovery dynamic.\n\nDuring the past year, in terms of prices performance, Panama emerged from the deflationary period (where it was for 12 consecutive months. As of March 2021,  inflation  returned  to  the  country,  progressively  accelerating  until reaching a peak in October (2.9%).\n\nIn 2021, Panama's fiscal performance was within what was expected by the market,  and  the  Government  met  the  announced  goals.  At  year-end,  the Non-Financial  Public  Sector  (NFPS)  budgetary  deficit  stood  at  7.5%  as  a percentage of GDP. This year, fiscal consolidation is expected to improve as economic activity gradually increases and government revenues continue to gain  traction  while  budgetary  expenditures  related  to  the  health  crisis decrease.\n\n## Guatemala\n\nPartially and due to a less favorable comparison base effect, the economic recovery in Guatemala lost momentum in the last  quarter  of  last  year.  Domestic  demand  also  suffered  a slight slowdown, even though household spending showed good  dynamics  in  the  previous  months  of  the  year.  As measured by the monthly index of economic activity, growth in  economic  activity  fell  to  an  eight-month  low  during October, and exports of goods growth also lost momentum in  the  same  month.  However,  the  flow  of  remittances  that have entered the country has continued to grow, reaching a five-month  peak  in  November.  This  significant  revenue stream  has  been  instrumental  in  keeping  household spending strong and contributing to economic recovery.\n\nUnlike  other  regions'  economies,  consumer  prices  did  not represent significant pressures during 2021.  Inflation decelerated during 2021 from the inflation peak in February last  year  (6%)  and  closed  2021  at  3.1%,  slightly  above  the lower limit of the central bank's target (3%-5%).\n\nFiscal performance during 2021 was better than expected by the market. Thus, the analysts' consensus expects the fiscal deficit to close in 2021 at 2.5% as the government withdraws stimulus  and  the  economy  continues  to  recover.    Public spending during 2021 remained within the budget announced by the Government, so we are confident that the country will continue with sound fiscal management.",

Recovering pre-pandemic  activity  levels  has  been  possible  due  to  its  good performance.  Also,  productive  activity  restrictions  have  been  lifted thanks to the progress in the vaccination program.\n\nThe growth of remittances during 2021 reached historical peaks. It has  become  an  increasingly  important  source  of  liquidity  for households  and  the  economy.  Five  years  back,  remittances represented 18% of GDP. In 2021, they represented 26.6%, totaling USD 7,517 million after annual growth of 26.8%.\n\nEl Salvador is vulnerable in fiscal terms, having closed 2021 with an estimated fiscal deficit of around 6%. This balance sheet result and public  debt  dynamic,  estimated  to  have  closed  2021  at  88%  as  a proportion of the GDP, leave little room for maneuvering on public finances.  Added  to  the  above  complex  scenario  is  that  political tensions  between  President  Nayib  Bukele's  Administration  and  the International Monetary Fund would hinder a possible loan of around USD 1.3 billion.\n\n## Estados Unidos\n\nThe  U.S.  economic  activity  performance  in  2021  exceeded  our expectations. It closed the year with a growth of 5.7%; an excellent dynamic of private demand supported this growth. The progressive removal of the measures to contain the pandemic (thanks to a strong vaccination plan, with about 60% of the population fully vaccinated) was also an ally in the economic recovery, particularly in the service sectors. This good dynamic of economic activity was also reflected in the  recovery  of  the  labor  market,  which  closed  last  year  with unemployment  below  4%.  These  results  have  come  amid  high uncertainty  stemming  from  new  COVID-19  strains,  bottlenecks  in global supply chains, and escalating inflation.\n\nDespite  the  good  economic  environment  described  above,  the advance in consumer prices has exceeded the market's expectations (and that of the Federal Reserve), putting financial stability at risk. CPI inflation closed 2021 at 7%, a figure not reported since 1982. The conjunction  of  several  phenomena  has  explained  this  increase  in inflation.  Supply  constraints  are  derived  from  global  logistical problems  such  as  a  solid  private  demand,  driven  partly  by  an extensive  fiscal  stimulus.  Rising  energy  prices  and  the  economic effects of the Fed's injection of liquidity during 2020 and part of 2021. This rise in prices has increased pressures on the Federal Reserve and its plan to harvest liquidity from the market and raise the Fed Funds rate early.",

In  its  latest  edition  of  the  World  Economic Outlook (WEO), the IMF forecasts that the region's growth during 2022 will moderate to 2.4%.\n\nThis will be primarily underpinned by how economic policy impetus will continue to be reduced. As efforts to reduce fiscal deficits begin to move forward, the central banks of the  major  economies  are  rapidly  increasing  their  policy rates to cope with the challenging inflationary context with which they received  2022.  Also,  political  uncertainty  with the elections in Colombia and Brazil and the definition of the new Political Constitution in Chile will limit dynamism.\n\nThe year ahead will be a stabilization period for economic growth in Latin America at levels consistent with its potential. In its latest edition of the World Economic Outlook (WEO), the IMF forecasts that the region's growth during 2022 will moderate to 2.4%.\n\nThus,  the  growth  of  the  Colombian  economy  would moderate  from  10.6%,  which  would  have  taken  place  in 2021, to 4%. The first half of the year will be marked by how consumption and investment decisions will be affected by the lack of clarity in the political landscape and by the stress still in force in international logistics chains. We expect the economy  to  return  to  greater  dynamism  only  once  the electoral contest is resolved and under the assumption that the winner is a candidate who continues to make orthodox use of economic policy tools.\n\nIn addition, the depletion of household liquidity surpluses that would limit the evolution of private consumption, the smaller gap to return to potential output levels, and the less expansionary stance of the economic policy stance will also contribute to the stabilization of growth.",

A  risk  would  be  the logistical  complications  generated  by  global  bottlenecks. Given the above, driven by the transport, trade, and mining sectors, we expect that by 2022 the economy will grow 6.5%.\n\nWe expect Guatemala to consolidate its vaccination program by 2022. We also expect the flow of remittances will continue to be an essential source of financing for household spending. On the other hand, inflation will continue to normalize thanks to  the  dissipation  of  international  logistical  problems,  the moderation of oil prices, and the central bank's interest rate hike.  We  expect  it  to  close  at  4.1%.  Fiscally,  we  expect  the government  to  continue  consolidation  as  the  economic recovery increases government revenues and pandemic-related fiscal spending pressures are reduced.\n\nFor El Salvador, supported by private consumption and some public  spending  plans,  we  expect  the  economy  to  grow  by 3.7%. The context of moderate inflation and the good flow of incoming remittances will help to boost private consumption. Several risks loom over our forecast horizon, stemming from the political and diplomatic management of the country. First, tensions between El Salvador and the U.S. could affect the flow of remittances, given a possible withdrawal of the work permit for  Salvadorans  in  the  U.S.  (TPS).  On  the  other  hand, diplomatic  relations  with  multilateral  organizations  such  as the  IMF  could  hinder  the  arrival  of  loans  to  the  country essential  for  fiscal  consolidation.  Additionally,  given  the implementation of bitcoin as legal tender in the country, great uncertainty continues about the financial sector's performance.\n\nIn the United States, we expect economic activity growth to stabilize  and  GDP  to  advance  at  around  3.3%.  Thus,  a normalization  of  the  comparison  base  effects  (which explained  part  of  the  high  growth  in  2021)  and  a  more challenging macroeconomic  context  would  cause  this stabilization. The main downside risks we see on the forecast outlook are the arrival of new strains of COVID-19, sustained inflation  growth  beyond  current  levels,  a  very  aggressive monetary stance that slows down the good momentum of the labor market, the economic activity, and the global logistics stress likely to persist. Conversely, in terms of upside risks, we see a more favorable global recovery environment, especially for  major  U.S.  trading  partners,  progress  on  international vaccination programs, and continued recovery and strengthening of the country's labor market.\n\nIn Colombia, Banco de la Rep\u00fablica will continue with an accelerated process of normalization of the monetary policy stance to reach a neutral rate of 5.5% before the end of 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Hence, we have maintained our position as a strategic ally in executing their projects.\n\nConsequently, we maintained the composition of our gross portfolio, with a 64% share of commercial loans and a 22% share of consumer loans, similar to those reported in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Thus,  this  resulted  in  the  strategy  of  making optimal use of resources and the correct portfolio management by the Grupo, closing the year at COP 32 billion. There was a growth of COP 3 trillion in cash during the year, which  closed  at  COP  23.1  trillion  in  2021,  maintaining  the liquidity levels required by the regulator and guaranteeing the availability of resources for our clients.\n\nMeanwhile,  Grupo  Bancolombia's  total  liabilities  closed  the year at COP 256 trillion, increasing COP 29 trillion (12.5%).

As a result, equity gained 73 bps as a percentage of the balance sheet  structure,  closing  the  year  at  11.1%,  reflecting  our commitment  to  strengthening  our  equity  as  a  hedging mechanism  against  future  risks.

This variation was mainly leveraged by the gross portfolio,  which  grew  by  11.73%  and  contributed 69.83% of the total increase in assets.\n\nPortfolio balances performance was primarily driven by the  Commercial  mode,  growing  12.66%  (COP  8.52 trillion), bringing the bank's market share in this line to 33.82%*,  98  bps  higher  than  in  2020.  On  the  other hand,  consumption  had  a  variation  of  15.85%  (COP 4.69 trillion) and reached a 19.93%* market share. In addition, Housing recorded a growth of 14.79% (COP 2.14  billion)  and  gained  26  bps  of  market  share, reaching 19.76%*.\n\nInvestments, including investment financial instruments, subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures,  increased  8.90%  due  to  higher  earnings  on equity method investments.\n\nThe  decrease  of  COP  916,986  million,  which  was  at 4.19%,  in  the  portfolio  provisions  balance  shows  a reduction  in  credit  risk.  This  resulted  from  the economic  reactivation,  reflecting  an  improvement  in portfolio  quality,  with  a  decrease  of  125  bps  in  the overdue portfolio indicator.\n\nConsequently, we have maintained our market leadership in both total assets (25.20%*) and portfolio (26.71%*).\n\nThe  company  closed  in  2021  with  a  total  balance  of liabilities of COP 175,15 trillion, representing COP 16,70 trillion  more  than  the  2020  closing.  Customer  deposits are mainly the reason for this behavior, with the growth in savings  and  current  accounts  of  COP  14.18  trillion  and COP  6.88  trillion,  respectively,  and  a  decrease  in  CD  of COP  4.84  trillion.  A  change  in  the  funding  structure  is evident,  with  CDs  losing  670  bps  of  their  share  of  total deposits  and  savings  and  checking  accounts  gaining  a more  significant  share,  thus  optimizing  the  cost  of funding.\n\nBancolombia reported a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ngrowth in total assets in 2021, representing COP 22.69 trillion more than at the end of 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  was  the  result  of  a  COP  1.32  trillion  drop  in interest expenses and a COP 2.71 trillion decrease in provision expenses, associated with a stabilization due to better portfolio performance and the release of the impairment of some clients because of the Program to Support Debtors (PAD, by its Spanish abbreviation) culmination, which generated a 219 bps decrease in the cost of credit, which stood at 1.64%.\n\nNet interest margin recovered from the previous year due to the management of the funding structure, which improved the cost of  liabilities.    As  a  result,  the  company's  net  interest  income increased 9.10%, equivalent to COP 731.333 million.\n\nIncome from the equity method was COP 994,439 million higher than that recorded in 2020, derived from the greater dynamism in the subsidiaries' financial results with the gradual reactivation of the economy worldwide.\n\nNet  income  before  provisions  increased  19.00%,  compared  to 13.04% in operating expenses, representing a recovery of 241 bps in the efficiency indicator, which stood at 45.67%. Thus, pre-tax profit stood at COP 5.24 trillion, COP 4.21 trillion more than in 2020.\n\nFinally, Bancolombia closed 2021 with a net profit of COP 4.15 trillion, representing an annual increase of 358.87% (equivalent to  COP  3.25  trillion).

By doing  so,  we  meet  the  needs  of  our  investors  and  keep  them  informed  about  the prospects and developments of the business.\n\nIn 2021, we participated in 28 local and international events. We interacted with several institutional  investment  funds  that  invest  in  Bancolombia.  We  also  increased  the number of meetings with investors, investment analysts, and rating agencies (thanks to virtuality).  They  closely  follow  Bancolombia  and  its  subsidiaries'  performance, perceiving our company as an appealing investment option.\n\nFour  earnings  conferences  are  held  to  keep  our  investor  community  informed.  We report on progress in implementing our strategy, business results, and prospects. We organized an investor's day. We addressed concerns and discussed key messages about digital transformation and sustainability, in which the organization has been engaged.\n\nIn  2021,  Bancolombia  consolidated  its  status  as  an  issuer  with  IR  Recognition.

From that feedback, our more than 30,000  employees  in  the  four  countries  take  every expectation  as  a  foundation  for  building  trust  with customers and non-customers alike.\n\nVarious stakeholders and corporate monitors currently endorse us. For instance, under Reptrak's methodology, Bancolombia  reached  a  strong  reputation  level  with 79.3/100 in 2021, four points higher than the previous year.  Meanwhile,  the  emotional  connection  between Bam  and  Banistmo  grew.  At  the  same  time,  in Bancoagr\u00edcola, we identified some issues to strengthen, mainly  marked  by  a  context  in  which  customers  are demanding  more  significant  effort  concerning  their expectations,  which  are  leveraged  on  the  service experience.\n\nOn the other hand, the Company Monitor on Corporate Reputation (MERCO), which evaluates the reputation of companies  and  business  leaders  in  the  country, awarded Bancolombia for the seventh consecutive year, the recognition as the best reputable company in the country.  This  is  proof  of  our  work  to  strengthen  the bonds  of  trust  with  our  different  stakeholders  and contribute to the organization's value with a commitment to criteria such as ESG.\n\nTo maintain and increase trust levels, we will focus on crucial  reputation  aspects  such  as  integrity,  customer experience,  and  sustainability.  This,  coupled  with profitability,  transparency,  and  compliance  with  the standards of the world's most sustainable companies, will  set  us  on  the  path  to  differentiation  to  achieve better  results  and  ensure  long-term  operation  and well-being for all.",

The  current  members  are  Arturo Condo Tamayo, president, Andr\u00e9s Felipe Mej\u00eda Cardona, and Silvina Vatnick.\n\nAfter the Colombian Financial Superintendence authorized her to become a member of the Board of Directors,  Silvina  Vatnick  has  acted  as  the  Audit Committee's  financial  expert  since  May  24,  2021. Before  this,  and  during  the  first  months  of  the  year, Sylvia  Escovar  served  as  a  member  of  the  Audit Committee and financial expert.\n\nThe main objective of this committee is to support the Board  of  Directors  by  overseeing  the  effectiveness  of our internal control system. Other specific responsibilities of the Committee are (i) overseeing the integrity  of  the  financial  statements,  the  financial reporting  process,  and  the  internal  accounting  and financial  control  systems,  (ii)  presenting  to  the Meeting, through the Board of Directors, the candidates for the Statutory Auditor position. For this purpose, the Audit  Committee  conducts  an  objective  and  public evaluation  after  analyzing  certain  variables,  (iii)  to ensure controls in the preparation and transparency of Bancolombia's  consolidated  and  separate  financial information, including its appropriate disclosure, verifying the existence of the necessary controls for the construction,  disclosure,  and  dissemination  of  such information.

Lastly,  the  Audit  Committee's functions  include  learning  about  the  criteria  for determining the price and other conditions of material and non-recurring transactions to be entered into with related parties before their execution.\n\nBancolombia's Internal  and  External  Auditors  and  the Compliance  Officer  report  to  the  Audit  Committee.

The  Vice President of Human Management acts as secretary of this committee.\n\nThe  Designation,  Compensation,  and  Development  Committee's primary task are to support the Board of Directors in determining the policies  and  provisions  for  the  selection,  appointment,  hiring,  and remuneration  of  senior  management  and,  in  general,  all  matters related to Grupo Bancolombia's remuneration model.\n\nThe  Designation,  Compensation,  and  Development  Committee's functions  are  to  (i)  determine  the  human  resources  management policies,  establish  the  selection,  evaluation,  compensation,  and development  processes  for  senior  management,  (ii)  establish  the objective  criteria  for  hiring  our  principal  officers,  (iii)  propose  the objective criteria for hiring senior management and design succession plans,  (iv)  determine  the  criteria  for  evaluating  the  performance  of senior management, and (v) issue recommendations to the Board of Directors  on  the  appointments  and  compensation  of  the  president and senior management.\n\nThe  Nomination,  Compensation,  and  Development  Committee recommend  that  the  Board  of  Directors  define  the  variable compensation  model  for  the  President,  Vice  President,  and employees,  which  rewards  the  integral  vision  of  the  business, teamwork,  and  the  pursuit  of  profitable,  efficient,  and  sustainable growth, based on people. Our Value-Added System (Sistema de Valor Agregado-SVA) remunerates the creation of added value according to the results at Grupo's level and the fulfillment of strategic goals. All the  above  is  based  on  the  policies  approved  by  the  Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe Designation, Compensation, and Development Committee is also responsible for approving the salary of senior management.

In addition, this committee supports our Board of Directors in learning and understanding risks assumed, the analysis of the capital required to support them, and tracking its risk appetite.\n\nIn 2021, the Risk Committee met 12 times.\n\nEvaluations of the Board of Directors are conducted annually to be permanently  informed  of  the  Board  of  Directors'  performance.  The evaluations alternate between internal and external assessments. For the 2021 fiscal year, an external review was conducted by the firm Governance  Consultants  S.A.  Its  results  will  be  evaluated  by  the Corporate Governance Committee and the Board of Directors. They will  be  taken  into  consideration  for  the  permanent  dynamics  of improvement of the Board of Directors. The board's evaluation process is independent of the evaluation process of senior management. The evaluation of the bank's president was conducted by the chairman of the Board of Directors, and that of the corporate vice presidents was led by the bank's president, with satisfactory results.\n\nDuring  the  2021  fiscal  year,  the  Board  of  Directors,  following  the recommendation of the expert support committee on the matter, as appropriate,  approved  policies  and  manuals  on  accounting  and  tax matters, ethics and integrity, credit risk, operational risk, liquidity risk, data,  cybersecurity  and  Anti-Money  Laundering,  and  Anti-Terrorist Financing  Risk  Management  System  (Sarlaft,  by  its  abbreviation  in Spanish), and other regulatory matters within its jurisdiction.\n\nThe  board  of  Directors  and  its  various  support  committees  ensure attention  to  stakeholders,  including  investors,  supervisors,  control bodies,  and  others.  Relations  are  conducted  with  professionalism, transparency  and  within  the  framework  defined  in  the  Good Governance and Ethics and Integrity codes.\n\nIn  January  2022,  in  compliance  with  the  duty  to  protect  Grupo Bancolombia's business, the Board of Directors approved amendments  to  the  Code  of  Good  Governance  to  protect  Grupo Bancolombia's  information,  reinforcing  independence  criteria,  and the regime of disqualifications and incompatibilities in our Board of Directors, among other aspects. Thus, our Code of Good Governance establishes the commitment, previously defined, to have 5 out of 7 independent directors on the Board of Directors.",

Thus, our directors receive a percentage of 30% of their compensation through the SVA Fund, and their contributions must have a two (2) year term of permanence.\n\nFunds withdrawn from the SVA Fund and the trading of the shares represented through this fund shall follow the same authorization procedure by the Board of Directors, with the same restrictions.\n\nAccordingly, in 2021, the Board of Directors authorized SVA's withdrawal transactions to Maria Cristina Arrast\u00eda Uribe and Jos\u00e9  Mauricio  Rodriguez,  vice  presidents  of  Business  and Internal  Audit.  The  bank  informed  the  market  of  these authorizations on each occasion.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These  policies  are included in our Code of Good Governance and our Code of Ethics and Conduct, which can be consulted on our website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur  Code  of  Good  Governance  considers  as  related parties the companies  subject  to  Bancolombia's supervision, our members of the Board of Directors and Senior  Management,  including  their  spouses  and children, the companies in which our members of the Board  of  Directors  and  Senior  Management  have  an investment of more than 10%, the entities that make up the Sura Bancolombia  Conglomerate,  and  other shareholders of Bancolombia with a stake in our capital stock of more than 10%.\n\nAccording  to  these  policies,  transactions  with  related parties  are  classified  based  on  their  recurrence  and materiality to apply adequate identification, disclosure, evaluation,  and  in  some  cases,  approval  standards  to transactions  that  require  greater  attention  from  a corporate governance perspective.\n\nNo material and non-recurring transactions with related parties occurred during the year 2021. Thus, additional approval  and  disclosure  procedures  defined  in  the Company's  Code  of  Good  Governance  were  not required.\n\nOur commercial and business relationships with related parties are entered into at market prices and in Grupo Bancolombia's best interest.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSpecifically, transactions with entities belonging to the Sura Bancolombia Financial Conglomerate were entered based on the best interest of each of the parties to  obtain  better  conditions  for  their  own  business, under the premise of not jeopardizing the companies' ability to comply with their obligations to third parties.\n\nHowever, the Board of Directors monitored the treasury operations  performed  with  our  related  economic parties every  month,  following  the  market  risk classification.  These  operations  were  executed  under market  conditions  and  in  compliance  with  the procedures established.\n\nBancolombia  generally  discloses  its  transactions  with related parties in the financial statement notes at the end  of  each  fiscal  year.  The  following  transactions entered during 2021 are highlighted (in COP millions):\n\n- \u203a Investments  in  Bancolombia  subsidiaries  for  COP 23,416,032.\n- \u203a Loan portfolio from customers and financial institutions, net for COP 901,424.\n- \u203a R ight-of-use assets under a lease, net for COP 300,718.\n\nOn the other hand, according to the Organic Statute of the Financial System, certain credit operations, including  those  of  administrators  and  their  relatives, require the approval of the Board of Directors, except for the vote of the respective director.\n\nThus,  for  2021,  four  credit  quotas  were  submitted  to the  Board  of  Directors  for  review  after  compliance verification, with indebtedness and risk concentration limitations.  Their  approval  implied  the  abstention  of the respective director and was unanimously authorized  by  the  other  members  of  the  Board  of Directors.",

Control Environment\n\nBancolombia's Board of Directors leads the strategic planning process based on a competitive environment diagnosis, trends, and Grupo's capabilities to achieve its objectives. Incentive strategy alignment is achieved through dashboards with indicators defined according to the pillars established by the Board of Directors.\n\nWe are committed to responsible business and sustainability. Therefore, we operate under the law and the highest ethics, integrity, and transparency standards. We know that the existence of an adequate control environment derives not only from the application of applicable regulations but also from the culture of the organization, where integrity is one of the features that characterize us and, therefore, we focus on encouraging expected and unacceptable behavior in the actions of employees,  promoting  whistleblower  channels  and  whistleblower  protection,  establishing guidelines for team member behavior in social systems, directing efforts towards the customer and team member knowledge, and strengthening the criteria for the identification, management, and disclosure of conflicts of interest.\n\n## In 2021, framed in the ICS, the organization worked on strengthening the Control Environment as follows:\n\n- The Compliance Vice-Presidency led the Code of Ethics and Conduct guidelines updating to reflect consistency between our words and actions, demonstrating ethics and  integrity  through  our  actions.  After  the  Board  of Directors  approved  the  changes  in  August  2021,  we began  to  disseminate  them  through  a  strategy  that included information directed to all employees and the delivery  of  a  specific  activity  to  the  organization's leaders, who oversaw communicating the code update to their work teams.\n\nThe Regulatory Compliance Manual was also approved. This  supports  the  Combined  Assurance  Model  for adequate governance in decentralized regulatory, legal, and risks report management, an essential input for the Vice-Presidency of Compliance and the key stakeholders to continue working on its implementation.\n\nIn addition, we continued to strengthen the compliance programs centrally managed by the Vice-Presidency of Compliance. These programs supervise and monitor the following  risks:  ethical  standards  defined  by  the organization in its Code of Ethics and Conduct, Sarlaft, Anticorruption,  Personal  Data  Protection,  Consumer Protection,  FATCA/CRS,  and  Behavioral  Risk  in  Money Markets, and Anti-Fraud Program Framework, for which Compliance plays an articulating role.\n\n- The Ethics, Integrity, and Cybersecurity Working Group continued  working  to  promote  and  strengthen  these issues through interventions in the culture to encourage the desired behaviors among employees and provide clarity regarding those that are not tolerated, strengthen  the  duty  to  report  and  raise  awareness regarding  the  observance  and  application  of  the organization's cybersecurity policies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

All these are framed in the \"zero tolerance to fraud\" policy.\n- Training sessions on the Code of Ethics and Conduct were held, providing opportunities for employees to analyze our actions' integrity and ethics as our hallmark.\n- Advice  and  accompaniment  were  provided  to  employees  on ethical issues. Questions about the Code of Ethics and Conduct guidelines,  support  for  ethical  dilemmas,  conflicts  of  interest management,  and  personal  investment  rules,  among  other topics,  were  addressed.  Thus,  promoting  a  consultation, disclosure, and accompaniment culture to employees.\n- A mandatory training plan for employees is updated annually on  internal  control  and  compliance  issues.  Topics  related  to Ethics,  Anti-Fraud,  Anti-Corruption,  SOX  Law,  Anti-Money Laundering, and Data Protection are included in this plan. In 2021,  the  results  were  highly  satisfactory,  achieving  98% compliance. Additionally, other training activities were held for specific audiences considering their risks.\n- Some  of  our  employees,  including  suppliers  and  customers, reported suspicion or knowledge of violations of the Code of Ethics and Conduct provisions or the policies that complement it  through  our  Ethics  Hotline,  a  whistleblower  channel  that Grupo Bancolombia has established for this purpose.\n- All  reports  and  complaints  received  were  investigated.  In addition, investigations were conducted due to alerts detected by  the  areas  responsible  for  ensuring  compliance  with  the Code of Ethics and Conduct, the Anti-Fraud Program Policies, and the zero-tolerance standard for fraud. When investigations determined that any of our employees failed to comply with the provisions, policies, or ethical standards required by Grupo Bancolombia,  either  actively  or  by  omission,  respective sanctions  or  disciplinary  measures  were  imposed,  per  the provisions of the Internal labor Regulations and the applicable regulations.  The  embargo  was  determined  considering  the seriousness of the act, recidivism, economic losses, reputational  effects  for  Grupo  Bancolombia  or  its  member companies, or our customers.\n- In addition  to  internal  sanctions,  Grupo  Bancolombia initiated the corresponding civil or criminal actions deemed viable and appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Hence,  roles  and  responsibilities defined for the different risk areas and other lines are aligned with the provisions of the SOX Act and the chapter of the Basic Legal Circular (C.E 029), referring to the Internal Control System ensuring compliance in addition to that.\n\nIn 2021, Bancolombia continued to strengthen its Risk  Governance  model  as  a  critical  element  in comprehensive risk management. This framework includes different risks identification to which the organization is exposed, roles and responsibilities definition  of  each  of  the  action  areas  against these  risks,  and  the  association  of  the  lines performing each of the positions. The framework promotes  a  risk  management  culture  through self-control, self-management, and self-regulation.\n\nGood  structuring  in  the  three  action  areas  and their  proper  functioning  prevents  gaps  and unnecessary  effort  duplication.

Impairment  of  the overdue portfolio and the lower level of coverage in the period was mainly due to the cessation of financial relief offered to clients in Panam\u00e1 by the end of 2021, a situation that affected the consumer and housing portfolios to a greater extent.\n\nFor Bancoagr\u00edcola , in 2021, the portfolio balance ended with a 21.6%  growth  due  to  a  positive  trend  during  the  first  three quarters of the year in the dollar portfolio for commercial and consumer loans. Due to the decrease in overdue balances in commercial and consumer loans in the last quarter, the 30-day overdue portfolio indicator stood at 2.5% compared to 3.0% in 2020.

A highlight  was  the  Corporate  banking  portfolio  with  a  better dynamism  in  the  first  quarter  of  the  year  and  better performance  in  the  last  quarter  in  Individual  banking.  The 30-day  overdue  loan  portfolio  indicator  stood  at  3.2%, compared to 4.9% at the end of 2020, driven by the decrease in overdue  balances  in  the  commercial  and  consumer  banking sectors,  consistent  with  the  strategy  of  assisting  customers with structural solutions and economic dynamics recovery in Guatemala,  compared  the  previous  year.  In  December  2021, the  30-day  overdue  portfolio  coverage  reached  165.3% compared to 150.3% in December 2020.\n\nIn Bancolombia  Panama ,  the  portfolio  balance  registered  a 28.3% growth compared to the previous year, and the 30-day Past Due Portfolio Indicator remained stable at 0.3% between the  periods  under  analysis.

Likewise,  the increase in inflation derived from the rise in the price of oil,  raw materials, and problems in global supply chains led  central  banks  worldwide  to  begin  withdrawing monetary stimulus and, in some cases, to increase their benchmark  rates.  Therefore,  market  and  liquidity  risk management were framed in strengthening measurements  and  analysis  under  stress  scenarios  to evaluate and anticipate possible impacts of the abovementioned events on our and third-party portfolios managed by Grupo Bancolombia to establish strategies to reduce these impacts.\n\nEfforts were also targeted at improving the efficiency of internal  reporting  and  risk  monitoring  and  control processes,  continuing  with  information  inputs  from Bancolombia, Banistmo, and Banco Agr\u00edcola's portfolios in the Landing Zone. Also, in the migration of processes towards new technologies. Thus, reducing the execution time  of  monitoring  activities  in  Grupo  Bancolombia's entities and migrating tools toward the target model.\n\nVaR limits were also reviewed and adjusted in the various entities of Grupo Bancolombia to facilitate the execution of the business strategies proposed by the Treasury and Business Vice-Presidencies. In Banistmo, internal processes  were  also  reviewed  to  streamline  approval flows and reduce response times for the attention of the businesses.\n\nOn  the  other  hand,  the  active  VaR  methodology  for portfolios managed by Valores Banistmo was implemented.  The  VaR  limit  was  defined  for  the Investment  Fund  managed  by  Gestora  BanAgr\u00edcola  to strengthen  advisory  processes  in  managing  third-party resources. In Valores Bancolombia, the VaR methodology was implemented to measure the level of risk exposure of our  client's  investments.  Thus,  supporting  the  control and  monitoring  of  their  risk  profile.    Based  on  the provisions  of  the  regulations  in  Colombia,  a  new  risk profiling  survey  was  also  created,  incorporating  the analysis of behavioral economics variables that meet the current needs of customers and the market.\n\nIn 2021, the methodology used by Grupo to monitor the market risk exposure of the trading activity continued to be the value at risk (VaR), which quantifies the extent of possible loss over a given time horizon at a pre-defined confidence  level.  For  such  monitoring,  the  internal weighted  historical  simulation  model  is  used,  with  a confidence level of 99% and a time horizon of 10 days, and  the  standard  methodology  regulated  by  the Financial Superintendence of Colombia (SFC) in Chapter 21  of  the  Basic  Accounting  and  Financial  Circular,  the result of which is incorporated in the solvency ratio.\n\nIn 2021, Grupo's exposure to market risk maintained moderate consumption compared to the tolerance levels approved by the Board of Directors, with an average occupation of less than 40% of its internal VaR limits.  The  exposure  to  market  risk  measured  with  the  standard  methodology  of  the  SFC  ranged between  COP  1,092,446,743,910  and  COP  1,711,794,862,101,  with  an  average  exposure  of  COP 1,509,084,808,129.

Therefore, its decisions seek to contribute toward compliance with global strategies for 2030, particularly the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement.\n\nThis  commitment  is  connected  to  a  governance  model  within  Grupo Bancolombia. Thus, ensuring the adoption and compliance of decisions on sustainability. Supervising sustainability incorporation in the risks, opportunities,  and  impacts  for  our  operations,  banking  and  investment activities, and other products and services we provide to our customers.\n\nIn 2021,  to  leverage  this  purpose  from  a  credit  risk  perspective, implementing the corporate credit policy for critical industries in the face of climate  change  continued.  Under  this  policy,  Grupo  Bancolombia  sets  the guidelines for sectoral support for sectors with the most significant impact on  carbon  emissions.    Grupo  Bancolombia  has  gradually  reduced  credit exposure by 2030 with a specialized support model for customers in these industries  for  the  coal  mining  and  coal-fired  power  generation  sectors. Additionally, credit policies have been established for the livestock, cement manufacturing, iron and steel manufacturing, air transportation, maritime transportation, and vehicle manufacturing sectors that define guidelines for the  financing  and  promotion  of  credit-oriented  to  sustainable  uses  that promote the transition of these industries towards decarbonization.  Grupo Bancolombia  manages  the  transition  risk  on  its  credit  portfolio  by implementing this policy.\n\nProgress  has  been  made  in  analyzing  and  approving  credit operations in the non-conventional renewable energy sector to  promote  carbon  neutrality  in  the  credit  portfolio.  Aside from it, direct coal financing reduction will contribute to the emissions reduction objective financed by the bank. Similarly, in 2021  environmental  and  social  risk  analyses  were conducted in  Colombia  for  COP  8.1  trillion  to  evaluate  the environmental  and  social  impact  of  the  financed  credit operations, complying with defined corporate guidelines and standards established by the Equator Principles.\n\nAmong  some  of  Banistmo's  highlights  is  the  successful placement of the gender social bond and resources allocation obtained to finance 311 SMEs  led by women.  In Bancoagr\u00edcola,  credit  lines  for  financing  women  in  the Individuals and SMEs segments continue to be promoted.\n\nRegarding the capital markets business, progress was made to incorporate environmental, social, and corporate governance  risk  assessment  methodologies  for  ESG  issuers and  investment  portfolios  in  2021.  Hence,  adjusting  the methods  to  best  industry  practices  and  complying  with analysts'  and  investors'  requirements.    Grupo  Bancolombia has  more  than  70  ESG  portfolios  and  30  issuers  internally qualified with ESG risk methodologies by the end of the year. The issuers are authorized by the external provider, ETFs, and ESG Mutual Funds approval methodologies.\n\nIncreasing asset coverage rated under ESG criteria, together with  the  approaches  made  to  issuers,  has  generated  more significant investment opportunities for the Asset Management  and  Proprietary  Position  portfolios  and  the strengthening of the Distribution and Sales advisory services with the inclusion of ESG criteria in the reports for clients. In addition,  an  ESG  portfolio  rating  tool  was  developed  to monitor  the  performance  and  assets  that  make  up  the portfolios that follow this type of strategy. On the other hand, opportunities  for  improvement  were  identified.  We  are working on closing gaps to achieve greater integration of ESG criteria  in  the  different  businesses.  These  will  include  the analysis  of  portfolio  impact,  exposure  to  climate  risk, engagement and voting, better coverage of qualified assets, the  definition  of  goals,  and  strengthening  processes  to achieve international practice compliance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This transaction will be for COP 531,000 billion, corresponding  to  100%  of  the  financing  in  the  long  term.  Thus, ensuring design, construction, process, and maintenance resources for road accesses to the north of Bogota.\n\nTogether, we drive economic development in the countries where we operate.\n\nWe also co-led the financial closing of the R\u00edo Magdalena 2 Highway, a 152-kilometer (94m) road corridor between Antioquia and Santander. We have committed to this project for up to COP 625,000 billion.\n\nWe supported the expansion of the Panama Metro in several sectors. This  project  will  generate  around  5,000  jobs  and  improve  the  life quality of 500,000 people living in West Panama.

The concessionaire will use this loan to finalize designs and studies and adapt the workshop yard, among other items. We will also finance the 80 Metro, the third line of this transportation system in Medell\u00edn.\n\nThrough the first social PPP (APP), we supported the development of the social infrastructure the country needs. On an equal basis, with a financial  closing  of  COP  260,000  billion,  we  participated  with  Ita\u00fa Unibanco in building  the  Bosa  Hospital  in  Bogot\u00e1.  This  will  benefit around 400,000 people in four location areas in the city's southwest.\n\nOn  the  other  hand,  we  continually  support  local  governments  in Colombia  with  digital  alternatives,  including  Wompi  and  Bot\u00f3n Bancolombia, to simplify procedures for citizens and facilitate public sector  collections.  Through  our  platforms,  they  have  handled  COP 3.51 trillion. In addition, 170 municipalities will use the Bancolombia Button for tax collection.\n\nWe are the Superintendency of Notary and Registry's financial agent.

We know that Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) criteria are fundamental to fulfilling our fiduciary duty.\n\nSince our 2014 adherence to the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), supported by the United Nations, we have challenged ourselves to incorporate these criteria as a fundamental and integral element in our investment processes. On this journey, and with the experience and knowledge we have acquired, we have integrated sustainability into our product and service offerings, our recommendations to the market, and our position. In 2021 we reached the following milestones:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs part of our business ambition to mobilize at least COP 500 billion by 2030 through financial services in activities associated with the purpose, we have proposed  to  have  COP  1.9  trillion  in  assets  under  management  with  ESG criteria by 2021, COP 5 trillion by 2022, COP 15 trillion by 2024, and at least 90% of total Asset Management assets by 2024. In 2021 we achieved COP 2.7 trillion, meeting the goal by 140%.\n\nWe relaunched the Renta Alta Convecci\u00f3n Fund to the market with a change in its investment strategy, including ESG criteria with an ESG rating objective under  MSCI  ESG  Research  measurement  methodologies.  In  addition,  we brought  the  global  Sustainable  Income  Fund  to  the  Panamanian  market, increasing our offering of sustainable investment products in the region. We expanded  our  assets  under  the  management  of  an  ESG  strategy  by  COP 472,500XX trillion with these products\n\nWe joined the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative by committing to align our investment portfolios with carbon-neutral scenarios by 2050, becoming the first organization in Latin America to be part of it. Therefore, we conducted our  first  measurement  of  the  indirect  carbon  footprint  of  our  investments under the PCAF methodology and defined our science-based targets that will be  submitted  for  validation  by  the  Science-Based  Target  Initiative  (SBTi). Emissions from our investment portfolios, equivalent to 63,115 tons of CO2e, represent 1.2% of Grupo Bancolombia's total emissions.\n\nDue to the region's lack of information and ESG ratings, we continue applying our proprietary ESG evaluation models under international standards. In 2021, we increased our ESG rating coverage by 33 local issuers, which allows us to make responsible decisions aligned with our ESG policies.\n\nWe  included  ESG  criteria  in  our  Economic  Research  (Investigaciones Econ\u00f3micas) investment recommendations and published the first analysis of the ESG rating status of Colombian companies.",

Next year, we will include our Renting and Transportempo business information. Aside from the financial sector, we will report on the actual industry.\n\nWe use various natural resources such as energy, water, and paper in our direct operation. This requires conscious management to reduce the impact of our actions  and  a  commitment  to  define  a  strategy  to  reduce  consumption consistent with our corporate purpose. Therefore, we permanently monitor our consumption, aligned with reduction goals.\n\nWe  exceeded  our  goals  for  the  2010  -  2020  period  and  reinforced  our commitment. We established a new baseline in 2019 to challenge ourselves to reach higher goals.\n\nDue to the prolonged pandemic conditions, we decreased our consumption during 2021 above the reduction trend we had before the pandemic and those derived from implementing different eco-efficiency actions. Although we met our goals, we expect a return to normalcy by 2022. We will capitalize on the lessons learned to redefine them based on the analysis of our consumption trends.\n\nAdditionally, we restated the energy consumption data for 2018 to 2020 due to improved measurement methodology for services provided to third parties.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Energy  (kWh) Goal 2019 - 2030  -20%   | 2019 - 2021:  -19% We decreased by 5% compared to 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Renewable Energy  (kWh) Goal 100%      | 75%  of our consumption  was renewable by 2021           |\n| Water  (m 3 ) -10%                     | 2019 - 2021:  -23%                                       |\n| Goal                                   | We decreased by 3% compared to 2020                      |\n| Paper  (kg) Goal 2019 - 2030  -25%     | 2019 - 2021:  -28% We increased by 3% compared to 2020   |\n| Air travel  (Ton CO 2 ) Goal -20%      | 2019 - 2021:  -89% We decreased by 37% compared to 2020  |\n| Waste  (tons) Goal -30%                | We increased by  16% compared to 2020                    |",

At Bancolombia, we are committed to defining concrete actions to actively contribute to mitigation and compensation from our direct operations and move towards a low-carbon economy.\n\nIn 2021 we reduced our Scope 1 + 2 emissions by 11%, with emissions of 8,146 tons of CO2.\n\nIn  2021, we redefined our science-based target for Scopes 1 and 2, aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C () scenario, and committed to reducing our direct emissions by 73% in 2024 compared to the 2019 emissions. By 2030, we  expect  to  achieve  carbon  neutrality  in  the  countries  where  we operate. We defined this goal based on the SBTi methodology.\n\nSince 2020, we have achieved carbon neutrality in Colombia thanks to our  energy  efficiency  strategies,  renewable  energy  consumption  in 100%  of  our  facilities  due  to  the  implementation  of  photovoltaic systems,  and  the  purchase  of  certified  renewable  energy  (REC).  In addition, we offset all of our Scope 1 and 3 emissions.\n\nDue to the purchase of certified renewable energy, we calculate our location-based and market-based footprint:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScope 1: Direct emissions associated with fossil fuel consumption in emergency power generation plants at our sites.\n\nScope 2: Indirect emissions associated with the electricity acquired for our operation.\n\nScope  3: Emissions  associated  with  our  paper consumption,  business  air  travel,  and  the logistics processes of our branches and buildings. We discuss our financed emissions in detail in a later chapter.\n\n| Year   | Scope 1   | Scope 2        | Scope 2      | Scope 1+2      | Scope 1+2    | Scope 3   | Total          | Total        | Variation      | Variation    | Total/Employee   | Total/Employee   | Variation      | Variation    |\n|--------|-----------|----------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|--------------|\n|        |           | Location Based | Market Based | Location Based | Market Based |           | Location Based | Market Based | Location Based | Market Based | Location Based   | Market Based     | Location Based | Market Based |\n| 2018   | 700       | 25,627         |              | 26,327         |              | 2,963     | 29,290         | 29,290       | -1%            | -1%          | 0.57             | 0.57             | -5%            | -5%          |\n| 2019   | 683       | 22,717         | 18,660       | 23,400         | 19,343       | 3,138     | 26,537         | 22,481       | -9%            | -23%         | 0.50             | 0.42             | -13%           | -26%         |\n| 2020   | 670       | 19,128         | 8,486        | 19,798         | 9,157        | 1,046     | 20,844         | 10,203       | -21%           | -55%         | 0.38             | 0.18             | -24%           | -56%         |\n| 2021   | 540       | 19,998         | 7,606        | 20,538         | 8,146        | 926       | 21,464         | 9,072        | 3%             | -11%         | 0.36             | 0.15             | -5%            | -18%         |",

        "page_content": "## Renewable Energy for All\n\nIn  2016,  Cindy  Prieto,  an  administrator,  and  her  husband,  Ian  Mart\u00ednez,  an architect, created Seca Energy in Panam\u00e1, a company specializing in designing, installing, maintaining, operating, and monitoring solar energy projects. They are the first ones in the country with German technology and warranty.  At first, it was a challenge as they had a good product, but not many people knew about the project. Thus, they had to teach people to publicize their business.\n\nCindy says: 'We got to the point where people already knew what a solar panel was.  We  sat  down  with  customers.  They  wanted  the  product  and  were interested in it. Although, when we got to the payment portion, they asked us if  we  financed  this  project.  That  was  out  of  the  question.  I  am  part  of  the Panamanian Chamber of Solar Energy board of directors, and we were always looking  for  a  way  to  finance  these  projects.  We  could  not  make  it  due  to guarantees issues and lack of knowledge.'\n\nAfter trying several options, Cindy received an email from In-Pactamos, a Grupo Bancolombia initiative committed to sustainable development and promoting a culture of entrepreneurship and innovation, accompanying and strengthening Colombian, Salvadoran, Panamanian, and Guatemalan companies on their path to economic, social, and environmental growth.\n\n'I got an email along the lines: Are you a woman? Are you an entrepreneur? Do you  have  a  sustainable  project?  I  replied  affirmatively.  I  am  a  woman,  an entrepreneur, and I work in renewable energy. So, I signed up.'\n\nCindy attended her first interview in a baggy dress as she was two months into her pregnancy with her second child. She was afraid of being excluded due to her situation. After passing the filter, she decided to inform them about her status. It was a relief for her to find out that it was not an inconvenience. The project was what mattered. It was very good.\n\n'I learned a lot with the In-Pactamos program. I learned about networking and how to present your business. I met more entrepreneurs. Most importantly, I could address the issue of financing for my clients' renewable energy projects. I made it because I could talk to people I never imagined from Banistmo.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI got an email along the lines: Are you a woman? Are you an entrepreneur? Do you have a sustainable project? I replied affirmatively. I am a woman, an entrepreneur, and I work in renewable energy. So, I signed up\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  first  project  that  they  financed  with  Banistmo  was  a  hospital.  Due  to energy  shocks,  it  had  an  annual  expenditure  of  40  thousand  dollars  on equipment  repair.  Additionally,  the  monthly  electricity  billing  expense  was about  10  thousand.  'With  the  installation  of  500  panels,  there  were exponential savings. The operating rooms were not affected when the power went out'.\n\n'When I sat down with the people from Banistmo to see financing options for this  project,  they  helped  me  a  lot.  We  almost  created  a  product  between leasing  and  credit.  We  were  an  alliance.  Now  it  is  working  perfectly.  They already have the purpose of doubling the size of the plant, and well, we also hope to do it with the Bank'.\n\nCindy and Ian realized that Seca Energy needed a new boost to grow and make their process more manageable during the pandemic. It was there that they turned to the financial institution. In fact,  Cindy's  company  was  one  of  the more than 300 that received credit thanks to issuing the first gender social bond issued by Banistmo to support female entrepreneurship in Panam\u00e1.\n\nThey acquired all the supplies and materials on-site with the funding. 'With the pandemic, we realized that the availability of parts is not a big deal. When they offered  us  a  container,  we  had  to  take  advantage  of  it  since  the  brand  we handle is being monopolized by the United States'.\n\nToday, Seca Energy has 15 employees. It seeks to recruit more women to install roofing systems, and Seca Energy expects to reach other countries. Among its milestones is constructing its first solar park with 2,500 panels. Now, they have the challenge of doubling it.",

In  Bancolombia,  under  our purpose of promoting sustainable economic development to make well-being a top priority for all, we have been people and companies' allies  in  their  project  development  and  through  grim  outlooks. We understand  their  state  of  affairs  and  offer  them  different  support measures.\n\nWe launched the Debtor Assistance Program (PAD, by its abbreviation in Spanish) in Colombia for Individuals, SMEs, businesses, freelancers, companies, and corporations that needed to redefine and facilitate the management of their obligations. With this program, customers could pay lower installments and  continue  to  meet  their commitments while addressing other difficulties they encountered. This  program  was  in  force  until  August  31,  2021.  More  than  1.1 million  loans  were  granted,  totaling  more  than  COP  20  trillion  in loans.\n\nAfter the PAD ended, we continued to offer alternatives for debtors since not all clients were back on track at the same pace. Thus, around 236,000  clients  (including  individuals,  SMEs,  and  companies)  who continued to struggle after the pandemic were given various options for  their  loans  between  September  and  December.  These  loans amount to COP 2.7 trillion.\n\nWe  also  disbursed  COP  3.9  trillion  in  leasing  to  renew  or  expand production and marketing capacity. Leaseback transactions for COP 510,107 billion were offered to provide liquidity to customers who already had assets paid for with their resources.\n\nOn  the  other  hand,  Banistmo  granted  grace  periods,  loan restructurings, quota reductions with term extensions, refinancing, and debt consolidation for individual and corporate clients.",

In  turn, the  projects  generate  a  positive  environmental impact. In 2021 we approved operations for COP 459,726  billion  and  disbursed  COP  178,171 billion.\n\n## Sustainable Livestock\n\nThrough  this  line,  we  finance  environmentally friendly  livestock  systems,  promoting  more productive systems and respecting forest areas and bodies of water. Through this line, we have provided loans for more than COP 11,916 billion to  farmers  seeking  to  invest  in  projects  that positively impact the environment.\n\nThe Fundaci\u00f3n Bancolombia has been an essential mechanism to execute initiatives aimed at the sustainable development of rural areas by strengthening businesses and projects, developing talent, and mobilizing resources and allies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We expect this will  result  in  the  implementation  of  sustainable  practices  on  16,000 hectares and the planting of 38,000 new trees in livestock systems.\n\nBeyond  our  financial  activity,  Fundaci\u00f3n  Grupo  Bancolombia  has  been  a critical  instrument  for  executing  different  initiatives  to  foster  rural  areas' sustainable development.

SMEs  are  essential  for  strengthening  the productive fabric and creating more development opportunities for our countries. Therefore, in Grupo Bancolombia, we support them in their different stages of life with financial and non-financial alternatives according to their needs.\n\nWe accompany more than 514,000 SMEs with an offer that meets  their  business  cycles  and  transactional  needs.  Aside from transactional channels, we also offer the essential tools (such as Plink and the alliance with BlueCaribu) to increase their sales and get to know their customers better.\n\nIn 2021 alone, we allocated COP 9.4 trillion to strengthen SMEs. We automatically issued 42,700 credit quotas for COP 4.8 trillion for SMEs as part of this initiative. They can use these resources whenever they need them. It is simple, and there is no need for credit analysis or additional procedures.\n\nAs part of the support to help businesses grow, Bancolombia's SMEs and client companies have a service to strengthen the management  of  their  companies  with  marketing,  process, and  financial  diagnostics.  Also,  personalized  consulting  for the definition and execution of action plans. We allied with Universidad CES of Medellin and its School of Administrative and  Economic  Sciences  to  accompany  the  entire  process through  a  business  management  model  that  includes financial and business decision simulation tools, mentoring, and intervention actions. This alliance began with 18 clients (11 of which were 100% sponsored by the bank, and 7 of them were 50% sponsored by the bank).\n\nMeanwhile,  small  businesses  in  Bogot\u00e1,  users  of  C\u00edvico Negocios,  have  access  to  many  of  our  solutions  (such  as credits for business growth, acceptance of different payment methods, QR codes, Wompi as a payment gateway, financial education  focused  on  small  businesses,  among  others)  to build a complete digital ecosystem.

Thus, we continue to advise our construction clients through an expert firm to guide them in selecting the appropriate certification for their projects and achieving the accreditation that certifies them as Sustainable Construction: EDGE, LEED, CASA Colombia, or HQE.\n\nThese consultancies are provided at no cost to our clients and are offered in Colombia and the Central American countries. A total of 209 projects have been approved in Colombia since the Sustainable  Construction  line  began  operating  in  2017  for about COP 4.6 trillion, of which 73 were approved in 2021 for about COP 2.1 trillion. In the same year, about COP 775 trillion was disbursed.\n\nLikewise, when an individual customer in Colombia acquires a home  through  a  mortgage  loan  or  housing  leasing  in  a sustainable project financed by Bancolombia, they are granted a benefit in the loan rate for the first 7 years of 65 basis points below the rate granted. In 2021, 964 clients benefited from this with disbursements of COP 106,000 billion, equivalent to an increase of 60% over the previous year.\n\nThe  projects  we  have  financed  and  supported  in  Colombia represent more than 10 million square meters certified, 3,000 tons of CO2 saved from being emitted into the atmosphere, and an average savings of around 5,000 megawatts of energy saved and more than 100,000 cubic meters of water saved.\n\nIn 2021 we expanded the scope of our financing benefits with our  Sustainable  Line  for  Sustainable  Individual  Builders (construction of own homes adhering to sustainability criteria) and sustainable renovations.\n\nAt BAM, we have the first line of credit focused on construction with sustainability standards. We have financed approximately Q112 million  for  projects  with  LEED  Silver,  EDGE,  and  CASA Guatemala certifications.\n\nIn Bancoagr\u00edcola, we have provided technical and commercial support  to  2  client  companies  with  housing  projects  in sustainable construction and industrial plants.

This project will allow our client Azimut, a company that provides energy consulting and services, to operate the installation and sell electricity.\n\nWe also carried out the first large-scale solar energy operation with financial leasing under a project finance structure for COP 52.3 billion to support the construction and operation of the Planeta Rica Solar Park in C\u00f3rdoba.\n\nThrough the Leasing Rent and Use strategic unit, we have considered the needs  of  our  clients  regarding  different  trends  in  the  energy  market, especially in terms of energy self-generation.\n\nAs a result, we realized that the leasing product for solar solutions is the most  efficient  and  profitable  alternative  for  customers  to  access  at  a competitive price and with the expert support of Grupo Bancolombia. This product  complements  our  value  proposition,  allows  us  to  impact  the fulfillment of the SDGs, and places us in the financial market as pioneers of these solutions.\n\nThus,  we  support  the  consolidation  of  energy  transition  through  the financing of different Non-Conventional Renewable Energy (NCRE) projects. We closed 6 projects with mandates for COP 600,000 billion, contributing to the energy matrix462 MW of new installed capacity in NCRE. Thus, we seek to  be  the  leading  bank  in  financing  these  projects.  We  will  continue  to support  this  energy  transition  in  the  short,  medium,  and  long  term  to contribute to achieving the decarbonization goals set in Colombia.\n\nBanistmo assumed the commitment to reducing energy consumption and using clean energies. As part of this, 50% of the energy consumption of its operation  comes  from  renewable  sources,  purchasing  Renewable  Energy Certificates.\n\n## This information includes financing under sustainable lines and rediscount lines in Colombia:\n\n| Technologies                                        | Funding  Amount     |   Power (Mw) | Annual Generation  (Mwh)   | Avoided Emissions  (TonCO 2 )   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Photovoltaic and  small hydroelectric  power plants | COP 193,081,359,253 |        165.7 | 192,470                    | 39,138                          |",

For example, through Renting, we have financed 1,766 clean fuel vehicles that avoid the emission of 40,307  tons  of  CO2,  while  through  leasing,  COP  1.28  trillion  was placed in decarbonization and technological reconversion initiatives.\n\nWe  supported  Bavaria  in  the  renewal  of  500  trucks  in  a  10-year process to incorporate more efficient mobility technologies that are less polluting to the environment.\n\nIn  2021  we  financed 235 businesses to acquire hybrid and electric vehicles.  151  have  already  been  disbursed  for  a  total  of  COP 48,538,051,844.\n\nWe developed two new products to promote sustainable mobility, the sustainable financing line and the sustainable line for short-term working capital. With the first one, importers of sustainable assets such as electric and hybrid vehicles will access financing in dollars and  rate  benefits  to  make  such  imports.  Thus,  encouraging  the supply of these types of assets in the country.\n\nWith the second product, we expect to support dealers who make recurring purchases of sustainable vehicles in the short term, offering them  a  credit  for  working  capital  with  a  rate  benefit.  Therefore, recognizing  their  contribution  to  sustainable  mobility.  We  could finance 6 projects with an amount of COP 13,196,208,270.\n\nBam  offers  Autoplan  Sostenible,  the  first  specialized  credit  for vehicles  focused  on  sustainable,  hybrid,  and  electric  mobility.  This has generated more than 260,000 transactions with an average of USD 316.32.\n\n## SUFI\n\nSUFI updated the sustainable mobility offer to include all brands and vehicle  sourcing  channels.  Likewise,  a  special  rate  offer  was consolidated for financing amounts over COP 80 million in hybrid and electric vehicles.\n\nIn 2021, SUFI launched financial plans with differential conditions for financing  hybrid  and  electric  vehicles,  such  as  the  ECO  and  the Sustainable Plan (Plan Sostenible).\n\nAdditionally, a customized financial offer was created with allies such as  BMW,  Mini,  and  Ford  so  that  customers  find  differential promotions. Thus, generating value for both the partner and the end customer.\n\nMore than COP 179,000 billion in sustainable vehicle financing was mobilized through the SUFI channel throughout the year. COP 615 million corresponded to motorcycles, COP 175,000 billion to hybrid vehicles,  and  COP  3,700  million  to  last-mile  vehicles  (electric  and traditional bicycles).\n\n## Muverang\n\nBy the end of 2021, with Muverang, our commitment to transform the way the world moves, more than 850 electric vehicles were put on the road in 5 cities in the country (Bogot\u00e1, Bucaramanga, Cali, Cartagena, and Medell\u00edn). In business contracts, we assisted 26 companies that put nearly 700 electric vehicles on the road to facilitate trips required by their operations or by their employees. On the other hand, under an innovative scheme of a monthly subscription to an electric vehicle for  individuals,  we  reached  1,400  subscriptions,  serving  600  new customers,  and  approaching  our  ambition  to  democratize  electric mobility  in  the  country.  On  the  other  hand,  under  the  innovative scheme of a monthly subscription to an electric vehicle for individuals, we  reached  1,400  subscriptions,  serving  600  new  customers,  and approaching our business ambition to democratize electric mobility in the country.\n\nAs  for  the  digital  services  offered  by  Muverang,  we  reached  6 companies  with  cab  modules  (for  private  travel)  and  sustainable mobility (to share a vehicle with other users on the same route). These services  promote  more  efficient,  sustainable,  and  shared  mobility. More than 1,600 users made nearly 36,000 trips with both solutions. In addition, we opened two additional channels for requesting these services. These are now available on the NEQUI and SURA applications.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Despite the contingency  of  vehicle  availability  globally,  it  has  established  business  for  more  than  300 additional electric vehicles by the beginning of 2022. In other words, the company will place 2,000 different  sustainable  cars.  40%  of  the  vehicles  will  be  hybrids  (between  non-plug-in  HEV  and plug-in PHEV), 52% electric (EV), and the remainder on gas due to the absence of technologies in heavy and long distances vehicles. Everything is aligned with the plan to reach 2025 with an active electric fleet of more than 6,000 vehicles.\n\n- Renting Colombia reported 1,382 active sustainable vehicles at the end of 2021, including 800 hybrids (gasoline-electric and diesel-electric), 147 natural gas vehicles, and 435 100% electric vehicles.\n- Renting Colombia placed 756 electric vehicles between trucks, hybrids, and dedicated gas in 2021.\n\n## Electrolinera Sabaneta:\n\nThe first fast-charging station in Latin America emerged as an innovative solution for customers with electric vehicles and the means to charge their vehicles, charging a fee for the time the customer occupies the space of the charging unit. Thus, maximizing the use of electric vehicles while meeting logistical needs.\n\n- In 2021, nearly 1,348 charging cycles occurred, for consumption of 154,500 kW, equivalent to 500,000 km of autonomy in zero-emission vehicles.\n\n<!-- image -->",

By the end of 2021, the initiative enrolled around 400 financial institutions.\n\nGlasgow Financial Alliance for Net- Zero (GFANZ) is a global coalition of leading financial institutions committed to accelerating economic decarbonization, bringing together around 450 financial institutions in 40  countries  responsible  for  approximately  USD  90 trillion assets.\n\nFor the second consecutive year, we are reporting our climate change management and performance per the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial  Disclosure  (TCFD).    The  TCFD  is  organized around  four  core  pillars:  Governance,  Strategy,  Risk Management, and Metrics and Targets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2021, disbursements of $4.6bn were made with implications for CO2 emissions reduction of 160,345 TonCO2. We also launched the credit tied to sustainable performance. Thus, we can support our clients transitioning to a low-carbon economy, incorporate sustainability into their strategy and achieve better standards in their  sustainability indicators.

Therefore, this risk is included in the company's corporate risk dashboard. We incorporate and analyze two types of risks within this risk, physical and transition risks.   In 2021, we evaluated physical risks using a methodology developed by the risk methodologies team.  This valuation was performed in credit, market, and operational risk.

Every year, he generates about five million white and red roses from its two farms  in  Cajic\u00e1,  Cundinamarca.  These  are  primarily  exported  to  the  United States, England, and Spain.\n\nOrlando explains that \"Valentine's Day is the day of love in the countries we export flowers to. This represents 60% of our annual sales, followed by Mother's Day  with  20%  and  the  other  20%  corresponding  to  the  remainder  of  the production,\"\n\nNevertheless, the pandemic hit. That was a heavy blow for its business. 'We had to discard a million roses because customers canceled their orders, and florists shut  down.'  Orlando  could  not  help  but  think  about  the  nearly  113  people directly working for him at the time. They are the backbone of his business. He couldn't imagine stripping away the livelihoods of their families.\n\nThe first bank that Orlando went to was Bancolombia. He already had several financial products with the bank. He was informed about the payroll plans that were being granted. He signed up and obtained credits for six months.  \"It was a relief. Our main concern was the payroll, and we got it covered. So, we focused on creating plans and overcoming the situation. Although we had to implement other strategies, we did not have to lay off any employees. We had to approve early vacation, leaves, and schedule rotation. However, we did not have not to reduce salaries. We paid on the exact day and did not have any layoffs.\"\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn Mother's Day 2020, we lost 100% of our rose production due to the pandemic, almost a million flowers representing 20% of our annual sales. However, through Bancolombia's support, we survived and kept all our jobs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  July  2020,  after  the  first  months  of  the  pandemic,  Orlando  resumed  rose production  and  soon  recovered  his  business  momentum.  \"The  pandemic increased floriculture, not in acres, but consumption. People started to spend more time at home, and all they wanted was flowers. After the pandemic, many people kept that habit, which made our lives more pleasant.\"\n\nThe  flower  industry  generates  around  150,000  direct  jobs  in  Colombia.  This industry  has  faced  several  crises  that  require  renewing  and  creating  new strategies to compete in the international market. \"In all fairness, the flower industry has experienced many crises. Undoubtedly, one of the toughest was the pandemic. Nonetheless, this is a very resilient, open-to-change industry. In the end, this industry relies on the foreign market. We depend on what those consumers demand, so we must be open to change. I received support from the bank and several farmers because we were also informed about the different assistance available for the sector.\"",

Through this channel, 313,707 accounts were opened in 2021, equivalent to 23.8% of the total number of accounts opened through the year.\n\nIn addition, we increased the limits for sending international money transfers from USD 5,000 per day to USD 10,000 per day with  no  limit  on  the  number  of  transactions  to  improve customers' experience making international transfers through the Sucursal Virtual Personas (People's Virtual Branch).",

Thus, a means for learning more about the behavior of people who invest in this type of asset. Also, to operate correctly between banks and exchanges.\n\nWe expect to link some of our clients through different phases. They are selected according to risk and digitality indicators until we reach 5,000 by the end of 2022, the maximum enabled by the regulator. These clients will trade  cryptocurrencies  directly  with  Gemini  and  use  their  savings  or checking accounts and our digital channels for the process. We are currently in  the  initial  phase.  Thus  far,  654  people  are  participating  (cut-off  date January 2022).\n\nAt  Bancoagr\u00edcola,  we  designed  a  credit  card  without  membership. Customers  can  purchase  all  they  want  without  formalities  and  charges involved  in  membership.  Almost  6,000  cards  have  been  issued,  and transactions have been made for USD 1.3 million.\n\nWe are enabling technological capabilities for the construction of APIs to continue supporting the transformation and innovation of the business. In the APIs,  different IT architects, business analysts, and developers who need to develop a new technological solution can learn about all the necessary documentation,  the  mechanisms  required  to  use  them,  and  the environments needed to test these APIs.\n\nAPIs facilitate digital innovation transformation of businesses, as they are readily available for re-use and accessibility, facilitating the reuse of business capabilities.  They  also  facilitate  the  integration  of  third  parties  with  the organization,  such  as  startups  and  fintech,  which  will  access  the  bank's capabilities  in  a  more  standardized  and  simple  way.  Thus,  promoting  the development  of  strategies  such  as  Open  Banking  and  the  exposure  of banking services to third parties (Banking as a Service).\n\nFor example, if a third party wants a transfer service between Bancolombia accounts in their online sales, they do not have to develop it from scratch. Still, they can use the Bancolombia Button API, in which all the necessary features to use it and the requirements for them to use it in their web portal (External API) have already been outlined.\n\nAlternatively, should any of our teams decide to improve any of our financial services, they will not need to worry about developing a system that can validate  whether  or  not  a  customer  can  receive  a  loan  but  can  use  the Accounts API, which already has a standardized solution for this need. This gives the team greater agility and focuses on designing new services or the environment in which they work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The first 50 deposits made by our customers  per  month  are  free  of  charge,  regardless  of  the  city  from  which  they  are  made, through multifunctional ATMs, physical branches, or correspondent banking.\n\nThe increase in customers and transactions brings a greater volume of requirements. Thus, we have  adopted  intelligent  alliances,  robots,  and  process  assistants  to  expand  our  installed capacity to handle questions, complaints, and claims effectively. As a result, service times were reduced from 14 to 4 days. We achieved 96% compliance with our customer promise. In addition, we anticipate our customers' needs and concerns, identifying the root causes that generate the requirements to improve the experience.\n\nConsequently, the number of incoming QCCs decreased by 17% compared to the previous year. To facilitate handling requests related to the linking and management of new developments of our construction clients, we provided a digital solution for direct communication between the salesrooms and our Trust Business Services Management. Hence, reducing time and improving the experience. Thus, our clients are already using the \"Sales Room Link\". This has become a distinctive element for selecting Fiduciaria Bancolombia.\n\nLikewise, by connecting the Construction and People segments, we further the home buying process for our customers. We implemented a pilot program for the salesroom to evaluate clients interested in the projects financed by the bank so that approvals can be made in five minutes. Thus, supporting our construction clients in the financial closing of their projects and reducing the  operability  of  sales  representatives  by  filling  out  only  15  fields  for  the  execution  of  an application.\n\nIn  addition,  we  set  a  milestone  with  the  first  digital  deed  in  Medell\u00edn.  We  can  integrate  the different actors (buyer, seller, lawyer, notary, and trustee), making the process simple, brief, and there  is  no  need  for  traveling  since  the  deed  is  generated  digitally  and  does  not  require attendance for the signing of documents, payment of notary fees, rent and registration.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConsequently, we offer a fully digital and self-manageable channel where our clients can monitor the status of their mortgage or leasing application.\n\nIn another context, when customers experience fraud situations, it is vital to provide support to understand the problem and resolve it on a case-by-case basis. For this reason, several actions were taken to improve customer service processes, offering agile and timely solutions. Creating a new  hotline  for  fraud  cases,  the  redefinition  of  more  concrete  and  more  precise  scripts,  and adjustments in customer information entry reduce service times and deliver an online solution for 97% of the cases.\n\nWe  created  a  technological  solution  to  provide  immediate  guided  advice  to  legal  concerns presented  by  commercial  and  requirements  teams  to  deliver  balances  without  probate proceedings. With this solution, we have automated 85% of the queries from the branches to the legal team, benefiting more than 17,500 customers and their families in just 11 months. This tool has been the starting point for transforming Grupo Bancolombia's legal services.\n\nWith the portal of embargoes and disbursements, we automated 65% of the legal documents received, reducing the operational risk of COP 5,000 billion and increasing the speed by 85%. Additionally, we achieved a 96.81% timeliness in applying disbursements, thanks to automation through RPA, helping customers normalize their deposit accounts.\n\nColombians abroad also play a fundamental role in economic reactivation. We have improved the experience  in  the  savings  account  opening  process,  reducing  costs,  reducing  the  number  of documents required from 6 to 4, and reducing response times. Today, more Colombians abroad have an account with Bancolombia. We started opening 347 accounts on average per month in 2020 to 693 accounts in 2021 with the new process, representing an increase of 50.07%.\n\nAnother significant milestone that our clients value is that we went significantly reduced the time to open an account from approximately 30 days to 5 days. In addition, we have supported them in their projects to own real estate in Colombia as an investment or for their family. In 2021, we granted them COP 382,210 billion in mortgage loans, 88% more than in 2020.",

As a result, his vision. His left leg was amputated. At that moment, at the age of 25, he set out to continue with his life and find a purpose. He says: 'My family's support was the reason to move forward. I realized that life goes on. After that moment, I began to look for alternatives to continue being useful to  society  and  my  loved  ones.  That  is  when  I  came  across  the  option  of becoming a professional.'\n\nIn 2011, Oliverio began studying law at Universidad de Medell\u00edn after a lengthy rehabilitation process. He did not stop when he graduated. He specialized in Real Estate Law and Urban Management.\n\nOliverio  had  sent  his  resume  to  one  of  Bancolombia's  calls  for  applications through a Universidad de Los Andes program, where contacts were made with executives, businesspeople, entrepreneurs, and many people.  'I went through the  selection  process  just  like  everyone  else.  My  dream  was  to  practice  my profession and expand my knowledge through practice. Bancolombia was the entity  that  gave  me  that  opportunity  without  excluding  me  because  of  my disabilities.  I  have  grown  professionally  and  personally  in  these  months  I've been there.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI am practicing two of my passions here, learning and helping others. When I advise clients and Bancolombia grants a housing loan to a client, we are helping fulfill dreams. That is special to me. I feel that I am contributing to society.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHis adaptation process in the organization has been excellent. He has complied with  his  functions.  Within  a  matter  of  months,  Oliverio  has  become  fully independent. The Bank provided him with a computer and the installation of Jaws  software.  He  can  access  the  Teams  tool,  through  which  he  receives requests and provides advice. He has the support of his colleagues when he needs it. 'I am practicing two of my passions here, learning and helping others. When I advise clients and Bancolombia grants a housing loan to a client, we are helping fulfill  dreams.  That  is  special  to  me.  I  feel  that  I  am  contributing  to society.'\n\nAs  a  result,  this  new  opportunity  has  changed  Oliverio's  life  and  his environment, his family, and those who support him at every stage of his life. He considers himself a resilient person and hopes to be an example for people who have a disability and still do not believe in what they can achieve. 'I am one of  the  many  testimonies  that  people  with  disabilities  can  participate  in  the labor  market.  Nowadays,  the  issue  of  inclusion  demonstrates  this  through business  groups  and  employers  who  have  allowed  us  to  support  them  in managing  their  companies.'  Bancolombia  today  has  a  labor  inclusion  policy that seeks to promote the welfare of all people and contribute to building a better future in which everyone has the same opportunities because we are convinced that every human being makes a difference.",

Through  it,  we promote hybrid work in an organizational context. We attract and develop the best talent through flexibility, trust, and well-being.\n\nAt the end of 2021, more than 7,000 administrative employees throughout the country (54%) returned to the administrative headquarters under the hybrid work modality and the characteristics of the flexible work scheme of which the person is a part. By the first quarter of 2022, we expect to complete the return stage and hope that more than 6,600 employees will join the TrabajoB experience.\n\nWe  also  believe  that  workspace  diversity  strengthens  relationships  and  drives extraordinary results. Thus, we have a workspace reservation system called BWork. Now, our offices will be open spaces. When we are there, we can locate in different spots of the organization according to the activities we need to perform. So, we seek to promote diversity, collaboration, and integration of individuals and teams.\n\nWith this statement, we continue with the massification of flexible work schemes, which  adapt  to  the  needs  of  employees  and  the  market.  We  contribute  to  the balance  between  work  and  personal  life.  We  contribute  to  constructing  more sustainable cities. At the end of 2021, 6,509 employees enrolled in flexible work schemes  like  teleworking  in  its  four  modalities  (supplementary,  autonomous, commercial, and administrative mobile) and flexiwork.",

We proudly declared the behaviors that set apart the 30,000 employees of Grupo Bancolombia. We know that the organization's talent will contribute to materializing our purpose and strategy. MovimientoB embodies our essence. It is what describes  us  as  an  organization.  It  is  what  fuels  our culture.\n\nWith MovimientoB, we seek the necessary contexts so that  integrity,  human  beings,  clients,  sustainable growth, dynamism, and extraordinary performance are the employees' traits in our organization. MovimientoB is  also  about behaviors that we do not tolerate as an organization as they drive us away from our purpose.\n\nUp  to  now,  21,188  people  have  participated  in MovimientoB workshops (70.6% from Grupo Bancolombia).  Thus,  being  inspired  and  connecting with  the  traits  that  set  us  apart  from  others. Additionally, 18,170  employees  have  visited  the MovimientoB website and its contents.\n\nToday,  the  Human  Management  processes  are  fully aligned  with  MovimientoB  and  L\u00edderB  (performance management,  selection,  career  path,  compensation, training  schools,  Leadership  Institute,  training,  and Induction).\n\nAlong with this statement, we also express our leaders' responsibilities  because  we  know  that  they  are  the ones  who  set  the  culture  in  motion  and  accompany others  in  their  development  journey  to  achieve  the strategy and purpose. For Grupo Bancolombia, a L\u00edderB (B Leader) is a leader committed to the organization's purpose, strategy, and culture to obtain extraordinary results  and  build  the  future  while  facilitating  the development of people in collaboration and well-being environments.\n\nThis strategy provides our leaders with the necessary tools to strengthen and adapt to their responsibilities. Therefore, in 2021, we trained more than 3,400 leaders in the Leadership Institute (Instituto de Liderazgo). To achieve statement adoption, we had 1,367 leaders in the  #YosoyL\u00edderB  (#I'maBLeader)  conversations.  With 12  leaders  sharing  their  leadership  experiences  and 12,609 attendees, we have developed the Leaders that Inspire initiative, the most  innovative  space  of MovimientoB's anniversary week.\n\nAs  a  cultural  mobilization  strategy  with  leaders  as spokespersons,  we  consolidated  MinutosB  as  an initiative for leaders to accompany the development of their teams with crucial information about our culture and adoption of expected behaviors. 35 deliveries were made (20 more than planned) to almost 3,000 leaders and, through them, to 23,000 employees.\n\nIn addition, to make L\u00edderB a leadership style in Grupo Bancolombia, we created the Open Leadership Portfolio, which seeks to develop leadership as an organizational and future capacity. This portfolio has more than 40 programs that employees can use for self-learning.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUp to now,\n\npeople have participated in MovimientoB workshops.",

With BEM, we have transformed the way we work. We have aligned people, structure, processes, and technology to the bank's strategy so is more efficient and delivers exceptional experiences to customers and society promptly.\n\nIn 2021, the organizational structure was changed. We have  created  agile  teams  where  day-to-day  work  is joined with transformation to bring value flows to life. Prioritization, budgeting, and talent processes such as selection, performance management, and career plans were  adjusted.    The  way  teams  (responsible  for generating  business  solutions)  interact  was  also modified.  This  process  included  the  accompaniment and training of more than 5,300 employees with agile knowledge to move forward with this evolution.  22,000 employees  were  impacted  by  communications  and events  that  strengthened  our  organization's  cultural traits and behaviors.\n\nAlong  with  this  evolution,  we  began  with  the Commercial Network Renewal, a model that revitalizes and refreshes Bancolombia's physical network and its commercial  dynamics.  It  is  an  accelerating  project  to fulfill our purpose, provide superior customer experiences,  materialize  the  strategy,  and  drive  the organization's cultural transformation. Through MovimientoB  and  L\u00edderB,  we  adopt  and  express  new behaviors  that  will  help  us  refocus  the  delivery  of financial and non-financial solutions. Thus, promoting sustainable economic development to make well-being a top  priority  for  all.  Aside  from  it,  reflecting customer-centric decisions, implementing greater dynamism, and strengthening extraordinary performance as fundamentals, being our forces drivers of integrity, human beings, and sustainable growth.\n\nAs of this date, 60% of the Branch Network has been impacted by massification, reaching 4,303 employees in  the  system  and  667  in  independent  offices.  The project has been highly accepted by employees and has improved in waiting times of 30 minutes in counseling compared to the offices that have not been impacted.\n\nMerco recognized Bancolombia as the company with the best reputation in the country and the best for attracting talent.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As  a  sign  of  this commitment, we declare the Equity, Diversity,  and  Inclusion Policy.

Remediation measures were immediately implemented.\n\nAll cases are investigated under strict parameters of neutrality and confidentiality.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Therefore,  since  2009  we  have  worked  to  improve  their performance continuously. To meet this objective, we initially defined the inclusion  of  a  sustainability  clause  in  all  contracts  with  suppliers  and contractors, which includes a commitment to respect human rights.\n\nWe  also  have  the  Code  of  Ethics,  the  ethics  hotline  for  suppliers  and strategic partners. They can report any violation of human rights, unethical or illegal practices, or other infractions that Grupo Bancolombia does not condone.\n\nSince 2016 we improved the measurement model of suppliers and strategic partners against their sustainable performance, using the \"Measure What Matters\" tool of Sistema B.  In 2021, 118 suppliers were evaluated with this tool,  allowing  them  to  know  their  economic,  social,  and  environmental impact, including Human Rights criteria.\n\nTo learn more,\n\nclick here\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn all our contracts with suppliers and contractors, we include a sustainability clause to fulfill our commitment to respect human rights.",

This assurance engagement was performed by a multidisciplinary team that includes assurance professionals and sustainability specialists.\n\n## Criteria\n\nThe criteria used by Grupo Bancolombia to prepare the Management Report, which is subject of the limited assurance report, were established considering the terms and conditions set forth in the GRI Standards as well as  the  GRI  Financial  Services  Sector  Supplement  and  with  the  modified  indicators  that  the  Administration defined  as  a  complement  to  what  is  established  by  GRI  and  additionally,  indicators  defined  by  the Administration  as  its  own,  which  are  detailed  in  Appendix  A  attached.  In  addition,  the  Company  used  the existing  frameworks  associated  with  the  Green  Bond  Principles  (GBP),  Social  Bond  Principles  (SBP)  and Sustainability Bond Guidelines (SBG) of the International Capital Markets Agency (ICMA) in its 2021 version, which are detailed in Annex B, for the reporting of information related to the post-issuance of the Green and Sustainable Bonds of Grupo Bancolombia.\n\nDeloitte & Touche Ltda.

This responsibility includes  the  design,  implementation,  and  maintenance  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  preparation  of  a Management Report statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Management Report is subject to inherent uncertainty due to the use of non-financial information which is subject to higher inherent limitations than financial information, given the nature of the methods used to determine, calculate, sample, or estimate such information. In the preparation of the Management Report, Management  makes  qualitative  interpretations  about  the  relevance,  materiality  and  accuracy  of  the information that are subject to assumptions and judgments.\n\n## Our independence and quality control\n\nWe have complied with the ethical and independence requirements of the Code of Professional Ethics of the Public Accountant issued by the International Ethics Standard Board for Accountants (IESBA), which is based on the principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality, and professional behavior.\n\nDeloitte se refiere a Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, sociedad privada de responsabilidad limitada en el Reino Unido, a su red de firmas miembro y sus entidades relacionadas, cada una de ellas como una entidad legal \u00fanica e independiente.

We conducted our limited assurance work in accordance with to the existing frames of reference associated with the Green Bond Principles (GBP), Social Bond  Principles  (SBP),  Sustainability  Bond  Guidelines  (SBG),  the  \"International  Standard  for  Assurance Engagements, Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\" ISAE 3000 - Revised, issued by the  International  Auditing  and  Assurance  Standards  Board  (IAASB).  Such  standard  requires  us  to  plan  and conduct our work to obtain limited assurance as to whether the information in the Management Report is free of material error.\n\nThe procedures we conducted were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of the processes performed, inspection of documentation, analytical procedures, assessment of the adequacy of quantification methods and reporting policies, and agreement or reconciliation with the underlying records.\n\nGiven the circumstances of the engagement, we have performed the following procedures:\n\n- a. Through inquiries, we gained an understanding of Grupo Bancolombia's control environment and relevant information systems, but we did not evaluate the design of specific control activities or obtain evidence on their implementation, nor test their operational effectiveness.\n- b. Understanding of the processes and tools used to generate, aggregate and report non-financial information through inquiries with those responsible for related processes.\n- c. Substantive testing, based on a sample basis, of sustainability information identified by Grupo Bancolombia, to  determine  the  indicators  subject  to  limited  assurance  and  verify  that  the  data  have  been  adequately measured, recorded, collected, and reported through:\n- \u00b7 Inspection of policies and procedures established by the Company.\n- \u00b7 Inspection of supporting documentation of internal and external sources.\n- \u00b7 Recalculation.\n- \u00b7 Comparison of the contents presented by Management with what is established in the criteria section of this report.\n- d. Information and samples were requested on the post-issuance of Grupo Bancolombia's Green and Sustainable Bonds and their alignment with the principles of the International Capital Markets an Association (ICMA) in its 2021 version:\n- \u00b7 Use of Proceeds.\n- \u00b7 Process for Project Evaluation and Selection.\n- \u00b7 Management of Proceeds.\n- \u00b7 Reporting (as of December 31, 2021).\n\nThe Appendix A to this report details the sustainability performance standards and indicators included in the scope of our work. The Appendix B details the resources of the issuances of the Green and Sustainable Bonds.\n\nOur  limited  assurance  engagement  was  performed  only  with  respect  to  the  sustainability  performance disclosures included in the table above, for the year ended December 31st, 2021; and we have not performed any procedures with respect to previous years, projections and future targets, or any other items included in the Management Report for the year ended December 31st, 2021, and therefore we do not express a conclusion thereon.",

The  scope  of  limited  assurance  engagement  is  substantially  less  than  reasonable  assurance engagement in relation to both risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, as well as procedures performed in response to the risks assessed. Therefore, we do not express a reasonable assurance conclusion as to whether the information in the Company's sustainability information report has been prepared in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria of the provisions of the criteria section of this report.\n\nWe  believe  that  the  evidence  we  have  obtained  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our conclusion.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the work we have done, the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that would lead us to believe that the sustainability performance standards and indicators for the year ended December 31st, 2021, have not complied in all material respects, as established in the criteria section of this report.\n\n## Restriction of use\n\nOur report is issued solely for the purpose set forth in the first paragraph and should not be used for any other purpose or distributed to other parties on its own. This report refers only to the matters mentioned in the preceding sections and to the sustainability information identified and does not extend to any other financial and  non-financial  information  included  in  Grupo  Bancolombia's  Management  Report  for  the  year  ended December 31st, 2021, nor to its financial statements, taken as a whole.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Grupo  Bancolombia  is  responsible  for  the investment process; our responsibility is to express an opinion on the use of resources based on our review.\n\nThe commitment with the Bond purchasers is that the resources are fully invested at the end of each year until the final term of the Sustainable Bond.
