SSE provides energy needed today while building a better world of energy for tomorrow. We develop, build, operate and invest in low-carbon electricity infrastructure in support of the transition to net zero. This includes onshore and offshore wind, hydro power, flexible thermal generation, electricity transmission and distribution networks, and localised energy systems. We also provide energy products and services for businesses and other customers.\n\n## Using our complete reporting suite\n\nThroughout this report you can find links to our complementary suite of reporting by following these icons:\n\n- \uf295 online at sse.com/annualreport2022\n\n\uf223\n\nin other SSE publications\n\n- \uf150 within another section of this report\n\n## Electronic tagging (ESEF)\n\nIn accordance with European Single Electronic Format ('ESEF') requirement that UK-listed companies provide their primary financial statements in standardised machine-readable format, SSE's 2022 Annual Report and Accounts are published as an XHTML tagged document which can be found on sse.com \uf295\n\n## Our front cover\n\nJennifer Ross, one of SSE Renewables' maintenance engineers on the Sloy/Awe hydro scheme, pictured at Loch Sloy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Alternative Performance Measures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSSE assesses the performance of the Group using a variety of performance measures. These measures are not all defined under IFRS and are therefore termed 'non-GAAP' measures. A reconciliation from these non-GAAP measures to the nearest prepared measure in accordance with IFRS is presented and described on pages 204 to 212 \uf150 . The Alternative Performance Measures SSE uses might not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\n## Measurement restatements\n\nThe Annual Report reflects a number of structural changes within SSE plc in this reporting year. These include the disposal of its Contracting and Rail business; the formation NEOS Networks, a standalone joint venture Telecoms business; and the sale of SSE's stake in SGN. In addition, the report measures progress against 2030 Goals as were prior to their revision in early 2022.",

These combined to create extraordinary energy market volatility, security of supply concerns, affordability challenges, operational complexities and financial distress in the value chain. Through it all SSE delivered on its purpose and demonstrated resilience and growth potential continuing to establish the Group as a clean energy champion in the UK and Ireland.\n\nWithin this report, we aim for high standards of disclosure to help our stakeholders understand how we create value and fulfil our social contract. As part of that, we set out how my fellow Directors and I have exercised our duties under Section 172 of the Companies Act to promote the long-term success of the Company with consideration to the views of all stakeholders.\n\nFor SSE, that means being a purpose-led company that seeks profitable solutions to the problems faced by people and our planet - and we were tested on both fronts during 2021/22.\n\n## Resilience through turbulence\n\nIt was a year which highlighted the distinct but interrelated challenges facing the energy sector. First, the climate crisis was strongly in focus as the UK hosted COP26 where SSE was a proud Principal Partner. Soon afterwards, concerns over affordability and the cost of living intensified with Ofgem announcing a significant increase to the\n\nlevel of the energy price cap in Great Britain, and prices also increasing in Ireland, reflecting soaring wholesale gas prices. And, latterly, energy security has been in sharp focus as the world responds to Russia's deeply concerning aggression in Ukraine.\n\nOperationally there have also been challenges, with an ever-changing outlook on the coronavirus pandemic, market volatility and extreme weather events. Throughout all this the Company has shown resilience, responsiveness, and continued strong performance that is described in the following pages.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of SSE's c.11,000 employees, whether working in the field, in offices or, indeed, at home, for their efforts over this challenging year in ensuring SSE fulfilled its purpose of providing energy needed today while building a better world of energy for tomorrow.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe approximate amount being invested daily by SSE as part of the Net Zero Acceleration Programme\n\n\u00a37m\n\n## Strategic evolution\n\nThe transition to net zero will require accelerating investments in the kind of low-carbon assets and infrastructure which already form the core of our business. The operating context is moving quickly as the requirements of net zero come into focus, and competitors and governments move fast to position themselves for success. A desire to strengthen energy security in many countries of the world in light of recent events accelerates this further and creates even greater potential for investment and growth in electrification and renewable energy.

        "page_content": "' In the context of the climate emergency, it is vital that we align our activities with a pathway consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, and to recognised global frameworks. For that reason, we are proud to have enhanced our 2030 goals this year, which are aligned with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.'\n\npurpose is vital in guiding decision-making and this was central for the Board as we carried out the strategic review that culminated in SSE's Net Zero Acceleration Programme, published in November.\n\nOver a period of several months, we undertook a comprehensive process to identify the strategic response to this changing environment that would enable SSE to fulfil its potential and optimise value for shareholders and society. Recent events in Ukraine have served to strengthen and reinforce the conclusions.\n\nWe have continued to reshape the Group, divesting our investments in gas production and gas distribution, while focusing and accelerating investments into renewables, including international opportunities. We see substantial investments required to build networks for net zero, flexible generation and storage technologies including pumped hydro storage, solar and batteries. And we see increased opportunities for lower-carbon thermal generation as part of the energy mix. SSE has options in every part of the net zero electricity infrastructure value chain.\n\nThese are all growth businesses and the potential in new geographies is significant as we have seen through our recent expansion into the Japanese offshore and Southern European onshore wind markets. There is more to come as we continue to evolve, but our Net Zero Acceleration Programme means we have a clear, fully-funded plan that will create real value over the next five years and set us up for further growth later in the decade.\n\nThe landscape will continue to change at pace and we therefore view the Net Zero Acceleration Programme as the beginning, not the end, of our strategic evolution.\n\n## Holding ourselves accountable\n\nIn the context of the climate emergency, it is vital that we align our activities with a pathway consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, and to recognised global frameworks. For that reason, we are proud to have enhanced our 2030 Goals this year, which are aligned with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nBut it is also paramount that our shareholders' views are heard on our progress towards net zero. We published our Net Zero Transition Plan in March and now we have to progress it. We recognise that there is a long way to go and we don't yet have all the answers; but the plan gives our best current view and, critically, is open about the challenges to enable constructive debate. We look forward to receiving shareholder feedback ahead of the AGM in July.\n\nA big part of holding ourselves accountable is taking a leadership position on disclosure. We adopted TCFD reporting ahead of time on a voluntary basis back in 2018 and will continue to be proactive in our reporting. This Strategic Report builds on the work done in recent years to maximise the transparency of our stakeholder interactions and delivery of our social contract.\n\nA critical stakeholder group is SSE's employees, and the Board continued to engage regularly with them through the year. I've been struck by the strength of SSE's culture, and it is clearly an important factor in the Company's resilience to the challenges that have been posed in the recent past. We remain determined to become an even more diverse and inclusive company and more details on our efforts in that respect are set out later in this report.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nIt is clear that global ambition for a clean energy transition that can deliver net zero while bolstering energy security and maintaining affordable prices will only intensify. SSE sits at the heart of that set of challenges, and our portfolio is fully aligned with the opportunities which will emerge. We will remain agile and focused on value creation within that context, and we will meet our purpose of providing energy needed today while building a better world of energy for tomorrow.\n\nTo close, I can confirm that this Strategic Report and the associated Section 172 Statement on page 110 \uf150 have been approved by the Board in line with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nSir John Manzoni Chair, SSE plc 24 May 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSSE's culture, and the people who underpin it such these apprentices at Peterhead power station, are the key to the Group's ongoing success.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are putting the investment plans within our Net Zero Acceleration Programme to work, pursuing growth options and spending nearly \u00a37m a day on the clean electricity infrastructure that is so important to tackling climate change.\n\nProgress made in 2021/22 gives us confidence in our strategic direction and optimism about meeting the ambitious new 2030 Goals set out on pages 18 and 19 \uf150 . But the year had challenges too: it presented us with uncertainty and day-to-day restrictions brought by the coronavirus outbreak, a post-pandemic energy crisis exacerbated by war in Europe and exceptional weather events that tested the resilience of our electricity distribution networks.\n\n## The right people\n\nThrough it all SSE's direct employees and contractors have stuck to the task of providing energy needed today while\n\nbuilding a better world of energy for tomorrow. With the rest of the executive team, I'm immensely proud of the way our colleagues have responded and very grateful for what they have achieved.\n\nKeeping those people out of harm's way remains our number one priority and we go into 2022/23 with a renewed focus on safety and wellbeing after a year of increased operational activity unfortunately saw 14 more injuries than in 2020/21.\n\nOur skilled and increasingly diverse c.11,000-strong workforce is central to our success and as we grow we need even more people. We will be creating 1,000 new jobs a year on average over the course of our five-year capex plan. These are critical, high-quality jobs in regional areas, in many cases transitioning skilled people from high-carbon to low-carbon roles.\n\nWe have the right management too, with business leaders who are the best in their fields, including new, highly-experienced managing directors bringing renewed delivery impetus to SSE Renewables and SSE Thermal.\n\n## The right business mix\n\nOnce again a resilient mix of market-based and economically-regulated businesses shielded the Group against the worst of the shocks reverberating through the economy.\n\nSSE's business model is based around the assets and capabilities required for the global transition to an electrified, net zero system. This is the result of the highly successful disposals programme and targeted investments which have created a group with the capabilities and projects to create value right across the clean electricity value chain. SSE is an ESG-aligned growth investment opportunity; with an attractive blend of regulated and market-based income streams across a very deliberately chosen, integrated mix of businesses\n\nThrough these businesses, we continued to work on long-term solutions to problems faced by the sector that have been brought into stark relief by geopolitical events. As policymakers are seeking to break the link between global energy markets and the cost of living, our investment in indigenous, lowercarbon power sources and greater flexibility is decarbonising the energy system, reducing dependence on imported gas and supporting a just transition to net zero.\n\nIn a year of strategic delivery high points, it was perhaps fitting that it closed with the completion of our SGN stake sale, marking",

        "page_content": "the end of a disposals programme that helped us refocus the Group to better deliver on our purpose.\n\nIt was against this backdrop that we were able to engage actively from our leadership position as a national clean energy champion at the COP26 summit in Glasgow. We came away from the event with the firm conviction that our strategy is the right one for meeting the challenges of holding global warming to a 1.5\u00b0C pathway and creating opportunities for sustainable growth.\n\n## Realising Renewables' ambition\n\nSome of those opportunities are in markets abroad and, as described on page 25 \uf150 , SSE Renewables' ambitions are taking shape in Japan, the US, and most recently in Southern Europe where we are securing a foothold with the acquisition of Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy's development platform which includes 3.9GW of onshore wind and 1GW of solar and batteries.\n\nCloser to home, our joint ScotWind seabed auction bid with partners Marubeni and CIP succeeded in winning our preferred site and took SSE's secured pipeline to 11GW. And in projects under construction, progress is being made on Dogger Bank, Seagreen and Viking wind farms.\n\nThis progress supports our plans for a doubling of net renewables installed capacity to 8GW up to 2026. And this is the platform for targets including a fivefold increase in renewables output to 50TWh, and maintaining a sustained renewables pipeline in excess of 15GW by 2031.\n\n## Networks fit for net zero\n\nConnecting ScotWind will sharpen an already steep growth trajectory for SSEN Transmission. Based on the System Operator's forecasts, which are likely to\n\nbe revised upwards, connected generation in SSEN Transmission's licence area could increase from 8GW today to 25GW by 2030, and we forecast gross RAV to reach around \u00a312bn over a similar timeframe. Unlocking the renewables upon which government net zero targets in the UK depend is at the heart of a RIIO-T2 business plan that SSEN Transmission is already delivering on.\n\nIn our electricity distribution business, strategic planning around network resilience was drawn on heavily in the year in the response to six exceptional weather events in 12 weeks. The scale of the storm damage inspired heroic efforts from SSEN Distribution's employees. In response to the storms around 2,500 people across operational and welfare teams worked tirelessly to safely reconnect 435,000 affected households and businesses and provide support to affected communities.\n\nOur economically-regulated electricity networks have evolved into powerful vehicles for growth. The RIIO-T2 and RIIO-ED2 business plans have huge capex requirements and our plans for bringing in financial partners will enable us to maximise growth not only in the distribution and transmission businesses, but across the wider Group.\n\n## Flexibility for the future\n\nThe transition to a decarbonised energy system, with renewables at its core, connected to consumers via technologically advanced networks, will also require flexible plant, lower-carbon thermal generation and energy storage.\n\nSSE's development pipeline includes critical flexibility offered by Coire Glas, the UK's largest pumped hydro storage project. Keadby 2 CCGT will displace less efficient plant and has potential for hydrogen blending. Further growth will come for SSE Thermal with planned CCS plants at Keadby and Peterhead which, together, could capture up to 3m tonnes of CO 2 a year - 10% of the UK Government's 2030 target - and play an important balancing role. Plans are also progressing for a Keadby hydrogen plant and a potential large-scale hydrogen storage facility at Aldbrough.\n\nSSE's Net Zero Acceleration Programme is the framework behind the strategic progress described above and it forms the foundations of a decade of unprecedented growth. Assuming a continued supportive policy environment, our net investment into vital UK and Ireland infrastructure could exceed \u00a325bn over the next 10 years, creating jobs and addressing the energy crisis. Our immediate task is to fully optimise the opportunities that arise from net zero, using our world-class capabilities, assets and businesses to fulfil the responsibility we have for creating shareholder and societal value over the long term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlistair Phillips-Davies Chief Executive 24 May 2022\n\n'Our net investment into vital UK and Ireland infrastructure could exceed \u00a325bn over the next 10 years, creating jobs and addressing the energy crisis.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSSE's target for a sustained renewables development pipeline by 2031\n\n15\n\nAlistair meets the project team at Keadby 2, Europe's most efficient CCGT, which will displace older, more carbon intensive power plant off the UK energy system.",

In February 2022, SSE refreshed the 2030 Goals to reflect its increased ambitions. 2020/21 is the last year progress will be measured against the original goals shown opposite.\n\n## Accelerating business ambition\n\nThe 2030 Goals address climate change and are aligned to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Since SSE set its first 2030 Goals in early 2019, the pace and scale of climate action has increased considerably. The imperative to accelerate pathways to net zero has provided SSE with significant opportunities for investment and growth. SSE has also set new 1.5\u00b0Caligned carbon targets and published its \u00a312.5bn Net Zero Acceleration Programme out to 2026. This increasing ambition means that SSE's 2030 Goals set in 2019 were no longer as ambitious and stretching as they once were.\n\nIn February 2022, SSE announced updated 2030 Goals reflecting an accelerated decarbonisation pathway and ensuring its targets remain stretching to the end of the decade (see page 5 \uf150 ).\n\n## Progress against the 2030 Goals\n\nTo demonstrate its commitment to the 2030 Goals, performance against them is linked to executive remuneration. As the 2030 Goals were refreshed in February 2022, 2021/22 performance was measured against the previous goals. A summary of this progress is outlined opposite, with more detail available in the Remuneration Committee's Report from page 168 \uf150 . Performance against the new 2030 Goals will be measured from 2022/23 onwards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Looking back at 2021/22\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cut carbon intensity by 60%\n\nCarbon intensity of electricity generated increased slightly in 2021/22. However, good progress was made in both renewables growth and paving a way forward for lowercarbon thermal generation. Plans progressed in the development of two new power stations equipped with carbon capture technology with both projects moving forward to differing degrees in the UK Government's process to encourage and support the most competitive carbon capture plants in the pursuit of net zero ambitions.\n\n## Treble renewable energy output\n\nExcellent progress was made on key offshore projects, including reaching financial close on Dogger Bank C and construction progressing at Seagreen and Dogger Bank A and B. SSE Renewables, along with partners, also won rights to develop what will become one of the world's largest floating offshore wind farms in the January ScotWind leasing round. With the acquisition of renewables development platforms in Japan and Southern Europe, SSE is also building pipeline options in carefully chosen international markets.\n\n## Help accommodate 10m electric vehicles\n\nSSEN Distribution progressed a number of key innovation projects with partners to support flexible markets and future infrastructure provision for the mass adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), including becoming one of the founding partners of a new international global smart grid partnership.\n\n## Champion Fair Tax and a real Living Wage\n\nSSE maintained its Fair Tax Mark accreditation for the eighth consecutive year and published its Talking Tax 2021 report. It achieved ongoing accreditation of the real Living Wage, completed its first year of Living Hours accreditation, and is beginning work to roll the new accreditation out in its supply chain.",

The coming pages highlight how that strategic focus is making a meaningful difference in the transition to net zero through delivery of clean electricity infrastructure.\n\n## Investing in a net zero future\n\nThe completion of the sale of SSE's remaining 33.3% stake in SGN marked the final step in a strategic disposals programme announced in June 2020 to streamline the Group and sharpen its focus on net zero. The sale in March realised nearly \u00a31.3bn in cash proceeds. SGN had been a good investment for the Group, delivering a return on investment of over 18% from an initial outlay in 2005 of \u00a3505m for a 50% stake, however it had become a purely financial interest less aligned with the Group's focus on electricity. The disposals programme overall achieved headline consideration of over \u00a32.8bn, significantly in excess of the original \u00a32bn target.\n\nGas networks are no longer part of SSE's strategic plans, but regulated electricity distribution and transmission networks businesses continue to be key drivers of net zero and engines of growth for the Group. Plans were outlined in the Net Zero Acceleration Programme to sell minority stakes in SSEN Transmission and SSEN Distribution, extending a partnering approach that has worked well in SSE Renewables to networks to fund growth and unlock opportunities across the Group. These plans are now progressing with a sales process initiated with banking advisers in Spring 2022 on a 25% share in SSEN Transmission.\n\nWhile these are high-quality, strategically important businesses and SSE will retain control, the scale of potential growth and the associated investment required mean that bringing in minority partners will create greater long-term value by enabling SSE to harness this significant growth whilst maintaining an attractive balance of capital allocation across the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is very deliberately aligned to prevailing government policy direction, with net zero at the heart of the business. COP26, where the UK Government asked SSE to participate as a Principal Partner, served to highlight the critical importance and global relevance of the Group's strategy.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has brought into sharp focus the need for greater energy security, prompting European countries urgently to reduce their reliance on fossil fuel imports. In this context, governments are recognising it is more important than ever that indigenous low-carbon investment is expedited to keep energy affordable and secure.\n\nSSE welcomed the UK Government's net zero and energy security strategies, which give a clear signal to low-carbon investors and developers to keep investing at the scale needed to achieve net zero by 2050 and support more immediate energy security. And SSE also takes the support received at the 2021 AGM for an annual vote on its Net Zero Transition Report as a clear signal of ongoing shareholder support for its strategic decarbonisation efforts.\n\nThe Net Zero Acceleration Programme aligns SSE with 1.5\u00b0C science-based targets and positions it to enable around 20% of the UK's 50GW offshore wind target by 2030, and over 20% of upcoming UK electricity networks investment, whilst leading investments in flexibility and exporting our renewables capabilities overseas. The urgency of the climate emergency from COP26 and the resulting Glasgow Pact is clear. SSE believes that decarbonisation of the energy system could go further and faster and at the summit it was able to make that case on the world stage.\n\n<!-- image -->",

SSE Renewables made good progress at Seagreen, the world's deepest, fixed-bottom wind farm, and offshore construction commenced at Dogger Bank, currently the world's biggest offshore wind farm at 3.6GW. Construction has also progressed on the 443MW Viking onshore wind farm, one of the highest yielding in Europe, which remains on track for completion in autumn 2024.\n\nSSER's capital investment programme to extend the life of large flexible hydro assets has also progressed, with repowering works commencing at Tummel Bridge in April to extend the life of the iconic power station beyond 2060.\n\nCommissioning of SSE Thermal's 893MW Keadby 2, which will become one of the world's most efficient CCGT power stations, started in October 2021 and full commercial operation is targeted for October 2022, Works are also progressing well at a 50MW energy-from-waste facility, Slough Multifuel, which remains on track to be commissioned by late 2024.\n\nA landmark year of delivery for SSEN saw the completion of distribution network upgrades throughout the North of Scotland and central southern England. SSEN Transmission meanwhile made significant progress in 2021/22, building out critical network infrastructure to unlock renewable generation in the North of Scotland. This included the completion of Tealing substation in January, which will enable the connection of the Seagreen offshore wind farm. Phase one construction milestones were also reached on major projects including Rothienorman substation and the Inveraray-Crossaig reinforcement, while construction began on the 275kV Kinardochy substation in November 2021. Substantial progress was also made on the pioneering Shetland HVDC link project, which is on track to connect the islands to the main GB energy system for the first time by 2024.\n\nSignificant progress has also been made by the newly refocused Distributed Energy business on developing and operating battery and solar technologies at scale, including the acquisition of a 50MW battery site in Salisbury. Existing grid connections at former coal-fired sites also put SSE in a relatively unique position to deploy battery storage at scale and pace, with 150MW opportunities being considered at Ferrybridge and Fiddlers Ferry. The secured solar and battery pipeline is now 380MW, with more than a 1GW of other opportunities being evaluated.\n\n<!-- image -->",

SSE is currently building more offshore wind than anyone else in the world and its renewables business continues to expand its sector leading pipeline, now standing at 11GW with opportunities in development to grow this to a sustained target of 15GW. In January 2022, SSE and its partners Marubeni and CIP celebrated success in Crown Estate Scotland's ScotWind seabed leasing auction. This was SSE's preferred site and, once constructed, will become one of the largest floating wind projects in the world with a potential capacity of at least 2.6GW.\n\nPlans to export SSE's significant capabilities to overseas markets gained momentum with the acquisition of an 80% interest in an offshore wind development platform in Japan. The new joint ownership company, SSE Pacifico, will pursue the development of offshore wind projects in Japan. SSE has taken initial steps into the emerging US offshore market, establishing a permanent base in Boston better to pursue options.\n\nIn Europe, SSE entered tender bids for the 1.4GW Hollandse Kust (west) wind farm development zone in the Netherlands; a 50/50 joint venture with Acciona is progressing in Spain and Portugal; application has been made, also with Acciona, for offshore development rights in the Baltic Sea in Poland; and most recently it acquired Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy's (SGRE) Southern Europe wind, solar and batteries development platform. The SGRE portfolio includes c.3.9GW of onshore wind development projects - around half located in Spain with the remainder across France, Italy and Greece - with scope for up to 1GW of additional co-located solar development opportunities. SSE Renewables also takes on a team of around 40 employees who bring considerable local knowledge and expertise to complement the substantial experience of the existing SSE team in delivering major projects.\n\nEmerging international options present pipeline opportunities; however, capital discipline will continue to guide investment decisions.\n\nSSE also has consent for the UK's largest pumped storage hydro project at Coire Glas and there has been material progress in the policy and regulatory environment for such vital long-duration storage schemes.",

The Net Zero Acceleration Programme will enable SSE to deliver over 20% of all planned UK electricity networks investment, increasing Regulated Asset Value (RAV) to \u00a39bn by 2026 (net of proposed 25% minority stake sales).\n\nSSEN Transmission has made substantial progress this year on major projects within its capital delivery programme, including the landmark Shetland HVDC Link. With options for substantial growth over and above capital expenditure plans approved under the RIIO-T2 price control, projects such as the Eastern HVDC, North Argyll and Skye reinforcement are expected to progress through the Needs Case assessment process.\n\nIn January 2022, National Grid Electricity System Operator (NGESO) published its annual Networks Options Assessment (NOA), which indicated the\n\nneed for more than \u00a35bn of investment in electricity transmission infrastructure in the North of Scotland to maintain a pathway for net zero.

With thermal generation continuing to be relied upon to meet electricity system demand, the UK Government clearly recognises the pivotal role CCS will play in helping to achieve net zero targets, and SSE Thermal has made substantial progress this year in developing these projects. In January 2022, both Keadby and Peterhead Carbon Capture and Storage projects were submitted into Phase 2 of the UK Government's Cluster Sequencing Process, with outcomes expected to be announced in mid-2022.\n\nIn total, the two lower-carbon power stations at Keadby and Peterhead would capture up to three million tonnes of CO 2 a year - 10% of the UK Government's 2030 target. They form part of SSE's ambitions for the coming decade and the submission represents significant progress on delivering SSE's strategy.\n\nSSE Thermal and Equinor are also working in collaboration on two further projects in the Humber: Keadby Hydrogen would be the world's first 100% hydrogen-fuelled power station while Aldbrough, located in East Yorkshire, could be one of the world's largest hydrogen storage facilities.\n\nHydrogen storage is expected to play an important role in a low-carbon hydrogen economy, balancing supply and demand with hydrogen produced using carbon capture and electrolytic technologies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This sector review outlines the events that have focused industry, government and consumer minds on the issues of affordability, energy security and the climate crisis.\n\nGLOBAL INSTABILITY\n\n## War in Europe deepens cost of living crisis\n\nDespite COP26 and progress on net zero, the year was, again, dominated by uncertainty related to coronavirus and a post-pandemic energy crisis exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Soaring energy prices caused inflation to spike across the world, hastening a cost of living crisis amid global energy security concerns.\n\nThe commercial impact of a prolonged conflict in Ukraine is difficult to predict but SSE has so far been served well by a prudent hedging approach. SSE does not have any energy supply contracts with Russian counterparties, and ceased trading activities with these entities after the invasion of Ukraine. The true cost of war is the devastating humanitarian impact and in response to the conflict SSE contributed \u00a31m to the Disasters Emergency Committee.\n\nGovernments rapidly introduced measures to support consumers, strengthen resilience and reduce fossil fuel import dependence.

The Glasgow Climate Pact set out the need to scale up clean power and energy efficiency, to phase down unabated coal power generation and to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. The message from COP26 was clear: the energy sector must lead the way on decarbonisation in the 2020s to hold global warming to a 1.5\u00b0C pathway.\n\nThe year also saw significant domestic progress on net zero. Major announcements were made in the UK on carbon capture and storage (CCS), onshore wind, offshore wind and on the decarbonisation of heat.\n\n## 7,000km 2\n\nAllocated seabed for up to 25GW of offshore wind in Scottish waters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn February, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) announced that Contracts for Difference (CfD) auctions would be held annually from 2023 to speed up the UK's adoption of renewable power. In October, the UK's mid-decade CCS ambitions received a boost with the announcement of two 'Track 1' industrial clusters, including the Humber cluster, as well as a further reserve cluster in Scotland.\n\nCrown Estate Scotland's January ScotWind announcement saw seabed totalling 7,000km 2 allocated for up to 25GW of offshore wind in Scottish waters, while the Scottish Government this year proposed to double onshore wind capacity, with an additional 8-12GW targeted by 2030. And even more recently, the British Energy Security Strategy signalled a bringing forward of a support mechanism for long-duration storage projects like SSE's at Coire Glas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nINNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY\n\n## Driving down the cost of decarbonisation\n\nTechnological innovation has created vast efficiencies and opportunities in the energy sector and continues to be the driving force behind the net zero transition.\n\nFast paced innovation is helping to support affordability in the shift to a low-carbon world at a crucial time for consumers.\n\nAdvances in technology and larger turbine capacities have made wind power the most cost-efficient source of generation, with Contract for Difference (CfD) prices for offshore wind falling from over \u00a3140/MWh to less than \u00a350.\n\nHigh wholesale prices meant that, if all the UK's CfD-awarded wind farms due to be built by 2027 had been operating under their CfDs over the winter months of 2021/22, they would have made over \u00a37bn of payments back to the scheme administrator that would have helped reduce future energy bill costs for consumers.\n\nMeanwhile, SSE marked major developments in technology, including commissioning of Europe's most efficient CCGT, Keadby 2 in the Humber. Green hydrogen also took a significant step forward, as SSE Renewables and Siemens Gamesa announced the co-location of an electrolyser and battery storage facility at Gordonbush wind farm in the Scottish Highlands.",

Industry engagement with regulators continues to focus on the need for an enabling regulatory framework to be established for the delivery of net zero. In the UK, there remains a need for Ofgem's statutory duties to be amended to facilitate net zero and timely decision-making, and the Government has signalled its intention to address this.\n\nSpecific regulatory issues emphasised in 2021-22 included the development of a support mechanism for long duration electricity storage and the need to reform transmission charges to enable further investment in Scotland and northern England. Consumer affordability issues were also prominent, with changes to strengthen supplier financial resilience and cost recovery arising from supplier failure framing dialogue between the regulator and industry. SSE has engaged with the regulator in relation to networks price controls and uncertainty mechanisms to unlock the level of investment required to deliver decarbonisation and renewables targets.\n\n## CAPITAL MARKETS\n\nLooking ahead, 2022-23 will be an important year as policymakers and regulators respond to the near-term impacts of the energy affordability crisis, while putting in place frameworks to unlock new low carbon technologies. Wider market and regulatory reforms are already under way to enable delivery of net zero at lowest cost and reduce exposure to global fossil fuel markets. The UK Government's Offshore Transmission Network Review (OTNR) will conclude with a Holistic Network Design setting out grid connection dates for\n\noffshore wind projects and the transmission network upgrades required to deliver the UK's flagship 50GW offshore wind target.\n\nMore widely, other significant reforms either initiating or concluding include the introduction of a Future System Operator (FSO), distribution network flexibility, competition in transmission networks, market mechanisms and frameworks for long duration electricity storage, CCUS/ Hydrogen and heat networks, many of which will be included in the UK's upcoming Energy Bill in summer 2022. For the longer term, BEIS will also initiate a Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (REMA) in mid-2022, which seeks to reform the GB electricity market to achieve a cost-efficient, low carbon power system by 2035.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The greening of debt and equity\n\nThe inherent value in developing and operating low-carbon infrastructure is increasingly recognised by investors beyond those with an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) focus. This is demonstrated by the influx of capital to the low carbon sector, with growing investment interest from oil majors and greater direct investment from infrastructure funds and institutional investors. This is creating strong opportunities for SSE in financial partnering and it supports creating value from successful development and operation of assets.\n\nAt the same time, both debt and equity investors are beginning to recognise the risks and opportunities from climate change, supported by initiatives such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). This means capital is increasingly flowing to projects and debt is attracted to green bonds that are well positioned to benefit from the low-carbon transition, and less exposed to the downsides associated with more emissions-intensive assets.\n\nTurbine jackets ready for installation at Dogger Bank, the world's biggest offshore wind farm.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexceptional weather events in 12 weeks\n\n6",

Changes in rainfall and wind patterns are felt right across the SSE Group. 2021/22 saw less wind and rain than the previous year, with April-September rainfall in its hydro catchment areas at the lowest level since records began in 1950.\n\nFor its energy-focused businesses, erratic weather can determine the output from renewables assets, the balancing requirements placed on flexible plant and energy demand from customers. The full\n\nimpact of exceptional weather is felt by electricity networks and last year no fewer than six exceptional weather events in 12 weeks tested the resilience of SSEN Distribution's operations in both Scotland and England (see page 66 \uf150 ).\n\nSSE has established crisis management measures to mitigate the impact of severe weather on critical national infrastructure and it has meteorological expertise to forecast coming events. This forecasting not only allows SSE to mobilise operational teams in good time to support energy customers, it also informs trading positions\n\ntaken by the Energy Portfolio Management business and purchasing decisions by the Procurement team.\n\nClimate adaptation strategies are becoming an increasingly important feature of government and business decision-making. For SSE, boosting weather resilience and assessing climate adaptation requirements are essential to the ongoing resilience of all its operational businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This approach is characterised, for example, by the dedicated stakeholder forums in SSE's networks businesses. Details of just some of the engagement methods deployed, and views captured during 2021/22 are covered on pages 34 to 39 \uf150 .\n\nA single metric cannot define the success or otherwise of a stakeholder relationship. However, by considering the size of the stakeholder group, extent of engagement and value returned - financial or nonfinancial - certain measurements can aid\n\nunderstanding of where further opportunities or risks exist. Examples of these measurements are shown in the business model on pages 12 to 13 \uf150 and overleaf.\n\nSSE's approach results in stakeholder influence within, and validity of, business plans and supporting objectives.\n\nThe framework set by the Board in which decision making takes place is explained on page 134 \uf150 . It confirms that consideration of SSE's purpose, vision, strategy and values, and its interconnectivity with stakeholders should drive appropriate outcomes.\n\nSituations will exist where not every stakeholder interest can be addressed in full, however stakeholder regard continues to the fullest extent possible.\n\nGiven that stakeholder considerations are embedded in SSE's definition of a healthy business culture, demonstrating the influence of stakeholders and the consideration given to them remains a focus across this Annual Report and the accompanying Sustainability Report.",

Within this framework SSE has identified four SDGs which are highly material to the business, and to which it has linked its four core 2030 Goals, and a further three material SDGs, which are focused on the environment and guide the pillars of SSE's environment strategy.\n\n## Champion a fair and just energy transition\n\nBe a global leader for the just transition to net zero, with a guarantee of fair work and commitment to paying fair tax and sharing economic value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Increase renewable energy output fivefold\n\nBuild a renewable energy portfolio that generates at least 50TWh of renewable electricity a year by 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Enable low-carbon generation and demand\n\nEnable at least 20GW of renewable generation and facilitate around 2 million EVs and 1 million heat pumps on SSEN's electricity networks by 2030.\n\n## Environmental management and governance Three further material SDGs linked to SSE's Environmental Strategy\n\nResource use\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSSE refreshed its 2030 Goals in February 2022 to reflect SSE's increasing net zero ambitions. More information on SSE's sustainability framework can be found in the Sustainability Report 2022 \uf223 .\n\n## Developments in sustainability reporting standards\n\nAt COP26, in November 2021, the creation of the new International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation was announced. Most of the international standard setters have indicated their support for the ISSB and SSE hopes this will be an important step towards providing the clarity that companies are seeking around globally aligned sustainability reporting standards.\n\nThe UK Government has endorsed the ISSB approach, indicating its intentions to use the standards as the framework for the new UK Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (UKSDR). The UKSDR will build on measures\n\nNatural environment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nalready under way to implement TCFDaligned disclosure rules, expanding the scope to cover wider sustainability topics beyond climate change, and will include requirements for listed companies to publish net zero transition plans. Ahead of these requirements, SSE published its own Net Zero Transition Plan in March 2022, one of the aims of which is to stimulate enhanced engagement with shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\n## Aligning with external frameworks\n\nSSE is a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), incorporating the Ten Principles of the UNGC into its approach to business, and aligns disclosures and KPIs in its Sustainability Report to international non-financial reporting standards, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the SASB Standards. SSE also actively engages with key investor ESG ratings agencies and investor-led initiatives. Detail of SSE's performance in these ratings can be found at sse.com/sustainability \uf295 .",

This approach is consistent with SSE's net zero-aligned strategic objectives and the presence of climate-related issues across vast areas of Board work.\n\nThe Board's assessment of risk is reflected both in the strategic decisions it takes, and in the identification of the Group Principal Risks and emerging risks which have the ability to affect achievement of agreed strategic objectives and, in turn, long-term success.\n\nWithin financial year 2021/22, the Board considered and approved accelerated science-based emission targets; revised business goals to 2030 aligned to the UN Sustainable Development Goals; the Net\n\nZero Acceleration Programme; and the Net Zero Transition Plan.\n\nBoard Committee support is provided on climate-related issues in the following ways:\n\n- \u00b7 The Nomination Committee ensures the Board possesses the correct depth and balance of capabilities to support SSE's long-term position, including the expertise to assess the impact of climate change (see pages 145 to 151 \uf150 ).\n- \u00b7 The Audit Committee supports the Board on matters relating to financial reporting, internal control and risk management. The Committee reviews the integrity of SSE's climate-related financial reporting and the process used to develop SSE's TCFD-aligned disclosures (see pages 152 to 161 \uf150 ).\n- \u00b7 The remit of the Safety, Sustainability, Health and Environment Advisory Committee (SSHEAC) was expanded in the year to oversee SSE's climate adaptation and resilience plans (see pages 164 to 167 \uf150 ).\n- \u00b7 The Remuneration Committee supports implementation of Board approved policy on climate related opportunities and risks, through inclusion of sustainability-linked metrics and targets within performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrelated pay for SSE's Executive Directors (see pages 168 to 199 \uf150 ).\n\n## The Board-agreed division of\n\nresponsibilities across key areas of SSE's Governance Framework, are set out in: the Board's Schedule of Reserved Matters; the Terms of Reference of the Board Committees and the Group Executive Committee; and the role profiles for key Board roles.

This includes ensuring that business decisions are being taken in line with the parameters set by the Board, such as SSE's 2030 Goals and sciencebased targets, and for monitoring new and emerging issues that require escalation.\n\nAs Chair of the Group Executive Committee the Chief Executive retains responsibility for the management of climate-related initiatives under agreed strategy and in turn, driving progress. In support of this, the Chief Executive agrees the annual objectives for the Chief Sustainability Officer who is a direct report. The Chief Sustainability Officer advises the Board, Group Executive Committee, Group Risk Committee and Business Units on climate-related matters and progress under the stated Net Zero Transition Plan.\n\nThe Group Risk Committee (GRC) monitors all Group risks on a periodic basis and ensures that the Business Units are managing the risks for which they are responsible. The GRC has overall responsibility for ensuring the right mechanisms are in place for managing all risks, including climate-related risk and opportunities. Reporting to the GRC is a TCFD Steering Group, comprising of representatives from Group Finance, Group Risk and Sustainability, focused on advising, steering and governing the development of fair, balanced and understandable climaterelated financial disclosures.\n\nSSE has a set of Group Policies applicable across its entire organisation, of which Climate Change and Sustainability are two. Policies are reviewed and endorsed by Group Executive Committee and approved by the Board annually. Compliance with Group policies is also considered as part of the annual review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control (see page 161 \uf150 ).\n\n## Aligning incentives to climate outcomes\n\nSSE's approach to Executive Remuneration reflects the role of sustainability and climate-related considerations within SSE's purpose and strategy, with sustainability-linked metrics and targets an element of performance related pay.

        "page_content": "## A strategy to support net zero\n\n## Providing profitable solutions to climate change\n\nThrough the delivery of its purpose SSE is directly addressing the energy transition to net zero and reflecting society's priorities on climate change. It achieves this through its strategy of developing, building, operating and investing in the electricity infrastructure and businesses needed in the transition to net zero.\n\nWith SSE's direct emissions (scope 1) cut by 78% since their peak in 2006/07, SSE has a well established decarbonisation strategy and has been transitioning its electricity generation portfolio to one dominated by renewable and low-carbon thermal sources of generation.\n\nSSE's goal is to achieve net zero GHG emissions across its scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 2040 (subject to security of supply requirements) and for remaining scope 3 emissions by 2050. These longterm net zero ambitions are supported by interim science-based targets aligned to a 1.5\u00b0C pathway. Progress against these targets is outlined on pages 54 to 55 \uf150 .\n\n## A plan for a net zero transition\n\nIn March 2022, SSE published its Net Zero Transition Plan. The Plan clearly sets out for stakeholders the key actions SSE will take to drive progress towards its net zero ambitions and its interim science-based targets aligned to a 1.5\u00b0C pathway.\n\nSSE will disclose annual progress against this plan through its Net Zero Transition Report, which will be subject to shareholder vote each year. Progress in 2021/22 is disclosed across SSE's Annual and\n\nSustainability Reports. A standalone summary Net Zero Transition Report has also been published to aid stakeholder engagement, which can be found at sse.com/sustainability \uf295 .\n\n## Advocating for climate action\n\nSSE actively and positively advocates for more ambitious climate change policy to achieve net zero, with a significant focus for advocacy activities in 2021/22 being linked to its Principal Partnership on COP26. SSE conducts its advocacy in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement and its own net zero strategy. It reviews trade association membership annually to ensure that the organisations of which it is a member also advocate in line with the ambitions of the Paris Agreement. In December 2021, it published the results of this annual review for the first time. Detail of advocacy activities undertaken across 2021/22 can be found throughout the Strategic Report of this Annual Report ( pages 1 to 94 \uf150 ) and in SSE's Sustainability Report 2022.\n\n## Investing in the net zero transition\n\nIn November 2021, SSE announced its Net Zero Acceleration Programme, which includes a \u00a312.5bn, fully-funded capital investment plan between 2021 and 2026 alongside ambitious 2031 targets, aligned with net zero. The Programme is the practical application of SSE's strategy and seeks to cement SSE's position as a national clean energy champion, enabling the contribution of around 20% of the UK's revised 50GW offshore wind target and over 20% of the required investment in UK electricity networks, whilst deploying flexibility solutions to secure electricity supplies and exporting SSE's renewables capabilities overseas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMeeting TCFD recommended disclosures:\n\n## 2.

In 2021/22, SSE invested \u00a32.1bn of this planned \u00a312.5bn capital investment. SSE's future capital investment plans, including those for any thermal assets, will be based on clear internal investment criteria, which ensures alignment to SSE's commitment to its core 2030 business goals including the targeted reductions in GHG emissions.",

        "page_content": "## A sustainable approach continued Protecting the environment continued\n\n## ENGAGEMENT IN ACTION GOVERNMENT AND REGULATORS\n\n## FURTHER AND FASTER AT COP26\n\nThe cornerstone of SSE's engagement with government and regulators in 2021/22 was the Company's Principal Partnership with the UK Government on COP26. SSE was able to showcase its standing as a national clean energy champion in what was a significant stepping up of engagement activity in the lead-up to, during and after the Glasgow event. Through more than 150 direct COP-related engagements, SSE established 50 new business relationships, received more than 20 public endorsements from stakeholders, and formed 14 new partnerships.\n\nCrucially, SSE was able to support a number of COP-linked policy announcements through its advocacy for decarbonisation of the energy sector to go further and faster. In the months following COP26, positive engagement, including meetings with the Secretary of State for Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Prime Minister, continued to maintain political resolve on the Glasgow Pact and highlight SSE's role in delivering national net zero targets.\n\n## Financing climate strategies\n\nSSE understands that investors are increasingly looking for robust mechanisms through which they can ensure their investments are sustainable and take account of climate-related risks. To support the growth of green finance, SSE also has pursued a strategy of issuing green bonds to fund its net zero investment plans. SSE has issued four green bonds, with the total outstanding at \u00a32bn which reaffirms SSE's position as the largest issuer of green bonds in the UK corporate sector.\n\n## Aligning to taxonomy definitions\n\n## A developing UK Taxonomy\n\nSSE supports the development of sustainable finance beyond green and sustainable debt markets. The establishment of a European Taxonomy is an important step forward in defining environmentally sustainable economic activity within equity markets and, as a UK-listed energy company, SSE is looking forward to the establishment of a UK Taxonomy based on the broad principles established by the EU. In support of a consistent, although UK-appropriate, taxonomy, SSE engaged constructively with several stakeholders in 2021/22, including HM Treasury and the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to suggest ways in which the UK Taxonomy could be developed to be\n\nsimpler, transparent and auditable. SSE has made the case that:\n\n- \u00b7 Any inclusion of gas generating activities within the UK Taxonomy should demand carbon abatement;\n- \u00b7 The operational expenditure metric be replaced with alternative metrics which are clearly defined and auditable, such as operating profit and loss metric which is captured within the UK adopted IFRS financial reporting standards;\n- \u00b7 To ensure all relevant economic activity is captured, activities measured should encompass projects within joint control, such as equity investments into large scale offshore wind farm projects.\n\n## Assessing SSE's activities\n\nTo provide stakeholders with an initial indication of SSE's economic activities according to taxonomy criteria, SSE has undertaken preliminary work to assess its activities using the eligible activities of the EU Taxonomy as a basis. The table on page 47 \uf150 provides an illustration of SSE's taxonomy aligned activities. Taxonomy eligible activities in 2021/22 are from SSE's onshore and offshore wind generation, hydro (run of river and pumped storage) as well as its networks transmission and distribution activities. In 2021/22, the proportion of SSE's taxonomy-eligible activities across the\n\nSSE's Gregor Alexander and Alistair PhillipsDavies with Chancellor Rishi Sunak at COP26.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndifferent measures were: adjusted operating profit, 84%; adjusted investment and capital expenditure, 86%; and, revenue, 30%.\n\nThe reason that SSE's taxonomy-eligible activity appears low in relation to its revenue, is primarily due to Energy Portfolio Management trading activity and the sale of power to end customers, both of which are high volumes, with pass through costs and lower margins than in larger businesses such as renewables generation and networks businesses. SSE believes that revenue is a poor measure in assessing its economic activity and that the most appropriate measures of its taxonomy-eligible economic activity are in relation to its capital investment and its operating profit.\n\nThe taxonomy non-eligible activities are associated with SSE's thermal generation and gas storage businesses. Other activities that do not currently align may qualify for taxonomy alignment in the future.\n\nProviding the UK Taxonomy does not deviate significantly from the EU model, SSE expects its assessment of its taxonomy eligible activities disclosed on page 47 \uf150 to be consistent with a future UK framework.",

with the requirements of IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' (see note 5.1.1).\n- (c)  Adjusted operating profit/loss: calculated as adjusted operating profit/loss related to the businesses aligned with the taxonomy categories (see note 5.1.2).\n- (d)  Adjusted investment and capital expenditure: calculated as adjusted capital expenditure related to assets or processes associated with taxonomy-eligible economic activities that is accounted for based on IAS 16, IAS 38 and IFRS 16 and thereby included within adjusted capital expenditure (see note 5.1.3).\n\n## Taxonomy eligible activities at a glance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Assumptions\n\nSSE's accounting policies for these calculations are based on the EU Taxonomy Regulation and delegated acts and available guidelines from the UK Government.\n\n## \u00b7 Linkage principle\n\nIn calculating each taxonomy-eligible proportion, a 'linkage principle' has been applied, stipulating that any revenue, operating profit/loss or capital expenditure that can be justifiably linked to an identified taxonomy economic activity can be classified as taxonomy-eligible. Using this principle, revenue and operating profits from SSE's balancing activities, hedging, and trading can be linked to the EU\n\ntaxonomy eligible activities when the activity is undertaken to directly support the eligible activities.\n\n## \u00b7 Proxies\n\nWhere the financial numbers are not appropriately split into Taxonomy compliant activities, namely for Energy Portfolio Management energy trading and power sales activities, a proxy has been used to estimate the ratio of purchased power volumes from\n\nrenewable versus non-renewable assets applied to revenue and operating profit/loss.\n\n- \u00b7 Materiality\n\nThe analysis has been prepared by applying a top-down review of SSE's activities and the alignment with existing segmental reporting within taxonomy eligible activities. There are some activities that fall below specified thresholds which are not taxonomy eligible. As SSE's reporting processes and controls are refined by the implementation of the UK Taxonomy, it is expected that some activities will be reclassified if they move above certain materiality thresholds.\n\n## \u00b7 UK taxonomy eligibility\n\n- SSE's transmission and distribution activities do not currently qualify as EU taxonomy eligible due to the use of Polychlorinated Biphenyls\n\n(PCBs). SSE has committed to removing PCBs within its business 31 December 2025 in line with recent UK legislation. It is therefore expected that the UK taxonomy will include these activities as taxonomy eligible.",

The material risks ( pages 52 to 53 \uf150 ) are associated with the physical impacts of extreme or changing weather conditions on renewable and network operations; alongside transition risks related to renewable wholesale prices and resilience of thermal power generators to changing policy.\n\nSSE has aligned its disclosures related to opportunities to its Net Zero Acceleration Programme out to 2026, where opportunities are more certain. Beyond this date a description of further opportunities has been provided, though these have not been quantified due to the inherent uncertainty in longer-term forecasting. Risks identified have been quantified based on SSE's exposure to the risk as at 31 March 2022.\n\nFurther information on each climate-related opportunity and risk is also presented in SSE's Sustainability Report 2022 \uf223 and CDP Climate Change Programme submission.\n\n## Explaining recommended disclosure Strategy 2.c\n\nSSE believes it is partially compliant with TCFD recommended disclosure Strategy 2.c as it describes the resilience of the organisation to the key identified climaterelated risks on pages 52 and 53 \uf150 . However, these risks followed a process of bottom up analysis and therefore does not meet the specific requirement to take into\n\nconsideration different climate relatedscenarios. SSE is still in the process of developing appropriate macro enterpriselevel climate scenarios, building on climate scenario analysis performed in the past, with a view to complying from 2023. SSE's previous reports, Post Paris , published in July 2017, and Transition to Net Zero , published in November 2019, assessed the resilience of SSE's electricity businesses and gas businesses to different warming scenarios respectively. These reports can be found at sse.com/sustainability sse.com/sustainability \uf295 .\n\n## SSE's key developments in 2021/22:\n\n- \u00b7 SSE announced its \u00a312.5bn Net Zero Acceleration Programme aligned to its net zero ambitions, see pages 4 to 5 \uf150 .\n- \u00b7 SSE set accelerated science-based targets aligned to a 1.5\u00b0C pathway, see pages 54 and 55 \uf150 .\n- \u00b7 SSE reviewed its climate-related risks and opportunities in its Annual Report, see pages 50 to 53 \uf150 .\n\n## ENGAGEMENT IN ACTION SHAREHOLDERS AND DEBT PROVIDERS\n\n## ENHANCING CLIMATE ENGAGEMENT WITH SHAREHOLDERS\n\nHaving worked closely with investor group Climate Action 100+ over 2020/21, SSE proposed an enabling resolution to its July 2021 Annual General Meeting (AGM) asking shareholders to accept and approve the Company's proposal to adopt a plan to become net zero across its scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 2050 or sooner. The resolution received 99.96%\n\nof the votes cast in favour and established a framework for SSE to propose a resolution at each AGM for shareholders to receive, consider and express non-binding advisory approval of SSE's Net Zero Transition Report. To aid the vote, SSE published a Net Zero Transition Plan in March 2022, from which its Net Zero Transition Reports will be based. The Plan sets out defined\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntargets and actions to allow for clear and simple disclosures which will facilitate high quality engagement. Ahead of the 2022 AGM, SSE will undertake a programme of shareholder engagement on the Net Zero Transition Report, which will be published in June 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Climate-related opportunity and risk management\n\n## Identifying and assessing climaterelated opportunities and risks\n\nSSE's Group Risk Management Framework is complemented by a specialist, and longer-term, TCFD climate-related risk assessment process that provides the framework for the identification and assessment of climate-related opportunities and risks.\n\nTo identify and assess climate-related opportunities and risks SSE used the outputs from senior business leader assessments of climate opportunity and risk alongside risk assessment workshops held by business units to test relevance, materiality and potential financial impact of climate issues. Following the completion of these activities a long list of climate-related opportunities and risks was identified.\n\nTo test the relevance of the long list of climate-related opportunities and risk, the risk approach used climate-related trends in the external environment, stakeholder perspectives (including regulatory requirements); internal risk assessment outputs and climate-related influencing factors in the Group Risk Management framework.\n\nTo test materiality a significance test was conducted that assessed potential financial impact and the likelihood of\n\noccurrence for each opportunity and risk. This assessment led to the definition of the final list of material climate-related risks and opportunities for SSE ( pages 50 to 53 \uf150 ).\n\n## Managing climate-related opportunities and risks\n\nSSE has a series of actions that enable it to realise the climate-related opportunities and has a set of controls and financial mitigations in place to reduce the climaterelated risks. This risk management section ( pages 49 to 53 \uf150 ) combined with SSE's Sustainability Report 2022 and CDP Climate Change response provides further information on these actions and controls.\n\n## Integrated climate-related risk assessment\n\nSSE's Group Risk Management Framework ( page 161 \uf150 ) ensures the management of risks that can threaten the achievement of SSE's strategic objectives, including those that are related to climate change. Climate Change is one of SSE's Group Principal Risks, with scenarios related to both physical and transition risks posed by climate change included as part of SSE's viability assessment ( page 70 \uf150 ). Climaterelated influencing factors and key developments continue to be considered against all relevant Group Principal Risks ( pages 71 to 81 \uf150 ).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMeeting TCFD recommended disclosures:\n\n## 3.

See sse.com/ sustainability \uf295 for the submission.\n\n## Material climate-related opportunities and risks\n\nThe following tables, on pages 50 to 53 \uf150 , present SSE's quantification of the potential financial impact of its material climate-related opportunities and risks. More detail to these disclosures is presented in SSE's CDP Climate Change Programme submission 2022.\n\nFor the opportunities and risks identified, where relevant, SSE has outlined the time frame for investment in climate-related activities as well as the time frame for the impact of that investment, when the benefits will be realised. The time frames are:\n\n- \u00b7 Short term (up to three years)\n- \u00b7 Medium term (four to 10 years)\n- \u00b7 Long term (up to 30 years)\n\nThese time frames have been determined based on a number of factors, including: SSE's Net Zero Acceleration Programme; market, policy and regulatory frameworks; and forecasted physical impacts of climate change.",

        "page_content": "## A sustainable approach continued Protecting the environment continued\n\n## Climate-related opportunities\n\n## VALUABLE FLEXIBLE HYDRO\n\nInvestment: Medium term Impact: Medium/long term\n\n## Context of the opportunity\n\nIncreasing volumes of intermittent wind energy will require support from flexible generators that provide system services, such as short-term reserve, frequency and long-duration energy storage services. The opportunity exists, from existing hydro expertise, to develop long-duration, low-carbon flexibility solutions that provide significant enduring value to the GB electricity system.\n\n## How SSE can realise this opportunity\n\n## Potential financial impact\n\nFor SSE's existing hydro portfolio, ongoing investment in maintenance, upgrades and repowering will optimise the provision of low carbon flexibility.\n\nSSE also has an important development option for large-scale, long-duration pumped hydro storage at Coire Glas in Scotland, with planning consent for a 1.5GW capacity project and c.30GWh of storage capacity potential. This would more than double existing pumped hydro storage capacity in GB. SSE is working with Government and the regulator to establish a market mechanism that would unlock investment into long-duration storage projects such as Coire Glas given the critical role they can play in securing low-carbon energy supplies in the UK.\n\n## ACCELERATED TRANSMISSION GROWTH\n\nSSE's current hydro generation capacity of 1.5GW had an adjusted operating profit of \u00a3293.1m and adjusted EBITDA of \u00a3324.7m in the year ended 31 March 2022. In 2021/22 SSE invested c.\u00a350m on existing hydro asset maintenance and repowering.\n\nEarly-stage development expenditure is already being incurred on Coire Glas, with the total capital cost for development expected to be in excess of \u00a31bn. The timing of that investment, and returns generated, will depend on the emergence of suitable market mechanisms to stimulate this investment in long-duration storage.\n\nInvestment: Medium term Impact: Medium/long term\n\n## Context of the opportunity\n\nSignificant growth in renewable wind in the north of Scotland requires significant expansion of the north of Scotland electricity transmission network, to transport the renewable electricity from the sources of generation to the sources of demand. In April 2022, the UK Government set out in the British Energy Security Strategy that it would ensure Ofgem expedites its approvals process to build networks in anticipation of major new sources of generation and demand. This is demonstrated by the Scottish Government's proposed target of 8-12GW of additional onshore wind by 2030, announced in November 2021, and the Crown Estate Scotland award of seabed leases in January 2022 of c.25GW of new offshore wind capacity.\n\n## How SSE can realise this opportunity\n\n## Potential financial impact\n\nSSEN Transmission's current RIIO-T2 business plan to 2026 envisages expanding and reinforcing the existing network for major new sources of generation. Regulatory approvals are in-flight for further projects such as reinforcements to Skye, Argyll and the Eastern HVDC offshore link which will connect the North of Scotland directly to demand centres in England.\n\nBeyond the current business plan, SSEN Transmission is working closely with stakeholders to determine the network expansion required to meet Government ambitions and new development projects. This will determine the scale of investment required in the next regulatory price control (2026 and 2031).\n\nThe latest RIIO-T2 Price Control Financial Model, submitted to Ofgem in November 2021, envisages spending at least \u00a34bn to expand and reinforce the existing network, with regulatorapproved projects that are in-flight. With this investment, the Regulated Asset Value (RAV) of SSEN Transmission is expected to reach in excess of \u00a36.5bn by the end of the price control (2026).\n\nBetween 2026 and 2031 it is expected that RAV will reach between \u00a38-10bn and there is the potential, if the additional expenditure is agreed, for RAV to reach \u00a312bn in this time period. SSEN Transmission earns a return on its RAV, therefore growth of the RAV should result in earnings growth in future periods, subject to future regulatory earnings agreements.",

        "page_content": "## ACCELERATED WIND INVESTMENT\n\nInvestment: Medium term Impact: Medium/long term\n\n## Context of the opportunity\n\nInternational agreements to decarbonise electricity systems, alongside increased energy security and the need to reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels enhance the case for accelerated wind deployment. The UK Government has ambitions for up to 50GW of installed offshore wind capacity by 2030 (including up to 5GW of floating offshore wind) and the Irish Government has targeted 4GW of incremental onshore wind and 5GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030. In the long term, the Climate Change Committee's balanced net zero pathway suggests 95GW of UK offshore wind by 2050.\n\n## How SSE can realise this opportunity\n\n## Potential financial impact\n\nSSE aims to build a renewable energy portfolio that generates at least 50TWh of electricity a year by 2030. SSE's accelerated capital investment plan (the Net Zero Acceleration Programme) published in November 2021 aims to double installed renewable capacity to 8GW (net) by 2026 and targets at least 13GW (net) of installed renewable capacity by 2026. In the longer term, SSE is exploring opportunities in the UK, Ireland and internationally.\n\nSSE's existing wind generation portfolio (2.5GW capacity) had an adjusted operating profit of \u00a3275.1m and adjusted EBITDA of \u00a3470.4m in 2021/2022. Between 2021 and 2026, SSE's Net Zero Acceleration Programme plans to invest over \u00a34bn in c.4GW (net) of new wind capacity, supporting a target of c.9GW (net) of new wind capacity by 2031. This planned investment is expected to significantly contribute to an 11-12% EBITDA compound annual growth rate in renewables across the five-year period.\n\n## DRIVING DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMATION\n\nInvestment: Medium term Impact: Medium/long term\n\n## Context of the opportunity\n\nThe UK Government's Net Zero Strategy accelerates the shift to zero emission vehicles, banning new petrol or diesel cars from 2030. National Grid's Future Energy Scenarios (2021) anticipates 12 million electric vehicles and 4 million residential heat pumps in GB in 2030. Depending on the scenario, there is potential for a five to ten-fold increase in annual load spend between now and 2038.\n\n## How SSE can realise this opportunity\n\n## Potential financial impact\n\nSSEN Distribution's draft RIIO-ED2 business plan for the period 2023 - 2028 establishes an investment and innovation programme that will enable customers to connect their electric vehicles reliably to local electricity grids. To predict the scale of connections Distribution Future Energy scenarios suggest that between 2020 to 2030, the number of EVs in SSEN's Distribution areas may increase from 30,000 to 0.85-2.3 million and for heat pumps from under 50,000 to 0.27-1.05 million.\n\nOver the RIIO-ED2 period to 2028, SSEN Distribution expects to invest c.\u00a34bn in distribution networks resilience and reinforcement. This is expected to increase RAV to c.\u00a35.5bn by 2026 with a further \u00a37-8bn by 2031, subject to regulatory determination and required future load spend. SSEN Distribution earns a return on its RAV, therefore growth of the RAV should result in earnings growth in future periods, subject to future regulatory earnings agreements.\n\n## VALUABLE FLEXIBLE THERMAL\n\nInvestment: Medium term Impact: Medium/long term\n\n## Context of the opportunity\n\nAs the electricity system decarbonises, increasing volumes of intermittent wind energy requires support from flexible generators that provide system services, such as short term reserve, frequency, security of supply and price stability. There is the opportunity to repurpose SSE's existing gas-powered electricity generators, as well as invest in new low-carbon thermal generation assets. The UK Government's 10 point plan for a Green Industrial Revolution involves a \u00a31bn fund to facilitate CCS deployment in two industrial clusters by the mid-2020s and a further two by 2030 and a Net Zero Hydrogen Fund with \u00a3240m up to 2024/25.\n\n## How SSE can realise this opportunity\n\n## Potential financial impact\n\nSSE is developing plans to support the UK's transition to net zero and accelerate the decarbonisation of some of the UK's most carbon intensive regions. SSE is progressing projects in the UK cluster sequencing pro-gramme with carbon capture power plants at Keadby in the Humber and Peterhead in the North of Scotland. SSE is also developing plans for a hydrogen power plant at Keadby and repurposing its Aldbrough Gas Storage site for the safe storage of hydrogen.\n\nSSE's Net Zero Acceleration Programme seeks to invest \u00a30.6bn in low-carbon flexible thermal generation, mainly carbon-capture technology but with some development investment in hydrogen projects ahead of potential investment decisions in the second half of the decade. Returns from CCS and hydrogen will depend on the level and nature of government support mechanisms, and plant availability, future consumer demand, generation supply mix within the system and energy commodity price volatility.",

These changes may impact SSE's renewable output and associated earnings. Weather variability is a perennial feature of risk for SSE as the largest generator of renewable electricity in UK and Ireland.\n\n## Potential impact to SSE\n\n## Potential financial impact\n\nSSE's long-term monitoring of weather changes and current forecasts, established that a plausible scenario of significantly below-average rainfall and low wind combined may result in reduced renewable generation output and associated earnings. In the first half of 2021/22 this risk played out, as SSE experienced one of the driest and calmest summer periods (April to September) on record. By the end of September 2021, Renewable volumes were 30% below plan. Some of this volume was recovered during the winter period, with Renewable volumes ending the year c.13% down on plan.\n\nFor the future, it is expected that given SSE's planned trebling of renewables capacity by 2031 that this risk will continue to impact SSE.\n\n## STORM DAMAGE NETWORK RISK\n\n## Impact: Short/medium/long term\n\n## Factors that impact business\n\nIncreased severity of extreme weather events, such as storms, floods and heat waves bring prolonged extreme temperatures, wind or rainfall. This may damage or stress network assets resulting in additional costs to repair and maintain the network and the loss of incentive revenue for distribution operators.\n\n## Potential impact to SSE\n\n## Potential financial impact\n\nThe impact of weather is a perennial feature of operating an electricity distribution network in the north of Scotland and south of England. In an exceptional 2021/22 winter season, seven storms were named by the Met Office including three, Storm Arwen, Storms Malik/Corrie and Storms Eunice/Franklin that became Red Alert events, the most in any year since SSE's records began. Each of these events impacted over 100,000 customers, with a significant number for a multi-day period. Future climate models predict that climate change will continue to bring extreme events such as storms, floods and heatwaves which will impact network assets.\n\nAlthough the impact on the Interruptions Incentive Scheme (IIS) revenue is mitigated during the most severe weather events, there are significant additional costs incurred through the provision of compensation, customer welfare and upweighted operational requirements. In 2021/22, the total cash expenditure incurred on storm responses was \u00a345m, including \u00a318.7m in enhanced guaranteed standards compensation payments, up from the mandated \u00a313.3m, reflecting the extreme nature of the impact on customers.\n\nIt is recognised that 2021/22 brought 'once in a generation' levels of impact and disruption, but with climate impacts accelerating the potential remains for similar events to occur across the network in the short, medium and long term, resulting in potential financial impact. As SSE invests in its networks infrastructure, the impacts of climate change are being built into its capital and operational investment plans, including a Climate Resilience Strategy published as part of the RIIO-ED2 Distribution business plan.\n\nThe impact of this dry and calm period in this financial year was a reduction to adjusted operating profit from plan of c.\u00a3140m through the summer period. While the business recovered some of the volume through the second half of the financial year, the financial result for the year was c.\u00a3130m below plan.\n\nFurther significant and sustained weather patterns similar to this could impact the recoverable value of the assets. A sensitivity to the wind goodwill impairment model was performed with a 15% adverse volume variance, which indicated significant headroom on the carrying value of the assets (see note 15).\n\nThere is still potential for events such as those that took place in 2021/22 to occur in the future, and therefore this remains a potential financial impact to SSE Renewables in the short, medium and long term.",

        "page_content": "## ACCELERATED GAS CLOSURE RISK\n\nImpact: Medium term\n\n## Factors that impact business\n\nMore aggressive climate change policy may bring forward the closure of unabated gas generation from 2030. The UK Government's Net Zero Strategy outlines plans to decarbonise the power sector by 2035 with a target of 95% of GB electricity to be low carbon by 2030. It is plausible that to meet climate change commitments the UK Government (and potentially the Irish Government too) may strengthen climate change policies to require unabated gas generation to cease in the 2030s.\n\n## Potential impact to SSE\n\n## Potential financial impact\n\nSSE's existing 5.3GW fleet of installed gas- and oil-fired generation will be nearing the end of its expected life by the end of the 2020s. However, 2.3GW of Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) capacity will still be in operation in 2030.\n\nIt is a plausible scenario that this capacity will not be able to generate beyond 2030 without low-carbon abatement technology. For assets currently assumed to have a life beyond 2030, it is possible that SSE could invest further in low-carbon abatement technology to prolong their life beyond this date.\n\nHowever, for the purposes of quantifying this risk, it is assumed that the financial impact of this policy change is the early closure of the remaining gas assets in 2030.\n\n## WIND/hyphen.caseCAPTURE MARKET RISK\n\nImpact: Medium term\n\n## Factors that impact business\n\nIn net zero consistent scenarios, the price wind energy can capture is forecast to reduce as more marginal cost wind generation is connected.\n\nAll credible pathways to net zero in the UK and beyond assume the dramatic scaling up of wind (especially offshore) generated electricity. This significant growth in wind power output without a corresponding increase in demand represents a potential climaterelated transition risk. As wind generation capacity increases, the market (and SSE) expects the average electricity price which wind power receives ('wind capture price') to be less than the average price for electricity ('baseload price'). As wind becomes the dominant source of electricity output it will define the market price, so the volatility of electricity prices correlates to wind output, both high and low. While this is expected in the medium term, and is factored into investment decisions, there is a risk that this lower average price for wind output is more extreme than what the market (or SSE) expects. In the long term, and with careful market design reform, the effect of the wind capture price will stabilise as more low carbon technologies adapt their patterns of demand according to the price signal sent by the market. In its British Energy Security Strategy, the UK Government committed to a Review of Electricity Market Arrangements which will seek, among other things, to ensure future low-carbon generation is fairly remunerated.\n\n## Potential impact to SSE\n\n## Potential financial impact\n\nThe effect of a wind capture price only materially impacts wind generation that is fully exposed to market prices (or 'merchant' wind output), as it is not supported by government-backed fixed price mechanisms such as the Contracts for Difference. Assuming a build out rate of wind generation assets in SSE's renewable project pipeline page 85 \uf150 , it is assumed there will be 10TWh of merchant wind output in 2029/30.\n\nThe scale of any impact of a change to the expected wind capture price would therefore be a function of the assumed wind capture price and the amount of merchant wind electricity generated.\n\nThe book value of the Group's wind assets at 31 March 2022 is \u00a34.0bn. A sensitivity to the wind goodwill impairment model was performed with a sustained 10% reduction to wind capture price. This sensitivity scenario indicated significant headroom on the carrying value of the assets (see note 15).\n\nDue to market conditions during FY21/22, the short term value of these assets has increased, resulting in the reversal of historic impairments to unabated gas plant of \u00a3331.6m. Following this impairment reversal, the value of unabated gas plant as of 31 March 2022 was \u00a31.1bn. This includes Keadby 2, Great Island and legacy GB CCGTs. Of SSE's legacy CCGTs, the current financial assumption is that these will either close by 2030, or SSE will not have a carrying value in the joint venture investment beyond 2030.\n\nThe potential impact of this policy change to SSE's impairment model at 31 March 2022 would be an impairment of \u00a341.5m to Great Island and no impairment to Keadby 2 if it were assumed these plant would close in 2030 (see note 15). In addition to an impairment charge, SSE's decommissioning provisions would reduce by \u00a38.4m at 31 March 2022 if the forecast closure date was brought forward (see note 20).",

SSE is now targeting net zero GHG emissions across its scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 2040 (subject to security of supply requirements) and for remaining scope 3 emissions by 2050.\n\nOn its pathway towards its longer-term net zero ambitions, SSE has a series of carbon targets which are approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). Originally set in April 2020, these targets were aligned to a 'well below 2\u00b0C' pathway which was the most stretching pathway for the power sector available from SBTi at the time. Since then, the SBTi has published a new pathway for the power sector, allowing electric utilities to set science-based targets in line with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway. In November 2021, SSE announced updated targets aligned to\n\nthis new 1.5\u00b0C pathway and approved by the SBTi. Progress against these more stretching SBTi-approved targets is detailed within this section and makes up part of SSE's progress against its Net Zero Transition Plan.\n\nIn October 2021, SSEN Distribution became the first UK Distribution Network Operator to set science-based targets in line with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway, verified by the SBTi. These targets play an important role in supporting the SSE Group's net zero ambitions, alongside the 1.5\u00b0C-aligned, SBTi-approved carbon targets set by SSEN Transmission in August 2020.\n\n## GHG emissions performance\n\nIn 2021/22, SSE's total GHG emissions consisted of 58% scope 1 emissions, 5% scope 2 emissions and 37% scope 3 emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMeeting TCFD recommended disclosures:\n\n## 4. Metrics and Targets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\na) Disclose the metrics used by the organisation to assess climaterelated risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process.\n\nb) Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the related risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- c) Describe the targets used by the organisation to manage climaterelated risks and opportunities and performance against targets.\n\nSSE's total GHG emissions decreased by 10% between 2020/21 and 2021/22. The most material contributing factor was the reduction in energy demand as a result of market conditions and the weather which led to this reduction in GHG emissions. Although SSE's GHG emissions fell over 2021/22, the impact of weather and demand can create exceptional years of change. SSE's overall strategy is to cut GHG emissions in line with its 1.5\u00b0C-aligned carbon targets and its 2030 Goals.\n\nBetween 2020/21 and 2021/22, GHG emissions arising from electricity generation fell by 19%. These emissions continue to make up 99% of SSE's scope 1 emissions. This was predominantly a result of two factors:\n\n- 1.  The ending of SSE's power purchase agreement contract with Seabank gas-fired power station on 30 September 2021. As a result 50% of emissions from this power station are now reported in SSE's scope 3 GHG emissions category, based on SSE's ownership share; and\n- 2.  Output from SSE's thermal generation plant* was 26% lower compared to the previous year, due to planned and unplanned outages and market conditions.\n- * Includes 100% output from Seabank power station up to 31 September 2021 when SSE's power purchase agreement to purchase ended, and then excludes output from SSE's 50% ownership share from October 2021 onwards.",

        "page_content": "SSE's total scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions combined were 6.24MtCO 2 e in 2021/22, an 18% reduction from the previous year and 44% reduction from the 2017/18 base year of SSE's SBTi-approved carbon target to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 72.5% between 2017/18 and 2030. Overall, SSE's scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions have reduced significantly compared to the base year, reflecting lower output from thermal power stations and the closure of SSE's last coal-fired power plant in March 2020.\n\nTotal scope 3 emissions increased by 9% between 2020/21 and 2021/22. This is due to the inclusion of 0.3MtCO 2 e emissions from Seabank gas-fired power station from October 2021 onwards. Previously, the power purchase agreement between Seabank and SSE required emissions associated with Seabank to be accounted as scope 1 emissions. From the end of the power purchase agreement in September 2021, the emissions from Seabank are defined as scope 3 emissions according to SSE's continuing 50% ownership share.\n\nGHG emissions from gas sold to customers, which contribute 62% of SSE's scope 3 emissions in 2021/22, decreased by 3%. This was a result of lower market demand. This means GHG emissions from gas sold have reduced by 10% from 2017/18. SSE's SBTi-approved target is to reduce GHG emissions from gas sold by 50% between 2017/18 and 2034.\n\nChange in SSE's scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions since 2017/18\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## -44%\n\n## Scope 1 GHG emissions intensity\n\nSSE's scope 1 GHG emissions intensity increased by 1% to 259gCO 2 e/kWh from 256gCO 2 e/kWh the previous year. There are a series of factors that contribute to the calculation of carbon intensity.\n\nOutput from SSE's renewable generation portfolio (inc. pumped storage and biomass) fell to 8.8TWh in 2021/22, from 9.6TWh the previous year. This was driven by exceptionally still and dry weather conditions, with the summer of 2021 being one of the least windy across most of the UK and Ireland and one of the driest in SSE's Hydro catchment areas in the last 70 years.\n\nOutput from SSE's thermal generation also fell, and by a greater extent than for renewables output. This meant that the proportion of total generation output contributed to by renewable generation\n\n## GENERATION OUTPUT AND SCOPE 1 GHG EMISSIONS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Scope 1 GHG emissions\n- * In 2021/22, oil-fired generation output contributed around 6% of gas and oil output.\n\nincreased to 40% from 35% in 2020/21. The fall in thermal output did not result in a corresponding fall in the GHG emissions intensity, because there was increased generation output from the most intensive generating plant in SSE's portfolio, including from carbon intensive peaking plant in Ireland.\n\nSSE remains on track to achieve its SBTi-approved target to reduce scope 1 GHG emissions intensity by 80% between 2017/18 and 2030, having reduced it by 16% in 2021/22 from the 2017/18 base year levels of 307 gCO 2 e/kWh.\n\nChange in SSE's scope 1 GHG emissions intensity since 2017/18\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## -16%\n\n## Working with supply chain partners to drive climate action\n\nOne of SSE's SBTi-approved targets is to engage with 50% of suppliers (according to financial expenditure) to set their own science-based targets by 2024. Following on from the workshops held in 2020/21, which facilitated dialogue around science-based targets, during 2021/22, SSE continued to engage with key suppliers through direct engagement and hosted a live webinar, in partnership with the Supply Chain Sustainability School, on the topic of carbon. At 31 March 2022, 48% of SSE's suppliers (by value) had set or committed to set their own science-based targets through the SBTi. Over 2021/22, SSE and CDP Supply Chain collaborated to deliver its first supplier webinar focusing on carbon reporting, which reached over 50 key suppliers and contributed to the highest supplier response rate SSE has had since beginning supply chain reporting.\n\n## SSE's key developments in 2021/22:\n\n- \u00b7 SSE total scope 1 GHG emissions reduced by 10%, see page 54 \uf150 .\n- \u00b7 SSE's Net Zero Transition Plan sets it GHG targets and actions, see\n\nsse.com/sustainability\n\n\uf295\n\n.\n\n- \u00b7 SSE's Net Zero Transition Report summarises SSE's disclosed progress against its Net Zero Transition Plan, see sse.com/ sustainability \uf295 .",

        "page_content": "## A sustainable approach continued Protecting the environment continued\n\n## Conserving the natural environment\n\n## A strategy for environmental protection\n\nWhile SSE's GHG emissions are its most material environmental impact, it also has wider impacts on the natural world that must be carefully managed. SSE considers these environmental impacts through its Environment Strategy, which sits within SSE's sustainability hierarchy outlined on page 39 \uf150 . The strategy is founded on robust environmental management and governance, with three core environmental SDGs providing the framework for sustainable environmental development: SDG14 Life Below Water; SDG15 Life Above Land; and, SDG12 Responsible Consumption and Production.\n\nDetail on SSE's environmental impacts and how it is managing them is outlined in this section, as well as in SSE's Sustainability Report 2022 \uf223 .\n\n## Protecting the natural environment\n\nSSE operates in some of the UK and Ireland's most remote areas which are home to a wide variety of valuable ecosystems and habitats. It works to manage its impacts of its activities to ensure it protects and, where possible enhance these environments.\n\nAll of SSE's Business Units have signed up to no net loss in biodiversity by 2023 and net gain in biodiversity by 2025 on onshore Large Capital Projects. As part of its approach to biodiversity net gain, SSEN Transmission is implementing its optioneering toolkit which allows consideration of biodiversity at the earliest stages of development and which has won a number of external awards.\n\nWith the increasing focus on how to effectively value nature, which has included the publication of the Taskforce for Nature-related Finance Disclosures (TNFD) Beta framework in March 2022, SSE is closely monitoring developments in this area and is now a member of the TNFD Forum, a multi-disciplinary consultative group of over 350 members, to help inform its next steps. You can read more about SSE's initiative to protect and enhance the natural environment in its Biodiversity Report and Sustainability Report 2022 \uf295 .\n\n## Managing water use\n\nWater plays a significant role in SSE's operations, being used in the energy production process including as a coolant in power stations and a source for power generation in hydroelectric generators. SSE also uses water as an amenity in its buildings.\n\nSSE has robust policies and processes in place, and works closely with environmental regulators, to ensure that it uses water in a sustainable way in its operations. SSE has an ongoing investment programme within its hydro operations to improve efficiency, enhance water capture and minimise spill from its plant. None of SSE's thermal and hydro generation assets impact on water stressed areas, as defined by the relevant environmental regulators in the jurisdictions in which they operate.\n\nIn 2020/21, total water abstracted by SSE fell to 23,896 million m 3 from 26,032 million m 3 the previous year. This was largely due to a reduction in water passing through SSE's hydro generation plant as a result of lower levels of rainfall compared to the previous year. The vast majority (97%) of water abstracted in 2021/22 was used in SSE's hydro generation operations. This water is technically recorded as abstracted, but it passes through turbines to generate electricity and is returned to the\n\nenvironment almost immediately, and therefore has minimal environmental impact. To help stakeholders to understand a more proportionate environmental\n\nimpact, water abstracted volumes are also provided in the table excluding hydro generation data. SSE's total water abstracted excluding hydro operations also fell over this period. This was predominantly due to a reduction in thermal generation output which resulted in a corresponding fall in water abstracted.\n\n## Total water abstracted by SSE (excluding hydro generation) (million m 3 )\n\n- Fresh water (rivers and groundwater)\n- Brackish and estuarine water\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTotal water consumed also fell significantly over this period, by over 78%. This was due to reduced output from thermal generation overall, as well as a proportional reduction in the output from thermal power plant with cooling systems that have evaporative losses of water.\n\n|                                                                         | Unit        | 2021/22    | 2020/21   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------|-----------|\n| Water use                                                               |             |            |           |\n| Total water abstracted                                                  | Million m 3 | 23,896 (A) | 26,032 *  |\n| Total water abstracted   (exc. hydro generation)                        | Million m 3 | 779        | 832       |\n| Freshwater abstracted (rivers and groundwater)  (exc. hydro generation) | Million m 3 | 1.9        | 13.6      |\n| Total water returned                                                    | Million m 3 | 23,895 (A) | 26,028 *  |\n| Total water consumed                                                    | Million m 3 | 0.8 (A)    | 3.9 *     |\n\n- (A)  This data was subject to external independent assurance in 2022.

        "page_content": "## SSE's energy consumption\n\nBetween 2020/21 and 2021/22, the energy SSE purchased for use in its assets (offices, depots, thermal power stations, gas storage facilities, and data centres) fell by around 16%, from 234GWh to 196GWh.\n\nEnergy consumed in SSE's thermal power stations and gas storage facilities fell by 17% compared to 2020/21. This was largely due to a fall in electricity consumed at the now closed Fiddler's Ferry coal-fired power station, as decommissioning activity reduced, and a reduction in energy consumption at SSE's Aldborough gas storage facility.\n\nEnergy consumed in SSE's offices, depots and data centres also fell slightly. Despite an increase in numbers of employees working from home due to the pandemic, energy consumption in SSE's facility managed offices has not reduced significantly due to the need to maintain buildings to meet heating and ventilation industry and government guidelines for the safe operation of buildings.\n\nDuring 2021/22, SSE invested in a range of energy efficiency measures including a programme of LED lighting upgrades to depot sites. Over this period, SSE purchased 100% of its electricity for use in its facility managed offices from renewable sources, backed by renewable guarantees. In 2020/21, 39% of the electricity that SSE purchased for its assets was from renewable sources, up from 29% the previous year.\n\n## Data assurance and environmental metrics\n\nSSE takes an integrated approach towards assurance utilising internal audit and external assurance providers to ensure accurate, complete disclosures. Where data has been externally and independently assured, this has been noted in the relevant tables. In all other areas, data is identified and disclosed according to SSE's internal processes, guided by environmental regulations where appropriate.\n\nSSE's 'Better Off' behaviour change campaign, alongside its investment of \u00a312.8m since 2011/12 in energy efficiency and building renewable generation programmes, has helped to reduce carbon emissions from energy used in its facility managed offices by 42% since 2017/18. SSE is a member of the Climate Group's EP100 initiative to encourage businesses to\n\ndouble energy productivity associated with office and depot buildings by 2030 from a 2011 baseline. From 1 April 2022 onwards SSE will revise its annual reduction target to 7.19% against a 2020/21 baseline, to align with its ambition of achieving a net zero non-operational buildings (offices, depots and data centres) estate by 2035.\n\n| Energy use*                                                | Unit   | 2021/22      | 2020/21   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------------|-----------|\n| Purchased heat from non-renewable sources  - UK/Ire        | GWh    | 3.3/0.08 (A) | 3.6/0.14  |\n| Purchased electricity from renewable sources  - UK/Ire     | GWh    | 73.3/0.98    | 87.3/0.9  |\n| Purchased electricity from non-renewable  sources - UK/Ire | GWh    | 118.6/0      | 142.4/0   |\n\n- * This information, taken in conjunction with the Carbon performance summary table on page 54 \uf150 , represents SSE's disclosures in line with the UK Government Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting requirements.\n\n## Managing air emissions\n\nIn 2020/21, SSE's thermal generation sites emitted 4,573 tonnes of nitrogen oxides (NOx), compared 4,106 tonnes the previous year, an increase of around 11%. Emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) more than doubled to 3,021 tonnes, from 1,378 tonnes the previous year. In addition, particulate emissions (PM10) rose to 277 tonnes, from 182 tonnes in 2020/21, and mercury emissions to air decreased significantly from 19.5kg in 2021/21, to 1.9kg in 2021/22.\n\nThe rising trend across three of these key air emission sources, reflects the increased demand for oil-fuelled peaking plant in Ireland that arose as a result of the need to balance the grid.\n\nIn 2021/22, SSE's sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) emissions increased slightly to 305kg from 295kg the previous year. SF 6 is widely used by the electricity industry around the world due to its insulating properties and therefore its ability to keep people safe from electrical 'arcing', however it is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG). SSE has a number of initiatives to reduce GHG emissions from SF 6 in its networks, including working with suppliers to install SF 6 -free alternatives across its electricity transmission network. You can read more about what SSE is doing to reduce the impact of SF 6 in its business activities in its Sustainability Report 2022 \uf223 and its Net Zero Transition Plan.\n\n|                                                                                                            | Unit   | 2021/22   | 2020/21   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|\n| Air emissions                                                                                              |        |           |           |\n| Sulphur dioxide (SO2) - thermal generation                                                                 | Tonnes | 3,021     | 1,378     |\n| Nitrogen oxide (NOx) - thermal generation                                                                  | Tonnes | 4,573     | 4,106     |\n| Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) - thermal generation  and electricity transmission and distribution  activities | kg     | 305       | 295       |\n| Particulates emissions (PM10) from thermal  generation assets                                              | Tonnes | 277       | 182       |\n| Mercury emissions from thermal generation  assets                                                          | kg     | 1.9       | 19.5      |",

        "page_content": "## A sustainable approach continued\n\n## SSE's social contribution\n\nFollowing its publication of the world's first company Just Transition Strategy, SSE has been ranked top in the World Benchmarking Alliance's just transition assessment. Continued leadership on a transition to net zero which happens in a way that is fair and just for workers, communities and consumers is a key strategic objective for SSE.\n\n## Generating value across society\n\n## Contribution to GDP and jobs\n\nWith a \u00a312.5bn Net Zero Acceleration Programme, the way this money is invested can deliver significant economic benefits to communities and businesses in the places SSE operates within. To understand its wider socio-economic contribution, SSE has commissioned PwC to measure the value it adds to GDP and the jobs it supports across the Scottish, UK and Irish\n\neconomies for the last 11 years. In total over 2021/22, SSE added \u00a35.8bn to UK GDP, of which over \u00a32bn was in Scotland, and \u20ac438m to Irish GDP. While the contribution to Irish GDP was consistent with last year (2020/21: \u20ac439m), this represents an increase of 36% increase in the Scottish GDP contribution (2020/21: \u00a31.5bn) and a 12% increase in the UK GDP contribution (2020/21: \u00a35.2bn), driven by\n\nSSE's major investments in projects like Dogger Bank, Seagreen and Viking wind farms. SSE supported a total of 47,130 jobs across the UK and Ireland in 2021/22.\n\nSSE also publishes socio-economic analysis for individual projects. Over 2021/22, SSE published reports on the socio-economic impact of Keadby 3 and Peterhead 2 CCGT plants. All socioeconomic reports for the SSE Group and at a project-level can be found on sse.com/sustainability/reporting \uf295 .\n\n## Paying a fair share of tax\n\nSSE has long recognised that paying a fair share of tax is part of its social licence to operate and right to make a profit. SSE has been accredited with the Fair Tax Mark since 2014. This means the Fair Tax Foundation has independently assessed it as having a responsible and transparent approach to paying tax, and that SSE explicitly rules out the use of tax havens or an aggressive approach to tax avoidance.\n\nOver 2021/22, SSE's total tax contribution was \u00a3944m, split between \u00a3375m in taxes paid (including \u00a370m paid in corporation tax) and \u00a3569m in taxes collected. This is a decrease of 5.5%, 5.6% and 5.4% respectively compared to 2020/21. This small reduction was the result of three key drivers: (1) 2020/21 tax figures include the tax contribution from SSE Contracting over the full financial year, whereas the disposal of this business in 2021/22 means that the tax contribution from SSE Contracting was only included up to 30 June 2021; (2) environmental taxes paid were lower this year due to outages at some generation sites; and (3) environmental taxes collected were lower due to lower energy usage by business customers.\n\n## 2021/22 UK and Irish GDP contribution, jobs supported and taxes paid\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Further information on SSE's tax contribution can be found in the Sustainability Report 2022. Each year SSE also publishes a Talking Tax report which provides detailed information on the taxes it pays in every jurisdiction it operates within, with disclosure of its tax strategy and approach. SSE's Talking Tax reports can be found on sse.com/sustainability \uf295 .\n\n## Targeting sustainable supply chains\n\nAn overhaul of SSE's sustainable procurement strategy began in 2020, recognising the opportunity for an increased focus on social and environmental value through its supply chain. SSE's new Sustainable Procurement Code and accompanying Supplier Guidance document were published in April 2021, with both documents available on SSE's website. All suppliers working with SSE must sign-up to the new Code which aligns to the Group's overall sustainability approach and UN's SDGs most material to the Company. The Code sets out in detail the sustainability requirements and expectations for SSE's suppliers.\n\nOver 2021/22, SSE has also embedded risk-based sustainability questions within its new sourcing system for all tender events to support the consideration of sustainability more fully throughout the supply chain, with a weighting of up to 20% for sustainability criteria. Registration and pre-qualification questionnaires have also been reviewed to include enhanced sustainability questions. Recognising the need for improved sustainability data capture from its suppliers, SSEN Transmission also launched its new supply chain reporting tool in 2021/22.\n\nFinally, collaboration with its supply chain partners is central to delivery of SSE's sustainable procurement strategy. Sustainability is now an agenda item at all Strategic Relationship Management (SRM) meetings. With 34 SRM suppliers, each is required to provide a detailed annual business update inclusive of sustainability. SSE has also been working with a number of these suppliers to develop and launch the new global Powering Net Zero Pact (see case study below.)\n\n## Embedding sustainability through Large Capital Projects\n\nSSE undertook an initiative over 2021/22 to ensure its Large Capital Projects (LCPs) are designed and constructed to enable the journey to net zero, deliver socio-economic benefits and facilitate a just transition. The newly updated LCP Governance Manual now includes guidance and requirements to embed sustainability through SSE's LCPs, ensuring sustainability risks are mitigated and sustainability opportunities maximised across 10 sustainability criteria. From 1 April 2022, a Sustainability Assessment and Action Plan (SAAP) is required for all new or early development projects, ensuring that sustainability is incorporated into all phases of major project development, construction and operation. Guidance, training and additional resources for project teams were also developed to support the roll-out of this new approach. While sustainability has always been a key consideration in SSE's LCP activity, this work has helped to formalise it as part of the overall governance approach.\n\n## Delivering local opportunities and community investment\n\nAn integral part of a just transition is delivering opportunities and sharing value locally. SSE primarily does this in two ways: providing local jobs and supply chain investment; and granting direct funds for community projects. With the level of ambition and action needed to reach net zero, there are many opportunities to deliver sustainable, competitive domestic supply chains which maximise local economic benefits. Information on SSE's focus on supporting local supply chains can be found in the Sustainability Report 2022.\n\nOver 2021/22, \u00a39.7m of community investment grants were administered by SSE Renewables (2020/21: \u00a310.2m). This financed 1,048 community projects across the UK and Ireland, including more than 130 rural jobs, 96 scholarships and 108 community projects which enhance local net zero ambitions. Detailed disclosure on this funding can be found on sserenewables.com/communities \uf295 . In addition to this direct community investment through renewables projects, almost \u00a3500,000 was administered to communities through SSEN's Resilient Communities Fund, and a further \u00a31m was donated by SSE directly to the Disasters Emergency Committee in support of humanitarian aid in Ukraine.\n\n## ENGAGEMENT IN ACTION SUPPLIERS, CONTRACTORS AND PARTNERS\n\n## INTRODUCING THE POWERING NET ZERO PACT\n\nThe Powering Net Zero Pact ('the Pact') is a new initiative created by SSE with a group of other leading companies working across the power sector, which was developed as a legacy of COP26. The Pact aims to bring together companies across all tiers of the power sector globally to achieve a fair and just energy transition to net zero.\n\nOver a six-month period, the 11 founding partners of the Pact - which alongside SSE includes: Balfour Beatty; DEME Group; GE Renewables; Hitachi Energy; NKT; RJ McLeod; Siemens Energy; Siemens Gamesa; Subsea 7; and Vestas - met on a regular basis to\n\nagree areas of focus, shared commitments and topics for future collaboration. Together the founding partners operate in over 100 countries, employ more than 240,000 people globally, had a combined turnover in 2021 of around \u00a356bn, and work with approximately 120,000 suppliers.\n\nThe Pact focuses on five areas of ambition: (1) achieving net zero carbon emissions; (2) protecting and enhancing the natural environment; (3)transitioning to a circular economy; (4) guaranteeing fair work and sustainable jobs; and (5) adding value to local communities. Each area of ambition has a shared\n\ncommitment and area for collaboration. For example, to achieve net zero, Pact signatories commit to working towards 1.5\u00b0C science-based carbon targets by 2025 and will participate in a working group focused on the quantification of scope 3 carbon emissions.\n\nThe Powering Net Zero Pact launched in Glasgow in May 2022, six months on from COP26. Any company involved in the power sector which shares the ambition of the Pact can become a signatory. More information can be found on sse.com/sustainability/ poweringnetzeropact \uf295 .",

        "page_content": "## A sustainable approach continued SSE's social contribution continued\n\n## Guaranteeing fair work and good jobs\n\n## Growing green jobs\n\nThe scale of growth needed to deliver SSE's net zero ambitions will result in significant employment opportunities. SSE plans to create 1,000 jobs every year to 2026. Opportunities will be created for new employees across a range of positions in many different areas across the UK, Ireland and beyond.\n\nThe sharpening of SSE's strategic focus around electricity infrastructure and net zero saw it continue with planned disposals of non-core business areas over 2021/22. These changes, which impacted around 2,300 employees, were undertaken with full consultation with impacted employees and employee representatives.\n\nDue to the disposal of certain business areas, SSE's headcount reduced from 12,489 at the end of 2020/21 to 10,754 at the end of 2021/22. However, to meet the demand of its other growing Business Units, the total number of people joining SSE rose from 1,529 in 2020/21 to 2,290 in 2021/22. This means that SSE filled a total of 3,195 positions across internal and external recruitment over 2021/22, an increase of 43% from 2020/21. The size of SSE's contingent workforce reduced between 2020/21 and 2021/22, from 1,950 to 1,767 people. This is attributed in part to the reshaping of the business and in part to the impact of the IR35 tax regulations.\n\nSSE's employee retention levels in 2020/21 were historically high. As stated in the Annual Report 2021, this was largely attributed to the coronavirus crisis and consequential reduced activity within the wider labour market. Coinciding with the easing of coronavirus restrictions, SSE's 2021/22 retention levels have decreased compared from 2020/21, from 92.1% to 90.5%, however this remains higher than the 2019/20 retention rate of 88.0%. SSE's 2021/22 voluntary turnover rate was 7.8% (2020/21: 3.6%, 2019/20: 6.5%). Attraction and retention of employees remains a key focus for SSE.\n\n## Committed to leading labour standards\n\nCreating job opportunities is an important element of the just transition to net zero, however ensuring these are high-quality jobs is equally important. SSE implements robust\n\nlabour standards in line with its responsible employer ethos, going beyond minimum standards to ensure that those that work for it, either directly or on its behalf through its supply chain, are treated fairly and with dignity and respect.\n\n## Protecting health and safety\n\nSafety remains SSE's first priority with the objective that 'everyone gets home safe'. In the 2021 all-employee Great Place to Work survey which had a 77% response rate, 92% of employees said that they work in a safe and healthy work environment and 90% said that SSE makes it easy for people to do the right thing on Safety, Health and Environment.\n\nOver 2021/22, SSE achieved 254 Safe Days (days where there were no minor, serious or major SSE or contractor safety or environmental incidents or any incident with high potential for harm to people or the environment) and reported a Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) for employees and contractors combined of 0.17 per 100,000 hours worked. The number of Safe Days decreased and the TRIR increased in 2021/22 compared to 2020/21. SSE believes this is a result of employees continuing to manage the implications of the coronavirus pandemic and changes in working patterns, including a significant increase in contractor hours. Support for employees during the coronavirus pandemic continued over 2021/22.\n\nFurther information on SSE's health and safety performance over 2021/22 is provided in the Safety, Sustainability, Health and Environment Advisory Committee report on pages 164 to 167 \uf150 and in the Sustainability Report 2022 \uf223 .\n\n## Paying the real Living Wage\n\nSSE has been a Living Wage accredited employer in the UK since 2013 and has paid the Living Wage in Ireland since 2016. SSE began chairing Living Wage Scotland's Leadership Group in April 2021 and the company is now beginning to explore how it extends its commitment to paying workers a real Living Wage beyond just the UK and Ireland.\n\n## Guaranteeing secure working hours\n\nLiving Hours guarantees workers with fair and secure working hours alongside a real Living Wage, specifically requiring:\n\n- \u00b7 Decent notice periods for shifts of at least four weeks, with guaranteed payment if shifts are cancelled within this notice period;\n- \u00b7 The right to a contract that reflects accurate hours worked; and\n- \u00b7 A guaranteed minimum of 16 hours a week (unless the employee requests otherwise).\n\nSince its accreditation as a Living Hours employer in March 2021, SSE has been working to roll-out this enhanced standard across its supply chain. It also continues to be a member of the Living Wage Foundation's Living Hours Steering Group where it provides advice and a business perspective on how to grow the accreditation initiative.\n\nRecognising the issue of work security more broadly, the vast majority of SSE employees are on permanent contracts. In 2021/22, 94.4% of employees were on permanent contracts, 0.6% were on non-guaranteed or short hour contracts, and 5% were on temporary contracts.\n\n## Developing employees from within\n\nSSE's investment in learning, training and development increased to \u00a37.5m in 2021/22 from \u00a36.8m in 2020/21. Average training hours per full-time employee also returned to near pre-pandemic levels (2021/22: 20.7, 2020/21: 9, 2019/20: 23.4), with 84.2% of SSE's employees receiving some form of training over the year.\n\nIn addition, while the number of people on one of SSE's pipeline programmes (apprenticeships, technical skills trainee programmes, graduate programmes, conversion programmes and other pipeline programmes) remained relatively static (2021/22: 465 individuals, 2020/21: 470 individuals), the decrease in SSE's headcount meant that this actually represented a notable increase in the proportion of SSE's workforce on a pipeline programme, rising from 3.8% to 4.3%. Investment in pipeline programmes also increased to \u00a39.8m in 2021/22 from \u00a39.0m in 2020/21. This brings SSE's total investment in pipeline programmes over the last three years to just under \u00a330m.\n\nMore information on SSE's approach to learning and development and its training programmes can be found in its Sustainability Report 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Boosting inclusion and diversity\n\nSSE understands that greater inclusion and diversity is central to its success going forward, which is why it has reviewed and refocused efforts over 2021/22 to accelerate progress. Detail can be found on the inclusion and diversity section of this report (see pages 64 and 65 \uf150 and within SSE's Inclusion and Diversity Report 2022, available on sse.com/sustainability/ reporting \uf295 .\n\n## Valuing employee voice\n\nEveryone that works for SSE has the fundamental right to freedom of association and to join a trade union. SSE has four recognised trade union partners (Prospect, Unite, Unison and the GMB)\n\n## ENGAGEMENT IN ACTION EMPLOYEES\n\nwhich it works with through the Joint Negotiating and Consultative Committee and through regular on-going dialogue.

See the stakeholder engagement section on employees on page 34 \uf150 and the case study below for more information.\n\n## Providing employee benefits\n\nSSE offers a wide range of employee benefits, detailed on careers.sse.com/ employee-benefits \uf295 . This includes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SUPPORTING WORKERS TRANSITION FROM HIGH TO LOW/hyphen.caseCARBON CAREERS\n\nOver 2021/22, SSE undertook wideranging stakeholder engagement on its just transition approach. This included meeting and consulting with policy makers, trade union partners, suppliers, oil and gas companies, investors, academics, and industry and skills bodies. Most importantly though, SSE sought insights from its own employees.\n\nUsing SSE's 2021 Great Place to Work survey, the company established that more than 1 in 5 of all employees had previously worked in high-carbon roles, rising to as high as a third of all employees in certain parts of the business such as SSE Renewables. To understand the drivers of change, and what SSE could do better to further attract and retain people from highcarbon industries, the Company undertook qualitative research with employees that had previously worked in high-carbon roles. Over 150 of these employees answered a detailed just transition survey, providing SSE with rich information about their experiences and offering feedback for the company.\n\nThese findings, and the wider engagement with other stakeholders, were used to inform SSE's second report on the just transition which was published in September 2021. This\n\nreport, ' From Principles to Action' , looks specifically at how best to support workers make the move from high to low-carbon careers. It outlines 20 commitments for SSE as well as 10 recommendations for industry and 10 recommendations for Government. It also includes 137 individual pieces of advice from SSE employees that have made the transition, verbatim and uncensored.\n\nAt an industry and government level, these recommendations include developing 'all energy' frameworks for skills, fair work terms where there is public sector support for climate action, and making sure net zero sector plans embed the concept of a just transition. For SSE, commitments include things like not asking for industry-specific experience unless it is genuinely required, piloting an engineering conversion programme, and paying for workers to develop the skills they need.\n\nSSE has continued to work with its employees on its just transition approach. Beginning in March 2022, a programme of just transition employee focus groups commenced to gather deeper insights on the opportunities and challenges from a worker perspective. This included an employee focus group session in March 2022 held\n\nflexible working arrangements, 21 weeks of fully-paid maternity leave, all-employee share plans, a holiday purchase scheme, cycle-to-work schemes, salary sacrifice low emissions car scheme, and technology loans. 96% of SSE's employees participated in one of its pension schemes over 2021/22.\n\n## Transparency of workforce disclosure\n\nSSE provides open disclosure on its direct and supply chain workforce. In 2021/22, the company participated in the investorled Workforce Disclosure Initiative (WDI) survey for the sixth consecutive year, remaining in the 10% of submissions for open disclosure.\n\njointly with one of SSE's recognised trade union partners, Prospect. SSE has also created a new page on its careers website specifically designed for those interested in joining the company from high-carbon sectors.\n\nSSE's Just Transition Strategy, its 'From Principles to Action' report and wider information on its just transition approach is available on sse.com/ sustainability/just-transition \uf295 .\n\n<!-- image -->",

Underpinning this is a strong commitment to a healthy business culture that supports people to do the right thing.\n\nSSE's guide to good business ethics is updated regularly, and underwent a full review over 2021/22. The guide applies both to direct employees and those that work on SSE's behalf. It is promoted to all employees through SSE's internal communication channels and mandatory elearning modules, and is highlighted to suppliers on page 1 of SSE's Sustainable Procurement Code. Topics covered include bribery and corruption, fair competition, business separation, engagement with politicians and regulators, modern slavery, safeguarding the environment, managing data and cyber security. SSE's 'Doing the Right Thing' guide is publicly available on sse.com/sustainability/policies-andassurances \uf295 .\n\nIn addition to this overall guide, guidance and supporting documents to help employees do the right thing include SSE's Financial Crime Guide, Anti-Financial Crime Framework, Group Inherent Fraud Risk\n\nSSE's 'Doing the right thing' guide to good business ethics is available on sse.com/sustainability \uf295 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRegister, Corporate Hospitality Procedure, and iComply portal.\n\nSpecific responsibility for financial crime horizon scanning, regulatory news and preparing internal financial crime updates sits with SSE's Group Anti Financial Crime Officer, with each of SSE's business units having their own Anti Financial Crime Officer that provide further support and guidance. SSE's Anti-Corruption and Financial Crime Committee reports directly into the Group Risk Committee and is responsible for driving adherence and monitoring implementation of SSE's Group Corruption and Financial Crime Prevention Policy which is also publicly available.\n\nTo ensure a constant minimum standard across SSE's workforce on good business ethics, SSE has a suite of mandatory ethics and compliance training modules. This includes modules on Fraud Awareness, Bribery and Anti-Corruption, and AntiMoney Laundering and Financial Sanctions which all employees must complete bi-annually, with additional modules on competition law and REMIT for selected employees.\n\nA review of cultural metrics is undertaken by SSE's senior leadership and a review of SSE's cultural dashboard is undertaken by the Board twice annually (see page 141 \uf150 ).\n\n## Reporting and investigating wrongdoing\n\nWhile SSE aims to reinforce a healthy culture at all levels of the organisation, it knows that sometimes things go wrong. The company therefore has an independent whistleblowing channel, SafeCall, as well as internal channels which employees can use to speak up against wrongdoing. SSE's Group Whistleblowing Policy is available on sse.com/ sustainability/policies-and-assurances \uf295 , with the effectiveness of SSE's whistleblowing arrangements reviewed twice yearly by the GEC and the Board.\n\nOver calendar year 2021, there were 52 reports of wrongdoing made through SSE's speak up channels, a 21% decrease from 66 reports over calendar year 2020 which is understood to be driven primarily by the impacts of Covid-19. Of these 52 reports: 17% related to Dishonest Behaviour (Fraud/\n\nTheft/Bribery/Integrity/Money Laundering/ Corruption); 27% related to HR (Bullying/ Harassment/Victimisation); 4% related to Inclusion and Diversity (Racism/ Discrimination/Unfair Treatment); 50% related to Health and Safety (General Safety/Covid-19/Environmental/Product Contamination); 2% related to Drugs/ Alcohol; and 0% related to Regulatory Compliance.\n\nAll of these reports of wrongdoing were passed on for formal investigation. one resulted in dismissal; four resulted in warnings issued; five resulted in no action taken; one was subsequently investigated as a grievance; 10 were investigated and partly substantiated but with no action taken; 19 were investigated but with the case was not proven; four resulted in an initial investigation establishing that there was insufficient evidence to proceed further; and eight cases could not be investigated due to insufficient information to establish the nature, cause, location or otherwise of the allegation being provided.\n\nEncouraging a 'speak up' culture is fundamental to an ethical business culture. People that work for SSE or on its behalf are encouraged to speak up without fear of retribution. SSE's Speak Up Aftercare Programme has been designed to promote good communication with people who speak up and reassurance that there will be no detriment for anyone speaking up in good faith. The Programme takes the form of a survey that is issued at the point of initial complaint, at 90 days and then at 180 days. Each survey is slightly different, having been designed to ensure that there is opportunity to highlight detriment in any form, provide an outlet for discussion and resolutions, and also seek feedback for SSE on the user experience, ease of reporting, what went well and to constantly improve the service we are offering.\n\n## Targeting modern slavery risk\n\nProtecting human rights and mitigating against the risk of modern slavery is the foundation of any good business and a fair and just transition to net zero. Over 2021/22, SSE continued to increase focus on this issue through delivery of its targeted Modern Slavery Action Plan. This Action Plan was created in 2020/21 following a gap analysis of its human rights approach",

Over 2021/22, SSE has refreshed its strategic approach to inclusion and diversity, recognising that this is an essential driver to deliver net zero in a way that is fair and affordable.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SSE's Inclusion and Diversity Report 2022\n\nReflecting its increased strategic focus to drive greater inclusion and diversity across the business, SSE has published a new comprehensive standalone Inclusion and Diversity Report 2022, providing detailed information on SSE's updated Inclusion and Diversity Strategy, progress made, and a range of key performance indicators for 2021/22. Transparency on its inclusion and diversity approach allows SSE to share successes and learnings, as well as gain feedback from key stakeholders. Read the report on sse.com/sustainability/reporting \uf295 .\n\n## 2022 gender pay gap\n\nSSE's headline gender pay gap figures as at 5 April 2022 are provided below, with further data, analysis and disclosure of actions taken to reduce the gap provided in SSE's Inclusion and Diversity Report 2022 \uf223 . SSE has voluntarily disclosed its Ireland Gender Pay Gap since 2021, calculated in line with the UK Gender Pay Gap methodology, based on a snapshot date of 5 April. The figures below follow this approach for 2022. In May 2022, the Irish Government launched new mandatory requirements for calculating the Gender Pay Gap in Ireland, which will require companies to use a June 2022 snapshot date and report this data publicly by December 2022. The June 2022 snapshot is beyond the last practicable day for inclusion in the Annual Report 2022 (being 24 May 2022), but SSE confirms the data will be reported in line with stated December deadline.\n\n## UK (93% of SSE's total 2021/22 workforce)\n\nMean gender pay gap:\n\n13.2%\n\n2021: 16.5%\n\nMedian gender pay gap:\n\n18.0%\n\n2021: 18.3%\n\nIreland (7% of SSE's total 2021/22 workforce)\n\nMean gender pay gap:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2021: 18.9%\n\n18.4%\n\nMedian gender pay gap:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2021: 27.1%\n\n25.6%\n\nIn 2021/22, SSE refreshed its Inclusion and Diversity Strategy by developing four strategic areas of focus: (1) Ambition; (2) Education and Development; (3) Inclusive Processes; and (4) Employee Voice. The new strategy relies on a collective effort and focus from all leaders. Actions to help shape and influence positive change in delivering greater inclusion and diversity are informed through collaboration with external partners to identify opportunities for further improvement, as well as listening to employees' lived experiences.\n\nThe refresh ensures SSE delivers greater inclusion and diversity across all levels of the Company and embeds systemic and behavioural change, supporting the delivery of SSE's 'IN, ON, UP' approach which it has been implementing since 2017. This approach, developed with inclusion experts EAInclusion, focuses on attracting diverse talent IN, enabling them to stay ON, and supporting them to progress UP, by providing opportunities that are fair and transparent for all.\n\nA high-level overview of progress against the new strategy is outlined on these pages, with more detail available in SSE's Inclusion and Diversity Report 2022 \uf223 .\n\n## 1. Ambition: setting measurable goals\n\nSSE has simplified its gender reporting and set new stretching gender ambitions in 2021/22, approved by the Group Executive Committee (GEC) and Boardlevel Nomination Committee. This includes increasing the proportion of women within the GEC and Direct reports to 40% by 2025, in line with the FTSE Women Leaders Review. In addition, SSE will increase female representation in its wider Leadership Group, which covers around 900 employees, to 40% by 2030, as well as increase overall female representation across the company to 33% by 2030. Performance against these ambitions is shown in the table on the following page, with information on key changes detailed below.\n\nAs at 31 March 2022, female representation across the Group Executive Committee and Direct Reports population (excluding administrative employees) was 22.4%. This represented a reduction from the 2020/21 level of 25% and was attributed to six men joining this population, whilst the number of women remained the same.\n\nBetween 31 March and the last practicable day for inclusion in the Annual Report 2022, 24 May 2022, a number of planned changes within the above group came into effect. These were the effective appointment of Catherine Raw as MD, Thermal as previously announced in February 2022; structural changes across the SSE Renewables",

As a result, female representation in the GEC has decreased from 25% to 20%, but has risen across the Group Executive Committee and Direct Reports from 22.4% to 34.2%.\n\nSSE considers external benchmarking when setting ambitions, which includes the FTSE Women Leaders Review, the successor to the Hampton Alexander, as well as the Workforce Disclosure Initiative, the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, and the UN Women's Empowerment Principles gap analysis tool.\n\nSupplementing its externally disclosed gender ambitions, SSE tracks progress against a wider range of diversity metrics, including the proportion of women, ethnic minority, disabled and LGBTQ+ employees. Senior leaders have a quarterly focus on progress against broader internal inclusion and diversity ambitions. These metrics are reviewed by the GEC twice yearly and by the Board annually, with the company exploring options for setting diversity ambitions beyond gender.\n\n## 2. Education  and development: focusing on behaviours\n\nSenior leadership commitment to inclusion and diversity is paramount for delivering change, and SSE's leaders have a responsibility to build a culture of belonging for all. To support its senior leaders to do this, SSE invests in behavioural change initiatives and resources.\n\nIn 2021/22, SSE provided a series of educational interventions to ensure that inclusion and diversity is prioritised, build\n\ncollective leadership confidence to create the right environment, and lead inclusively.\n\nThis included the 'Igniting Inclusion Development Programme', developed in partnership with Ashridge Business School, which provided insights, education, and discussion on: the Neuroscience of Inclusion and Diversity; Growth Mindsets; and Psychological Safety. 186 senior leaders participated in this programme, with 94% of those who responded to the feedback survey on the three sessions reporting a better understanding of the topics, and 95% felt more confident in applying their learning.\n\nSSE has dedicated internal webpages which act as a central point of resource for all employees. This includes best practice materials, webinar recordings, learning materials, employee blogs and vlogs to talk about experiences, and manager guides to support employees and managers with how to create an inclusive workplace.\n\nSSE developed a Strategic Secondary School network across 25 priority locations, offering a bespoke programme based on Tomorrow's Engineers STEM Code to inspire and showcase the range of opportunities within the energy sector. The secondary schools are chosen by indicators such as high levels of Black, Asian and Minority ethnicities, areas of deprivation, gender imbalance in STEM subjects, and attainment gaps or rurality.\n\nSSE is currently working with its social mobility education partner, Teach First, to build a Just Transition themed programme for all primary schools throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland. The content for both primary and secondary is curriculum aligned, inclusive and demonstrates diversity.\n\nThere are 38 secondary school Strategic Partnerships with a STEM Volunteer community of 365 across the Businesses, geographic spread and various disciplines. In 2021/22 SSE delivered over 159 educational interventions across the UK, with an average\n\nscore of 9/10 for both 'Helpful to pupils' learning' and 'Helpful to pupils' career aspirations' from the host teachers.\n\n## 3. Inclusive  processes: embedding best practice\n\nDeveloping robust policies and processes, to embed inclusion and diversity, ensures SSE creates a workplace that supports all employees and future employees. SSE believes improved diversity characteristics are a result of embedding best practice into existing process and routinely reporting on key drivers of inclusion.\n\nA 'Hiring for Difference' scorecard, which is reviewed by the Group Executive Committee and Board quarterly, shows progress against targets on the percentage of diverse recruitment panels, number of roles openly advertised, and the promotion of flexible working for senior hires. Over 2021/22, these metrics have improved significantly to over 90% for each, with the number of diverse panels more than doubling since April 2021.\n\nIn addition, using diverse job candidate short-lists has improved from 33% in Q1 2021/22 to 80% in Q4 2021/22. SSE increased its hiring rate of women into its Leadership Group (around 900 employees), from 15% over 2020/21 to 32% over 2021/22, and as a result the female representation in SSE's Leadership Group has increased from 20.0% to 23.7%. In addition, SSE prioritised transferable skills in job descriptions, over technical skills, to increase the diversity of job applicants. This was done through facilitated workshops which challenged the details, tasks, and key requirements of job roles.\n\n## 4. Employee  voice: actively listening\n\nListening to SSE's employee voice helps to build trust with its employees, drives innovation, and focuses business priorities. It also helps employees feel valued, resulting in better job satisfaction and increased opportunities for development. Over 2021/22 SSE has listened to employees' lived experiences on subjects such as graduate recruitment and used this to drive inclusion and diversity forward by influencing the breadth and types of universities that it engages with as well as how information about SSE is positioned.\n\nSSE's 'Belonging Communities' aim to unite employees by encouraging open and constructive discussion. Focus groups were carried out over 2021/22 with several Belonging Communities, exploring how external best practices compare to lived experiences to create bespoke plans of action to help SSE be even more inclusive.",

SSE has engaged widely with governments, devolved administrations, regulators, and other stakeholders, both bilaterally and through its trade associations, to inform options for near term alleviation of the impact of rising energy bills on households and businesses in the UK and Ireland, particularly the most vulnerable.\n\nTo help reduce the economy's exposure to gas imports in the medium term, SSE has worked closely with governments, including on the UK's British Energy Security Strategy, to ensure its \u00a312.5bn Net Zero Acceleration Programme (NZAP) can have the greatest impact in reducing energy costs. To help protect the UK and Ireland from the next energy crisis, SSE has commissioned independent analysis to inform developing plans which aim to reduce costs, gas and carbon as soon as possible.\n\n## Responding to the affordability challenge\n\nSSE recognises the huge challenges faced by its customers during the current affordability crisis. Over winter 2021/22, SSE Airtricity provided up to \u20ac500,000 of funding for customers requiring additional support. The company has also established a \u20ac1m fund to directly support customers who may be struggling to pay their bills. The business also made a donation of \u20ac1m to a trusted all-island charity partner to support hard-to-reach cohorts struggling with the cost of living. In May 2022 a price promise was announced by SSE Airtricity to hold energy tariffs for existing domestic financially vulnerable customers in Ireland for the remainder of the year.\n\nSSE Airtricity has also expanded the range of external stakeholders it works with to include agencies working directly with customers in financial difficulty. The development of these partnerships has helped support direct referrals and provided better support for customers who are struggling. SSE is also supporting\n\nENGAGEMENT IN ACTION ENERGY CUSTOMERS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RESPONDING TO EXCEPTIONAL WEATHER EVENTS\n\nIn response to a 2021/22 winter of consecutive exceptional weather events, SSEN Distribution teams worked tirelessly to maintain supply with a particular focus on supporting isolated and vulnerable customers. Between November 2021 and February 2022, SSE's network areas in both north and south were tested by six exceptional weather events, including back-to-back named storms with three storms occurring in just one week.\n\nIn the aftermath of storms Arwen, Malik, Corrie and Eunice, around 430,000 customers were affected and SSEN's\n\nPriority Services Register, which had been extended in response to the coronavirus pandemic, was used extensively by dedicated outreach teams to proactively engage via phone and text message with vulnerable customers. Engagement with impacted customers was further enhanced on the ground by good attendance at around 90 Local Resilience Partnership meetings. In addition to the reconnection efforts by operational teams, localised support was provided through door-to-door welfare checks and the provision of more than 140,000 hot meals and drinks.\n\ncustomers with energy efficiency measures, including some free of charge energy upgrades to those experiencing fuel poverty, see the next page.\n\n## Providing an inclusive service\n\nSSEN Distribution attained the British Standard for inclusive service provision (BS 18477) for the sixth year in a row in 2021/22. This was achieved through rigorous assessments to ensure SSEN's policies, procedures and services are accessible and fair to all customers.\n\nSSEN Distribution's Priority Services Register (PSR) also provides help to those who need it most on the rare occasions there is a power cut. Throughout 2021/22, SSEN has been encouraging customers to sign up to the PSR, raising awareness of free additional services via podcasts, events, posters, and partnerships. The PSR had 768,104 people registered on it in at the end of 2021/22 (2020/21: 770,844). This covers 71.3% of eligible households in SSEN's distribution network areas, an increase from 68.5% in 2020/21.\n\nIn recognition of the hardship caused for customers by these extreme weather events, SSEN has boosted its Resilient Communities Fund to a total of \u00a32m across licence areas.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As part of this initiative, in April 2022 SSE Airtricity committed to delivering home energy upgrades to up to 600 homes experiencing fuel poverty free of charge. SSE Airtricity has also been awarded the contract to install the first communal heat pump system in Ireland, where 44 of the 88 units are assisted living centres.\n\nDuring 2021/22, SSE's business customers on green products grew from 6% to almost 30%. Over the year, the business ensured that customers joining or rolling onto new fixed contracts were provided with 100% renewable electricity, matched with independently verified and assured output from SSE's UK wind farms and hydro plants. In May 2021, a simplified Corporate Power Purchase Agreement (CPPA) approach was announced to enable a wider range of customers to purchase energy directly from SSE's renewable assets, giving customers fully traceable access to 100% renewable energy. Finally, in September\n\n2021, SSE also launched the Green EV tariff, which supports businesses running on, or switching to, electric vehicles and enables them to charge fleets with 100% renewable electricity. In response to feedback from SMEs which showed 84% considered product sustainability as an important procurement choice but 50% were unsure of actions required, SSE launched its new Energy Solutions website. The site provides a knowledge centre for customers to access the range of products available from SSE, and assist them with reducing the carbon footprint of their businesses and supply chains.\n\n## Unlocking local solutions through global partnerships\n\nAs part of its COP26 legacy and inspired by Project LEO, the most ambitious and holistic smart grid trial in the UK, SSEN developed a new global smart grid partnership. Discussions with global and community partners resulted in the launch of the International Community for Local Smart Grids (ICLSG). The ICLSG consists of electricity distribution companies from the UK, Australia, Italy and Japan, with SSEN, Ausgrid and Enel as founding partners. These companies have joined forces to revolutionise and support communities to engage with electricity grids of the future. Launched at COP26, the University of Oxford-led initiative in cooperation with the Enel Foundation, will bring together electricity networks and community energy groups, scientists, and practioners from across the world to remove barriers to\n\nENGAGEMENT IN ACTION NGOS, COMMUNITIES, CIVIL SOCIETY\n\n## BUILDING A SENSE OF COMMUNITY AROUND RIIO/hyphen.caseED2\n\nCommunities are at the core of SSEN Distribution's RIIO-ED2 business plan for the next price control. An extensive stakeholder engagement programme in 2021/22 gave more than 25,000 people the opportunity to have a say on the plan, shaping 64 outputs. The process featured qualitative and quantitative research, and 'Citizens Juries' were held on key ED2 topics such as sustainability and innovation while the Managing Director hosted a roundtable with fuel poverty charities, the regulator and consumer groups in November 2021.\n\nCOP26 provided a forum to engage on SSEN Distribution's role in a smart and fair transition to net zero through delivery of its ED2 plan. ED2 also featured in the business's established engagement framework which includes a Stakeholder Advisory Panel (meets quarterly); an ED2 Customer Engagement Group (met six times in the year); Inclusive Service Panels (met three times) and Connections Expert Customer Panels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndelivering net zero at a local level and share key learnings from innovation projects, facilitate discussions around challenges and support a collaborative transition to a decarbonised future. In addition to tackling climate change this partnership benefits consumers by building resilient communities.\n\n## Increasing accessibility of electric vehicles with Equal EV\n\nA core element of the just transition to net zero is ensuring it is cost-effective, secure and inclusive for all. This means ensuring opportunities are open to all customers and infrastructure is developed in a fair and accessible manner. Over 2021/22, SSEN Distribution continued its partnership with leading charity Disabled Motoring UK to support more blue badge holders to get on the road with EVs, and worked with Energy Systems Catapult (ESC) on the second phase of the Equal EV project. Equal EV aims to overcome the four key barriers preventing disabled motorists from making the switch and benefitting from low carbon transport. This includes: (1) accessibility of charging points; (2) costs of modifications; (3) range anxiety; and (4) lack of support with charging compatibilities. In March 2022, SSEN and ESC produced their first Equal EV report which maps out customer journeys for people with disabilities and identifies how available and emerging technologies can mitigate the barriers and challenges identified in the project's first phase.",

The Board aims to consider all material influencing factors and key external trends in the energy market, including those relating to climate change,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntechnological developments and capital flow and aims to do so in a way that reflects the expectations of SSE's key stakeholder groups.\n\nThese material influencing factors also have an impact on the nature and extent of risks the Board is willing to take to meet these objectives, and related mitigation strategies adopted by the Group. Material changes in the nature and potential impacts of SSE's Group Principal Risks are regularly assessed with appropriate mitigations implemented where necessary.\n\n## Overseeing risk\n\nThe Group Executive Committee and its sub-committees have responsibility for overseeing SSE's Principal Risks. During the third quarter of SSE's financial year, an assessment of each Principal Risk is completed by the assigned oversight committee. This assessment requires committee members to provide commentary on contextual changes to the risks, consider whether over the course of the year the risks have become more or less material based on impact and likelihood and to confirm procedures and policies are in place for controlling risks. Consideration is also given to emerging risks and whether any of those identified have the potential to become a Principal Risk to the business in the medium to long-term.\n\nThese responses are then consolidated into reports, one for each Principal Risk, which are presented back to the committees along with the results of provisional viability testing and analysis of relevant, current management information and key information relating to Business Unit Principal Risks and controls. These reports form the basis for the committees to discuss and confirm the risk trend (more, less or equally material), overall effectiveness of the risk control and monitoring environment, and whether any additional control improvement actions are required. This is an inclusive and iterative",

As such, following the 2021/22 review process and due to the development of a Joint Venture Governance framework throughout the year, the emerging risk 'Joint Venture and Partner Management' was not retained as an emerging risk. Joint Venture and Partner Governance has however been included as a key mitigation against the Group Principal Risks of Large Capital Project Management,\n\nPeople and Culture, Politics, Regulations and Compliance and Speed of Change.\n\nImportant revisions have also been made to the descriptions of each of the Principal Risks to take account of key developments and corresponding mitigations that were introduced during the year. Full details of the Group Principal Risks are available on pages 71 to 81 \uf150 .\n\n## Group Principal Risks\n\nThe graphic below illustrates SSE's 11 Group Principal Risks positioned on a relative basis against the output of the Principal Risk Self-Assessment process based on the residual risk score (impact vs likelihood) of each risk and the potential impact on Group Viability based on critical risk scenarios developed with business experts.",

        "page_content": "## Risk-informed decision making continued Managing SSE's Principal Risks continued\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nNo business is risk free and indeed the achievement of SSE's strategic objectives necessarily involves taking risk. SSE will however only accept risk where it is consistent with its core purpose, strategy and values; is well understood; can be effectively managed; is in line with stakeholder expectations and offers commensurate reward.\n\nThe sectors in which SSE operates continue to be subject to a high degree of political, regulatory and legislative risk as well as risks arising from other developments and change including technology, the impact of competition, stakeholders' evolving expectations and climate change.\n\nFurthermore, each of SSE's Business Units have differing levels of exposure to additional risks. For example, the Transmission and Distribution businesses are largely economically regulated and are characterised by relatively stable, inflation linked cash flows while the SSE Renewables business benefits from cash flows linked to government-mandated renewables subsidies. Those Business Units that generate and trade energy are also exposed to significant medium to long-term energy market and commodity risks in operational and investment decision making.\n\nThe key elements of SSE's Strategic Framework - including the focus on regulated energy networks and renewable sources of energy, particularly clean electricity, complemented by flexible thermal generation and business energy sales - and its financial objective in relation to dividend growth are fully reflective of its risk appetite.\n\nFundamentally:\n\n- \u00b7 SSE's strategy is to create value for shareholders and society in a sustainable way by developing, building, operating and investing in the electricity infrastructure and businesses needed in the transition to net zero.\n- \u00b7 SSE has a clear understanding of the risks and opportunities in the Great Britain and Ireland energy markets and these markets therefore continue to provide the Group's geographic focus, with any expansion into new international markets being subject to especially rigorous scrutiny and ensuring that the appropriate governance arrangements which are consistent with the Group's values and strategic goals are in place.\n- \u00b7 Safety is SSE's first value and it has no appetite for risks brought on by unsafe actions, nor does it have any appetite\n\nfor risks brought on by insecure actions including those relating to cyber security. In areas where SSE is exposed to risks for which it has little or no appetite, even though it has implemented high standards of control and mitigation, the nature of these risks mean that they cannot be eliminated completely.\n\nIn determining its appetite for specific risks, the Board is guided by three key principles:\n\n- 1. Risks should be consistent with SSE's core purpose, financial objectives, strategy and values;\n- 2. Risks should only be accepted where relevant approvals have been attained through the Governance Framework to confirm appropriate reward is achievable on the basis of objective evidence and in a manner that is consistent with SSE's purpose, strategy and values; and\n- 3. Risks should be actively controlled and monitored through the appropriate allocation of management and other resources, underpinned by the maintenance of a healthy business culture.\n\nThe Board has overall responsibility for determining the nature and extent of the risk it is willing to take to achieve strategic objectives and for ensuring that risks are managed effectively across the Group.\n\n## Viability Statement\n\nSSE provides the energy needed today while building a better world of energy for tomorrow. It develops, builds, operates and invests in low-carbon infrastructure in support of the transition to net zero, including onshore and offshore wind, hydro power, electricity transmission and distribution networks, localised flexible energy systems alongside providing energy products and services for businesses and other customers. The delivery of SSE's purpose and execution of its strategy depends on the skills and talent of a diverse workforce, the quality of its assets and the effective identification, understanding and mitigation of risk.\n\nAs required within provision 31 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board has formally assessed the prospects of the Company over the next four financial years to the period ending March 2026. The Directors have determined that as this time horizon aligns with the Group's Net Zero Acceleration Programme, which includes a fully funded capital investment programme to 2026, a greater degree of confidence over the forecasting assumptions modelled can be established.\n\nIn making this statement the Directors have considered the resilience of the Group\n\ntaking into account its current position, the Principal Risks facing the Group and the control measures in place to mitigate each of them. In particular the Directors recognise the significance of the strong balance sheet and total undrawn committed lending facilities of \u00a31.5bn - with \u00a31.3bn committed to March 2026 and \u00a30.2bn committed to October 2026. The Group is an owner and operator of critical national infrastructure and has a proven ability to maintain access to capital markets during stressed economic conditions. The Group has demonstrated this through securing \u00a31.2bn of funding since April 2021 including the issuance of a 1bn Euro Hybrid bond in April 2022. Further detail relating to planned funding is available in A6.3 Accompanying Information to the Financial Statements in the Annual Report and Accounts.\n\nThe Group has a number of highly attractive and relatively liquid assets - including a regulated asset base which benefits from a strong regulated revenue stream as well as the operational wind portfolio - which provide flexibility of options. This has been demonstrated through the success of the programme of disposals set out by the Group in June 2020 with \u00a32.8bn secured to date.\n\nTo help support this Statement, over the course of the year a suite of severe but plausible scenarios has been developed for each of SSE's Principal Risks. These scenarios are based on relevant real life events that have been observed either in the markets within which the Group operates or related markets globally. Examples include critical asset failure resulting in sustained impacts to network assets (for Energy Infrastructure Failure); changes to key government energy policies (for Politics, Regulation and Compliance); and the physical impacts of climate change on distribution assets through more frequent and increasingly severe storm events (for Climate Change).\n\nScenarios are stress tested against forecast available financial headroom and in addition to considering these in isolation, the Directors also consider the cumulative impact of different combinations of scenarios, including those that individually have the highest impact.\n\nUpon the basis of the analysis undertaken, and on the assumption that the fundamental regulatory and statutory framework of the markets in which the Group operates does not substantively change, and the Group continues to be able to refund its debt at maturity, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due in the period to March 2026.",

It positions SSE as a national clean energy champion with the scale to contribute around 20% of the UK's revised 50GW offshore wind target and over 20% of upcoming UK electricity networks investment, deploy flexible solutions to keep the lights on, whilst exporting its renewables capabilities overseas.\n- \u00b7 With electricity demand expected to more than double by 2050, regulated electricity networks are at the heart of the transition to net zero. SSEN Transmission and SSEN Distribution continue to form a key part of the low-carbon electricity core of SSE. The Net Zero Acceleration Programme could increase total networks Regulated Asset Value (RAV) to between \u00a38bn and \u00a310bn by 2031.\n\nGroup Executive Committee\n\n## Key mitigations\n\n- \u00b7 Policy Link: Business Unit Asset Management Policies.\n- \u00b7 SSE assesses the climate impact on its operations over the short, medium and long term from the perspective of market, policy or regulatory transition risks and opportunities and the physical risks of a changed climate.\n- \u00b7 SSE's dedicated Engineering Centre of Excellence reviews and develops plans to ensure the ongoing integrity of its generation assets is maintained.\n- \u00b7 Targeted investment plans to ensure the ongoing health and integrity of network assets.\n- \u00b7 Crisis management and business continuity plans are in place across the Group.

And SSE's conviction that a deliberatelyintegrated and well-balanced group of market-based and economically-regulated businesses offers the optimal route to value creation for shareholders has again been borne out in 2021/22.\n\nWe are proposing payment of a full-year dividend of 85.7p, in line with plan, and we remain committed to our existing five-year dividend plan to 2023, which targets dividend increases in line with RPI each year as set out on page 4 \uf150 .\n\nWe completed our \u00a32bn-plus disposals programme announced in June 2020 with the sale of our remaining financial stake in SGN for nearly \u00a31.3bn in cash proceeds. Overall we achieved headline consideration of over \u00a32.8bn from our disposals programme, significantly in excess of the original \u00a32bn target and this is reflected in the disparity in adjusted and reported metrics for the year.\n\nOver the course of the year we invested a record level of \u00a32.1bn in the assets and\n\ninfrastructure needed to maintain a 1.5\u00b0C pathway on global warming. Thanks to strong operational performance, adjusted operating profit increased by 15% to around \u00a31.5bn. And adjusted EPS was up 22% to 95.4p reflecting our strong performance in the year.\n\nWe have now updated our adjusted EPS CAGR target for 2026 from between 5-7% to between 7-10% due to confidence derived from strong delivery in 2021/22; higher inflationary forecasts; anticipation of continued volatile and high energy commodity prices; and evidence of increased value creation potential from flexibility provided by SSE's thermal and hydro generation, and gas storage assets.\n\nWe have financed ourselves robustly in uncertain times with good liquidity. We have a stable debt profile and our financing strength has enabled us to be nimble in the acquisition and partnering decisions we have made.\n\nOur balance sheet remains strong, supported as it is by word-class assets and investment-grade credit metrics. The credit rating agencies reviewed our Net Zero Acceleration Programme and we were\n\npleased with their positive response. SSE's S&P credit rating remains at BBB+ 'stable outlook' and our Moody's rating remains at Baa1, having been updated to 'stable outlook' after the announcement of our plans in November 2021.\n\nOur financial strength is critical in enabling us to take forward projects of the size and scale society needs, such as Berwick Bank which will be larger even than the world's largest wind farm that we are currently building at Dogger Bank.\n\nOverall, this year has underscored the advantages of a balanced, integrated business - giving investors strong returns in clearly volatile times and leaving us well positioned to take forward emerging opportunities across the clean energy value chain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGregor Alexander Finance Director 24 May 2022",

These adjusted measures are used for internal management reporting purposes and are believed to present the underlying performance of the Group in the most useful manner for ordinary shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nThe definitions SSE uses for adjusted measures are explained in the Alternative Performance Measures section before the Financial Statements. A reconciliation of adjusted operating profit by segment to reported operating profit by segment can be found in note 5.1(ii) to the Financial Statements.\n\nSegmental EBITDA results are included in note 5.1(v) to the Financial Statements.",

        "page_content": "## Impact from market volatility\n\nThe Group reduces direct exposure to short term commodity price volatility through its business mix, the disciplined application of its clearly defined approach to hedging and low VAR trading limits. Nevertheless, the higher and more volatile gas and power market prices, combined with increasing inflation rates have had some impact upon SSE's businesses which can be summarised as follows:\n\nSSEN Transmission and SSEN Distribution operate under a regulatory price control framework which is set by Ofgem. Returns under this framework have no direct relationship to gas and power market prices, however both allowed revenues and Regulated Asset Values are index linked (Transmission to CPI(H). Distribution to RPI (for ED1 price control) and CPI(H) (for ED2 price control)).\n\nWithin SSE Renewables , in periods where wind volume output was significantly lower than expected, excess forward sale contracts had to be 'bought back' in the market at higher prices, further reducing the trading result.\n\nFor SSE Thermal (as well as the Hydro plant within SSE Renewables), value has come from the ability of the plant to respond to market conditions and provide vital balancing services to provide security of supply and flexibility in higher, more volatile market conditions. The current market conditions are therefore generally positive for these businesses, although this is dependent upon plant availability at times of system stress.\n\nBoth EPM and Gas Storage , through their respective exposure to unsettled commodity contracts and physical gas inventory, have experienced significant positive unrealised mark-to-market remeasurement gains in the year. However, EPM is not expected to realise significant gains upon settlement of the contracts, as they are largely offset by significant adversely marked-to-market 'own use' operating derivatives which are excluded from disclosure as remeasurements under IFRS 9. In addition, for EPM, market volatility and retail energy supplier failure has resulted in a significant increase in the collateral requirements necessary to allow the businesses to continue to trade with counterparties and on exchanges as required. To date these increased collateral requirements have generally been managed by issuing new Letters of Credit, Guarantees and Performance Bonds, however exchange cash collateral requirements have been subject to volatility in recent months. The Group closely monitors this and maintains\n\nmore than sufficient liquidity to manage these increased collateral requirements.\n\n## SSE Business Energy and SSE Airtricity\n\n(aside from Northern Ireland, where SSE Airtricity is subject to a regulatory pricing mechanism) are not subject to a regulated price cap and therefore variable tariffs are adjusted dynamically and fixed tariff rates are reset for new customers as wholesale costs increase or decrease. Although the businesses are insulated against gas price rises insofar as they are fully hedged, there are external circumstances that would result in hedge adjustments such as weather, supplier failures and broader economic conditions. A dynamic forecasting approach has been in place to quickly respond to volume changes. In relation to Airtricity, vertical integration of generation and customer businesses in the Irish market limits commodity exposures with some benefit received through REFIT receipts on legacy wind assets.\n\nFinally, SSE Group is well funded with a strong investment grade credit rating, a high proportion of the \u00a38.6bn adjusted net debt (c.96%) is fixed rate and the long average maturity of SSE's debt is 6.8 years. The Group has been successful in challenging debt markets, issuing a \u20ac1bn Hybrid and \u00a3350m Private Placement post year-end. SSE's balance sheet strength allows the Group to meet additional collateral increases on higher and volatile commodity contracts, while the high proportion of fixed rate debt provides robust financing in an inflationary environment.\n\n## Operating profit\n\nAdjusted and reported operating profit/ losses in SSE's business segments for the year to 31 March 2022 are set out below; comparisons are with the same period to 31 March 2021 unless otherwise stated.\n\nSSEN Transmission: Adjusted and reported operating profit increased by 72% to \u00a3380.5m. This was mainly due to higher allowed revenues in FY22 (the first year of the RIIO-T2 price control) resulting from an increased proportion of higher totex allowances received through the 'fast money' mechanism, and an over-recovery of \u00a39m, as timing impacts passed from the Electricity System Operator to Transmission Operators. This higher revenue was partially offset by increases in operating costs and depreciation charges, as the business continues to expand its operational capability and asset base.\n\nSSEN Distribution: Adjusted and reported operating profit increased by 28% to \u00a3351.8m compared to \u00a3275.8m which was lower than expected due to a c.\u00a340m\n\nimpact of coronavirus in FY21 which will be recovered in FY23. In FY22, higher allowed revenue and an over-recovery of \u00a317m were partially offset by a \u00a351m increase in operating costs, c\u00a340m of which related to expenditure incurred managing the impact of several severe weather events during the year.\n\nSSE Renewables: Adjusted operating profit decreased by 22% to \u00a3568.1m, compared to \u00a3731.8m, mainly as developer profits of \u00a364m from a 10% stake disposal in Dogger Bank C on 10 February 2022 were lower than the \u00a3226m of developer profits in the prior year. Excluding developer profits, operating profit was broadly flat as exceptionally still and dry weather in the summer months led to a decrease in output of 7% or 0.7TWh compared to the prior year, offset by strong financial performance from hydro and pumped storage in volatile markets. The financial impact of lower output - equivalent to 13% or 1.4TWh below planned levels - included the cost of buying back hedged volumes at high market prices.\n\nIn addition to the factors outlined above, reported operating profit of \u00a3427.8m compared to \u00a3856.0m which included one-off exceptional gains of \u00a3214.5m. In addition, reported operating profit was also impacted by a \u00a321.5m increase in joint venture share of interest and tax charges and the impact of the UK Corporation tax rate change on deferred tax balances in joint ventures.\n\nSSE Thermal: adjusted operating profit increased 91% to \u00a3306.3m, compared to \u00a3160.5m. This increase was mainly due to higher achieved spark spread, including buying back forward power sales on high wind days, and strong performance in the balancing market. This was partially offset by non-recurring developer profits on the disposal of a 50% stake in Slough Multifuel in the prior period, lower profit contribution following divestment of Ferrybridge Multifuel and increased depreciation following the part-reversal of historic impairment charges at the half year.\n\nReported operating profit decreased to \u00a3630.1m from \u00a3775.3m in the prior year which had included one-off gains of \u00a3669.7m on the sale of Multifuel Energy and \u00a321.3m on Slough Multifuel offset by a \u00a358.1m exceptional impairment charge for Great Island CCGT. In addition to the factors affecting operational performance highlighted above, the reported result reflects the associated impairment reversal of \u00a3331.6m to the carrying value of SSE's CCGT assets following higher forward price curves, alongside other minor tax and interest movements.",

        "page_content": "## Financial review continued\n\nGas Storage: Adjusted operating profit of \u00a330.7m, compared with a prior year loss of \u00a3(5.7)m. SSE continues to operate the plant on a merchant basis, with the ability to capture positive gas price spreads during periods of heightened market volatility. The operating result for the period reflects continued volatile market conditions, which allows Gas Storage to optimise the value from storage of physical gas against changes in the spread between summer and winter prices.\n\nReported operating profit of \u00a3125.4m included an impairment reversal of \u00a397.3m as a result of improved operating prospects given projected gas price volatility, together with a \u00a3(2.6)m revaluation loss on gas held in storage, compared to a revaluation gain of \u00a38.5m in the prior year.\n\nSSE Business Energy: Adjusted operating loss of \u00a3(21.5)m has slightly improved compared with an adjusted operating loss of \u00a3(24.0)m last year. Both years have been impacted by significant volatility; the prior year result included approximately \u00a324m of losses on early settlement of excess commodity hedges linked to Covid, while the current year has borne non-recoverable BSUoS costs of around \u00a320m and \u00a314m of additional mutualisation costs due to a significantly higher number of supplier failures. These were partially offset by an improvement in bad debt recovery of \u00a314m as the economy emerged from the impact of coronavirus. The underlying business remains stable with a solid customer book.\n\nReported operating loss was also \u00a3(21.5)m, compared to \u00a3(3.9)m loss in the prior year which included a \u00a320.1m release of excess bad debt provisioning originally expected to arise from coronavirus impact.\n\nSSE Airtricity: Adjusted operating profit increased to \u00a360.4m compared to \u00a344.0m in the previous year, with the increased profit due to \u00a351m of higher generation receipts on wind assets which are contracted through Airtricity. This was partially offset by a \u00a325m adjustment in relation to historic use of system costs.\n\nThe business has grown customer numbers year on year but seen a drop in customer margins as energy prices increased; commodity costs increased significantly in the year and were managed through our approach to hedging and where necessary through tariff increases.\n\nReported operating profit was also \u00a360.4m, compared to \u00a350.0m profit in the prior year which included a \u00a36.0m release of excess bad debt provisioning originally expected to arise from coronavirus impact.\n\nEnergy Portfolio Management: Adjusted operating loss of \u00a3(16.8)m, compared to an adjusted operating profit of \u00a318.4m which included a net \u00a320.4m income from legacy Gas Production hedges. The operating loss is primarily due to a legacy power contract with Ovo which fully unwound during the year in a higher commodity price environment. EPM continues to expect to earn a small adjusted operating profit through service provision to those SSE businesses requiring access to energy markets.\n\nReported operating profit of \u00a32,083.6m reflects a material net remeasurement gain in the year on unsettled fair value forward commodity contracts, under IFRS 9. In line with reporting in previous years, this result excludes an adverse remeasurement of 'own use' contracts of approximately \u00a32.0bn which largely offsets the IFRS 9 gain.\n\nSSE Distributed Energy: An adjusted operating loss of \u00a3(10.9)m was reported, compared with an adjusted operating loss of \u00a3(27.0)m which included an impact from coronavirus. This reporting segment includes the result from the Contracting and Rail business, which remains reported within this segment up to the point of disposal on 30 June 2021. The segment no longer includes Out of Area Networks, which is now reported within the Distribution segment, and Neos Networks JV, which has been separately presented below.\n\nReported operating loss of \u00a3(29.2)m reflects the above factors together with an exceptional loss on disposal of \u00a318.3m upon completion of the sale of Contracting and Rail.\n\nNeos Networks JV: SSE's remaining 50% share in the Telecoms business Neos Networks recorded an adjusted operating loss of \u00a3(16.1)m compared with \u00a3(2.8)m in FY21. The reported loss of \u00a3(140.0)m includes both an impairment of \u00a3(106.9)m and an adjustment to original transaction consideration.\n\nCorporate unallocated: Adjusted operating loss of \u00a3(95.7)m compared with \u00a3(58.4)m, reflecting a natural reduction in external revenues as enduring service agreements with recently divested businesses roll-off, together with higher central costs including increased Group IT costs as the Group accelerates its investment in digitalisation.\n\nReported operating loss of \u00a3(113.5)m reflects the above factors together with a \u00a3(13.1)m revaluation adjustment to the legacy Gas Production decommissioning provision, part of Corporate unallocated following the business disposal in the year, and other minor tax and interest movements.\n\n## Adjusted earnings per share\n\nTo monitor its financial performance over the medium term, SSE reports on its adjusted earnings per share measure. This measure is calculated by excluding the charge for deferred tax, interest costs on net pension liabilities, exceptional items, valuation movements on the retained Gas Production decommissioning liabilities, depreciation on fair value adjustments and the impact of certain remeasurements.\n\nSSE's adjusted EPS measure provides an important and meaningful measure of underlying financial performance. In adjusting for the items mentioned, adjusted EPS reflects SSE's internal performance management, avoids the volatility associated with mark-to-market IFRS 9 remeasurements and means that items deemed to be exceptional due to their nature and scale do not distort the presentation of SSE's underlying results. For more detail on these and other adjusted items please refer to the Adjusted Performance Measures section of this statement.\n\nIn the year to 31 March 2022, SSE's adjusted earnings per share on continuing operations was 95.4p. This compares to 78.4p for the year to 31 March 2021 (restated for SGN disposal - 87.5p previously reported) and reflects the movements in adjusted operating profit outlined in the section above.\n\n## Group financial outlook 2022/23 and beyond\n\n## Key points for 2022/23\n\nThe group has enjoyed a strong start to delivery of the targets it set out in its Net Zero Acceleration Programme with thermal and hydro plant performing particularly well in the second half of 2021/22.\n\nSSE's focus continues to be on long-term, sustainable financial performance. Through high levels of investment expected in Transmission, a step up in profits expected in Thermal generation and an expected return to normal weather for Renewables, SSE is confident about delivery of strong earnings growth for this financial year, specifically:",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 For SSEN Transmission: SSE expects to report strong growth in adjusted EBIT with a 20% increase in allowed revenues under the RIIO-T2 price control, as the network continues to expand its operational capability and asset base;\n- \u00b7 For SSE Renewables: assuming normal weather and plant availability, SSE expects to report generation output of 11.4TWh, including 0.9TWh from Seagreen; and\n- \u00b7 For SSE Thermal and Gas Storage: assuming normal plant availability and excluding the benefit of Keadby 2, SSE expects to report adjusted EBIT for 2022/23 of at least \u00a3337m, the same level as 2021/22.\n\nTaking the above into account SSE currently expects to report full year adjusted earnings per share of at least 120p.\n\nThe Group remains committed to its five-year dividend plan to March 2026 and is recommending a 2022/23 full-year dividend of 85.7 pence in line with that plan.\n\nCapital expenditure and investment is expected to total in excess of \u00a32.5bn in 2022/23 (including acquisitions but net of project finance development expenditure refunds) assuming the recent Southern European acquisition successfully completes as planned. This is consistent with maintaining SSE's target net debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.5 times or below.\n\n## Update to net zero acceleration programme\n\nIn November 2021 SSE set out that it expected to deliver adjusted EPS CAGR on the 87.5 pence reported for the year ended March 2021 (before restatement) of between 5-7% in the period to 31 March 2026. This was underpinned by index-linked revenue streams driving 60% of EBITDA and was after a modelling assumption of a 25% minority interest disposal of Transmission and Distribution during FY24.\n\nSSE now expects to deliver an adjusted EPS CAGR of between 7-10%* over the same period as a result of: confidence derived from strong delivery in 2021/22; higher RPI forecasts; higher and more volatile energy commodity prices; and evidence of increased value creation potential from flexibility provided by SSE's Thermal and Hydro generation, and gas storage assets.\n\n## Supplemental financial information\n\n## Adjusted investment and capex summary\n\n|                                                               | March   2022   Share %   | March   2022   \u00a3m   | March   2021   \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| SSEN Transmission                                             | 30                       | 614.4               | 435.2               |\n| SSEN Distribution                                             | 18                       | 364.8               | 350.8               |\n| Regulated networks total                                      | 48                       | 979.2               | 786.0               |\n| SSE Renewables                                                | 39                       | 811.0               | 294.3               |\n| SSE Thermal                                                   | 6                        | 129.3               | 106.5               |\n| Gas Storage                                                   | -                        | 2.1                 | 1.9                 |\n| Thermal Total                                                 | 6                        | 131.4               | 108.4               |\n| Energy Customer Solutions                                     | 2                        | 39.8                | 31.2                |\n| Energy Portfolio Management                                   | -                        | 2.4                 | 2.1                 |\n| Gas Production*                                               | -                        | -                   | 26.8                |\n| Distributed Energy                                            | 1                        | 26.6                | 17.6                |\n| Corporate unallocated                                         | 4                        | 78.7                | 74.2                |\n| Adjusted investment and capital expenditure,   before refunds | 100                      | 2,069.1             | 1,340.6             |\n| Project finance development expenditure refunds               |                          | (136.7)             | (428.6)             |\n| Adjusted investment and capital expenditure                   |                          | 1,932.4             | 912.0               |\n| Acquisitions                                                  |                          | 141.3               | -                   |\n| Adjusted investment, capital and                              |                          | 2,073.7             | 912.0               |\n| acquisitions expenditure                                      |                          |                     |                     |\n\n## Disposal of minority stake in networks\n\nSSE continues to regard partnering as vital for the future and an important means of unlocking future opportunities in its businesses.\n\nIn line with the modelling assumption in its Net Zero Acceleration Programme, announced in November 2021, the Group has recently initiated a sales process with banking advisers for a 25% share of the SSEN Transmission business which is expected to formally commence in Summer 2022. Given the SSEN Distribution business is currently progressing its ED2 price control negotiations, a decision on the timing of a similar stake sale will be made later in the financial year.\n\nWhile these are high-quality, core businesses and SSE will retain control, the scale of potential growth and the associated investment required mean that bringing in non-controlling partners will create greater long-term value by enabling SSE to harness this significant growth whilst maintaining an attractive balance of capital allocation across the Group.\n\n## Progress in SSE's capital expenditure programme\n\nDuring the year to March 2022, SSE's adjusted investment, capital and acquisition expenditure, which now includes equity expenditure on acquisitions per above, totalled \u00a32,073.7m, an increase of 127% compared with the prior year and representing the highest ever investment recorded by the Group. Almost \u00a32bn of this was invested within SSE's Renewables, Thermal and Networks businesses, all which are fundamental to delivery of the\n\nUK's net zero ambitions. In summary:\n\n- \u00b7 Excellent progress was made in SSEN Transmission's investment programme, with a total of \u00a3614.4m invested in building out and reinforcing the network in the North of Scotland. Work was completed on Tealing Substation Extension, required to facilitate the connection of Seagreen to the grid. In addition, construction is well under way on the link between Shetland and mainland Scotland, which will see a submarine cable laid in order to transmit power beneath the seabed between converter stations at Weisdale Voe on Shetland and Noss Head in Caithness.",

        "page_content": "## Financial review continued\n\n- \u00b7 SSEN Distribution continued its capital investment programme across both the north and south networks, with a total spend of \u00a3364.8m, mainly on strategic investment and construction in both the north and south regions, as well as progressing the replacement of the submarine cable between Skye and Harris. All of which is designed to deliver improvements for customers.\n- \u00b7 Significant further capex was deployed on SSE Renewables' flagship projects, including nearly \u00a3500m investment on Seagreen, Scotland's largest offshore wind farm, and around \u00a3100m on Viking onshore wind farm, which will be one of Europe's most productive onshore wind farms, once complete. In addition, progress was made at the 30MW Lenalea onshore wind farm in County Donegal and the 38MW Gordonbush Extension onshore wind farm in Sutherland was commissioned during the year.\n- \u00b7 Investment in SSE Thermal was focused on the final stages of the 893MW Keadby 2 CCGT, with commissioning started in October 2021 and full commercial operation expected 1 October 2022.\n\nIn April 2022, an incident occurred on a sub-contractor S7000 installation vessel which is contracted to the Seagreen offshore wind farm construction project. The project team are working closely with contractors to manage and mitigate project impacts and the project is currently expected to achieve first power in July 2022 and full commercial operation in April 2023.\n\n## SSE'S hedging position at 18 May 2022\n\nSSE has an established approach to hedging through which it generally seeks to reduce its broad exposure to commodity price variation at least 12 months in advance of delivery. As market conditions change, SSE may decide to alter its hedging approach in response to any changes in its exposure profile. SSE will continue to provide a summary of its current hedging approach, including details of any changes in the period, within its Interim and Full-year Results statements.\n\nA summary of the hedging position for each of SSE's market-based businesses is set out above.\n\nVolumes are based on average expected output, and the contracted hedge price is either at 31 March or 18 May as noted in the table above.\n\n## SSE Renewables - GB wind and hydro\n\nForward power prices and volatility have been increasing, driven by supply-demand tensions, the acceleration in carbon pricing, nuclear outages and closures and the reconfiguration of the merit order in both GB and Ireland. These trends have been amplified by scarcity concerns across Europe. In response to this, SSE Renewables has increased its hedge position against its target volume for financial years 2023/24 and 2024/25.\n\nIn order to show this hedge acceleration, the table below has been updated to show the position at 18 May 2022 for those periods.\n\n|       |                       | As at 31 March 2022   | As at 31 March 2022   | As at 18 May 2022   | As at 18 May 2022   | As at 18 May 2022   |\n|-------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|       |                       | 2021/22               | 2022/23               | 2023/24             | 2024/25             | 2025/26             |\n| Wind  | Expected volume - TWh | 4.2                   | 5.3                   | 6.8                 | 8.4                 | 8.7                 |\n|       | Volume hedged - %     | 85%                   | 91%                   | 78%                 | 37%                 | 1%                  |\n|       | Hedge price - \u00a3MWh    | \u00a348                   | \u00a354                   | \u00a369                 | \u00a3105                | \u00a3108                |\n| Hydro | Expected volume - TWh | 3.6                   | 3.5                   | 3.7                 | 3.8                 | 3.8                 |\n|       | Volume hedged - %     | 83%                   | 85%                   | 70%                 | 38%                 | 1%                  |\n|       | Hedge price - \u00a3/MWh   | \u00a350                   | \u00a363                   | \u00a374                 | \u00a3110                | \u00a3108                |\n\nThe expected volumes include anticipated volumes from SSE's wind farms in construction, Seagreen (pre CFD) and Viking. No volumes have been included for Dogger Bank wind farm. Seagreen accounts for approximately 0.9TWh in 22/23 and 2.5TWh in each of 23/24, 24/25 and 25/26 with Viking accounting for 1.6TWh in 24/25 and 1.9TWh in 25/26. These volumes represent SSE's most up to date view of the output from Seagreen taking account of recent issues encountered by the S7000 installation vessel. In the event that further construction delays result in a shortfall against wind hedged volumes, it is expected that the exposure will continue to be managed within the wider SSE generation portfolio.\n\nThe table excludes additional volumes and income for BM activity, ROCs, ancillary services, pre-commissioning, capacity mechanism and shape variations. It also excludes volumes and income relating to Irish wind output, pumped storage and CfDs.\n\nEnergy output hedges for both wind and hydro are progressively established over the 36 months prior to delivery (although the extent of hedging activity for future periods depends on the level of available market depth and liquidity). Target hedge levels continue to be achieved through the forward sale of either electricity, or gas and carbon equivalents (assuming a constant 1MWh : 69.444 th and 1MWh : 0.3815 te/MWh conversion ratio between commodities), with the balance determined by the optimal hedge price across those markets. This approach aims to reduce the exposure of renewables assets to volatile spot power market outcomes whilst still providing an underlying commodity price hedge.\n\nFor wind energy output, SSE's established approach to hedging seeks to account for the effect of the 'wind capture price' by targeting a hedge of less than 100% of its anticipated wind energy output for the coming 12 months. The targeted hedge percentage is reviewed and adjusted as necessary to reflect any changes in future market and wind capture insights. The last such revision occurred in May 2021, with at least 90% of the anticipated energy output from wind for the coming twelve months being hedged from that date.\n\nThe approach to hedging hydro energy output remains unchanged at approximately 85% of its forecast energy output for the coming 12 months.\n\nUK Business Energy: The business supplies electricity and gas to business and public sector customers. Sales to contract customers are 100% hedged: at point of sale for fixed contract customers; upon instruction for flexi contract customers; and on a rolling hedge basis for tariff customers.\n\nGiven the pricing and macro-economic context Business Energy is dynamically monitoring nearer term consumption actuals for any early signs of demand variability, and adjusting future volumes hedged accordingly.\n\nGB Thermal: In the six months prior to delivery, SSE aims to hedge all of the expected output of its CCGT assets, having progressively established this hedge over the preceding eighteen months. Hedging activity depends on the availability of sufficient market depth and liquidity, which can be limited, particularly for periods further into the future.",

As such the assets are being commercially operated to optimise value arising from changes in the spread between summer and winter prices, market volatility and plant availability.\n\n## Energy Portfolio Management (EPM): EPM\n\nprovides the route to market and manages the execution for all of SSE's commodity trading outlined above (spark spread, power, gas, oil and carbon). This includes monitoring market conditions and liquidity and reporting net Group exposures. The business operates under strict position limits and VAR controls. There is some scope for small position-taking to permit EPM to manage around shape and liquidity whilst taking small optimisation opportunities. This is contained within a VAR limit of \u00a32m (\u00a31m for the curve period and \u00a31m for the prompt).\n\nIreland: Vertical integration of the generation and customer businesses in Ireland limits the Group's commodity exposure in that market.\n\nIn addition to the above exceptional items from continuing operations, a net exceptional gain within discontinued operations of \u00a3455.7m before tax was recognised. This net exceptional profit consisted of:\n\n- \u00b7 a \u00a3576.5m gain recognised on completion of the disposal of the Group's 33.3% investment in SGN on 22 March 2022; offset by\n- \u00b7 a \u00a3120.8m loss relating to the disposal of the Gas Production assets and liabilities on 14 October 2021.\n\nFor a full description of exceptional items, see note 7 of the Financial Statements.\n\n## Operating derivatives\n\nSSE enters into forward purchase contracts (for power, gas and other commodities) to meet the future demands of its energy supply businesses and to optimise the value of its generation assets. Some of these contracts are determined to be derivative financial instruments under IFRS 9 and as such are required to be recorded at their fair value as at the date of the financial statements.\n\n## Summarising movements on exceptional items And certain remeasurements\n\n## Exceptional items\n\nIn the year to 31 March 2022, SSE recognised a net exceptional gain within continuing operations of \u00a3305.0m before tax.

The following table provides a summary of the key components making up the net gain position:\n\n| Certain remeasurements within continuing operations   | Total   \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Operating derivatives                                 | 2,100.4      |\n| Commodity stocks held at fair value                   | (2.6)        |\n| Financing derivatives                                 | 21.0         |\n| Total                                                 | 2,118.8      |\n\nSSE shows the change in the fair value of these forward contracts separately as this mark-to-market movement does not reflect the realised operating performance of the businesses. The underlying value of these contracts is recognised as the relevant commodity is delivered, which for the large majority of the position at 31 March 2022 is expected to be within the next 12-18 months.\n\nThe change in the operating derivative mark-to-market valuation was a \u00a32,100.4m increase from a small 'in-the-money' position at 31 March 2021 into a significantly 'in-the-money' position at 31 March 2022. This movement consisted of:\n\n- \u00b7 Settlement during the year of \u00a3(1,426.8)m of previously 'in-the-money' contracts in line with the contracted delivery periods; and\n- \u00b7 Mark-to-market gains of \u00a33,527.2m on unsettled contracts entered into during the course of 2020/21 and 2021/22 in line with the Group's stated approach to hedging. These mark-to-market gains reflect the significant volatility in commodity markets during the period.\n\nAs in prior years, the reported result does not include remeasurement of 'own use' adverse hedging agreements which would have settled at a mark-to-market loss in the year of c.\u00a31.95bn and which would be valued at c.\u00a3(2.1)bn at 31 March 2022; these contracts are excluded from recognition under IFRS 9 and largely offset the IFRS 9 remeasurement noted above.\n\n## Commodity stocks held at fair value\n\nGas inventory purchased by the Gas Storage business for secondary trading opportunities is held at fair value with reference to the forward month market price. The \u00a3(2.6)m negative movement in the year mainly resulted from a decrease in the underlying volumes of gas held at year end, as gas was sold in the second half of the financial year realising the significant increase in the fair value of that gas during the year.",

These hedges ensure that any movement in the value of net debt is predominately offset by a movement in the derivative position. The adjustment was primarily driven by weaker Sterling against the Dollar partially offset by stronger Sterling against the Euro.\n\nThese remeasurements are presented separately as they do not represent underlying business performance in the period. The result on financing derivatives will be recognised in adjusted profit before tax when the derivatives are settled.\n\n## Reported profit before tax and earnings per share\n\nTaking all of the above into account, reported results for the year to 31 March 2022 are significantly higher than the previous year.

        "page_content": "## Maintaining a strong balance sheet\n\nWhile there may be short-term fluctuations, a key objective of SSE's approach to managing cash outflow and securing value and proceeds from disposals is its target of a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 4.5x or lower across the five years to 31 March 2026.\n\nAs well as promoting the long-term success of the Company, this approach is also designed to ensure that SSE maintains credit rating ratios (Retained Cash Flow (RCF)/Net Debt and Funds From Operations (FFO)/Net Debt) that are comparable with private sector utilities across Europe and comfortably above those required for an investment grade credit rating.\n\nSSE's S&P credit rating remains at BBB+ 'stable outlook' and its Moody's rating also remains at Baa1, but updated to 'stable outlook' following the strategic review update in November 2021.\n\n## Adjusted net debt and hybrid capital\n\nSSE's adjusted net debt and hybrid capital was \u00a38.6bn at 31 March 2022, down from \u00a38.9bn at 31 March 2021. This movement reflects the completion of the non-core asset disposal programme announced in 2020, which included completion of the sale of the 33.3% investment in SGN in March 2022, partially offset by the ongoing investment programme, including the acquisition of an 80% stake in a Japanese\n\ndevelopment platform from Pacifico Energy in September 2021, as well as various working capital movements.\n\nFollowing the significant debt issued in the 20/21 financial year, where the SSE Group accessed the debt and hybrid capital markets three times issuing c.\u00a32.5bn of debt over six tranches, no new mediumlong-term debt was issued in the 2021/22 financial year. The SSE Group did however re-enter the short-term Commercial Paper market during the year and at 31 March 2022 had \u00a3507m of Commercial Paper outstanding.\n\n## Debt summary as at 31 March 2022\n\nAs stated above no new medium- longterm debt was issued and received in 2021/22 however the following two debt issues were committed to or completed either side of the financial year end:\n\n- \u00b7 In March 2022, the SSE Group through its SSEN Transmission entity priced and committed to a \u00a3350m dual tranche private placement, being a \u00a3175m 10-year tranche at 3.13% and \u00a3175m 15-year tranche at 3.24% giving an all-in average rate of 3.19%. The pricing was committed to in March 2022 and the proceeds will be received on 30 June 2022.\n- \u00b7 In April 2022, SSE plc issued a \u20ac1bn NC6 equity accounted hybrid bond at 4% to refinance the dual tranche debt accounted hybrid bonds issued in March 2017. SSE has taken advantage of the\n\n3-month par call option on these 2017 hybrid bonds, meaning they will now be repaid on 16 June 2022 in advance of the first call date. The \u20ac1bn equity accounted hybrid bond has been kept in Euros and the proceeds will be used to cover the portion of the maturing hybrid that was swapped to Euros (\u20ac575m) and to finance a portion of the Southern European onshore wind development platform acquisition cost which is expected to complete by September 2022.\n\nIn addition to the hybrid bonds called in June 2022 a further \u00a3613m of mediumlong-term debt matures in 2021/22 being \u00a3163m (USPP) which matured in April 2022, \u00a3300m (Eurobond) maturing in September 2022 and \u00a3150m (EIB) maturing in October 2022. A further \u00a3507m of short-term debt in the form of Commercial Paper is also due to mature in the first half of 2021/22, however the current intention is to roll this maturing short-term debt forward where possible.\n\n## Hybrid bonds summary as at 31 March 2022\n\nHybrid bonds are a valuable part of SSE's capital structure, helping to diversify SSE's investor base and most importantly to support credit rating ratios, with their 50% equity treatment by the rating agencies being positive for SSE's credit metrics.\n\nA summary of SSE's hybrid bonds as at 31 March 2022 can be found below:\n\n| Issued     | Hybrid Bond Value*   | All in rate   | First Call Date   | Accounting Treatment   |\n|------------|----------------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------------|\n| March 2017 | \u00a3300m                | 3.73%         | September 2022    | Debt accounted         |\n| March 2017 | $900m (\u00a3749m)        | 2.72%         | September 2022    | Debt accounted         |\n| July 2020  | \u00a3600m                | 3.74%         | Apr 2026          | Equity accounted       |\n| July 2020  | \u20ac500m (\u00a3454m)        | 3.68%         | July 2027         | Equity accounted       |\n\nIn accordance with the first call date, the \u20ac600m (\u00a3440m) March 2015 Hybrid Bond was called and redeemed in April 2021 and therefore not included in the table above. The March 2017 hybrids have a 3-month par call option that SSE has invoked meaning these two hybrids will now be called and settled on 16 June 2022.\n\nFurther details on each hybrid bond can be found in Notes 21 and 22 to the Financial Statements and a table noting the amounts, timing and accounting treatment of coupon payments is shown below:\n\n## Hybrid coupon payments\n\n|                                | 2022/23   | 2022/23   | 2021/22   | 2021/22   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n|                                | HYe       | FYe       | HYa       | FYa       |\n| Total equity (cash) accounted  | \u00a339m      | \u00a339m      | \u00a351m      | \u00a351m      |\n| Total debt (accrual) accounted | \u00a321m      | \u00a321m      | \u00a315m      | \u00a331m      |\n| Total hybrid coupon            | \u00a360m      | \u00a360m      | \u00a366m      | \u00a382m      |",

        "page_content": "## Financial review continued\n\nSSE's March 2015 and July 2020 hybrid bonds are perpetual instruments and are therefore accounted for as part of equity within the Financial Statements but, as in previous years, have been included within SSE's 'Adjusted net debt and hybrid capital' to aid comparability. The March 2017 hybrid bonds which have been called and will be settled in 2022/23 had a fixed redemption date and have therefore been debt accounted and included within Loans and Other Borrowings; as such they were already part of SSE's adjusted net debt and hybrid capital.\n\nThe coupon payments relating to the equity accounted hybrid bonds are presented as distributions to other equity holders and are reflected within adjusted earnings per share when paid. The coupon payments on the debt accounted hybrid bonds are treated as finance costs under IFRS 9.\n\n## Managing net finance costs\n\nSSE's adjusted net finance costs - including interest on debt accounted hybrid bonds but not equity accounted hybrid bonds -\n\nwere \u00a3372.8m in the year to 31 March 2022, compared to \u00a3384.6m in the previous year after restatement for SGN related finance costs. The relatively stable level of finance costs from year to year, despite periods of high inflation, reflects the high proportion of fixed rate debt held by the Group.\n\nReported net finance costs were \u00a3273.2m compared to \u00a3236.9m, after restatement for SGN related finance costs, reflecting a \u00a334.6m year-on-year change in the mark-to-market revaluation of financing derivatives held at fair value.\n\n## Summarising cash and cash equivalents\n\nAt 31 March 2022, SSE's adjusted net debt included cash and cash equivalents of \u00a31.0bn, down from \u00a31.6bn at March 2021 which reflects the continued strong cash generation from operating activities, offset by a significant increase in capital investment, a reduction in year-on-year disposal proceeds as the June 2020 non-core asset disposal programme came to an end and a net repayment of\n\nborrowings. This continued strong cash position will allow SSE to meet its nearterm debt repayment and capital investment needs as set out above.\n\nAs the fair value of forward commodity contracts has moved from an 'in the money' position in the prior year to an 'out the money' position in the current year, the related collateral required has similarly unwound. At 31 March 2022, \u00a374.7m of cash was provided as collateral to third parties compared to \u00a337.1m held as collateral from third parties on these 'in the money' contracts in the prior year.\n\n## Revolving credit facility/ short term funding\n\nSSE has \u00a31.5bn of committed bank facilities in place to ensure the Group has sufficient liquidity to allow day-to -day operations and investment programmes to continue in the event of disruption to Capital Markets preventing SSE from issuing new debt for a period of time. These facilities are set out in the table below.\n\n| Date   | Issuer   | Debt type                                                       |   Term | Value   |\n|--------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| Mar 19 | SSE plc  | Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility with 10 Relationship Banks |   2026 | \u00a31.3bn  |\n| Oct 19 | SSE plc  | Revolving Credit Facility with Bank of China                    |   2026 | \u00a3200m   |\n\nThe facilities can also be utilised to cover short-term funding requirements; however, they remain undrawn for most of the time and at 31 March 2022 they were both undrawn.\n\nBoth facilities are classified as sustainable facilities with interest rate and fees paid dependant on SSE's performance in environmental, social and governance matters, as assessed independently by Vigeo Eiris.\n\nIn addition to these committed bank facilities, the Group has access to \u00a3100m of uncommitted bank lines and a \u00a315m overdraft facility.\n\n## Maintaining a prudent treasury policy\n\nSSE's treasury policy is designed to be prudent and flexible. In line with that, cash from operations is first used to finance regulatory and maintenance capital expenditure and then dividend payments, with investment and capital expenditure for growth generally financed by a combination of cash from operations, bank borrowings and bond issuance. In 2021/22 growth was also financed by disposal proceeds.\n\nAs a matter of policy, a minimum of 50% of SSE's debt is subject to fixed rates of interest. Within this policy framework, SSE borrows as required on different interest bases, with financial instruments being used to achieve the desired out-turn interest rate profile. At 31 March 2022, 96% of SSE's borrowings were at fixed rates.\n\nBorrowings are mainly in Sterling and Euros to reflect the underlying currency denomination of assets and cash flows within SSE. All other foreign currency borrowings are swapped back into either Sterling or Euros.\n\nTransactional foreign exchange risk arises in respect of procurement contracts, fuel and carbon purchasing, commodity hedging and energy portfolio management operations, and long-term service agreements for plant.\n\nSSE's policy is to hedge any material transactional foreign exchange risks through the use of forward currency purchases and/or financial instruments. Translational foreign exchange risk arises in respect of overseas investments; hedging in respect of such exposures is determined as appropriate to the circumstances on a case-by-case basis.\n\n## Ensuring a strong debt structure through medium- and long-term borrowings\n\nThe ability to raise funds at competitive rates is fundamental to investment. SSE's fundraising over the past five years, including senior bonds, hybrid capital and term loans, now totals \u00a37.7bn and SSE's objective is to maintain a reasonable range of debt maturities. Its average debt maturity, excluding hybrid securities, at 31 March 2022 was 6.8 years, down from 7.4 years at 31 March 2021. This movement reflects the \u00a32.1bn of debt maturing in the next 12 months and is forecast to return to 7.5 years during 2022/23. SSE's average cost of debt is now 3.81%, compared to 3.75% at 31 March 2021.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Directors regularly review the Group's funding structure and have assessed that the Financial Statements should be prepared on a going concern basis.\n\nIn making their assessment the Directors have considered sensitivities on the forecast future cashflows of the Group for the period to 31 December 2023 resulting from the current volatile market conditions; the Group's credit rating; the success of the Group's disposal programme through",

The Directors have also considered the Group's obligations under its debt covenants, with projections to 31 December 2023 supporting the expectation that there will be no breaches.\n\nThe Directors have also assessed that the Group remains able to access Capital Markets, as demonstrated by the \u00a33.7bn of debt issued over the last 24 months. There is also an expectation of continued availability of the Commercial Paper market along with future available liquidity in the\n\nprivate placement market in addition to the Group's existing liquidity with \u00a31.5bn of undrawn committed borrowing facilities.\n\n## SSE's principal joint ventures and associates\n\nSSE's financial results include contributions from equity interests in joint ventures ('JVs') and associates, all of which are equity accounted. The details of the most significant of these are included in the table below.

SSE seeks to pay the right amount of tax on its profits, in the right place, at the right time, and was the first FTSE 100 company to be awarded the Fair Tax Mark. While SSE has an obligation to its shareholders, customers and other stakeholders to efficiently manage its total tax liability, it does not seek to use the tax system in a way it does not consider it was meant to operate, or use tax havens to reduce its tax liabilities.\n\nUnder its social contract SSE has an obligation to the society in which it operates, and from which it benefits - for example, tax receipts are vital for the public\n\nservices SSE relies upon. Therefore, SSE's tax policy is to operate within both the letter and spirit of the law at all times.\n\nIn December 2021, SSE published 'Talking Tax 2021: Tax as a driver for change' report. It did this because it believes building trust with stakeholders on issues relating to tax is important to the long-term sustainability of the business.\n\nIn the year to 31 March 2022, SSE paid \u00a3335.3m of taxes on profits, property taxes, environmental taxes, and employment taxes in the UK, compared with \u00a3379.0m in the previous year. The reduction in total taxes paid in 2021/22 compared with the previous year was primarily due to:\n\n- \u00b7 The sale of SSE's Contracting business in June 2021. Only three months of profit taxes, property taxes and employment taxes are included in relation to that business in 2021/22 compared with a full year in 2020/21;\n- \u00b7 Lower Climate Change Levy being paid as a result of outages at SSE's gas-fired power stations.\n\nIn 2021/22 SSE also paid \u20ac46.4m of taxes in Ireland, compared to \u20ac20.4m the previous year, due to increased profits in SSE's Irish businesses. Ireland is the only country outside the UK in which it currently has significant trading operations. SSE's operations elsewhere are still at an early stage and are not yet paying material amounts of tax.\n\nAs with other key financial indicators, SSE's focus is on adjusted profit before tax and, in line with that, SSE believes that the adjusted current tax charge on that profit is the tax measure that best reflects underlying performance. SSE's adjusted current tax rate, based on adjusted profit before tax, was 9.2%, compared with 9.1% in 2020/21 on the same basis. Total deferred tax for the period increased to \u00a3797.4m from \u00a3145.4m and was principally driven by the tax effect on the significant mark-tomarket valuation movement on derivative contracts, in addition to a \u00a3244.7m adjustment relating to the tax rate change to 25% which was substantively enacted on 24 May 2021.",

Over the duration of the five-year RIIO-T2 price control, which began in April 2021, total expenditure by SSEN Transmission is expected to reach at least \u00a32.8bn (the Certain View) which would take Transmission RAV to in excess of \u00a35bn by the end of RIIO-T2.\n\nIn addition to the Certain View expenditure, under Ofgem's Uncertainty Mechanisms changes to the allowed revenue are permitted during the price control period to reflect additional investment requirements, when their need or expected timeframe are not known at the outset. These Uncertainty Mechanisms are used to fund further upgrades to the network during the price control period, when there is more certainty around the scope of work required. This investment plays a pivotal role in providing critical national infrastructure and to maintain network reliability for the communities SSEN Transmission serves as it delivers a network for net zero.\n\n## Operational delivery\n\nSSEN Transmission has made a strong start in delivering against its regulatory settlement during the first year of the new five-year RIIO-T2 price control period. Building on its strong track record of consistently delivering over 99.99% network reliability - and in line with its RIIO-T2 goal to aim for 100% transmission network reliability for homes and businesses - in 2021/22, SSEN Transmission achieved the full reward of \u00a30.7m through the Energy Not Supplied Incentive. This is the second consecutive year SSEN Transmission has achieved the full Energy Not Supplied Incentive available and the 2021/22 reward will be reflected in revenue in 2023/24.\n\nIn addition to exceptional operational performance in the year, SSEN Transmission continues to deliver against its strategic objective to enable the transition to a low-carbon economy as it builds a network for net zero in the North of Scotland. The RIIO-T2 period is expected to deliver significant growth in the capacity of renewables connected to SSEN Transmission's network, from under 7GW at the start of RIIO-T2 to around 14GW by March 2026. This includes growth of around 1GW in 2021/22, which brings the total installed capacity connected to the North of Scotland transmission network to around 9GW, of which just under 8GW is from renewable sources. SSEN Transmission is well on its way to delivering its RIIO-T2 goal to transport the renewable electricity that powers 10m homes, which will be met once the installed capacity of renewables reaches 10GW.\n\nThis forecast growth in renewables will be enabled by a series of strategic investments in new and upgraded infrastructure. Excellent progress continues to be made on the Shetland HVDC transmission link, which has now been in construction for over 18 months and will see Shetland connected to the GB transmission system for the first time, enabling the connection of renewables and supporting Shetland's future security of supply. The substation and convertor station sites at Kergord (Shetland) and switching station at Noss Head (Caithness) are taking shape, with all main building structures now complete. Cable installation preparatory works have also progressed well, with all land cable ducting now in place and the first phase of subsea boulder clearing successfully completed. Subsea cable installation works will follow from 2022/23, alongside the fit out of substation and convertor station buildings, with the project on track for completion and energisation in 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'The future for our business has never been brighter: National Grid's Network Options Assessment has set out the critical need for further network development and the British Energy Security Strategy calls for faster, more strategic network build-out to connect the renewables needed for net zero.'\n\nRob McDonald Managing Director, SSEN Transmission",

        "page_content": "The second phase of the Inveraray to Crossaig overhead line replacement project in Argyll, from Port Ann to Crossaig, is also progressing well, with the replacement line remaining on track for completion by summer 2023.\n\nExcellent progress continues on works to increase incrementally the capacity of the north east and east coast transmission network to 275kV then to 400kV, with new substations at New Deer and Rothienorman now energised at 275kV, to be subsequently upgraded to 400kV in 2023. The 400kV overhead line (OHL) upgrade works between Peterhead, Rothienorman and Blackhillock are also well under way and are due for completion in 2023, with the overall upgrade of the east coast network to 400kV remaining on track for completion in 2026.\n\nAt both Alyth and Kinardochy, construction of new substations, including specialist voltage control devices, have commenced with good progress also being made at Peterhead substation and an upgrade to Tealing substation.\n\nTo support SSEN Transmission's 1.5\u00b0C science-based targets for emissions reductions, including its RIIO-T2 goal to deliver a one third reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, the business remains at the forefront of industry efforts to remove harmful SF6 gases from its infrastructure, working with its supply chain to develop and deliver innovative alternatives. This includes the world's largest installation of GE's g3 gas-insulated substation at New Deer substation and the world's first g3 400kV substation at Kintore.\n\nFor financial performance commentary please refer to the Group Financial Review.\n\n## Growth opportunities in RIIO-T2\n\nDuring 2021/22, SSEN Transmission has made excellent progress progressing plans for a number of investments over and above its \u00a32.8bn Certain View. These additional investments, which are being taken forward through Ofgem's Uncertainty Mechanisms, will be key to delivering a pathway for net zero.\n\nIn March 2022, Ofgem provisionally approved the Final Needs Case (FNC) for the first of two planned HVDC links connecting Peterhead to demand centres in England. Work on the initial 2GW Peterhead to Drax link, with a combined investment of around \u00a32.1bn, will be progressed jointly by SSEN Transmission and National Grid Electricity Transmission (NGET). Development and early construction activity and expenditure will continue during RIIO-T2, with delivery and energisation in 2029 (RIIO-T3).\n\nAlso in March 2022, SSEN Transmission submitted its Initial Needs Case (INC) to Ofgem for the Argyll and Kintyre 275kV Strategy. At an estimated total investment of around \u00a3400m, this is required to upgrade the main Argyll transmission network from 132kV, supporting the forecast growth in renewables in the region.\n\nIn April 2022, Ofgem published its response to SSEN Transmission's INC for the replacement and upgrade of the Fort Augustus to Skye transmission line, recognising the clear need for the project, paving the way to progress to the FNC stage of the regulatory approvals process. At an estimated total investment of around \u00a3400m, the replacement line is required to maintain security of supply and to enable the connection of renewable electricity generation along its route.\n\nFurther expenditure to connect new renewable generation, rail electrification and system security is also expected throughout the RIIO-T2 period and beyond when the need for this investment becomes certain. These investments could see the total installed generation capacity increase to around 14GW by the end of RIIO-T2, with up to 13GW of this expected from renewable sources. Subject to regulatory approval, combined, these investments, alongside the Certain View, could bring the total expenditure across the RIIO-T2 period to over \u00a34bn, with SSEN Transmission RAV increasing to between \u00a36.5bn to \u00a37bn by the end of RIIO-T2.\n\n## Growth opportunities beyond RIIO-T2\n\nIn January 2022, Crown Estate Scotland published the outcome of the ScotWind leasing round, awarding leases with a potential capacity of around 25GW, vastly exceeding the anticipated 10GW of potential capacity expected to be leased. In April 2022, the UK Government published its British Energy Security Strategy (BESS), which included an increased offshore wind ambition from 40GW to 50GW by 2030 and a clear direction for Ofgem to support anticipatory investment in strategic network projects ahead of demand, which will be formalised in a Strategic Policy Statement from BEIS to Ofgem later this year. Enabling ScotWind's ambition and the UK Government's 50GW target will require significant transmission upgrades in both onshore and offshore transmission infrastructure.\n\nIn January 2022, National Grid Electricity Transmission (NGESO) published its 2022 Networks Options Assessment (NOA). This provided strong 'proceed' signals recommending several major reinforcements in the North of Scotland to meet forecast future energy scenarios, although these will still require Ofgem approval. The NOA recommended the following investments in SSEN Transmission's network region:\n\n- \u00b7 Two subsea high-voltage direct current (HVDC) links from Peterhead to England;\n- \u00b7 A second HVDC link from Spittal in Caithness, connecting to Peterhead; and\n- \u00b7 Strategic onshore reinforcements north of Inverness and between Inverness and Peterhead.\n\nIn addition to the opportunities outlined above, SSEN Transmission continues to work with stakeholders in Orkney and the Western Isles to develop and take forward proposals to enable mainland transmission connections. Changes to the structure of the forthcoming Contracts for Difference (CfD) auction, with offshore wind now in a separate pot to remote island wind, may increase the competitiveness of remote island wind which, in turn, could support the investment case for the proposed transmission links. The outcome of the next CfD auction is expected in the summer of 2022.",

SSEN Distribution's networks cover the greatest land mass of any of the UK's Distribution Network Operators over 75,000km\u00b2 of extremely diverse terrain.\n\nIn December 2021, SSEN Distribution published its RIIO-ED2 Final Business Plan for 2023 to 2028. Titled 'Powering Communities to Net Zero' it sets out the \u00a33.99bn of flexibility and network investment required to accelerate net zero in a way that is efficient and affordable.\n\n## Operational delivery\n\nSSEN Distribution continues to undertake a major capital investment programme across both its networks, delivering significant improvements for customers and increasing its Regulated Asset Value. In the 12 months to 31 March 2022, the business invested \u00a3364.8m, bringing the total invested since the beginning of the RIIO-ED1 price control to around \u00a32.3bn. This is part of a forecast \u00a32.7bn investment throughout the RIIO-ED1 period, supporting future earnings through RAV growth. This includes progressing \u00a341m of strategic investment approved through the Green Recovery programme in 2021.\n\n2021/22 investment has included a multi-million pound upgrade to an essential section of Hampshire's infrastructure in Fareham, completed in January 2022; and a substantial programme of works to boost power supplies to homes and businesses on the Isle of Wight comprising the complete refurbishment of two 132kV transformers along with the replacement of two 33kV circuit breakers. In the North of Scotland, work commenced on a \u00a39.5m project to boost the resilience and reliability of the network around Aultbea and Ullapool, and a \u00a37m investment programme to enhance security of supply across Tayside.\n\nIncentive performance remains a revenue driver and SSEN prioritises improving reliability of network performance and supporting a positive customer experience. Under the RIIO regulatory regime, and the Interruptions Incentive Scheme (IIS), SSEN Distribution is incentivised on its performance against the loss of electricity supply through the recording of Customer Interruptions (CI) and Customer Minutes Lost (CML) which includes both planned and unplanned supply interruptions. These incentives will typically be collected two years after they are earned.\n\nThe winter of 2021/22 saw six exceptional weather incidents which had a major impact on SSEN Distribution's network, causing in excess of 2,600 points of damage. In total, 10 Met Office Weather Warnings were in place last winter for both licence areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'We are progressing a stakeholder-led plan for RIIO-ED2 that balances investment in net zero with the need to keep costs down for customers. We look forward to the Ofgem's final determinations and hope very much that they match the decarbonisation ambitions set out in the British Energy Security Strategy.'\n\nChris Burchell Managing Director, SSEN Distribution",

        "page_content": "Whilst SSEN Overall Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) is broadly in line with last year at 87%, the incentive reward has been impacted due to the unprecedented storm season. The volume of calls presented during the winter period (October to February) was equivalent to a normal year's worth of calls, resulting in reduced customer satisfaction metrics. As a result, the overall incentive reward under the Broad Measure of Customer Satisfaction reduced in 2021/22 to \u00a32.7m from \u00a34.9m the previous year. It is expected that a best ever score from the Stakeholder Engagement and Customer Vulnerability (SECV) incentive will be achieved, which would result in an increased incentive revenue from \u00a31.6m to \u00a31.9m.\n\nFor financial performance commentary please refer to the Group Financial Review.\n\n## Growth opportunities in RIIO-ED2\n\nAs a provider of critical national infrastructure, SSEN Distribution is playing a vital role in accelerating the transition to net zero. The business is on track to deliver its key ED1 outputs and, in October 2021, became the first DNO to set a 1.5\u00b0C-aligned target accredited by the Science Based Target initiative.\n\nIn April 2022, the UK Government's British Energy Security Strategy recognised the importance of strategic network investment which is essential to meeting the expected demand growth in RIIO-ED2 and future price control periods. DNOs will unlock billions of pounds in investment in wider economic benefits for a net zero future.\n\nSSEN Distribution now awaits Ofgem's draft determination on its ambitious, stakeholderled business plan for the RIIO-ED2 period. This will be an acid test of the regulator's\n\nalignment with the British Energy Security Strategy and fundamentally its approach to delivering the necessary strategic investment for networks to be an enabler, rather than a blocker, of net zero. SSEN Distribution continues to engage proactively with Ofgem and government on achieving a fair ED2 outcome that protects current and future consumers, and delivers the outcomes customers want at a pace consistent with a rapid growth environment.\n\nThe proposals within SSEN Distribution's Final Business Plan for ED2 are a key part of SSE's Net Zero Acceleration Programme. The plan was co-created with stakeholders and this engagement will continue to ensure that their ambitions are reflected in the process. The Final Business Plan proposes a total base expenditure of \u00a33.99bn representing a 32% increase over an equivalent timeframe in RIIO-ED1, and reflecting additional requirements for customers over the five years to 2028. The proposed baseline spend provides a low-regret foundation enabling all scenarios and optionality, without which DNOs risk becoming a blocker to customer demands for EV and heat pump connections through ED2 and beyond and increasing costs for future generations.\n\nLate 2021 saw much-awaited publications and strategies related to heat decarbonisation. The UK Government confirmed its ambition to upscale the installation of heat pumps to at least 600,000 a year by 2028 and to make its Boiler Upgrade Scheme available for early adopters, while the Scottish Government has set a 2030 target for at least 1m homes to have switched to zero emissions heat. It is anticipated that there will be over 800,000 heat pumps across SSEN Distribution's networks by the end of RIIO-ED2. The Final Business Plan sets out the required investment to ready the network for net zero, consistent with this projection.\n\nThe Scottish Government's January 2022 publication, A Network Fit For The Future: Draft Vision for Scotland's Public Electric Vehicle Charging Network, confirmed its desire to enable new models of public electric vehicle chargepoint financing and delivery, focused on public and private partnerships, to support and coordinate investment. In March 2022, the UK Government's EV Infrastructure Strategy set out ambitions for EV chargepoints to be seamlessly integrated into a smart energy system with at least 300,000 public chargepoints installed by 2030. By this date, the 2021 DFES projects that SSEN Distribution's licence areas could support up to 10.8GW of electric vehicle charging capacity. SSEN Distribution has set out investment plans to help provide the increased capacity needed to enable these projections and to ready its network to facilitate 1.3m electric vehicles by 2028.",

Its operational offshore wind installed capacity is 487MW with its onshore wind and hydro electric installed capacity at 1,936MW and 1,459MW respectively.\n\n## Operational delivery\n\nSSE Renewables' hydro assets continue to play an important role in providing cost-effective, low-carbon flexibility to the system, which is providing additional diversified revenue streams. Hydro assets\n\nperformed very strongly across the year, with availability at an all-time high between December and March and providing much needed flexible peak capacity to the market. In addition, Foyers pumped hydro station was fully available through periods of very high demand.\n\nDespite natural wind resources being below normal yearly averages, a steady second half of the year - coupled with high plant performance to maximise production - led to a year-end position of onshore wind volumes at 88% of planned volume.\n\nOffshore, Beatrice saw excellent availability in the second half and Greater Gabbard saw improved turbine availability over the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'We are getting on with delivering the flagship wind projects that underpin the Net Zero Acceleration Programme and broadening our pipeline horizons with ventures in exciting new markets.

Offshore wind speeds returned to average after low wind speeds in the first half of the year, resulting in improved volumes.\n\nAs part of SSE Renewables' continued investment into its asset management capabilities, it has just been awarded certification in the ISO55001 standard for asset management for its operational organisation.\n\nFor financial performance commentary please refer to the Group Financial Review.\n\n## Construction programme\n\nAll three phases of the world's largest offshore wind farm at Dogger Bank (each 1,200MW, SSE share 40%) remain on track. Onshore works are continuing, and offshore construction is now under way with installation of the HVDC export cables for Dogger Bank A. Dogger Bank C reached financial close in December 2021, and in February 2022, SSE Renewables and Equinor each sold a 10% share in this third phase to Eni.\n\nOn Seagreen 1 (1,075MW, SSE share 49%) there are currently 21 jackets and turbines installed on what will be the world's deepest, fixed-bottom offshore wind farm once operational.

        "page_content": "commencing commissioning works. All onshore cabling works and export cable installation is progressing as planned. SSE currently expects first power in July with commercial operations by mid-April 2023. In April 2022, an incident occurred on a sub-contractor S7000 installation vessel which is contracted to the Seagreen project. The project team is working closely with contractors to manage and mitigate project impacts. Seagreen 1 is eligible to participate in the UK CfD Allocation Round 4 (AR4). Bids are due to be submitted by 15 June 2022 with the results of the auction expected by 8 July 2022.\n\nConstruction is progressing well on Viking (443MW) with almost all of the access tracks completed and 83 of 103 bases excavated. Work on the DC substation is continuing with the first two transformers due to be delivered by June 2022. Turbines will be installed in early 2023 and completion is planned for July 2024. Viking is expected to be amongst the highest-yielding onshore wind farms in Europe, producing almost 2TWh annually. It is also eligible to enter AR4.\n\nAt Lenalea wind farm (30MW, SSE share 50%) in Ireland, construction is progressing and is to be commissioned in late 2022/ early 2023.\n\nIn July 2021, Beatrice Offshore Wind Farm Limited, a joint venture owned 40% by SSE Renewables, agreed divestment of its Offshore Transmission Owner assets at an asset value of \u00a3437.9m and full asset transfer took place on 5 August 2021.\n\nGordonbush Extension (38MW), SSE's first merchant onshore wind project, was fully commissioned and handed over to operations following its official opening in August 2021.\n\nIn Hydro, investment in works to modify three key stations, Sloy, Glendoe and Errochty, has started and will increase the capability of these stations in providing essential services to the grid. And in April 2022, a \u00a350m investment to upgrade Tummel Bridge power station commenced which will increase the station's potential power output from 34MW to 40MW, with a return to service expected in Autumn 2023.\n\n## Growth opportunities - domestic\n\nSSE Renewables' core markets of the UK and Ireland still offer considerable opportunities for growth over the near, medium and long term.\n\nNear term, onshore wind growth can be delivered through SSE Renewables' consented sites at Strathy South (208MW) and Tangy repower (57MW) in Scotland. Yellow River (104MW) in Ireland was provisionally successful in the May 2022 RESS-2 auction in Ireland and will now progress towards a final investment decision. Consent applications have been submitted to the Scottish Government for Bhlaraidh Extension (in excess of 100MW), and Achany Extension (in excess of 80MW).\n\nOffshore, near-term growth is expected to come from the consented Seagreen 1A (500MW, SSE Renewables share 49%), which is an extension to the Seagreen 1 offshore wind site. Seagreen 1A is eligible to participate in AR4. Should a Financial Investment Decision (FID) be reached, it could be operational by 2025/26.\n\nIn the medium term, out to the end of the decade, there is a wealth of opportunities. In addition to the UK's increased offshore target of 50GW by 2030, from 40GW noted above, the British Energy Security Strategy set out a raft of measures which will see permitting of offshore wind projects accelerated. SSE Renewables' unrivalled offshore wind pipeline will play a key role in meeting this new target.\n\nSSE Renewables is working towards a consent application submission in Q3 2022 for the up to 4.1GW Berwick Bank wind farm with the aim of securing consent in 2024 and being operational around the end of the decade.\n\nNorth Falls wind farm (up to 504MW, SSE Renewables share 50%), which is an extension to the Greater Gabbard wind farm off the east coast of England, continues to progress with local consultation under way for a potential grid connection in North Essex. North Falls could also be operational by 2030.\n\nSSE Renewables has added its first floating offshore wind project to its domestic pipeline with the success in Crown Estate Scotland's ScotWind offshore wind seabed\n\nleasing process as part of a consortium with Marubeni Corporation and CIP (Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners). The up to 2.6GW site (SSE Renewables share 40%) in the E1 Zone in the Firth of Forth will be one of the largest floating wind projects in the world and aims to start generating by 2030. This will play an important part in meeting the UK Government's increased floating wind target of 5GW by 2035.\n\nSSE Renewables also aims to contribute additional capacity needed to meet Ireland's offshore wind target of 5GW by 2030. Following the introduction by the Irish Government of the Maritime Area Planning (MAP) Act in December 2021, SSE Renewables will now progress Arklow Bank Wind Park 2 via this new consenting regime. The revised project will proceed with an increased capacity of 800MW. Subject to securing the necessary consents and if successful in the first Offshore Renewable Energy Support Scheme (ORESS) auction, expected at the end of 2022, Arklow Bank Wind Park 2 could be operational by 2028.\n\nA foreshore licence has been secured for site investigations for the 1,000MW Braymore Wind Park project off the north-east coast and an application has been submitted for the 1,200MW Celtic Sea Array off the south-east coast. Celtic Sea Array and Braymore Wind Park will both apply for a Marine Area Consent (akin to a seabed lease) in the Irish Government's next phase, expected in 2023.\n\nOnshore, there continues to be positive progress on SSE Renewables' consented Coire Glas pumped hydro storage project (up to 1,500MW). Coire Glas would double the current amount of electricity storage capacity in Great Britain and create energy storage capacity of 30GWh, equivalent to powering around 3m homes for up to 24 hours. The British Energy Security Strategy identified the importance of long duration storage, and a policy decision in response to the BEIS call for evidence on possible policy interventions, such as cap and floor mechanism to support long duration storage, is expected imminently. Subject to the outcome of these policy decisions, Coire Glas could progress to an FID decision by 2023/24 with the objective of being completed before the end of the decade.",

As part of this, SSE Renewables has kickstarted its first electrolysis projects. Currently in the early stages of development, the Gordonbush H2 project will use a portion of the renewable energy from the 100MW-plus Gordonbush onshore wind farm to produce up to 2,000 tonnes of green hydrogen each year, contributing to the new UK 5GW electrolytic hydrogen target. SSE Renewables is also part of Galway Hydrogen Hub (GH2), a consortium proposing to develop an initial flagship demonstrator project at Galway Harbour, for the indigenous production and supply of green hydrogen fuel for public and private vehicles.\n\n## Growth opportunities international\n\nSSE Renewables made important progress in its international expansion plans in April 2022 when it entered into an agreement with Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy for the acquisition of an onshore wind development platform totalling c.3.9GW across Spain, France, Italy and Greece for a consideration of \u20ac580m. The portfolio co-located solar development\n\nincludes scope for up to 1GW of additional opportunities. The move marks SSE\n\nRenewables' entry into Southern Europe and creates a wider opportunity to pursue a balanced range of technologies, eg wind, solar, hydrogen, and storage. As part of the transaction, SSE Renewables will take on a team of around 40 employees with vast local experience in the sector. The transaction is likely to complete by the end of September 2022, subject to receipt of relevant foreign direct investment and regulatory approvals.\n\nIn September 2021, SSE Renewables progressed into Japan with the creation of a new joint ownership company, SSE Pacifico (80% stake), which includes the acquisition of an interest in an offshore development platform for US$208m. The new company will develop the acquired 10GW gross portfolio, comprising a number of early development stage offshore wind projects in Japan. It includes a mix of fixed bottom and floating sites with the most advanced projects expected to be constructed by the end of this decade. SSE Renewables has submitted an application to the Polish government for an Offshore Location License (OLL) for the allocation of development rights for an\n\n## SSE Renewables project pipeline\n\n| Project                    | Location   | Technology                | Capacity   (MW)   | SSE Share   (MW)   |\n|----------------------------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| Due FID or in Construction |            |                           |                   |                    |\n| Dogger Bank A              | GB         | Offshore wind             | 1,200             | 480                |\n| Dogger Bank B              | GB         | Offshore wind             | 1,200             | 480                |\n| Dogger Bank C              | GB         | Offshore wind             | 1,200             | 480                |\n| Seagreen 1                 | GB         | Offshore wind             | 1,075             | 527                |\n| Viking                     | GB         | Onshore wind              | 443               | 443                |\n| Lenalea                    | ROI        | Onshore wind              | 30                | 15                 |\n| Consented                  |            |                           |                   |                    |\n| Seagreen 1A 1              | GB         | Offshore wind             | 500               | 245                |\n| Yellow River               | ROI        | Onshore wind              | 104               | 104                |\n| Tangy                      | GB         | Onshore wind              | 57                | 57                 |\n| Strathy South              | GB         | Onshore wind              | 208               | 208                |\n| Coire Glas                 | GB         | Pumped storage            | Up to 1,500       | Up to 1,500        |\n| Requiring consent          |            |                           |                   |                    |\n| Berwick Bank 2             | GB         | Offshore wind             | Up to 4,100       | Up to 4,100        |\n| ScotWind E1 Lease          | GB         | Offshore wind             | 2,600             | 1,040              |\n| Arklow Bank 2 3            | ROI        | Offshore wind             | 800               | 800                |\n| North Falls                | GB         | Offshore wind             | 504               | 252                |\n| Cloiche                    | GB         | Onshore wind              | 155               | 155                |\n| Other                      | -          | Onshore wind              | c.200             | c.200              |\n| Future prospects 4         |            |                           |                   |                    |\n| Braymore Point             | ROI        | Offshore wind             | 1,000             | 1,000              |\n| Celtic Sea Array           | ROI        | Offshore wind             | 1,200             | 1,200              |\n| Japanese development       |            |                           |                   |                    |\n| projects                   | Japan      | Offshore wind             | 10,000            | 8,000              |\n| Other GB Other NI          | GB         | Onshore wind Onshore wind | c.250 c.50        | c.250 c.50         |\n| Other ROI                  | NI ROI     | Onshore wind              | c.250             | c.250              |\n| Other GB                   | GB         | Hydro                     | 75                | 75                 |\n\noffshore wind farm in the Baltic Sea, which would be developed in partnership with Acciona Energia.

Ecological innovation and energy systems integration are key assessment criteria.\n\nSSE Renewables has formed a 50/50 strategic partnership with Brookfield for the bid, who have strong offtaker relationships in the Netherlands. SSE Renewables has also recently opened an office in Rotterdam.\n\nSSE Renewables is also assessing other\n\ngrowth options across selected markets in Northern Europe and the United States. Towards the end of the financial year, it opened an office in Boston and is assessing participation in upcoming offshore leasing rounds, for example, in California, which is expected to take place in Autumn 2022.",

These assets play a key transitional role in the SSE Group and wider energy system, supporting the Balancing Mechanism on the journey to net zero. While providing much-needed system flexibility to ensure stability and security of supply in the short term, SSE Thermal is actively developing options to progressively decarbonise its fleet.\n\n## Operational delivery\n\nSSE Thermal's combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) fleet has played an important role in the UK, providing flexibility at scale to support a tight and volatile energy market, demonstrating the value it delivers within the SSE Group portfolio, providing balance when wind resource is scarce, and the importance of flexible assets in securing a resilient transition to net zero.\n\nIn the GB market, significant periods of scarcity in the year have led to increased forward spark spreads allowing value to be secured by the fleet ahead of delivery. This has been complemented by the fleet's ability to respond to on-the-day market requirements to balance the system, through the Balancing Mechanism. In the Irish market, the system has been tighter than normal, with lower generation capacity available. As a result, SSE Thermal's assets in Ireland have played an important role in keeping the lights on.\n\nWith the value of the SSE Thermal portfolio coming from its ability to respond to market conditions, plant availability has been managed responsibly to respond to system balancing needs; an approach that is likely to become more important as the volume of renewable capacity on the system increases. In providing these vital balancing services, strong operational performance is therefore less dependent upon the volume of its output and more on the availability of the plant at times of system stress. Reduced plant availability in the year was predominantly concentrated in the first six months and was driven by a number of factors including unplanned outages to respond to faults and maintenance requirements, slight overrun of planned outages and the phasing of outages towards the first half of the year to respond to system needs.\n\nSSE's UK-based CCGT fleet has secured valuable Capacity Market agreements for winter 2022/23 and for future years out to September 2026, demonstrating the role thermal plant plays in ensuring security of supply. Agreements have also been secured for all of SSE Thermal's fleet in Ireland.\n\nFor financial performance commentary please refer to the Group Financial Review.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'The past year has shown the value that SSE Thermal creates for shareholders while providing society with the generation flexibility needed in the transition to net zero. I come into the role of MD already proud of a team that is delivering for the Group, and excited about our future prospects.'\n\nCatherine Raw Managing Director, SSE Thermal",

Developing more efficient alternatives to the existing CCGT fleet will be vital to deliver SSE's goal to cut carbon intensity by 80% by 2030 and achieve its science-based carbon reduction targets, aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C global warming scenario. SSE Thermal is developing projects using carbon capture and storage (CCS) and hydrogen; technologies which will be critical to society in the transition to net zero, enabling enhanced renewables deployment by balancing the system.\n\nIn 2021/22 SSE Thermal progressed its carbon capture power stations, which it is co-developing with Equinor, through the planning process. In June 2021, SSE Thermal submitted a planning application for Keadby Carbon Capture Power Station to the UK's Planning Inspectorate. In March 2022 SSE Thermal submitted a planning application for Peterhead Carbon Capture Power Station to Scotland's Energy Consents Unit.\n\nIn October 2021 the UK Government announced that the East Coast Cluster comprising the Humber and Teesside regions - and the HyNet Cluster in north-west England would be Track 1 clusters, or the first clusters supported to deploy shared CCS infrastructure by the middle of this decade. The Scottish cluster was identified as a 'reserve' Track 1 cluster and remains in line to progress to deployment as a Track 2 cluster by the end of the decade. The UK Government's commitment to supporting four clusters by\n\n2030, including two by the middle of this decade, was galvanised in its CCUS Investor Roadmap which emphasised that the technology is a necessity not an option to deliver net zero emissions by 2050. Published in April 2022, it also confirmed its intention to engage with industry on the 'Track 2' process this calendar year.\n\nIn November 2021, the UK Government launched the second phase of the Cluster Sequencing Competition to identify which projects would be supported to connect to Track 1 clusters; this process was also open to projects seeking a connection into the 'reserve' Scottish Cluster. SSE Thermal submitted applications for Keadby Carbon Capture Power Station, seeking to connect into the East Coast Cluster, and Peterhead Carbon Capture Power Station, seeking to connect into the Scottish Cluster. Successful projects will secure a Dispatchable Power Agreement; a revenue support scheme designed by the UK Government. A decision on which projects will progress into negotiations is expected from July 2022.\n\nLow-carbon hydrogen will be an important facet of a net zero economy. The UK Government's inaugural hydrogen strategy, published in August 2021, highlighted the role it will play in providing flexible energy for power, heat and transport and the need for large hydrogen storage facilities. SSE Thermal is continuing to develop lowcarbon hydrogen projects, alongside Equinor, including Keadby Hydrogen Power Station and Aldbrough Hydrogen Storage and sees significant further growth opportunities in this space, in line with the UK's target to deliver 10GW of low-carbon\n\nhydrogen production by 2030. SSE Thermal is also involved in Project Cavendish, an initiative to promote the Isle of Grain as a location for a low-carbon hydrogen economy. This could provide the opportunity to bring low-carbon hydrogen to SSE's Medway site.\n\nCommissioning of Keadby 2, SSE Thermal's 893MW CCGT, started in October 2021 and full commercial operation is targeted for 1 October 2022. Keadby 2 brings Siemens' cutting-edge turbine technology to the UK; this first-of-a-kind turbine will be Europe's most efficient CCGT and will displace older, more carbon intensive plant on the system. It is capable of being upgraded to decarbonise the system further, through hydrogen blending or carbon capture and storage.\n\nKeadby 2 also provides a testing ground for SSE Thermal's new digital strategy to deliver intelligent asset management, building on the digital capabilities already used to manage the SSE Thermal fleet. Using data and technology, the digital strategy aims to enhance asset management and maintenance capabilities.",

These assets can play an important role in the transition to net zero, supporting stability and security of gas supply in the short term as well as potential conversion to hydrogen storage for a net zero future.\n\n## Operational delivery\n\nIn 2021/22 SSE's Gas Storage business has navigated highly volatile gas markets and optimised assets to help ensure security of gas supply for the UK and provide important liquidity to the market. The assets also offer a significant risk management value to the portfolio by offering spot, short-notice flexibility. This helps defend the portfolio from exposures emanating from wind speed or consumer demand variability. Given the increasing focus around gas supply response across Europe, and the need for additional reserve to protect markets against significant geopolitical exposures, SSE anticipates this trend will continue. On that basis Gas Storage assets\n\nare likely to make a substantial contribution to the Group in the next financial year.\n\nFor financial performance commentary please refer to the Group Financial Review.\n\n## Growth opportunities\n\nSSE Thermal remains committed to working with UK Government departments and Ofgem to ensure the critical role of UK storage in relation to security of supply and stability of gas price is properly valued. It is also looking to play a future role as a source of low-carbon hydrogen storage which will be needed to balance supply and demand in a hydrogen economy.\n\nPlans to develop a potentially world-leading hydrogen storage project at Aldbrough, announced in July 2021 with Equinor, are progressing. Since this announcement, the UK Government has committed to develop business models for hydrogen storage as part of the British Energy Security Strategy and SSE is particularly close to this policy discussion.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The business markets its products under the SSE Energy Solutions brand alongside SSE Distributed Energy, selling power to over 469,000 non-domestic customers across GB.\n\n## Operational delivery\n\nDuring 2021, Business Energy increased its green customer propositions including the launch of a new and simplified Corporate Power Purchase Agreement product, to make them increasingly accessible to a wider range of businesses. This was followed in July by a commitment to businesses on fixed power contracts that they will receive their electricity from renewable sources. Green credentials associated with this electricity supply are independently verified by EcoAct, an Atos company, and customers are provided with Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs) certification. Business Energy's 'Green Gas plus' tariff, a renewable gas tariff which is also independently certified by EcoAct, performed well through the year since its launch.\n\nSmart meters are a key factor in supporting customers on their net zero journey and 2021/22 saw strong performance for the rollout of smart meter installations. Business Energy continues to work towards its first year of challenging smart regulatory installation targets in calendar year 2022.\n\nFor detailed financial performance commentary please refer to the Group Financial Review.\n\n## Growth opportunities\n\nThe platform SSE Business Energy growth is via the SSE Energy Solutions business-tobusiness brand, launched in July 2021 in partnership with SSE Distributed Energy. The platform provides a single shopfront for a range of SSE customer product offerings to support all business segments on their net zero journey; from renewable power and flexible Corporate Power Purchase Agreement offerings, to customer workplace EV charging solutions and larger scale distributed energy systems. As SSE's electricity generation businesses continue to expand and deliver new technologies, so will SSE Energy Solutions as an important route to market for the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'We recognise that market volatility has created challenges for many people.

Airtricity retains a strong market position as Ireland's largest supplier of 100% green energy, supplying approximately 701,000 customers and holding 21.2% market share by load.\n\n## Operational delivery\n\nAs a responsible business, SSE Airtricity has recognised that current market volatility has created challenges for many households and has taken various measures to support financially vulnerable customers. An all-island customer support fund (\u20ac1m) has been established, \u20ac1m was donated to a trusted all-island charity partner, and a home energy efficiency upgrade programme has been rolled our for up to 600 homes in fuel poverty. In addition Airtricity's financially vulnerable domestic customers in the Republic of Ireland will be insulated from any further price rises for the remainder of the 2022 calendar year.\n\nFor financial performance commentary please refer to the Group Financial Review.\n\n## Growth opportunities\n\nA positive public policy environment aimed at improving the thermal efficiency of 0.5m buildings provides the backdrop for the Generation Green Home Upgrade product. This is enabling the rapid rollout of a first of its kind one-stop-shop business model, in partnership with An Post, in the Republic of Ireland market. The growth of this business segment remains a key priority for 2022.\n\nFurther areas of strategic focus include building on the success of partnerships with brands such as Volkswagen and ePower delivering electric vehicle charging infrastructure and green end-to-end solutions for customers; and continued innovation and delivery of extended customer offerings to help support decarbonisation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The primary retained activity of the former SSE Enterprise businesses is now distributed energy. The business provides solar and battery storage asset development and operation and focuses on distributed generation, EV infrastructure, heat and cooling networks, and smart buildings and places.\n\nThe financial results from the Group's out of areas networks business and Neos Networks Limited (formerly SSE Telecoms) joint venture are now reported within SSEN Distribution and Corporate Unallocated respectively. Comparative information has been re-stated to reflect these changes.\n\n## Operational delivery\n\nOver the past 12 months SSE has announced significant milestones in its nascent solar and battery storage business including a secured 380MW solar and battery pipeline, with over 1GW more of other sites currently under assessment. The secured pipeline includes a 50MW battery storage asset on a consented site in Wiltshire, where construction gets under way this summer, with full energisation expected in summer 2023. SSE has also acquired a 30MW solar farm at Littleton Pastures in Worcestershire and, once complete in late 2023, this 77-acre site will be capable of powering some 9,400 homes.\n\n## Growth opportunities\n\nA key focus will be on battery storage and solar technology. Existing grid connections at legacy coal-fired sites, such as Ferrybridge and Fiddlers Ferry, also puts SSE in a strong position to deploy battery storage at scale and pace.\n\nSSE's Distributed Energy team is helping people and places reach their net zero targets by adopting a 'whole system' approach to connect localised and flexible energy assets. These include energy optimisation, heat and cooling networks, electrical networks, smart buildings, and EV charging. Distributed Energy therefore seeks to help provide the platform for a data-driven and sustainable world.\n\nDistributed Energy has ambitions to build a network of EV charging hubs across the UK - with the first of potentially 300 hubs being built in summer 2022 in Glasgow. Innovation also remains a key tool to unlocking net zero; its heat sector division for example, has an exciting partnership under way with National Grid to utilise heat from electricity transformers that would otherwise go to waste.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'This is an exciting time for the business. We've got ambitions to deliver solar and battery storage technology at GW scale, we have a 2GW distributed energy development pipeline, and we are developing strategic grid-connected local energy systems to industrial regeneration areas across the UK.'\n\nNeil Kirkby Managing Director, SSE Enterprise",

Each commodity has different liquidity characteristics, which impacts the quantum of hedging possible. See also SSE's Hedging Position.\n\n## Operational delivery\n\nIn 2021/22 EPM navigated unprecedented energy market volatility, ensuring the SSE portfolio was hedged in accordance with the Group's approach to hedging and optimised through prompt periods. The value EPM secures for SSE's asset portfolio continues to be reported against individual Business Units. 2021/22 also saw successful delivery of the first year of operation under the UK Emissions Trading Scheme.\n\nFor detailed financial performance commentary please refer to the Group Financial Review.\n\n## Growth opportunities\n\nTransformation of the EPM Business Unit continues with key external recruits into risk, prompt trading and analytics.

        "page_content": "## Section 172 and non-financial information statements\n\n## Section 172 Statement\n\nSSE has an unwritten social contract with its stakeholders that both informs decision making by the Board and aligns closely with the spirit of Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 (Section 172). Under this contract, SSE relies on society for public services and infrastructure, human capital, and the implicit right to earn a profit and remunerate shareholders. In return it safely and reliably provides energy, invests in critical national infrastructure needed for net zero, creates jobs and contributes to GDP through fair payment of tax.\n\nThis Statement summarises how, over the course of 2021/22, the Board has upheld this contract by promoting the long-term success of the Company for the benefit of SSE's six key stakeholder groups ( see pages 32 to 39 \uf150 ). This has been undertaken with regard to the matters set out in Section 172(1)(a) to (f), being:\n\n- (a) The likely consequences of any decision in the long term.\n- (b) The interests of the Company's employees.\n- (c) The need to foster the Company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others.\n- (d) The impact of the Company's operations on the community and the environment.\n- (e) The desirability of the Company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct.\n- (f) The need to act fairly between members of the Company.\n\nSSE's approach to the above social contract is exemplified throughout this Annual Report, with specific disclosures of decisions and actions which are supportive of this Section 172 Statement detailed as follows.\n\n## Long-term direction\n\nSSE's strategy is to create value for shareholders and society in a sustainable way by developing, building, operating and investing in the electricity infrastructure and businesses needed in the transition to net zero. Four 2030 Goals support this strategy, and provide important interim milestones to net zero in 2050. This longer-term view set by the Board frames its strategy work and the agreement of objectives, which extends to: capex plans; budgets; dividend plans and future resourcing requirements. SSE's Risk Management Framework, including the Groups' Principal Risks, the identification of emerging risks and the Group's Risk Appetite statement, further underpins the Board's long-term approach.\n\n## More on the longer-term context\n\n- \u00b7 Pages 2 to 3 \uf150 Our purpose and our strategy .

Supporting conversations have been conducted within a well-established framework that encourages both Group and complementary Board-level engagement. This is reflective of SSE's operating model based on autonomous Business Units in which decision-making takes place every day. The Board creates the correct conditions for this approach by setting SSE's long-term direction and the overarching decision-making framework and culture. This is in line with the Board's own understanding of stakeholder needs.\n\n## More on engagement\n\n- \u00b7 Page 134 \uf150 Considered decisionmaking .

The Board leads on, and monitors culture, by setting the tone and framework within which agreed values and accepted behaviours can be embraced by employees. This includes an inclusive working environment.

        "page_content": "## Chair's introduction\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board's work this year has been defined by dramatic changes in the operating context which informs our deliberations. As set out in my earlier reflections, this has included the evolution of a global pandemic which has touched us all; a sharpened focus on the climate emergency and the net zero transition; and volatility and affordability concerns in energy markets impacted by geopolitical events.\n\nThe purpose of this Directors' Report is to explain how we as a Board have assessed SSE's situation, and taken informed decisions to secure a sustainable and leading position on behalf of our key stakeholders; all underpinned by a long-standing and deeply embedded commitment to high standards of corporate governance. The strength of the Board's leadership is assessed through the clarity of the actions we take and transparency surrounding the standards, processes and culture we ultimately set.\n\n## Focused on the future\n\nIn November 2021, SSE announced its Net Zero Acceleration Programme, representing the optimum growth pathway identified by the Board to capitalise on the opportunities across the value chain in which SSE participates. In all our deliberations, we are focused on long-term success, financial resilience and shareholder value, and ensure thorough debate based on robust inputs which capture all of the available information. We have carefully assimilated the views and long-term priorities of those who invest in SSE, and have provided clarity\n\naround funding, growth, and dividend policy. Across pages 126 to 129 \uf150 , we provide insight into the strategic process followed in the year, alongside the governance which drove challenge and debate across each stage.\n\nIn support of strategic progress, we have continued to monitor and review current large capital programmes, and have strengthened development pipelines which represent the foundation of our accelerated investment plans. To ensure the Company has the platform it needs to succeed in the delivery of revised and accelerated ambitions, we have also spent time assessing SSE's capacity and resources for future growth.\n\nTo this end, we have refreshed the framework represented by our 2030 Goals, and (as supported by shareholders at our 2021 AGM) published a Net Zero Transition Plan, which together set the parameters within which we intend to deliver our ambition. This includes enhanced 1.5 \u00b0 C aligned science-based targets.\n\nCommittee support has been strong and provided in multiple ways. The Remuneration Committee has overseen proposed updates to Remuneration Policy to align with our growth ambitions. The Nomination Committee has championed talent and capability across our most important asset, people. The Audit Committee has monitored the development of our risk and opportunity reporting under the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures framework. As indicated last year, the Safety, Sustainability, Health and Environment Advisory Committee has progressed its environmental, social and governance (ESG) role, deepening its focus on performance across ESG indices, and reviewing climate resilience and adaptation plans. The Energy Markets Risk Committee has been active in its review of SSE's exposures in an increasingly volatile energy market. Further information can be found in each of the respective Committee Reports on pages 145 to 199 \uf150 .",

        "page_content": "## ' The strength of the Board's leadership is assessed through the clarity of the actions we take and transparency surrounding the standards, processes and culture we ultimately set.'\n\n## Engaging and reconnecting\n\nOne year on from my last report, a welcome change has been the ability to reconnect in person. Throughout the pandemic virtual channels worked well, and continue to be used in the Company, as we responded to employee feedback on the benefits of our 'Flexible First' approach to work enabled by technology. Nonetheless, having joined at a time when face-to-face meetings were not possible, I have thoroughly enjoyed travelling across SSE and engaging with people and operations; a sentiment which is echoed by my fellow Board members.\n\nSite visits deliver an enriched view of the reports we receive on employee sentiment, with candid discussion providing a truer understanding of how to support our people. This two-way dialogue is further enhanced through our Non-Executive Director for Employee Engagement, Dame Sue Bruce, who reports back to the Board and management after each engagement she undertakes. I am pleased to provide information on pages 137 to 139 \uf150 of how we have listened and acted upon the areas of importance to employees, which takes place within the maturing framework in which we discuss, monitor and review company culture.\n\nWe have resumed physical meetings for the Board in 2021/22, as well as for many of our shareholder engagements. The 2022 AGM is set to take place in a hybrid format, and I look forward to meeting with those of you who are able to attend in person and answering questions from those of you who join us virtually.\n\nThe Board takes very seriously the views of employees, shareholders and wider stakeholders to ensure we are pursuing actions that are acceptable to those we work with, and for. And as is evidenced across this Annual Report, the network in which we gather relevant insights is extensive. At Board-level, we enhance our understanding of views through work which complements the daily contact our businesses have, with the most significant external engagement in the year, in which the Directors participated, being COP26 in Glasgow.\n\nThe Board agenda further includes a stakeholder assessment of our strategy, an annual update on supply chains, confirmation of sustainability priorities and an annual report of key stakeholder work. Specifically, in 2021/22, we considered the development of SSEN Distribution's ED2 business plan, the impact of storms across communities, and the wider issue of energy affordability, to name just a few examples.\n\n## Composition and performance\n\nIn what has been my first full year as Chair, we've welcomed two new nonExecutive Directors to the Board in Dame Elish Angiolini and Debbie Crosbie, who bring added depth and capability to our perspectives and skillset. This has been followed by the appointment of John Bason from 1 June 2022, as the intended successor to the role of Audit Committee Chair. John's financial expertise and wealth of international experience is a strong fit, and I look forward to welcoming him to the Board.\n\nTo ensure an orderly transition within the positions of Remuneration Committee Chair and Non-Executive Director for Employee Engagement, we have further agreed a six month extension to Dame Sue Bruce's tenure ending 31 March 2023. At this time, Melanie Smith will take on the position of Remuneration Committee Chair and Dame Elish Angiolini Non-Executive Director for Employee Engagement.\n\nAs discussed on pages 146 to 149 \uf150 , these changes stem from the detailed assessment by the Nomination Committee of the Board's needs, and our composition will continue to evolve in light of the fast-moving operating environment and our future-oriented focus.\n\nA balanced Board comprises representation across a suite of diverse characteristics, which is the focus of our standalone Board Diversity Policy. We took time to consider the policy in the year and approved updates to align with our ultimate aim of enduring inclusivity and equality. Whilst good progress has been made within the Board - with gender parity across our current membership - we recognise there is\n\nalways more work to do. Notably, within the senior leadership population progress has been slower, and we have therefore continued to probe the barriers to accelerating change. We seek to address sector specific challenges through a new set of ambitions and accompanying workstreams for senior leadership, and within SSE's Just Transition Strategy. Fuller detail of the above, and wider people matters, is set out in the Nomination Committee Report on pages 145 to 151 \uf150 .\n\nThis year, in line with the three-yearly cycle, our annual Board evaluation process was externally-facilitated; providing objective findings and areas for continued development and future focus. Both the appointment of Lintstock as evaluator, and the methodology used to assess performance were carefully planned to ensure meaningful outcomes. We were pleased with the conclusion that we continue to operate effectively and welcome the suggested areas for improvement, which we will take forward as actions within our plan of work as set out on pages 143 to 144 \uf150 .\n\nI hope the following report of Board activity is a clear and engaging account of the year, and look forward to reporting further progress in 2022/23, when we will welcome continued engagement surrounding our views and actions to secure long-term success.\n\nSir John Manzoni Chair, SSE plc 24 May 2022\n\n<!-- image -->",

SSE Energy Customer Solutions comprises SSE Airtricity and SSE Business Energy.\n\n## The role of the Board\n\nThe primary role of the Board is to lead SSE in a way that ensures its long-term success, whilst generating value for shareholders and wider stakeholders. This is a broad-ranging duty and is directed by the cornerstones of SSE's purpose and vision. The last material re-definition of these guiding statements was in 2019/20, when the Board agreed closer alignment of SSE's purpose and vision with its strategic transformation around a core of clean electricity infrastructure and its societal role in the net zero transition.\n\nIn support of SSE's purpose and vision, the Board sets and monitors SSE's strategy through a continuing programme of work. In 2021/22, this saw the approval and announcement of SSE's Net Zero Acceleration Programme. The process which identified this phase of strategic growth as the optimum pathway for all of SSE's stakeholders is covered on\n\npages 126 to 129 \uf150 . Confirmation of how SSE's businesses and its associated business model provide the best possible balance to deliver long-term value, is set out on pages 10 to 17 \uf150 .\n\nOnce set by the Board, the implementation of strategy is the responsibility of the Group Executive Committee and management across SSE's Business Units. Oversight of performance is achieved through structured operational and financial reporting from the Executive Directors at each Board meeting, in addition to presentations from each Business Unit across the year. These presentations comprise strategic updates and approvals in line with SSE's Governance Framework.\n\nOperational and financial performance for 2021/22 is covered across the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 111 \uf150 .\n\n## Corporate governance in SSE\n\nCorporate governance in SSE can be explained as the minimum expectations set by the Board surrounding standards, responsible conduct and controls. SSE's Governance Framework supports this approach by mapping where accountability resides in line with delegated authorities, and in this way, forms part of SSE's System of Internal Control as set out on page 161 \uf150 .\n\nAreas of importance to the Board and SSE's operations influence the features of the Governance Framework, which is illustrated, in part, by the Committees which provide dedicated focus to areas on behalf of the Board and the Group Executive Committee. Clarity surrounding the responsibilities of each Committee is ensured through approved Terms of Reference, as determined by a Committee's reporting line.",

        "page_content": "Monitoring of delegated matters is supported by formal reporting channels. For Board Committees, this is a personal account from the non-Executive Director who chairs the Committee following each Committee meeting. As set out above, on executive matters, the Chief Executive, Finance Director and Chief Commercial Officer are responsible for providing full updates at each Board meeting. These mechanisms are in addition to sub-Committee minutes, written reports and agreed KPIs to monitor financial and non-financial performance.\n\n## Board reserved matters\n\nIn order to safeguard the areas material to the delivery of SSE's purpose, vision and strategy, the Board retains a schedule of matters reserved for its decision. This ensures the necessary framework and resources are in place for the Company to meet its stated objectives and covers the below areas.\n\n## Strategy and performance\n\n- \u00b7 Approval and review of commercial strategy, business development and long-term strategic options.\n- \u00b7 Oversight of performance in light of approved strategy and objectives.\n- \u00b7 Review and approval of priorities surrounding SSE's principal sustainability impacts, including climate change.\n- \u00b7 Major transactions and any material extension or closure of operations.\n\n## Financial management\n\n- \u00b7 Approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets.\n- \u00b7 Approval of dividend policy and key financial communications.\n- \u00b7 Changes to the Group's capital structure.\n\n## Risk and control\n\n- \u00b7 Ensuring sound systems of internal control and risk management.\n\n## Board meetings in 2021/22\n\nIn the period to 31 March 2022, there were six scheduled meetings of the Board with update calls in alternate months to maintain coverage of key business developments, emerging issues and opportunities. Arrangements remain in place should a Board decision or approval be required outside these times.\n\nAcross the year, Board meetings were conducted in line with applicable government guidance, with the physical element returning when it was safe to do so. Details of Board meeting activity in 2021/22 can be found on pages 126 to 133 \uf150 .\n\n## People and culture\n\n- \u00b7 Approach to people, succession, and inclusion and diversity.\n- \u00b7 Agreement and monitoring of a healthy corporate culture including SSE's values and framework of cultural controls.\n\n## Governance\n\n- \u00b7 Changes to Board and Board Committee structure, size and composition.\n- \u00b7 Approval of shareholder communications.\n- \u00b7 Confirmation of stakeholder approach.\n- \u00b7 Approval of Board-level corporate governance matters.\n\n## Regulation\n\n- \u00b7 Approval of the electricity distribution and transmission price control reviews proposed by Ofgem.\n\nThe Schedule of Reserved Matters is one of a collection of documents which make up SSE's Board Charter. The contents of the Board Charter govern the Board's operations and pertinent Group-wide matters and is subject to annual Board review and approval.\n\nThe Board Charter contains:\n\n- \u00b7 SSE plc's Articles of Association.*\n- \u00b7 Board's Schedule of Reserved Matters.*\n- \u00b7 SSE's guide to good business ethics.*\n- \u00b7 SSE's Guide to Governance.\n- \u00b7 Board Committee Terms of Reference.*\n- \u00b7 Non-Audit Services Policy.*\n- \u00b7 Procedure for Taking Independent Advice.\n- \u00b7 Non-Executive Directors' Shareholding Policy.\n- \u00b7 Board Inclusion and Diversity Policy.*\n- \u00b7 Responsibilities of key Board roles.*\n- * Documents available in full on sse.com \uf295 .\n\n## Board operations\n\nThe Board, led by the Chair, seeks to nurture a culture in which informed and transparent decision-making takes place. This is supported by clearly defined Board roles and constructive dialogue within and outside of meetings. The division of responsibilities across the Board is explained on page 142 \uf150 .\n\nWith one of the key responsibilities of\n\nthe non-Executive Directors being to challenge and provide counsel, it is deemed appropriate that relationships can be built across different levels of SSE. The Board therefore has unfettered access to senior leadership, their teams and specialist functions. For details of employee engagement and knowledge development in 2021/22 see pages 137 to 139 and 148 \uf150 .\n\nStructured meeting agendas are developed by the Chair, Chief Executive and Company Secretary, around an agreed annual plan of Board business and the current status of projects, strategic workstreams and the overarching operating context. Adequate time is allocated to support effective and constructive discussion, and guidance is available to authors and presenters of Board materials. An electronic meeting portal allows efficient navigation of papers, information and requests.\n\nPrior to every Board meeting, the nonExecutive Directors meet without the Executive Directors present. This allows any issues surrounding meeting business to be raised in advance of full Board discussion. Further time is set aside at the end of every meeting to capture any emerging areas for non-Executive focus.\n\n|                          | Board   | Nomination  Committee   | Audit  Committee   |     | EMRC SSHEAC   | Remuneration   Committee   |\n|--------------------------|---------|-------------------------|--------------------|-----|---------------|----------------------------|\n| Number of meetings held  | 6       | 6                       | 4                  | 5   | 4             | 5                          |\n| Sir John Manzoni         | 6/6     | 6/6                     |                    | 5/5 | 4/4           | 5/5                        |\n| Alistair Phillips-Davies | 6/6     |                         |                    |     |               |                            |\n| Gregor Alexander         | 6/6     |                         |                    | 5/5 |               |                            |\n| Martin Pibworth 1        | 6/6     |                         |                    | 5/5 | 1/1           |                            |\n| Tony Cocker              | 6/6     | 6/6                     | 4/4                | 5/5 | 4/4           |                            |\n| Dame Elish Angiolini 2   | 4/4     | 4/4                     |                    |     | 3/3           | 3/3                        |\n| Dame Sue Bruce 3         | 5/6     | 6/6                     |                    |     |               | 5/5                        |\n| Debbie Crosbie 4         | 4/4     | 4/4                     | 1/1                | 1/1 |               |                            |\n| Peter Lynas              | 6/6     | 6/6                     | 4/4                |     |               | 5/5                        |\n| Helen Mahy               | 6/6     | 6/6                     | 4/4                |     | 4/4           |                            |\n| Melanie Smith            | 6/6     | 6/6                     |                    | 5/5 |               | 4/5                        |\n| Dame Angela Strank       | 6/6     | 6/6                     |                    |     | 4/4           | 5/5                        |\n\n- 1 Martin Pibworth joined the SSHEAC on 1 January 2022.\n- 2 Dame Elish Angiolini joined the Board and Nomination Committee on 1 September 2021, the SSHEAC on 26 October 2021 and Remuneration Committee on 15 November 2021.\n\n- 4 Debbie Crosbie joined the Board and Nomination Committee on 1 September 2021 and the EMRC and Audit Committee on 23 February 2022.",

The Programme was the result of a robust review process conducted by the Board, which considered: SSE's integrated business model of market-based and economicallyregulated; the growth opportunities\n\navailable across this mix; alongside the full range of strategic and structural alternatives.

        "page_content": "## Review of strategic situation\n\nIn May 2021, the Board confirmed within SSE's preliminary results statement, that it intended to assess significant and emerging potential capital and investment opportunities, across the coming months, which were not reflected in the previously agreed \u00a37.5bn capital investment plan. This\n\ndecision was supported by the agreed capital investment being largely contracted; the strength of execution across the \u00a32bn non-core disposal programme; and preliminary analysis of SSE's short, medium and long-term strategic situation as part of the Board's ongoing strategy review work.\n\n## Assessment of strategic options\n\nThrough dedicated sessions across May to July 2021, the Board confirmed SSE's strategic progress, and based on this position, engaged in targeted debate to agree further strategic opportunities for analysis and refinement. The robust quality of the information to support this phase of Board discussion was assured through a broad range of inputs. These included external energy sector analyses and dedicated work from specialist internal teams including Corporate Finance, Energy Economics, Business Unit Leadership and Group Strategy.\n\nAn overview of the topics which shaped Board debate across May to July 2021 is set out below.\n\n- \u00b7 Purpose and long-term shape of the Group\n\nThe Board considered and reaffirmed the continued role of SSE's purpose and strategy focused on a core of low-carbon electricity infrastructure against the growing external importance of a net zero transition by 2050. This considered views on decarbonisation of\n\nthe power sector, covering: technology, security of supply and energy markets; the current policy and regulatory framework to support the sector transition; the competitive landscape; and Business Unit-specific roles and trends. Further details of the key trends within SSE's external operating context can be found on pages 28 to 31 \uf150 .\n\n- \u00b7 Capital allocation, long term growth opportunities and strategic choices Substantive discussion covered net zero-linked growth options to 2050 and the view of risk-adjusted returns across SSE's current markets, pipeline and technologies. This further tested the synergies and optimum balance across the business mix to confirm where maximum value could be created; the overall fit of available long-term strategic trajectories; SSE's capability and competencies; and the strength of the existing platform for overall long-term growth across geographies, including internationally.\n\n## Incorporating external views and challenge\n\n## Wider stakeholder views\n\nStakeholder views are gathered through an extensive network of strategic engagement across SSE as explained on pages 32 to 39 \uf150 , and within the framework set by the Board described on page 134 \uf150 .\n\nAcross the strategic review process, the position of SSE's six key stakeholder groups was incorporated across each of the long-term pathways, with an explanation of how the Programme embodies the optimal outcome for all set out overleaf.\n\n## External analysis of SSE's appraisal\n\nIn addition to internal debate, the Board engaged external legal and financial advice to test the key elements of the identified strategic options. To preserve objectivity, two independent workstreams were created. One led by financial advisors from SSE's brokers and the other led by an independent financial advisor. The findings of each workstream were presented separately to the Board. The work was concluded over a phased three month period to allow the Board to fully appraise the respective evaluations and reflect on the priorities gathered by an agreed Shareholder Engagement subCommittee (see page 128 \uf150 ).\n\n## APR MAY\n\nWith the existing dividend plan set to March 2023, the Board had further indicated it would provide an update on the approach to shareholder remuneration beyond the current dividend plan by May 2022.\n\n## MAY JUN JUL\n\n- \u00b7 Funding and financial strategy Modelling and analysis assessed the sources of funding available to pursue strategic options, retain financial stability and support strong investment grade credit and credit capacity. It also considered funding for each growth opportunity, across a range of valuation scenarios and timehorizons. This further evaluated the ability to retain optionality and seize future opportunities whilst delivering sustained long-term shareholder value.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, strategic work is supported through Board participation in deep dives which cover sector specific issues and matters of potential strategic significance. These sessions are facilitated by internal and external subject matter experts. Further details of sessions held in 2021/22 are covered on page 148 \uf150 .\n\n## AUG SEP OCT NOV\n\nThe scope of the external analysis across this period covered:\n\n- \u00b7 Total Shareholder Returns of different strategic alternatives.\n- \u00b7 Growth optionality and potential across Business Units.\n- \u00b7 SSE's investment case and business model valuation.\n- \u00b7 Financing, credit profile and the ability to fund growth.\n- \u00b7 Dis-synergies and separation costs which were verified by an independent external advisor.\n- \u00b7 Disruption to execution of investments critical to net zero.\n- \u00b7 Wider impacts on stakeholders.",

This is supported by the formal and separate collation of market and investor data from SSE's brokers which is presented to the Board at least twice a year.\n\nFull details of the standing programme of shareholder engagement is set out on pages 135 to 136 \uf150 , with shareholder views providing a crucial backdrop to the full range of Board deliberations.\n\nTo enhance monitoring of stakeholder feedback and public commentary, the Chair initiated a dedicated Shareholder Engagement sub-Committee.

The sub-Committee met weekly outside of agreed Board meetings, was led by the Chair of the Board, and comprised at least 50% independent membership.\n\nEngagement methods which the sub-Committee oversaw in this period included the offer of meetings to SSE's largest shareholders - representing around 40% of SSE's issued share capital - and proactive monitoring of the normal communication channels which remained open to all shareholders.

In concluding the Programme was the correct pathway in the next phase of growth for SSE, the Board assessed the following outcomes for long-term success and each of SSE's six key stakeholder groups.\n\n- \u00b7 Sustainable long-term growth Delivering on growth opportunities across SSE's core electricity infrastructure businesses is the fundamental long-term driver of value. This would be best achieved through balance sheet strength and funding options, derived from a re-balancing of the mix of market-based and economically-regulated businesses through a minority networks stake sale.\n\n- \u00b7 Shareholder value and ESG SSE's business mix continues to support a clear ESG investor story, with total long-term shareholder returns maximised from earnings and asset value growth across net zeroorientated opportunities. Recognising the importance of shareholder remuneration through dividends, a rebased dividend at an absolute level with attractive growth was deemed as the correct balance to meet the needs of those who invest for sustained annual returns, whilst promoting continued long-term success. The Programme also highlights that a minority networks stake sale will rebalance the expected allocation of capex across SSE's businesses over the longer-term, and retains SSE's ability to harness\n\nCommittee, reviewing both the internal information position and external commentary across media and analyst notes across the period to November 2021.\n\nTo date, the sub-Committee has remained in place, and intends to meet as required to support an enhanced frequency and co-ordination of shareholder soundings on strategic matters following announcement of the Programme. The role and requirement for the sub-Committee will remain under review throughout the initial phase of execution in 2022/23.\n\n## Identified shareholder priorities\n\n- \u00b7 Long-term value creation\n- \u00b7 Balance and stability of growth options\n- \u00b7 Transparency over funding and capital allocation\n- \u00b7 Clear investment proposition\n\nNOV\n\nthe significant growth opportunities to SSE's networks businesses, as investment in national critical infrastructure remains central to the net zero transition.\n\n- \u00b7 People, skills, capability and culture SSE's greatest asset is the experience and expertise of its employees, and the Programme continues to champion SSE's principles for providing and creating good, green jobs (see also page 60 \uf150 ). The assessment of break-up scenarios concluded substantial dis-synergies, a loss of the shared services and capabilities that SSE's electricity-focused business mix provides, and an impact on culture. Significant disruption would see cost and uncertainty to the business, its people, partners and counterparties, leading to project delays.",

SSE's customer businesses, meanwhile, remain an important route to market for, and supplier of, low-carbon energy.\n- \u00b7 Accelerating the net zero transition The Programme would enable the delivery of Government policy objectives aligned to net zero, including: around 20% of the UK's 50GW offshore wind target by 2030; 20% of upcoming UK electricity networks investment; and critical options for the 20GW lowcarbon flexibility to ensure security of supply by 2030, all of which are central to decarbonisation of the power sector by 2035.\n- \u00b7 Projects society requires for net zero Other scenarios, including 'break-up' or separation of some elements of the Group, such as SSE's renewables business, would see loss of scale, reduced capital structure and a weaker credit position; negatively impacting the ability to fund larger scale projects and denying growth options across the value chain, in areas such as carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and distributed energy solutions, amongst other emerging technologies. These projects are critical for society to transition to net zero through enhanced renewables deployment and system balancing.\n- \u00b7 Suppliers, contractors and partners Well-chosen equity partnering is a key element of SSE's strategy, with a proven ability to spread project risk and financial exposures, manage net debt, secure developer premiums and benefit from third party experience. This provides the\n\n## Governing strategic execution\n\nThe Programme sets out quantifiable deliverables to 2026 and is further supported by a set of ambitious targets to 2031. Together these represent strategic outcomes underpinned by core sustainability objectives, including the renewal of SSE's greenhouse gas emission targets to align with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway as approved by the Science Based Target initiative. The result is a comprehensive framework against which the Board can monitor and incentivise progress with clear criteria for Business Unit decision-making. In line with this, reporting to the Board has been re-aligned with the agreed ambitions and timelines.\n\nTo support execution of the Programme, a number of governance-based decisions have been taken, and workstreams initiated, which are covered in detail across respective sections of the Annual Report. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 Board approval of revised 2030 Goals (see page 130 \uf150 ).\n- \u00b7 Board approval of SSE's Net Zero Transition Plan (see page 130 \uf150 ).\n- \u00b7 Board support for SSE's sustainable investment criteria and Large Capital Project Framework (see page 133 \uf150 ).\n- \u00b7 Board approval of a revised Employee Guide to SSE's Strategy (see page 138 \uf150 ).\n\nopportunity to accelerate SSE's growth plans and capture further opportunities at home and abroad. By extending the approach to SSE's network businesses through minority stake sales, the Group optimises the investment in, and growth from, market-based and economically regulated businesses whilst fully funding the investment and expecting an investment grade credit rating to be maintained. Meanwhile, the development pipeline will continue to present opportunities for local and national suppliers, support competitive domestic supply chains and support continued engagement on cutting scope 3 activity.\n\n## NOV DEC JAN FEB MAR\n\n- \u00b7 Board oversight of SSE's Just Transition Strategy (see page 132 \uf150 ).\n- \u00b7 Nomination Committee review of leadership, talent, succession, inclusion and diversity, and culture (see pages 145 to 151 \uf150 ).\n- \u00b7 Remuneration Committee review of SSE's Remuneration Policy including performance-related metrics and targets (see pages 136 and 168 to 171 \uf150 ).",

The physical and transitional risks and opportunities to SSE, associated with climate change, is therefore not a singular agenda item. Climate is a topic embedded across all areas of Board work.\n\nLong-term considerations, including those trends within the operating context that have the potential to influence strategic direction, and affect the views and needs of stakeholders, are all couched in the possible pathways to net zero.\n\nThis includes changes in policy frameworks and energy regulation; how commodity markets may react within a changing energy mix; the impact of climate change on weather; the role of innovation and technology within SSE's asset base and in changes to customer behaviour; and investor views of SSE's investments and business model.\n\nIn turn, the framework set by the Board based on its view of these climate-related issues, includes strategic targets, business goals, the approved budget, net zero consistent investment criteria, risk-based parameters including SSE's Risk Appetite, and SSE's approach to stakeholder engagement.\n\nThese represent just a few of the areas which are evidenced across pages 126 to 133 \uf150 .",

SSE's Governance\n\nFramework represents the backdrop for this, with the Board confirming ambitions, key parameters and expectations to drive long-term success. These include SSE's\n\npurpose, vision, strategy and culture and the approach to reflecting stakeholder views within long-term plans and day-today operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Engaging with stakeholders\n\nThe Board sets the framework within which stakeholder relations are developed and maintained, establishing why SSE interacts with its stakeholders and how views should be considered at both a Business Unit and Group level. The identification of SSE's key stakeholder groups and the purpose of stakeholder engagement are therefore Board-approved principles, which are explained on pages 32 to 33 \uf150 .\n\nTo ensure meaningful reflection of stakeholder views across SSE's operations and actions, breadth and depth of stakeholder engagement is required. The Board is supported in the scale of this activity by a network of mature executive and business-led stakeholder contacts, with oversight and understanding of views achieved through both direct engagement and reporting of below-Board\n\nactivity. This allows the timely recognition of emerging stakeholder issues, with Board engagement complementing the expectation that senior leadership and SSE's Business Units take demonstrable account of stakeholder opinion in their decisions and longer-term objectives.\n\n## Addressing stakeholder priorities\n\nReflective of SSE's approach, the response to stakeholder priorities across business plans and within Board work is represented across the Annual Report. In the context of the Board-level principal decisions on pages 126 to 131, 150 and 169 \uf150 , insight is provided surrounding the material stakeholder factors which shaped deliberations. Totemic issues with multistakeholder impact, such as the climate emergency, coronavirus pandemic, energy affordability and security of supply remain a backdrop to all Board work.\n\nLooking ahead, the delivery of SSE's Net Zero Acceleration Programme will provide a focal point for stakeholder engagement across 2022/23, and will be supplemented by the following Board-identified priorities.\n\n- \u00b7 Advocacy on energy system design to future proof a net zero transition that supports customers' needs.\n- \u00b7 Two-way dialogue with employees on their role within SSE and net zero, and support for SSE's IN, ON and UP inclusion and diversity strategy.\n- \u00b7 Active engagement with all stakeholders on SSE's view of a fair and just transition.\n- \u00b7 Diversity of opinion and challenge on SSE's long-term strategic direction and approach to environmental, social and governance matters, through external soundings.\n\nWorking for stakeholders\n\nMore on pages 32 to 39 \uf150",

Engagement by the executive team is led by the Chief Executive and Finance Director with participation from the Chief Commercial Officer and other members of the Group Executive Committee, and focuses on financial and business performance in executing SSE's strategy. Engagement by the Chair leads on corporate governance, strategy development and people, with support from the non-Executive Directors.\n\nOpen and regular dialogue remains the foundation to the Board's approach, with managed communication channels in place for all to use (see page 355 \uf150 ). In addition, the Board, executive management and the Investor Relations team proactively engage with investors through an annual programme of activity, and ongoing communication with analysts, proxy advisors, ESG ratings agencies and financial ratings agencies helps improve disclosure and allow stakeholders to better assess SSE's performance.\n\n## Institutional investors\n\nCollectively, in 2021/22, the Board engaged directly with institutional investors representing over 40% of issued share capital. The programme of engagement which encompassed 153 one-to-one sessions with investors - was mainly focused across three periods: the Full-year Results Roadshow; the period ahead of the Net Zero Acceleration Programme; and the Half-year Results and Strategy Roadshow thereafter. In addition to dedicated engagement surrounding long-term strategic direction (see page 128 \uf150 ), specific feedback was sought on the proposed Remuneration Policy, and following appointment as Chair, Sir John Manzoni proactively engaged with many of SSE's largest shareholders to establish a first-hand understanding of priorities and views on corporate governance.\n\nSupplementing one-to-one engagement, the Executive Directors attended 15 industry conferences, mainly virtual, and held 23 group meetings which were attended by a number of shareholders and prospective investors.\n\n## Retail shareholders\n\nTo allow management of an individual's shareholding, SSE's investor website provides a source of equivalent information, housing all regulatory news announcements and published financial and non-financial reports. The Investor Relations team and the Company\n\nSecretariat, with support from SSE's Registrar, engage directly with retail shareholders in response to private shareholding queries.\n\n## Annual General Meeting (AGM)\n\nThe Board encourages shareholders to participate in the AGM, and through shareholder approval, has introduced the necessary measures to hold a hybrid meeting in 2022. These arrangements allow full remote participation, with details of the business of the meeting and how to attend both in person and virtually set out in the separately issued Notice of AGM 2022. With all Directors available to respond to enquiries, questions are invited to be submitted both on the day and in advance. Answers to questions and the results of the meeting are published on sse.com \uf295 as soon as practicable after the event. In 2021, all resolutions were passed with in excess of 94.87% votes cast in favour.\n\n## Debt investors\n\nEngagement with solicited credit ratings agencies, being Standard & Poors' and Moody's, takes place throughout the course of the year, with increased dialogue ahead of the annual ratings review process and in line with Company related news flows. Regular dialogue is also maintained between key relationship banks, debt investors and SSE's Treasury team and the Finance Director.\n\nCYCLE OF SHAREHOLDER ACTIVITY 2021/22\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNumber of shareholder meetings\n\nMain focus of meetings",

This is covered through written reports and verbal feedback from meetings which have taken place.\n\nThe feedback provided by shareholders during and after Half and Full-year Results Roadshows is communicated directly to the full Board in a biannual shareholder feedback paper including updates from SSE's brokers.\n\nThe Board, through the SSHEAC, receives a full annual review of SSE's performance in investor-led ESG reviews and ratings. Key matters raised by shareholders during the period, considered across Board deliberations are set out on page 35 \uf150 .\n\n## ENGAGEMENT IN ACTION SHAREHOLDERS AND DEBT PROVIDERS\n\n## SHAPING REMUNERATION POLICY\n\nSSE's Remuneration Policy is subject to a three-yearly binding vote from shareholders, with it last approved at the 2019 AGM.\n\nIn February 2022, the Chair of the Remuneration Committee wrote to SSE's top 30 shareholders on the Register, as well as several advisory agencies. This set out that the Remuneration Committee was seeking to use the upcoming review cycle to further strengthen and align its approach to executive pay with SSE's purpose and long-term strategy, as directly supported by the Net Zero Acceleration Programme. The letter resulted in a number of written responses as well as virtual meetings\n\nwhere views on the policy proposals were shared and discussed.\n\nShareholder responses were considered at the Remuneration Committee meeting at the end of March, and with agreement of the Committee, a further letter was sent to shareholders at the end of April. This reported the feedback which had been received to date and provided a summary of its response to the common themes raised.\n\nFollowing approval at the Remuneration Committee meeting in May, this engagement with shareholders contributed to: a change to the proposed split of performance measures for the Performance Share\n\nPlan - with more being financial than originally proposed; and a focus on the importance of stretching targets, with a suitable mix of quantitative and qualitative measures.\n\nFurthermore, the engagement allowed the Remuneration Committee Chair to reassure shareholders that the proposed change to Policy wording does not represent a change in the current approach to pay, but provides greater flexibility for the future, with Executive Directors' salaries increasing by 3% with effect from 1 April 2022 in line with the negotiated pay increase for all employees.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the Nomination Committee's considerations, recognition was given to Dame Sue's depth of experience, active listening skills and empathetic approach. It was further\n\nrecognised that as Remuneration Committee Chair, relevant employee perspectives could be understood in the context of wider remuneration policy and the approach to reward.\n\nThe creation of the role remains a natural and progressive step in the evolution of SSE's employee voice strategy, providing an enhanced and more interactive understanding of employee sentiment.\n\nENGAGEMENT IN ACTION EMPLOYEES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## NON/hyphen.caseEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT\n\nI have been hugely grateful of the opportunity to re-connect with colleagues in person after the unique challenges which coronavirus presented across 2020/21. Recognising that virtual platforms provided an inclusive means of 'travelling' to different locations, we have retained a hybrid approach to engagement, delivering a more rounded and flexible means of keeping in touch with employee sentiment.\n\nWork across the year has continued to support constructive engagement on employee survey results and businessled action plans - which saw a session with Airtricity colleagues in Ireland and a virtual employee-wide call; alongside new thought provoking sessions with the leads of Belonging in SSE Groups, which will be a biannual occurrence going forward. The essence of engaging, listening and sharing lived experiences cannot be captured through measured survey responses alone, and direct insights from colleagues is an invaluable way of deepening Board understanding of how our people feel.\n\nOur dialogue remains two way and questions are always invited on Board-led developments. With SSE's strategy dependant on the collective skills of its diverse workforce I was able to share Board views in the lead up to COP26, meeting with Distributed Energy team members in Perth and attending virtual Thermal Town Hall sessions. A consistent observation is the personal commitment to SSE's purpose, and colleagues should continue to recognise the contribution they make to SSE's net zero ambitions.\n\nFrom my constructive engagements, notable priorities which have been identified to support future work, and which have been reported to the Board, are:\n\n- \u00b7 A continued pledge to support colleague wellbeing, with a particular focus on mental health for frontline workers.\n- \u00b7 Confidence in levels of employee support as society continues to adapt to the evolving coronavirus pandemic.\n- \u00b7 Focus on the value of SSE's 'Flexible First' working approach as a core enabler of employee engagement.\n- \u00b7 A retained central focus on safety.\n\nMeetings with trade union FTOs and JNCC colleagues, at least twice each year, have also continued, building on the foundations of a well-established relationship and supporting the formal industrial relations activities led by the executive team. This relationship is underpinned by openness, inclusivity and transparency whilst respecting our respective roles, allowing diverse views to be heard by the Board, in a pro-active and timely way. The collaborative role of Group HR ensures that responsive\n\nEach year, the programme of work for the Non-Executive Director for Employee Engagement is structured and supported in collaboration with SSE's Group HR Employee Engagement Manager. The success of the role is measured in action, whereby the employee voice is consistently represented in meetings attended by the Non-Executive Director for Employee Engagement, allowing the views and opinions of colleagues to feature and contribute to discussions and decisions being made.\n\nbusiness-led action can be channelled directly to senior leaders and informs the overall engagement approach.\n\nI would like to reiterate the Board's pride in the continued achievements of our employees, and the strength of culture which is evident across our engagements.\n\n## Dame Sue Bruce\n\nNon-Executive Director for Employee Engagement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n' During our call Sue was inspirational and courageous, speaking very openly about the challenges she has faced. At SSE we encourage personal stories in striving to make the uncomfortable comfortable. Board engagement on this supports an inclusive workplace where diversity is valued and everyone can thrive.'\n\nVikki Mohammed Neurodiversity and Chronic Health, Belonging in SSE Lead",

This context is reflected within the Board-approved definition of a healthy corporate culture, which supports purpose, vision, strategy and long-term success, by setting a baseline against which cultural guidance can be developed and cultural indicators tested.\n\nA healthy corporate culture is one in which SSE has a purpose, values and strategy that are respected by its stakeholders, and an operating environment that is inclusive, diverse and engaging; that encourages employees to make a positive difference for stakeholders; in which values guide decisions and actions; and in which attitudes and behaviours are consistent with high standards of conduct and doing the right thing.\n\n## Setting the tone\n\nA healthy corporate culture is a shared deliverable, which starts with the Board setting the correct tone. This is supported through approval of SSE's values, and their translation into accepted attitudes and\n\nbehaviours within SSE's Group Policies and an employee guide 'Doing the Right Thing; SSE's guide to good business ethics', all of which are supported by mandatory training for everyone in SSE.\n\nLeading by example is through the Board's own conduct and communication to employees of key Board activity. Senior leaders across SSE have the same responsibility to lead, embed and oversee cultural standards.\n\nCulture is embedded at Board-level by:\n\n- \u00b7 SSE's Governance Framework and practices (see pages 124 to 125 \uf150 ).\n- \u00b7 Board decision-making (see pages 126 to 133 \uf150 ).\n- \u00b7 People matters, appointments and succession planning (see Nomination Committee Report \uf150 ).\n- \u00b7 SSE's risk, controls and compliance approach (see Audit Committee and EMRC Reports and page 68 \uf150 ).\n- \u00b7 Focus on safety, sustainability, health and the environment (see SSHEAC Report \uf150 ).\n- \u00b7 Attitudes towards reward and remuneration (see Remuneration Committee Report \uf150 ).\n\n## Monitoring and measuring\n\nThe Board uses multiple sources to assess the strength of culture and understand how it manifests across employee sentiment,\n\nobserved behaviours and trends. These can be described as a combination of the below reported metrics, standing reports and listening channels.\n\n- \u00b7 Feedback from Board-employee engagement.\n- \u00b7 Non-Executive Director for Employee Engagement insights.\n- \u00b7 Employee survey results.\n- \u00b7 Twice yearly Cultural Dashboard review.\n- \u00b7 Monthly people updates from the Chief Executive covering key developments and employee sentiment.\n- \u00b7 Monthly compliance reporting from the Finance Director.\n- \u00b7 Monthly safety and employee wellbeing data.\n- \u00b7 Whistleblowing performance reports.\n- \u00b7 SSE's Principal Risk 'People and Culture'.\n\nThe Cultural Dashboard remains a health check, comprising data from Group HR and Group Compliance. A key section, which is illustrated opposite, aligns measured employee survey feedback with people metrics and KPIs under cultural strands. This allows the Board to consider where there are deviations between what is being heard and underlying behaviours. There were no areas of concern raised in 2021/22, with the Board retaining oversight of ongoing culture-related workstreams through its wider agenda.\n\n<!-- image -->",

An equivalent offer was made to Board Committee Chairs and secretaries, where they could meet with the Principal Reviewer if desired.\n- \u00b7 The finalised report of findings was presented to the Board in person by Lintstock at its March 2022 meeting.\n\n## Stage 2. Design of the performance review\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Considering the outcomes and effectiveness of the two previous internal Board performance reviews, it was decided that a comprehensive review of the Board and its Committees would be achieved using a detailed questionnaire - to be completed by the Board, Committee members and secretaries - complemented by individual interviews with each member of the Board.\n- \u00b7 Throughout the process the Company Secretary and Director of Investor Relations assisted Lintstock in ensuring appropriate access to Board members and the materials required to facilitate the review.\n\n## Stage 3. Review process\n\n- \u00b7 A questionnaire was issued to members of the Board, its Committees, and the respective secretaries in December 2021. To achieve a comprehensive review, questions were structured around agreed topics, comprising: Board dynamics; Board composition; Board support; management and focus of meetings; stakeholder oversight; strategic oversight; risk management and internal control; and succession planning and people.\n- \u00b7 Across January 2022, individual interviews were carried out with Board members and the Company Secretary and Director of Investor Relations to gain deeper understanding of the responses from the questionnaires. The interviews were structured to allow candid conversation as well as substantive discussion, across the range of identified topics. These interviews included specific consideration of Board dynamics, affording the reviewer the opportunity to make a robust assessment of how the Board works together without observing a Board meeting.",

Areas which scored particularly well, by the Board and Lintstock relative to an external benchmark, included: the clarity and development of strategy; monitoring of culture; the effectiveness of risk management surrounding the coronavirus pandemic; the strength and oversight of stakeholder relations; and Board support through training.\n\nThe findings further affirmed a strong Board composition, with discussions cognisant of the attributes which would be desirable in future appointments, alongside due consideration as to how these should be balanced and prioritised within succession plans.\n\nWhilst the findings were positive and confirmed the Board to be operating effectively, there remained as with all balanced process, opportunities for improvement and refinement.\n\n| Opportunities   for refinement                | Commentary   and actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Optimising  oversight of  strategic execution | In light of SSE's refreshed strategy, the review suggested the Board could consider the format of current  strategic reporting to ensure clear alignment with growth ambitions and monitoring of progress. Supporting action agreed by the Board: \u00b7  The Board reviewed proposals for monitoring progress on strategic execution at its March 2022 meeting,  and agreed updates to further optimise Board oversight, centred on the preparation and presentation of  certain strategic reports on a quarterly basis.                                                                                              |\n| Alignment on  people issues                   | People matters were identified as a particular area of Board interest and the review concluded that  alignment of expectations and aspirations, together with greater visibility of ongoing activities and   progress, would provide a more effective platform for debate.  Supporting action agreed by the Board: \u00b7  Inclusion and diversity progress, targets and reporting was considered at the Nomination Committee  meeting in May 2022 (see  page 150 \uf150 ). The output of this discussion included refreshed diversity  ambitions, providing a revised framework for constructive challenge and monitoring. |\n| Leveraging   external voices                  | The findings supported the view that the management team was highly expert and proficient in   the suite of technical matters which fall under its remit. There was however an opportunity for the   Board to complement this, through the use of third-party or external expertise on particular topics.  Supporting action agreed by the Board:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n## Board Committees\n\nThe evaluation of Board Committee performance found that each Committee remained effective in providing Board support. Specific findings and the agreement of actions was overseen by each Committee Chair, with consideration of the overall findings of the Board performance review.\n\nProgress will continue to be monitored by each Committee, with details set out in the Reports across pages 145 to 199 \uf150 .\n\n## Individual Director performance\n\nIndividual Director performance and contribution was assessed through one-to-one meetings with the Chair. These sessions allowed reflection on personal development and discussion of matters relevant to Boardroom culture and process. The findings, in combination with individual skills (see page 117 \uf150 ), the time commitment, and independence assessments (see page 148 \uf150 ) confirmed that each Director continues to contribute positively.\n\n## Chair performance\n\nThe performance of the Chair was evaluated by the Senior Independent Director based on: feedback which was proactively gathered as part of the Board performance review; a thorough discussion with the non-Executive Directors; and individual input from non-Executive and Executive Directors and selected senior\n\nmanagers. The output confirmed that Sir John Manzoni had made a strong start to the role, following a smooth transition from his predecessor. He was confirmed to lead the Board with positive energy and focus, and his dedication to the role was evident. Over the past year, he provided strong challenge on strategy, contributing positively to the ambition SSE has articulated, and engaged constructively with investors on strategy and environmental, social and governance matters.\n\nHe has developed and maintains highly effective relationships with all Directors, supporting and driving a committed and inclusive culture that encourages constructive debate and diversity of views. His positive and open tone further supports the effective operation of meetings. It was confirmed that he devotes sufficient time to the role, and in all respects meets the requirements of the Code.\n\n## Progress against 2020/21 actions\n\nProgress against the actions agreed through the 2020/21 internal evaluation process can be found on the following pages:\n\n## Continued Board engagement on strategy\n\n(see pages 126 to 131 \uf150 )\n\nRestart site visits and in-person employee engagement (see pages 137 to 139 \uf150 )\n\nMaintain topical deep dives and teach-ins (see page 148 \uf150 )",

        "page_content": "## Nomination Committee Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe Nomination Committee provides dedicated focus to the following people-led matters.\n\n- \u00b7 Board leadership . Identifies the skills, knowledge and experience required for the effective leadership and long-term success of SSE, managing the balance of Board competencies through succession planning, knowledge development and targeted recruitment.\n- \u00b7 Board Committees . Monitors the size, structure and composition of the Board's Committees to ensure the necessary support now, and going forward, in line with succession plans.\n- \u00b7 Talent pipeline . Monitors the senior leadership pipeline and initiatives to develop internal capability, engaging in leadership programmes and updates on external recruitment.\n- \u00b7 Inclusion and diversity . Under the Board's Policy, considers the perspectives and attributes across the Board and senior leadership, confirming ambitions and work to drive progress, reviewing overall support for Group-wide inclusion and diversity strategy.\n\nThe Committee's Terms of Reference are available on sse.com \uf295 .\n\nDear Shareholder,\n\nThe Nomination Committee champions SSE's long-term success through its dedicated focus on people matters. Across the Board and management, this centres on effective and inclusive leadership, with confirmation that SSE has the breadth of capability and perspectives to drive measured decision-making and company culture. The Committee focuses on succession planning for the Board itself, and the Group Executive Committee and senior management, as well as reviewing supporting talent pipelines. Our focus group-wide, is on attracting, retaining and developing the diverse talent needed for SSE to deliver on its long-term plans.\n\nI am pleased to confirm the successful appointment of three new non-Executive Directors to the Board, with Dame Elish Angiolini and Debbie Crosbie joining us in September 2021, and John Bason due to join us in June 2022. As explained on pages 146 to 147 \uf150 , these changes result from two separate search processes, and defined candidate specifications, that align with SSE's strategic ambitions. The Committee, and Board, believe the unique and diverse experiences brought by Dame Elish, Debbie and John will provide additional rigour and challenge, thereby enhancing our discussions going forward.\n\nBoard Committee membership was reviewed in September 2021 when Dame Elish and Debbie joined, and we have confirmed that John will join the Nomination Committee and the Audit Committee, for which he is the intended Chair designate, upon appointment. Details of Committee membership refreshment are on page 149 \uf150 .\n\nDame Sue Bruce will achieve 9 years of Board tenure in September 2022, and the Board has agreed our recommendation that her term be extended until 31 March 2023. This is to provide continuity as SSE seeks to introduce a new Remuneration Policy which will be voted on at the Annual General Meeting in July, and across the new pay policy which we have agreed with our trade unions. To ensure a smooth handover in key Board roles, the Board has further agreed that effective 1 April 2023 Melanie Smith will take over as Chair of the Remuneration Committee, and Dame Elish Angiolini as the Non-Executive Director for Employee Engagement.\n\nSSE's Net Zero Acceleration Programme provides a clear backdrop against which to assess the competencies SSE will need in the long term. We have reviewed the Board skills matrix, which can be found on page 117 \uf150 , in this context, and spent time on senior leadership development through enhanced updates from Group HR. This has included oversight of an externally-led leadership development review and meeting with potential future leaders. We will continue to review Board and executive skills and capacity in light of future plans.\n\nA diverse and inclusive workplace remains a priority for the Board and Nomination Committee, and underpins discussion at every level. As at 31 March 2022, the Board is 50% female and the Board Inclusion and Diversity Policy has been updated to reflect this as an enduring aim. As this position remains sensitive to both changes in the composition and size of the Board, we will continue to assess the impact of proposals in relation to membership and succession. When John Bason joins the Board in June 2022, female representation will be 46%.\n\nTo assist our future work, we note the recommendation from the FTSE Women Leaders Review centred on increasing female representation within key Board roles, and although we are currently in line with the Parker Review recommendation on ethnic diversity, we continue to consider opportunities for further progress.\n\nAt senior leadership level, whilst diversity has improved, there is a desire to accelerate the pace of change. We have therefore set revised ambitions, and actions, which we will track the initial effectiveness of across 2022/23. Details of these ambitions and our inclusion and diversity work is set out on pages 150 to 151 \uf150 .\n\nI am pleased to present this report and welcome engagement on our people-led agenda.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSir John Manzoni Nomination Committee Chair 24 May 2022",

The Company Secretary is Secretary, and where appropriate, the Executive Directors are invited to attend meetings. Biographical details of the Committee members can be found on pages 118 to 122 \uf150 . The Committee met six times in 2021/22 with meeting attendance on page 125 \uf150 .\n\n## Board leadership\n\n## Composition and succession\n\nThe composition of the Board is informed by the Committee's plans for orderly succession across key Board and Committee roles. This is supported by regular assessment of the skills, experience and diversity the Board needs in line with agreed strategy and changes in SSE's operating context. The backdrop to these discussions comprises the spectrum of Board work set out across the Directors' Report, and the counterparts of the Board composition dashboard and skills matrix on pages 116 to 117 \uf150 .\n\nFollowing agreement through the prior year's evaluation, in September 2021, the Committee engaged in a refreshed assessment of Board skills. This was aligned to SSE's strategic situation and coupled with a view of non-Executive Director tenure, including analysis of where collective and individual capabilities reside. As an evolution of existing process, it was used to test the scope of in-flight workstreams, and confirm both optionality and coverage for Board roles across the short, medium and longer-term. Identified priorities were fed into the continuum of work on Board composition, which saw the Committee support three non-Executive Director appointments in the period to 24 May 2022.\n\nIn the 2021 Annual Report, it was confirmed that Spencer Stuart had been engaged to support a prospective nonExecutive Director search process following the departure of Crawford Gillies. This\n\n## Committee evaluation\n\nThe annual review of Committee performance was considered through the formal external Board evaluation conducted by Lintstock (see pages 143 to 144 \uf150 ). The output of the evaluation was considered at the Board in March, with follow-up actions agreed by the Committee for progression across 2022/23. The Board confirmed the effective operation of the Committee in discharging its responsibilities.\n\n## Evaluation confirmed\n\n- \u00b7 The quality of information to support the Committee in discharging its responsibilities was rated positively.\n\n## Actions for 2022/23\n\n- \u00b7 Non-Executive Director succession planning is supported by proactive process and clear oversight of Board capability.\n- \u00b7 Inclusion and diversity is positioned high on the agenda and remains a clear priority in conjunction with the Board and Group HR.\n- \u00b7 Board composition . In line with the refreshed view of Board skills, continue to review succession plans and the evolution of the Board to support SSE's long-term strategic ambitions.\n- \u00b7 Executive succession and talent pipeline . Continue focus on talent and capability across senior leadership, reviewing Group HR reports on high-potential candidates and internal and external talent pools.\n- \u00b7 Inclusion and diversity . Drive further progress surrounding inclusion and diversity across senior leadership roles, reviewing initiatives, plans and ambitions.\n\nconcluded with the appointment of Dame Elish Angiolini and Debbie Crosbie with effect from 1 September 2021, both of whom joined the Nomination Committee from the same date. In May 2022, following a process supported by Korn Ferry, it was announced that John Bason would join the Board with effect from 1 June 2022. As the intended Audit Committee Chair designate, he will join the Audit Committee and become a member of the Nomination Committee from this time. Details of the supporting process for each is set out on page 147 \uf150 .\n\nAn updated title for the Group Energy and Commercial Director was further recommended to the Board in March 2022, with Martin Pibworth becoming Chief Commercial Officer from 1 April 2022. This saw no change in underlying executive responsibility and brings clearer alignment between Martin's title and directorate role.\n\n## Time commitment\n\nThe expected time commitment of the Chair and non-Executive Directors is agreed and set out in writing in a Letter of Appointment. This is issued following confirmation of an individual's capacity to take on the role, based on an assessment of existing external commitments and demands on time. Any changes, such as additional external appointments which\n\ncould impair the ability to meet the above, can only be accepted following approval of the Board. The acceptance of an external appointment by an Executive Director is further subject to Board consent. Approved changes across 2021/22 are set out on page 119 \uf150 .\n\n## Director re-appointment\n\nAll non-Executive Directors undertake a fixed term of three years subject to annual re-election by shareholders. The fixed term can be extended and consistent with best practice, does not exceed nine years unless defined circumstances are deemed to exist.\n\nExtensions recommended in the period were: a further three-year extension to the tenure of Melanie Smith and Helen Mahy representing a second and third term in each case; and a time-limited extension to Dame Sue Bruce's tenure to 31 March 2023. This is to provide continuity as SSE seeks to introduce a new Remuneration Policy, and to allow an orderly transition in the key roles of Remuneration Committee Chair and Non-Executive Director for Employee Engagement (see page 149 \uf150 ).\n\nIn each case, the decision was supported by the continuing independence, experience and contribution that each Director brings to both Board and Committee work (see pages 144 and 148 \uf150 ).",

This requirement is supported by an annual conflicts authorisation process, where the Committee reviews SSE's Conflicts of Interest Register and seeks confirmation from each Director of any changes or updates to their position.\n\nThis process informs the simultaneous assessment of a non-Executive Director's independence, as following the absence of any conflict, the Committee reflects upon the outcome of each individual Director's performance evaluation (see page 144 \uf150 ) and the circumstances set out in the Code which could compromise an individual's position.\n\nFollowing review in 2021/22, and to the exclusion of the interested Director in each case, the Committee recommended and Board confirmed: updates to the Conflicts of Interest Register; the continuing independence and objective judgement of each non-Executive Director; and the overall independence of the Board in line with the recommendations of the Code.\n\n## Director induction\n\nFollowing appointment, all Directors receive a comprehensive and tailored induction programme. This is designed through discussion with the Chair and the Company Secretary and considers existing expertise and any prospective Board or Board Committee roles.\n\nThe agreed plan for Dame Elish Angiolini and Debbie Crosbie comprised over 20 interactive sessions with both internal functions and external advisors over an initial period of six months. This was structured to ensure that information material to the non-Executive Director role was delivered in the early stages of the programme. These formal briefings, which provide an initial opportunity to meet senior leadership, are supported by operational site visits to provide on-the-ground understanding of SSE's diverse business areas and working environments. Site visits are discussed further on pages 137 to 139 \uf150 .\n\nAn appropriate induction programme for John Bason will be agreed upon joining the Board.\n\nAdditional safeguards to support Director independence are:\n\n- \u00b7 Meetings between the Chair and the non-Executive Directors, individually and collectively, without the Executive Directors present (see page 125 \uf150 ).\n- \u00b7 Separate and clearly defined roles for the Chair, as head of the Board, and the Chief Executive, as head of executive management (see page 142 \uf150 ). This division of responsibility is supported by a degree of contact outside of Board meetings to ensure an effective ongoing dialogue and channel for the timely escalation of external or internal developments.\n\n## Knowledge and training\n\nAny Director can request further information to support their individual duties or collective Board role. The arrangements are overseen by the Company Secretary and can be internally or externally facilitated, with sessions typically originating from technical Board discussions, an identified training opportunity or area of general interest relating to SSE. 2021/22 sessions included:\n\n- \u00b7 The role of CCS.\n- \u00b7 A teach-in on international growth markets in the USA and Europe.\n- \u00b7 A session on electrification of vehicles with Distributed Energy.\n- \u00b7 A teach-in on SSE's cyber context from the Chief Information Office.\n\nThrough SSE's mandatory training programme, all Directors are requested to refresh their understanding of current obligations and recent developments in areas pertinent to their role. These modules address, among other matters: Directors' duties; competition law; anti-money laundering and financial sanctions; GDPR; and inclusion and diversity.\n\nTo remain abreast of, and connected to, broader societal trends, expectations and issues, the Directors are encouraged to participate in seminars and events hosted by external organisations. Discussion with peers, other sectors and individuals in different professional and personal situations develops broader perspectives and insights, which can translate into different thinking styles and new debate within Board discussions.\n\n- \u00b7 An externally delivered session on energy markets dynamics and commodity pricing.\n\n## Dame Elish Angiolini and Debbie Crosbie induction programme\n\n| Areas covered                                                                                                | Sessions provided by                                                           |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| SSE's purpose, strategic priorities  and balanced business operations.                                       | Chief Executive  Group Strategy  MD of each Business Unit                      |\n| Financial position, performance,  investment and funding, including  credit ratings and external  assurance. | Finance Director  Senior Finance leaders External Auditor                      |\n| Energy sector and trends, energy  markets, net zero, sustainability  and stakeholder engagement.             | Chief Commercial Officer  Chief Sustainability Officer Group Corporate Affairs |\n| Corporate governance, Board  operations and shareholder   and investment community  perspectives.            | Company Secretary and   Director of Investor Relations SSE's brokers           |\n| Safety, health and the  environment, people and culture.                                                     | Director of HR  Group Safety, Health and  Environment Manager                  |",

        "page_content": "## COP26: a significant Board opportunity\n\nAs a Scottish headquartered company, the hosting of COP26 in Glasgow provided a once-in-a-lifetime experience for both the Board and employees of SSE. Maximising the development and learning opportunity provided by the large number of varied events and diverse stakeholders, was an explicit objective of SSE's Principal Partner status. To ensure SSE's Directors (non-Executive and Executive), alongside employees, would experience the process of multilateral climate negotiations; the important role of non-state actors within that process; and hear firsthand, the direct experiences of climate vulnerable nations and indigenous peoples, members of the Board in attendance in both the Blue and Green Zones of the climate conference participated in over 100 different events. These covered topics ranging from power systems innovation, the electrification of heat to human rights and a just transition.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nBoard Committee composition is designed around the following principles:\n\n- \u00b7 to ensure alignment between skillset and specific Committee responsibilities;\n- \u00b7 to prevent undue reliance on the capacity of any Director; and\n- \u00b7 to comply with recognised guidance including the Code.\n\nChanges are recommended following directorate appointments and succession, or in response to formal review. In 2021/22, the Board approved recommendations resulting in the below changes.\n\n- \u00b7 Dame Elish Angiolini joined the SSHEAC on 26 October 2021 and Remuneration Committee on 15 November 2021.\n- \u00b7 Debbie Crosbie joined the Audit Committee and EMRC on 23 February 2022.\n- \u00b7 Martin Pibworth replaced Jim Smith, outgoing MD, SSE Renewables, on the SSHEAC on 1 January 2022.\n\nIn line with the recommended extension in Dame Sue Bruce's tenure, in May 2022, the Committee put forward the succession plan for the positions of Remuneration Committee Chair and the Non-Executive Director for Employee Engagement, which saw the Board approve the respective appointments of Melanie Smith and Dame Elish Angiolini to these positions from 1 April 2023.\n\nSupporting these recommendations, was the Committee's view that Melanie's depth of strategy experience, approach to proactive engagement and focus on people development, are qualities complementary to the position of Remuneration Committee Chair; bringing a measured approach to setting relevant and stretching targets, with fair outcomes that are acceptable to all stakeholders. Melanie has further served on the Remuneration Committee since January 2020.\n\nFor the Non-Executive Director for Employee Engagement, Dame Elish brings rich experience in assimilating and interpreting views across a multitude of settings, and is skilled in concluding and communicating any required course of action. This speaks to the core purpose of having a dedicated employee-Board link and a desire to operate in an empathetic and thoughtful way.\n\n## Talent capability and development\n\nSuccession for senior leadership roles and strategy to support talent development by building capability for the future, is overseen by the Committee with support from Group HR.\n\nOn succession, at least annually, the Committee reviews the existing internal pipeline of candidates for immediate and medium to longer term movement into key leadership and functional roles. This is subject to routine challenge to ensure understanding of the breadth of internal potential and experience represented by external talent pools. In 2021/22, enhanced detail was provided on the Business Unit approach to strengthening leadership teams, and the Committee and Board remained updated on the processes resulting in the appointment of Stephen Wheeler as MD, SSE Renewables from 1 January 2022 and Catherine Raw as MD, SSE Thermal from 21 April 2022.\n\nOn talent and capability, updates are provided on: critical skills investment; people development; and performance improvement, which are centred on an agreed set of leadership capabilities and competencies required for SSE's long-term growth. In the context of SSE's Net Zero Acceleration Programme, emphasis has been placed on commercial expertise, project delivery, digital, data, and the international context, with these endorsed as key areas for benchmarking and developing through SSE's structured training interventions.\n\nMembers of the Committee engage in core talent programmes providing exposure to the talent pool and allowing reciprocal sharing of experiences, with diversity across training cohorts monitored in the approach to encouraging and progressing difference.\n\nAdditional engagement with future leaders is facilitated through presentations at Board meetings, business-led sessions and conferences which the Directors are invited to attend. The open two-way dialogue between the Board and all levels of the organisation is seen as a key tool for observing and informally coaching emerging talent.\n\nAs agreed in 2020/21, to support increased constructive discussion and measurement of SSE's position, a stepped plan of work comprising a refresh of SSE's Leadership Blueprint; agreement of an enterprise leadership profile; and an externally-led leadership development review, have been subject to Committee oversight and reflection. The outputs remain an area of focus to agree strengths and shape future talent work.",

Its objective is to set a Board-led culture which is inclusive to all views, perspectives and experiences, and which embraces and encourages diversity as a norm. Across Board membership, the Policy drives balance and alignment with SSE's purpose, strategy and values, through\n\nagreed principles and targets which reflect the measures the Board will take when considering its own membership and approach.\n\nThrough review in 2021/22, the Committee recommended a number of updates to the Policy which are reflected opposite.\n\n## Senior leadership ambitions\n\nThe Committee is focussed on increasing the diversity of SSE's senior leadership population and pipelines, as championed by external initiatives such as the FTSE Women Leaders Review and Parker Review. To identify the levers for progress, close work has taken place with the Executive Directors and Group HR to develop targeted action, including revised and stretching ambitions. This represented\n\n## BOARD/hyphen.caseLEVEL PRINCIPAL DECISION SUPPORTING STRETCHING AND SELF/hyphen.caseLED AMBITIONS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What did the Nomination Committee consider?\n\nPriorities to create the environment, which will support SSE as a diverse and inclusive organisation, and realise progress across the senior leadership and talent population.\n\n## What did the Nomination Committee discuss?\n\n- \u00b7 Gender diversity progress across senior leadership and management populations in 2021/22, which had been subject to quarterly Group Executive Committee review.\n- \u00b7 The impact of attrition rates and internal vacancies to create opportunities for internal moves and hiring for difference.\n- \u00b7 Business Unit reporting of progress including agreed diversity priorities, and short and long-list diversity requirements.\n- \u00b7 Training to support success by going beyond policies and process, and through coaching people and challenging mindset.\n- \u00b7 Improvements in disclosure and data across the senior pool, to better understand SSE's position and monitor change.\n\n## What did the Nomination Committee approve?\n\nNew ambitions to monitor and report progress.\n\n- \u00b7 Increase the proportion of women within the Group Executive Committee and its direct reports to 40% by 2025 .\n- \u00b7 Increase female representation in SSE's wider Leadership Group , which covers around 900 employees, to 40% by 2030 .\n- \u00b7 Increase overall female representation across SSE to 33% by 2030\n\n.\n\n## What were the material stakeholder considerations?\n\n- \u00b7 Employee perspectives . The Board considered external feedback from candidates, external partners and directly from the employee voice on the inclusivity of SSE's approach and employer proposition (see page 138 \uf150 ) in order to understand material issues and assess if they were being addressed.\n- \u00b7 Societal expectations . As a large organisation that directly employs around 11,000 people and that serves communities and customers, reflecting wider societal expectations across the internal inclusion and diversity agenda supports sustainable and respectful business operations.\n- \u00b7 Driving real change . Impacted by a historically low baseline, diversity progress across the energy sector has been slower than other industries but change is taking place. Credible ambitions, clear focus and transparent actions, are key to creating the balance which is required and to change sector bias surrounding the accessibility of roles.\n\n## Link to 2030 Business Goal\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChampion a fair and just energy transition\n\na Board-level principal decision in the period and is discussed further below.\n\n## Supporting wider initiatives\n\nComprehensive updates have continued to cover the evolution of SSE's Group-wide inclusion and diversity approach, and the factors influencing the choice of targeted initiatives alongside the extent to which they have been embedded across SSE. Diversity scorecards detail the split of diversity criteria including gender, ethnicity and disability within recruitment processes for apprentices through to senior leaders, and also across the overall employee, new entrant and leaver populations.

This report is intended to provide shareholders with an understanding of the work we have done to provide assurance on the integrity of the Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022. Much of the work of the Committee is necessarily targeted around the key areas of financial reporting, external audit, internal audit, internal control and risk management, all of which is underpinned by a robust governance framework.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee discussed the proposed disclosures and assurance programme to enable the Group to report against the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures recommendations as described on pages 42 to 55 \uf150 . Given the increased focus and scrutiny on climate from investors, we reviewed climate risk considerations to ensure they were reported on throughout the Annual Report and Financial Statements on a consistent basis. For the first time this year, a climate consideration section is included with the Auditors' Opinion on page 339 \uf150 .\n\nDuring the year, the Committee considered the BEIS consultation on 'Restoring Trust in Audit and Corporate Governance' and assisted the Board in formulating a position on the key issues for inclusion in SSE's consultation response.\n\nAt each meeting, we received an update on the audit and governance reform agenda, in addition to the project to further\n\nstrengthen the internal control framework and its effectiveness. As part of this project, we undertook a benchmarking exercise against current controls with support from an external adviser. The output of this exercise was used to develop a comprehensive roadmap and implementation plan which the Committee regularly oversees. The Committee will continue to review preparations for anticipated reform during the year ahead.\n\nCyber security remains a major focus area for the Committee. The Director of IT and the Chief Information Security Officer are regularly invited to meetings to give an assessment of cyber risk and update on progress made in protecting the Group against evolving threats.\n\nAs part of the Committee's work to support the refinement of an integrated assurance model across the Group, the Committee reviewed a draft of an Audit and Assurance Policy which is in the process of being developed for internal and external publication.\n\nThe year ahead will no doubt continue to bring challenges and opportunities, but the Net Zero Acceleration Programme gives us a clear sense of direction and the work of the Committee will remain fully aligned with the strategic direction of SSE.\n\nI hope that you find this report informative and take assurance from the work undertaken by the Committee during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeter Lynas Chair of the Audit Committee 24 May 2022\n\n## Role of the Committee Financial reporting\n\n- \u00b7 Review the integrity of the interim and annual Financial Statements.\n- \u00b7 Review the appropriateness of accounting policies and practices.\n- \u00b7 Review the significant financial judgements and estimates considered in relation to the Financial Statements, including how each was addressed.\n- \u00b7 Review the content of the Annual Report and Accounts and advise the Board on whether taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced and understandable.\n\n## External audit\n\n- \u00b7 Review and monitor the objectivity and independence of the External Auditor, and oversee the policy on the provision of Non-Audit Services.\n- \u00b7 Review and monitor the effectiveness of the external audit process and the ongoing relationship with the External Auditor.\n- \u00b7 Review and make recommendations to the Board on the tendering of the external audit contract, and the appointment, remuneration and terms of engagement of the External Auditor.\n\n## Internal audit\n\n- \u00b7 Review and approve the Internal Audit Plan and monitor its implementation.\n- \u00b7 Review and monitor the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function, including the adequacy of the overall Internal Audit resource.\n\n## Internal control and risk management\n\n- \u00b7 Review and monitor the effectiveness of the management of risk and overall System of Internal Control.\n- \u00b7 Review the framework and analysis to support both the Going Concern and the long-term Viability Statement.\n\nThe Committee's Terms of Reference are available on sse.com \uf295 .",

        "page_content": "## Key activities in 2021/22\n\nThe Committee has a structured forward looking planner to reflect the Group's annual financial reporting cycle. The planner informs the business considered at each meeting and is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect areas identified for additional focus. The practice of effective governance and quality reporting underpin all aspects of the work of the Committee. The key areas of focus in the year included:\n\n- \u00b7 Assessing the impact of climate change on accounting assumptions and disclosure, including the reporting of TCFD recommendations.\n- \u00b7 Overseeing a project to enhance the internal control framework for financial reporting influenced by the audit and governance reform.\n- \u00b7 Developing the approach to integrated assurance across the Group.\n- \u00b7 Assessing the Company's readiness and future areas of focus required to address areas of anticipated audit and corporate governance change.\n\n## Committee membership\n\nThe composition of the Committee is compliant with the Code and currently comprises four independent non-Executive Directors as Committee members. Debbie Crosbie became a member of the Audit Committee on 23 February 2022 and brings broad financial and commercial experience to the Committee. Peter Lynas has chaired the Committee since 2014 and is considered by the Board to have recent and relevant financial experience. He was Group Finance Director of BAE Systems plc until 31 March 2020 and is a Fellow of the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants. The Board considers the Audit Committee as a whole has competence relevant to the sector, with two members having had significant executive roles in the energy sector, and all members possessing an appropriate level of experience in corporate financial matters. Biographical details of the Audit Committee members can be found on pages 118 to 122 \uf150 and details of meeting attendance are set out on page 125 \uf150 .\n\n## Committee evaluation\n\nThe actions identified from the evaluation of the Audit Committee in 2020/21 as reported on last year were monitored through to completion. The evaluation of the Audit Committee during 2021/22 was externally facilitated by Lintstock and was based around a bespoke questionnaire and interviews with members of the Committee. The output of the evaluation was considered at the Board in March and follow-up actions were agreed at the Committee meeting in May 2022. The Board confirmed the effective operation of the Audit Committee in discharging its responsibilities.\n\n## Evaluation confirmed\n\nActions to progress during 2022/23\n\n- \u00b7 Meetings are chaired effectively, dedicating sufficient time to key issues, and giving all members the opportunity to contribute.\n- \u00b7 The quality of information to support the Committee in discharging its responsibilities was rated positively.\n- \u00b7 The oversight of new developments such as TCFD and internal control over financial reporting received strong coverage.\n- \u00b7 Ensuring a smooth transition of Audit Committee Chair.\n- \u00b7 Supporting developments to enhance the approach to risk management.\n\n## Meetings\n\nThe Committee met on four occasions during the year and has met once since the end of the financial year. Before each meeting, the Committee Chair meets with the Finance Director and External Auditor to ensure there is a shared understanding of the key issues to be discussed. Committee meetings are held in advance of Board meetings to facilitate an effective and timely reporting process. The Committee Chair provides a report to the Board following each meeting.\n\nMeetings are routinely attended by: the Chair of the Board; the Finance Director; the Director of Group Risk and Audit; Partners from the External Auditor; and the Deputy Company Secretary (who is Secretary to the Committee). Senior finance and business managers are invited to attend certain meetings to enable the Committee to gain a deeper level of insight on particular items of business. The Committee meets with the External Auditor privately at least twice each year in line with the financial reporting calendar and also with the Director of Group Risk and Audit. These engagements provide an additional opportunity for open dialogue and feedback without management being present.\n\nIn addition to the scheduled meetings, the Committee Chair meets separately with the Finance Director, Director of Group Risk and Audit, External Auditor and Committee Secretary to ensure the work of the Committee is focused on key and emerging issues.\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable assurance framework\n\nThe assurance framework used in the preparation of the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts to assist the Directors in the discharge of their requirement to state that, taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company's performance, business model and strategy is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 a verification process dealing with the factual content;\n- \u00b7 comprehensive reviews undertaken independently by senior management to consider messaging and balance;\n- \u00b7 comprehensive reviews undertaken by the Company's Brokers to ensure consistency and balance;\n- \u00b7 reporting by the External Auditor of any material inconsistencies; and\n- \u00b7 comprehensive review by the Directors and the senior management team.\n\nThe Committee and Board received confirmation from management that the assurance framework had been adhered to for the preparation of the 2022 Annual Report.",

        "page_content": "## Audit, risk and internal control continued Audit Committee Report continued\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nThe Annual Report and Accounts seek to provide the information necessary to enable an assessment of SSE's position and performance, business model and strategy. In preparing the Financial Statements for 2022 there are several areas requiring the exercise of judgement or a high degree of estimation.\n\nThroughout the year, the Finance team worked closely with the External Auditor to ensure SSE provides the required level of disclosure, including the appropriateness of alternative performance measures (APMs) and their consistency with IFRS financial information. This section outlines the significant areas of judgement that have been considered by the Committee through discussion and detailed reporting by both management and the External Auditor - to ensure appropriate rigour has been applied. Other key accounting judgements and areas of estimation uncertainty applied in the preparation of the Financial Statements for 2022 are provided in notes 4.2 and 4.3.\n\nThe Independent Auditor's Report on pages 336 to 346 \uf150 sets out the audit approach and highlights the other key audit matters that EY drew to the attention of the Audit Committee. These areas of audit focus include: going concern; decommissioning provisions; provisions and claims; customer debtor recoverability; Supplier of Last Resort; carrying value of tangible and intangible assets; taxation judgements; exceptional items and APMs; recoverability of \u00a3100m Ovo loan note; ROCs recycle price; contingent consideration; and segmental reporting.\n\n## Significant financial judgements and estimates\n\nIn the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, management necessarily makes judgements and estimates that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements. In consultation with the External Auditor, the Committee reviewed the significant financial judgement areas and identified five specific areas for 2021/22, an increase of one significant financial judgement areas from the prior year. Accounting for the SSE disposal programme, an area of accounting judgement and estimation uncertainty reported on last year, was no longer considered by the Committee to be a significant financial judgement at the year-end. Due to recent market volatility, management has recognised a provision for expected credit loss in relation to the recoverability of \u00a3100m loan note due from Ovo Energy Limited following the disposal of SSE Energy Services on 15 January 2020. The assessment of the value of the loan in now considered by the Committee to be a significant financial judgement. In addition, the impact of climate change and the transition to net zero has been included as a significant financial judgement this year.\n\nThe Group's most significant financial judgement areas, some of which are also areas of estimation uncertainty, are explained below. For each of these areas the Committee considered the key facts and judgements outlined by management, and requested the External Auditor to provide a professional view on whether the judgements are appropriate. The Committee specifically discussed with the External Auditor how management's judgement and assertions were challenged and how professional scepticism was demonstrated during their audit of these areas. This also included the adequacy of the disclosures within the Financial Statements.\n\n## Going Concern and Viability Statement\n\nThe Committee reviewed the information to support the assessment and disclosure of the Going Concern Statement prior to Board approval (see A6.3 Accompanying Information to the Financial Statements). Given the cash surplus of \u00a31.0bn at 31 March 2022; the undrawn committed borrowing facilities of \u00a31.5bn maintained by the Group; the current commercial paper market conditions, with \u00a3507m outstanding at 31 March 2022; and the assumption the Group will be able to refinance maturing debt, the Directors have concluded that both the Group and SSE plc as Parent Company have sufficient headroom to continue as a going concern. In coming to this conclusion, the Directors have considered sensitivities on future cashflow projections resulting from the Group's credit rating; the success of the Group's disposal programme through 2020/21 and 2021/22; and the successful issuance of \u00a32.5bn of medium to long-term debt and hybrid equity during the financial year 2020/21, along with \u00a31.2bn of longterm debt and hybrid equity since the March 2022 financial year end. In the very unlikely event of not being able to access the revolving credit facility or otherwise refinance as may be required, the Group's options include deferring uncommitted capex and implementing further cost reductions. The Financial Statements are therefore prepared on a going concern basis.\n\nThe Committee agreed the parameters and reviewed the supporting report for the Board's assessment of the prospects of the Company which is covered in the Viability Statement on page 70 \uf150 . In doing so, the Committee considered the Net Zero Acceleration Programme which includes a fully funded capital investment programme to 2026 and as such, the viability period has been extended to four years.\n\n| Significant financial judgements and   estimates for the year ended 31 March 2022   | How those were addressed by the Audit Committee                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Retirement benefit obligations (Estimation Uncertainty)                             | Retirement benefit obligations (Estimation Uncertainty)                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| The assumptions in relation to the cost of providing post-retirement                | The assets and liabilities of the Group's defined benefit retirement schemes                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| benefits during the period are based on the Group's best estimates and are          | are regularly reviewed.

        "page_content": "## Significant financial judgements and estimates for the year ended 31 March 2022\n\n## How those were addressed by the Audit Committee\n\n## Impairment testing and valuation of certain non-current assets (Financial judgement and estimation uncertainty)\n\nThe Group reviews the carrying amounts of its goodwill, other intangible assets and specific property, plant, equipment and investment assets to determine whether any impairment or reversal of impairment of the carrying value of those assets requires to be recorded. The specific assets under review in the year ended 31 March 2022 are intangible development assets and specific property, plant and equipment assets related to gas storage and thermal power generation. In addition, the Group performed an impairment review over the carrying value of its investment in Neos Networks Limited. In conducting its reviews, the Group makes judgements and estimates in considering both the level of cash generating unit (CGU) at which common assets such as goodwill are assessed against, as well as the estimates and assumptions behind the calculation of recoverable amount of the respective assets or CGUs. Changes to the estimates and assumptions arising from factors such as regulation and legislation changes (including climate change related regulation), power, gas, carbon and other commodity prices, volatility of gas prices, plant running regimes and load factors, discount rates and other inputs could impact the assessed recoverable value of assets and CGUs and consequently impact the Group's income statement and balance sheet.\n\nAn annual valuation/impairment exercise is carried out and the basis and outcome of this review is presented to the Committee by management and includes a description of the assumptions applied in deriving the recoverable values. The Committee reviewed and challenged the assumptions and projections presented in the management paper and considered the detailed reporting from, and findings by, the External Auditor. Further detail of the calculation basis and key assumptions used in the impairment review, the resulting impairment charges and reversals, and the sensitivity of this assessment to key assumptions is disclosed at note 15. Detail on the accounting policies applied is included in the Accompanying Information section A1. Following this review, the Committee supported the recommendation to recognise an impairment reversal in the financial year of \u00a3331.6m in relation to thermal assets (Peterhead, Keady, Medway, Marchwood and Great Island) and \u00a397.3m in relation to gas storage assets. In addition, the Committee supported the recommendation to recognise an impairment of \u00a3106.9m in relation to its remaining interest in Neos Networks Limited.\n\n## Revenue recognition - customers unbilled supply of energy /uni00A0(Estimation uncertainty)\n\nRevenue from energy supply activities undertaken by the Business Energy and Airtricity businesses includes an estimate of the value of electricity or gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end. This estimation comprises both billed revenue (disclosed as trade receivables) and unbilled revenue (disclosed as accrued income) and is calculated based on applying the tariffs and contract rates applicable to customers against estimated customer consumption and taking account of various factors including usage patterns, weather trends and externally notified aggregated volumes supplied to customers from national settlements bodies. A change in the assumptions underpinning the calculation would have an impact on the amount of revenue recognised in any given period.\n\nThis estimation is subject to a process which compares calculated unbilled volumes to a theoretical 'perfect billing' benchmark measure of unbilled volumes (in GWh and millions of therms) derived from historical weatheradjusted consumption patterns and aggregated metering data used in industry reconciliation processes. Furthermore, actual meter readings and billings continue to be compared to unbilled estimates between the balance sheet date and the finalisation of the Financial Statements. The Committee reviewed the practical process issues and assumptions applied in determining the estimation uncertainty and considered the findings of the External Auditor. Following this review, the Committee supported the estimate for revenue recognition from energy supply activities. Further details of the sensitivity associated with this judgement is disclosed at note 18.\n\n## Impact of climate change and transition to net zero (Financial judgement and estimation uncertainty)\n\nTo fulfil SSE's strategy, its Net Zero Acceleration Programme which is a clearly articulated response to climate change, will drive SSE's capital investment and financial activity in both the short and medium term. With Audit Committee oversight, in 2021/22 SSE enhanced the governance and elevated its response to the recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) which involve, among other requirements, financial impact assessment of the Group's identified climate-related risks and opportunities, which are disclosed on pages 42 to 55 \uf150 , and the impact of climate change on the Group's accounting policies and financial valuations.\n\nThe process which the Group adopted in relation to identification and quantification of its climate-related risks and opportunities is explained at Page 49 \uf150 along with the governance processes established to oversee and approve the associated reporting. The Audit Committee reviewed the approach adopted by the TCFD Steering Group in relation to this matter and was also briefed by the External Auditor, EY, on the audit requirements associated with the adoption of the TCFD including the need for consistency of disclosure throughout the Annual Report and the technical basis for those disclosures. Following presentation of the proposed disclosures and the report of the external auditor on SSE's approach to the adoption project, the Committee approved the basis of reporting and the related financial judgement disclosures included throughout the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2022.\n\n## Disposal programme and valuation of other receivables (Financial judgement and estimation uncertainty)\n\nWith the disposal of its investment in SGN in March 2022, the Group's strategic disposal programme came to an end. There had been significant judgement around certain of the accounting issues associated with the disposal during the year, including the timing of the investment being 'held for sale' and the treatment of the investment as a discontinued operation. At March 2022, the most significant financial judgement associated with the disposal programme was the recoverability of the Group's \u00a3100m loan note due from Ovo Energy Limited following the disposal of SSE Energy Services on 15 January 2020. The loan carries interest at 13.25% and is presented cumulative of accrued interest payments, discounted at 13.25%. Due to recent market volatility, the Group's assessment of the value of the loan note is now considered a more significant financial judgement. While the carrying value is considered to be appropriate, changes in economic conditions could lead to a change in the level of expected credit loss incurred by the Group.\n\nThe Audit Committee considered the accounting judgements associated with the disposal programme throughout the year and reviewed the accounting for the gains and losses recognised and other judgements associated with consideration elements, timing and presentation. The Committee also considered the steps applied by management in making its assessment of the significant financial judgements associated with the Ovo loan note. Management has assessed the recoverability of the loan based on publicly available financial information, the established SSE methodology for considering relevant credit default spreads, knowledge of the business and made direct enquiries to Ovo Energy Limited management. The External Auditor explained the work carried out to corroborate and challenge the position taken by management on all judgmental matters and the audit work carried out to validate the accounting associated with the disposals in the year.",

The Policy was reviewed by the Committee during the year to ensure that it remained fit for purpose and aligned to the FRC's whitelist of Permitted AuditRelated and Non-Audit Services. In addition, SSE is required to cap the level of non-audit fees paid to its External Auditor at 70% of the average audit fees paid in the previous three consecutive financial years. Services provided by the External Auditor are split into two categories for the purposes of approval:\n\n- \u00b7 Audit-Related Services. These services are largely carried out by members of the audit engagement team. The work\n\n## External Auditor fees\n\nThe Committee considered the audit fee proposal for the year to 31 March 2022 at its meetings in September 2021 and agreed the fee at its meeting in November 2021. The factors driving the increase in the level of fees over the last three years were discussed with the External Auditor. The impact of increasing regulatory requirements, changes in the business and composition of the Group and the level of complexity requiring an increased proportion of specialist resource were amongst some of the factors taken into consideration by the Committee when agreeing fair commercial arrangements with the External Auditor. The Committee keeps under review the services provided by the External Auditor by reviewing a fee report at each meeting.\n\nNon-Audit Services amounted to \u00a30.1m and principally related to regulatory accounts and returns required by Ofgem and comfort letters in connection with funding and debt issuance. The Committee was satisfied that the work was best handled by the External Auditor because of its knowledge of the Group and the services provided did not give rise to threats to independence. All Non-Audit Services were approved in accordance with the Non-Audit Services Policy and adhere to the FRC Ethical Standard. Fees paid to EY during the year are made in note 6 to the Financial Statements.\n\ninvolved is closely related to the work performed in the audit and the threats to auditor independence are 'clearly insignificant'. Such engagements are routinely pre-approved by the Audit Committee as part of their approval of the total annual audit fee. Before engaging in any work of this type, approval is required from the Finance Director.\n\n- \u00b7 Non-Audit Services. These are services other than 'Audit-Related Services' for which the External Auditor is an appropriate provider. The threats to independence arising from such services are not necessarily 'clearly insignificant' and the Committee and External Auditor must consider the threats to independence and whether any safeguards should be applied. In\n\nthe absence of any apparent threat to auditor independence, approval for the provision of any Non-Audit Service must be obtained from the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has pre-approved the use of the External Auditor for whitelist Non-Audit Services subject to the following limits: The Finance Director up to \u00a350,000 and Audit Committee Chair up to \u00a3100,000.\n\n## EXTERNAL AUDITOR FEES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAudit and Audit-Related Services\n\nNon-Audit Services\n\n## Re-appointment of the External Auditor\n\nThe external audit contract will be put out to tender at least every 10 years and will be conducted by no later than 2029 in line with prevailing best practice. The Committee confirms ongoing compliance with the Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.\n\nThe Committee concluded that it is satisfied with the objectivity and independence of the External Auditor, and that the effectiveness of the external audit process delivered by EY was robust. The Committee proposed to the Board that it seek shareholder approval for the re-appointment of EY for the financial year ending 31 March 2023.",

Internal Audit, led by the Director of Group Risk and Audit, reports to the Committee and functionally to the Finance Director. The purpose, scope and authority of Internal Audit is defined within its charter which is approved annually by the Committee.\n\nIn fulfilling its role, Internal Audit seeks to add value by encouraging continual improvement in the effectiveness of business planning, operations and systems, promoting wherever possible enhancements to internal control processes, and seeking to embed 'best practice' throughout the SSE Group.\n\nAt each Committee meeting, an update on Internal Audit is provided covering an overview of the work undertaken in the period, actions arising from audits conducted, the tracking of remedial actions, and progress against the Internal Audit Plan. The Committee routinely meets independently with the Director of Group Risk and Audit to discuss the results of the audits performed and any additional insights obtained on the risk management and control environment across the organisation.\n\nthe Director of Group Risk and Audit who joined SSE in early 2020. The Committee received an update with an overview of the strategic objectives for the function and supported the objective to strengthen the skills and experience of the team.\n\n## Internal control and risk management\n\n## Internal control\n\nThe Board has delegated to the Committee responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of SSE's System of Internal Control. This covers all material controls including financial and compliance controls, in addition to the financial reporting process. Internal control and risk management in relation to SSE's energy market related exposures are overseen by the Energy Markets Risk Committee and further information can be found on pages 162 to 163 \uf150 .\n\nDuring the year, the Committee received an update at each meeting from the project team established to assess and strengthen the financial reporting control environment in anticipation of a SOX style framework being introduced in the UK. The timing of the implementation legislation remains unclear, however, management has continued to monitor regulatory developments and provide regular updates to the Committee.\n\nTo assist the Committee's review of the System of Internal Control, the different elements are evaluated by relevant key stakeholders.\n\n## Internal Audit Plan\n\nThe Internal Audit Plan is structured to align with SSE's operating model, risk profile, control environment and assurance arrangements. The Internal Audit Plan is split between a one-year plan and a three-year strategy setting out the broader areas of Internal Audit focus, together with the vision and resource for the function. External providers may be engaged to support delivery of the Internal Audit plan where specific skills and expertise require to be co-sourced. An integrated assurance mapping and planning process is undertaken to ensure that Internal Audit work is appropriately aligned to, and coordinated with, the activities of other relevant assurance providers across the Group. The Plan includes audits of key transformational programmes, financial control and areas relating to responsible behaviour and non-financial risk.\n\n## Internal Audit effectiveness\n\nThe Committee keeps under review and assesses the independence and effectiveness of Internal Audit by adopting the process outlined below.\n\nThe assessment considered Internal Audit's positioning within the organisation and the quality of its planning and operational procedures. The assessment incorporated a survey of Internal Audit's stakeholders across the Group, along with a review of outputs from a number of recent internal audits. During the year, a review of the Internal Audit function was carried out by\n\n## Effectiveness of Internal Audit\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Outcome\n\nFollowing consideration of all elements of the review, the Committee recognised the progress made during the year and confirmed it was satisfied with the overall performance of the Internal Audit function. The key areas of focus for 2022/23 include: recalibrating the Internal Audit function to adopt leading practices through digital, technology and data analytics; implementation of a people based strategy that can support talent, career development and succession; and an enhanced approach to identification, management and mitigation of risk.",

These assurance evaluations consider each framework of the system of internal control form a Business Unit perspective and include any planned improvements to enhance controls. These improvements are tracked, with updates reported to the executive-level Group Risk Committee on a regular basis.\n\n## System of Internal Control\n\nThe elements that make up the System of Internal Control are:\n\n- \u00b7 Governance Framework. Designed to ensure focus on the key components of high quality and effective decision making - clarity, accountability, transparency and efficiency.

This includes Group's strategic objectives, financial objective and sustainability goals and forms the basis for all activity within the Risk Management Framework.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Group's Risk Management Framework is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. It can only therefore provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. In addition to the ongoing review of emerging risks, the Board carried out a robust assessment of the Principal Risks facing the Group, being those that have the potential to threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. Further details of the Group Principal Risks are set out on pages 71 to 81 \uf150 .\n\nFor further details please see pages 2 to 5 \uf150 of the Strategic Report.\n\n- \u00b7 Risk Management Framework. This framework supports each Business Unit in managing its risks and helps to ensure that the Board can meet its obligations.

As market conditions change, SSE may be required to vary its hedging approach to take account of any resultant new or additional exposures. SSE will continue to provide a summary of its current hedging approach, including details of any changes in the period, within its Half and Full-year Results Statements. Detail's of SSE's latest hedging approach and hedging position are set out on pages 88 to 89 \uf150 .\n\nDear Shareholder,\n\nThis report aims to give insight into how the Energy Markets Risk Committee (EMRC) operates, provide an outline of our activities, and to summarise the role we have played in overseeing SSE's energy markets risk exposures and ensuring the effectiveness of related risk management, controls and processes, for the year ending 31 March 2022.\n\nOur main responsibility is to oversee governance arrangements, which provide transparency surrounding SSE's approach to managing commodity price exposures. Reports of these exposures are reviewed and discussed at each EMRC meeting. When required, actions are recommended to the Board for approval, including any changes to SSE's hedging approach.\n\nRecently, we have overseen SSE Renewables' continued assessment of its approach to hedging, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Further refinement, where appropriate, of the use of equivalent gas and carbon trades as a replacement for power trades along the forward curve. This aims to both optimise the hedge prices achieved and reduce the exposure of SSE's wind assets to volatile spot power market outcomes, while still providing a hedge for most of the anticipated energy and carbon commodity price exposure.\n- \u00b7 Ongoing assessment of market conditions to optimise hedging outcomes. This has included an increase in SSE Renewables' position against its target hedge volume for financial year 2024/25, in response to continued high prices and observed volatility in energy markets.\n\nI would like to highlight that during the year, despite the historically high and volatile prices seen on energy markets, SSE was served well by its measured hedging approach and successfully managed any increasing credit and collateral requirements. As a committee, we will continue to monitor and oversee these exposures, and should circumstances lead to any change in approach being required, these will be fully discussed, challenged and appropriately reported in\n\nSSE's Half and Full-year Results statements. For further details of SSE's latest hedging approach and hedging position see pages 88 to 89 \uf150 .\n\nTo enhance the internal control and risk management approach in relation to energy markets, a Group Energy Markets Exposure Risk Committee was established in 2021/22, to provide a forum for SSE's senior management to discuss and consider energy market risks and exposures monthly. This forum reports to the Group Executive Committee and minutes of meetings are provided to the EMRC for review and comment.\n\nAcross the period, we continued to monitor the coronavirus pandemic receiving regular updates on its economic consequences and energy market related impacts. This included reports and minutes from the Group-level Demand Management Committee, which was set up to monitor the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on SSE Business Energy's and SSE Airtricity's customer demand profile.\n\nFor the year ahead, the main priority for the EMRC is to continue its oversight role in relation to SSE's energy markets risks and exposures. Given the ever-changing external environment, we will provide particular focus to the impact, management, and mitigation of relevant macroeconomic and geopolitical events. This will include the impact of a prolonged or an escalated conflict between Ukraine and Russia and its influence on energy market prices and volatility.\n\nI hope you find this report informative and reflective of the activities undertaken by the EMRC during 2021/22.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTony Cocker Chair of the EMRC 24 May 2022",

Full details of membership and meeting attendance are set out on page 125 \uf150 . The Chief Executive and the Managing Director, Energy Portfolio Management also routinely attend meetings, with an Assistant Company Secretary acting as Secretary to the EMRC. To assist the EMRC in carrying out its responsibilities, relevant senior managers can be invited to attend to present certain items of business and provide additional levels of insight.\n\nThe EMRC membership is approved by the Board following recommendation of the Nomination Committee. In line with new appointments to the SSE Board, the EMRC membership was reviewed during the year with Debbie Crosbie becoming a member from the February 2022 meeting. This change continues to enhance the skills\n\nand expertise across the EMRC's membership, ensuring it is able to effectively discharge its duties. Upon joining, Debbie Crosbie was provided with a committee induction by senior managers which covered the key focus areas of the EMRC.\n\nThe composition of the EMRC allows for the utilisation of the relevant experience held by the non-Executive Directors. As EMRC Chair, Tony Cocker brings extensive knowledge from his career in the energy industry, Debbie Crosbie, Melanie Smith and Sir John Manzoni, provide invaluable insights and a wealth of knowledge from various senior roles in the private and public sectors. Biographical information of the EMRC members' backgrounds and experience is contained on pages 118 to 122 \uf150 .\n\n## Meetings and focus areas in 2021/22\n\nThe EMRC held four scheduled meetings in 2021/22, and one additional meeting to receive a report on the market volatility seen in Winter 2021. After each meeting, the Committee Chair reports to the Board on its work. Meeting agendas are informed by a forward plan of business, which is designed to ensure the EMRC carries out its responsibilities in line with its Terms of Reference. In addition, and outside of the cycle of scheduled meetings, the EMRC Chair meets with the Chief Commercial Officer, Managing Director, Energy Portfolio Management, and the Committee Secretary to ensure that key and emerging issues are brought to the EMRC's attention in a timely manner.\n\n## Committee evaluation\n\nThe annual review of Committee performance for 2021/22 was considered through the formal external Board evaluation conducted by Lintstock (see pages 143 to 144 \uf150 ). The evaluation rated the performance of the EMRC and the Chair highly. It also indicated that the EMRC is operating effectively, and continues to provide appropriate challenge and oversight of the areas within its remit. The evaluation also identified that to continue to adapt to the focus of the demands of the business and environment in which the EMRC operates, the agenda and business planner should continue to be kept under review to ensure material issues and developments were being discussed at each EMRC meeting.\n\nThe EMRC continues to develop and regularly review its forward plan of business, to capture any emerging issues and risks to SSE arising from energy markets.\n\nDetails of the key focus areas and action taken in the year are set out below.\n\n## Key EMRC focus areas in 2021/22\n\n| Overseeing SSE's   hedging approach                     | \u00b7          | \u00b7  As part of a quarterly report on Energy Markets Risk, monitored: - hedging arrangements; - risk control metrics; - Energy Portfolio Management's counterparty credit risk exposures; and - the liquidity of energy markets. \u00b7  Reviewed and endorsed the hedging approach and position on 31 March 2022 included in the Full-Year  Preliminary Results Statement and Annual Report 2022.   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Energy Markets Risks                                    |            | Received reports on emerging energy market issues and risks (for example in relation to volatile gas markets  due to the tension, and then ongoing conflict, between Russia and Ukraine) and recommended relevant  changes to risk management arrangements, in line with SSE's hedging approach, to the Board.                                                                                |\n| Energy Markets Risks                                    | \u00b7          | Considered a report on key energy market risks, risk appetites and risk management controls and governance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Energy Markets Risks                                    | \u00b7          | Received reports on reviews of GB and ROI energy markets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Internal Control and Risk Management relating to Energy | \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7 | Considered a report on the key risks and controls arising from operations within Energy Portfolio Management.

The purpose of this Report is to explain the work of the SSHEAC during the year, alongside the progress that has been made in relation to safety, sustainability, health and wellbeing, and the environment. A more in-depth review of these areas, together with a range of other ESG reporting can be found on pages 40 to 67 \uf150 and in SSE's Sustainability Report 2022 which is available on sse.com \uf295 .\n\nOur Safety Family licence, 'If it's not safe, we don't do it' and genuine drive to take care of ourselves and each other has helped many navigate their way through the coronavirus pandemic. Now, as we move into a 'new normal', we have spent time reviewing our SHE strategy for the next five years. There was evidence that SSE's SHE engagement programmes continue to drive improved SHE performance, and 'We all get home safe' provides a measurable goal to aim for. Moving forward, the engagement and activity across the organisation will therefore build on the progress made with added focus around the SHE strategy aim of 'making it easier to do the right thing'.\n\nWe're proud to provide our people with the tools and flexibility they need to balance work and life. As coronavirus restrictions have eased, we have seen our colleagues returning to offices and we have also been able to resume the programme of physical site visits. Across this transition, we have been exploring technology to establish how we can better support our employees. Apart from investing significantly in the platforms for agile working, extensive digital resources have been developed to support the wellbeing of our colleagues. The Company has reviewed mental health and wellbeing programmes, trained some of our colleagues as Mental Health First Aiders and supported the 'Time to Change' initiative - a commitment to change how we think and act about mental health at SSE.\n\nSSE was proud to be a Principal Partner of COP26 in Glasgow and the event was powered by 100% renewable energy generated by SSE's Griffin Wind Farm in Perthshire. SSE also became the first company to publish a Just Transition Strategy in November 2020, this will help to guide our decision-making and influence greater fairness for those impacted by the decline of high-carbon economic activity and increase the opportunities of climate action. This was followed in September 2021 by a report focused on moving from just transition principles to action. In November 2021, SSE announced an ambitious \u00a312.5bn capital investment plan which will accelerate progress towards net zero over the five years to 2026, the majority of which will go to low-carbon infrastructure.\n\nTo support ongoing engagement with shareholders on climate-related issues, the Board has proposed a resolution, within the business of the Annual General Meeting 2022, that will allow shareholders to vote on SSE's first Net Zero Transition Report. The Report is based on our Net Zero Transition Plan which was published in March 2022. The aim of the Plan is to provide SSE's stakeholders with clarity around the actions SSE intends to take towards achieving its net zero ambitions in both 2040 and 2050. The Net Zero Transition Plan is available on sse.com \uf295 .\n\nOn behalf of the SSHEAC, I would like to thank all employees and those that work with SSE for their sustained effort, hard work and commitment. I would also like to welcome Dame Elish Angiolini and Martin Pibworth who were appointed as new members of the Committee in the year.\n\nI hope you find the following report a useful explanation of our work and of SHE performance during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHelen Mahy CBE Chair of the SSHEAC 24 May 2022",

An Assistant Company Secretary is Secretary to the Committee and the Chief Executive routinely attends meetings. The Committee invites operational managers and specialists to attend certain meetings to gain a deeper level of insight on particular items of business. Biographical details of the non-Executive members can be found on pages 118 to 122 \uf150 and details of nonExecutive meeting attendance are set out on page 125 \uf150 . During the year, a number of changes to the Board and executive membership of the Committee were considered by the Nomination Committee and subsequently agreed by the Board. The detail of these changes are set out on page 149 \uf150 .\n\n## Meetings and focus areas in 2021/22\n\nThe SSHEAC met four times in 2021/22. Working closely with the Group Safety, Health and Environment Committee (which reports to the Group Executive Committee), the SSHEAC has an annual work plan to: review SHE performance at Group-level and in each of SSE's seven business areas; consider in-depth reviews of certain key topics such as contractor, asset and process safety; and review a range of SHE governance and assurance requirements. Other matters which the SSHEAC has focused on during the year include: SHE strategy; SHE targets; SHE engagement; the environment, including natural environment; occupational health and wellbeing; a review of the SHE Risk Matrix; fatigue management; and legislative and regulatory developments.\n\n## Committee evaluation\n\nThe actions identified from the evaluation of the SSHEAC in 2020/21 as reported on last year were monitored through to completion. A detailed review of the SSHEAC's remit was completed and its Terms of Reference updated accordingly. More information about the process can be found in this Report under Reform of the SSHEAC.\n\nThe annual review of Committee performance for 2021/22 was considered through the formal external Board evaluation conducted by Lintstock (see pages 143 to 144 \uf150 ). The output of the evaluation was considered at the Board in March, with follow-up actions agreed by the Committee for progression across 2022/23. The Board confirmed the effective operation of the Committee in discharging its responsibilities.\n\n## Evaluation themes\n\n## Actions for 2022/23\n\n- \u00b7 Good coverage of the key aspects of safety and environmental issues. The revised scope of the Committee enhanced oversight of ESG matters with a range of sustainability topics now being reviewed.\n- \u00b7 The SSE safety language was described as outstanding, and the Safety Conference in November 2021 demonstrated how well safety messages have been embedded.\n- \u00b7 The SSHEAC's contribution have supported and encouraged the ambition and direction of travel on safety, health and environmental matters.\n- \u00b7 Site visits. The continuation of site visits is a top priority.\n- \u00b7 Agenda. Develop an overall framework for the Committee's agenda, to promote a more holistic oversight of safety, health and wellbeing, the environment and sustainability.\n- \u00b7 Deep dives. Consider focused sessions on The Construction (Design and Management) Regulation, Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, carbon reductions plans and biodiversity.\n\nTo discharge its new responsibilities the SSHEAC also considered:\n\n- \u00b7 A climate adaptation and resilience review developed collaboratively by Group Sustainability, SSE's Weather and Thermal Environment teams, that looked at the effects of climate change on SSE's businesses and outlined the actions taken so far to support the consistency of climate adaptation reporting for the SSE Group.\n- \u00b7 An ESG performance review that summarised SSE's 2020/21 environmental, social and governance performance, as assessed by external ratings agencies and investor-led initiatives.\n- \u00b7 Prior to sign-off, the plan for SSE's Sustainability Report 2022 that reports on SSE's economic, social and environmental impacts.\n\n## Response to coronavirus\n\nSSE's over-riding priority through the coronavirus pandemic has been to provide the safe and reliable supply of electricity, at local, regional and national level, on which the people and organisations whose work is critical to the coronavirus response depends.\n\nTo ensure people across SSE continue to work safely, the Committee monitored the approach taken by the Company to pro-actively manage the evolving coronavirus position, and a range of processes, procedures and guidance were followed and widely communicated. At an early stage, SSE introduced coronavirus testing when needed for its critical workers and has worked closely with trade union partners throughout to extend flexible working practices, particularly for those with caring responsibilities. The priority remains continuing to take care of, and supporting employees.\n\nIn 2021/22, SSE launched its Flexible First employee guidelines which have been shaped by employee feedback. The guidelines are designed to harness the benefits of flexibility, balanced with the need to connect and work together in the most effective way. The SSHEAC acknowledges the well documented link between the pandemic and the impact on mental health, and the importance of making the return to work a pragmatic and positive journey.",

        "page_content": "## Audit, risk and internal control continued\n\n## Safety, Sustainability, Health and Environment Advisory Committee Report continued\n\n## Reform of the SSHEAC\n\nThe output from the 2020/21 performance evaluation of the Board and its Committees identified a need to evolve the scope and coverage of the SSHEAC, to assist the Board in its oversight of sustainability governance and assurance on a range of ESG topics. In support of this, the Board agreed a series of recommendations at its meeting in May 2021 to enhance the role of the renamed Safety, Sustainability, Health and Environment Advisory Committee. The key recommendations that were approved by the Board and which have impacted the work of Committee are summarised below.\n\n- \u00b7 Responsibilities . The responsibilities of the Committee were expanded to cover: (a.) a review of SSE's comparative ESG ratings performance; (b.) approval of the Sustainability Report; (c.) a review of the physical risks of climate change on SSE's activities with a focus on climate adaptation and resilience; and (d.) increased oversight of SSE's policy, practice and performance surrounding environmental impacts, including waste, air emissions, biodiversity and water consumption.\n- \u00b7 Committee name . The SHEAC was renamed the Safety, Sustainability, Health and Environment Advisory Committee (SSHEAC) to reflect its enhanced role.\n- \u00b7 Meetings . A review of the length, frequency and timing of Committee meetings was carried out.\n\n## SHE Strategy\n\nDuring the year, the SSHEAC reviewed SSE's SHE strategy for the next 5 years. A 'hybrid' SHE Conference to engage key local influencers and a wider community on SSE's SHE strategy took place on 30 November 2021. An employee survey showed that colleagues feel committed to the goals of the previous 50by20 SHE Strategy which had been successful in delivering improvements in SHE performance. The SHE Goals, Safety Family and Enduring Goals were key features of the 50by20 Strategy and understood and recognised across the organisation. These features have therefore been maintained as part of the updated SHE strategy.\n\nAs part of the SHE Strategy development activity, feedback from engaging with colleagues, peer benchmarking and a review of the learning outcomes from past incidents, further led to exploring the concept of 'how to make it easy for people to do the right thing'. In this context, the following focus areas were set out: (a.) strengthening of controls and assurance; (b.) enablers to help people do the right\n\nthing; and (c.) drive progress with the 8 Enduring Goals. The five Golden Safety Rules have also been integrated into the SHE strategy.\n\n## SHE performance Safety\n\nSSE uses the concept of 'Safe Days' as a way to monitor and track its safety progress and performance. On a 'Safe Day', there are no minor, serious or major, SSE or contractor, safety or environmental incidents or any incident with high potential for harm to people or the environment. During 2021/22, 254 Safe Days were achieved, compared to 271 in the previous year. In addition to Safe Days, SSE continues to measure safety performance using the rolling Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) for employees and contractors. This measure is used for benchmarking and trend analysis, and in 2021/22 it increased to 0.17 per 100,000 hours worked, compared to 0.15 in the previous year. This increase reflects a significant surge in construction associated with SSE's record capex and increased activity following the recovery from coronavirus.\n\nFocus on ensuring everyone gets home safe remains central to SSE and the work of the SSHEAC. In March 2022, the Committee therefore set a TRIR target of 0.15 for 2022/23 and re-iterated the need to keep focus on having no life changing injuries or major SHE incidents. This will continue to be monitored, alongside a measure of environmental permit breaches against key Business Units' milestones to provide a framework in which to assess SHE performance in a rounder way. At the end of April 2022, the longer-term trend on TRIR had tracked back to the 0.15 level.\n\n## Health and wellbeing\n\nHealth and wellbeing is at the core of SSE's Safety Family. It reinforces very directly how we can take care of ourselves and each other.\n\nTo strengthen the occupational support SSE offers; it recruited a new Head of Health and Wellbeing during the year. A supporting review of occupational benefits concluded that there is a very good range of support with the ability for some services to be used more and/or expanded upon. Building on the good foundation that is already in place and using all-employee survey findings, SSE is looking to integrate the following into the health and wellbeing support model: (a.) making it easy to do the right thing; (b.) making the uncomfortable, comfortable; and (c.) service and support.\n\nA range of resources are available to employees to help them take care of themselves and others, including Employee Assistance and Back to Health programmes supported by Nuffield Health. A wellbeing app provides home workout videos and tailored programmes and the 'Mental Health Toolkit', that is being developed, is designed to support managers by providing information on various concerns all related to mental health. SSE's priority for 2022/23 will be to continue to support employees to adapt to new working conditions and look after their mental and physical health.\n\n## Environment\n\nTo achieve its core purpose to provide energy today while building a better world of energy for tomorrow, SSE's strategy seeks to simultaneously create value for both shareholders and society. The framework it uses to achieve this objective is the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. SSE's Environment strategy sits firmly within the sustainability hierarchy within the UN Global Goal framework. Operationally, SSE focuses on three priority pillars: (a.) environmental management and governance; (b.) responsible resource use; and (c.) natural environment.\n\nIn 2021/22, the number of environmental incidents as a result of SSE's activities totalled 60, compared to 44 in the previous year. Of these, there were no major environmental incidents. SSE's environmental permit breaches increased to 7 in 2021/22 from 4 the previous year. The majority of environmental incidents were minor and most permit breaches were self-reported to the relevant environmental agencies. All incidents were dealt with quickly when identified. During the year, SSE's carbon footprint benefited by having reduced travel, with most colleagues using the Flexible First approach to work combining office and home working, and utilising technology.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nSignificant progress was made across the most material areas of sustainability in 2021/22, with the SSHEAC reviewing SSE's performance in each environmental and social category identified by ESG-focussed investors and ratings agencies, approving areas for development and improvement in the next financial year. In terms of SSE's approach to the disclosure of its sustainability impacts, the aim is to bring about continuous improvement in both the quality of information disclosed and across stakeholder engagement. SSE's Sustainability Report aims to demonstrate the way SSE creates value for shareholders and society",

Complementary information can also be found on pages 40 to 67 \uf150 .\n\n## Site visits\n\nEasing of coronavirus restrictions allowed for the programme of SSHEAC site visits to resume in 2021/22. Instead of all members participating in the same site visit, it was agreed to broaden the coverage through two members of the SSHEAC teaming up and focusing on a particular area during September 2021. Site visits included: Slough Heat and Power; Keadby 1 and 2; Walton Park; Solent Park; and the Viking Windfarm construction site on Shetland, followed by a visit to the Transmission HVDC convertor station site and to Lerwick Power Station. A large part of the meeting held in October 2021, which had been organised outside of the schedule of Committee meetings, was dedicated to receiving feedback and agreeing next steps in the process of continuous improvement. Overall, it was agreed that the safety site visits were powerful in providing members of the SSHEAC with a breadth and depth of knowledge across a range of projects and operational activity.\n\nA structured approach to site visits ensures that feedback is collected and acted upon. This is facilitated by a dedicated feedback template which is completed by members of the Committee following completion of an engagement. The SSHEAC has agreed the site visit programme for 2022 which will be reported on next year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Site visit to Keadby 1 - our Safety Language in action\n\nThe below represents feedback provided by the members of the SSHEAC on a visit to Keadby 1 in September 2021.\n\n## If it's not safe, we don't do it\n\n- \u00b7 The site is currently operating under a number of operational access restrictions which is being monitored closely. The leadership team provided a clear account of how operational teams were engaged on the approach, to ensure effective management of this risk.\n\n## We take pride in our work and our environment\n\n- \u00b7 A good level of housekeeping and appropriate coronavirus signage was observed.\n- \u00b7 A remote induction in addition to a local site orientation was provided.\n- \u00b7 The approach taken during outages - external tents for coordinating meetings - was seen as best practice.\n\n## We take care of ourselves and each other\n\n- \u00b7 The local SHE community group operates effectively with the 45 people on site engaged. This includes representatives from Engineering, Operations and Maintenance teams.\n\n## We see it, sort it and report it\n\n- \u00b7 The contractor workshop was a well set up area and work being done was highly organised.\n- \u00b7 Coronavirus restrictions in the permit office were well managed.\n- \u00b7 Weeds in the HV compound had been identified by the on-site team and work to address had been planned.\n\n## Plan, scan and adapt\n\n- \u00b7 The Gated process for outages was presented, and judged as being very effective in ensuring that the work being done was well planned and appropriate.\n- \u00b7 Work coordination between Keadby 1 and Keadby 2 was in place, with weekly integration meetings and an embedded Keadby 1 team member in the Keadby 2 team.\n\n## What would make it easy (or easier) for people to do the right thing?\n\n- \u00b7 The on-site team were comfortable with the steps being taken to address coronavirus.\n- \u00b7 Supervision was highlighted as an important area. The benefit of the empowering supervisor training was noted, alongside ensuring adequate time was allocated for supervisory activities.\n\n## Overall impression\n\nKeadby 1 is moving towards the end of its operations and the site are managing the transition well, in addition to preparatory work for the operation of Keadby 2.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Committee Chair's statement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is responsible for the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The Remuneration of SSE's most senior Executives and also Chair of the Board. The Committee also reviews but does not decide the remuneration of SSE's employees. This ensures that the decisions on executive pay take full account of pay across the Company.\n- \u00b7 The Directors' Remuneration Report and for ensuring that, at least every three years, shareholders are asked to approve a new Directors' Remuneration Policy at the Annual General Meeting. The Terms of Reference of the Committee which are reviewed annually and are available on sse.com \uf295 .\n\nThe Committee bases its activities with four principles and objectives in mind. 1.) the Company's culture and values; 2.) the link between the remuneration framework with the Company's purpose and strategy 3). ensuring the remuneration framework is designed to promote the long-term success of the Company and 4.) ensuring the performance-related elements of pay are transparent, stretching and consistently applied as well as linked to the successful delivery of strategy.\n\nAn Assistant Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee and the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary and Director of Investor Relations are invited to attend all meetings. The Committee ensures, however, that no individual is ever present when their own remuneration is under discussion or decisions are made. The Committee also takes independent external advice on remuneration and corporate governance and appoints its own professional advisers for this purpose.\n\n## Performance and delivery in a year of volatility\n\nDear Shareholder,\n\nThis Directors' Remuneration Report sets out simply and transparently how SSE pays its Directors (both Executive and nonExecutive); the decisions made on their pay in 2021/22; and how much they received in relation to the financial year ended 31 March 2022.\n\n## Delivering on strategy\n\nIn November 2021 SSE set out its strategic Net Zero Acceleration Programme for sustainable, long-term growth aligned to a 1.5\u00b0C global warming pathway. As detailed earlier in this Annual Report, good progress against the programme - with its \u00a312.5bn capital expenditure plan to 2026 and new medium-term business goals to 2031 has been made in the intervening months. SSE has been investing around \u00a37m a day in low-carbon infrastructure at home and has started to export its developer expertise abroad, creating tangible value for stakeholders.\n\nIn addition, throughout 2021/22, SSE has delivered solid operational performance. Highlights include strong earnings performance despite unfavourable weather for renewable generation, the conclusion of the disposals and re-structuring programme with \u00a32.8bn of proceeds, improvements in employee engagement despite the pandemic, a positive reaction to our involvement with COP26 where SSE was a Principal Partner and strong Total Shareholder Returns. Our employees have once again contributed amazingly throughout the year and a special payment has been made of \u00a3500 or \u20ac600 to employees in recognition of their excellent contribution.\n\n## 2021/22 AIP outcomes\n\nThe Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) is determined against a broad range of financial, operational, strategic, and personal performance targets collectively designed to reflect business performance each year. The measures used for 2021/22 were chosen to support our strategic delivery and longer-term goals.\n\nPerformance in the year has been strong across a range of metrics which resulted in an assessment of the 2021/22 award being up to 83% of the maximum. The Committee considered the results in the context of other performance indicators and the wider stakeholder experience and determined that the result was fair and reasonable so did not apply any discretion. As a reminder, the Committee has used downward discretion three times in the previous five years. A detailed AIP scorecard can be seen on pages 186 to 189 \uf150 .\n\n## 2021/22 PSP outcomes\n\nThe Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards granted in 2019 are due to vest following the 2021/22 financial year, subject to financial, operational, and value-creation performance measures over the three-year period. These have been objectively assessed, resulting in an outturn of 66% of maximum. The Committee confirmed that the formulaic outcome for these awards is appropriate and no discretion was applied. More details on the performance measures used, the targets set, and the performance outturn is set out on pages 189 to 190 \uf150 .",

        "page_content": "## Linking policy to purpose\n\nOur current Directors' Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the 2019 AGM, with over 99% support. The policy is built on our core reward principles which endure. They are:\n\n- 1.  Sustainability, reinforcing SSE's commitment to being a responsible employer\n- 2.  Simplicity, maximising transparency and avoiding unnecessary complexity\n- 3.  Stewardship, encouraging good decision-making for the long term\n- 4.  Stakeholders, reflecting SSE's strategic goal of creating value for shareholders and society.\n\nThe policy expires at the AGM and the Remuneration Committee is seeking to use the three-yearly review cycle to strengthen and align the approach to pay with SSE's purpose and long-term strategy as set out by the Net Zero Acceleration Programme. The changes to the Policy will play a key role in the successful execution of SSE's strategy, including the stated investment and growth plans to create the conditions for SSE to succeed, the Remuneration Committee took the view that changes to pay were necessary at this time for four main reasons.\n\n- \u00b7 Sustainability is central to SSE's purpose and strategy. Operational excellence will be key to successful delivery of the Net Zero Acceleration Programme. Hence, we propose to include sustainability measures in the Performance Share Plan (PSP), to reflect the long-term nature of these targets, whilst also retaining an\n- 'in-year' focus on progress by including a smaller element within the Annual Incentive Plan (AIP). This increases the emphasis on sustainability overall, as well as focusing it more to the longer term. We also plan to introduce operational measures into the AIP and strategic measures into the PSP.\n- \u00b7 Our total remuneration arrangements currently place insufficient emphasis on long-term performance-related pay and a market correction is required. This applies to both the level of awards under the Performance Share Plan and SSE's share ownership requirements which are both below market. The performance share awards are key to ensuring that we are paying fairly and competitively in exchange for delivery and higher levels of performance. We are not proposing to make increases to basic salaries above the norm for all SSE employees.\n- \u00b7 SSE's overall approach to executive remuneration is in line with SSE's historic policy positioning because of long standing pensions arrangements in place for incumbent executives. The Board is keen to structure the policy to ensure that it can attract world-class talent for whom existing historic pension arrangements will not exist. This is particularly important as SSE becomes more international and recruits from new geographies.\n- \u00b7 Our Executive Directors are key to the success of the Net Zero Acceleration Programme, and we shall be asking more of them than ever before as we move into a new phase of accelerated growth for SSE.\n\nAs Chair of the Remuneration Committee, I consulted extensively with our largest shareholders and other interested parties. The engagement process began in February to allow as much time as possible to listen to the views of our shareholders. I am extremely grateful to everyone who was generous with their time and shared their views on the proposals. Most shareholders were supportive of the changes. All the feedback we received from investors was considered by the Remuneration Committee. As a result, we have adapted the proposals in a number of ways. We changed the proposal to reduce the weighting of financial and share-based measures under the PSP in light of the feedback. EPS and relative TSR still account for 70% of the award. Dividend Per Share remains a crucial KPI but we shall reward instead achievement against specific strategic and sustainability goals. Some shareholders asked us to link incentives to return on capital or return on equity. The Committee debated this at length and, at this stage, take the view that stretching targets could not readily be set for ROCE given the range of returns across SSE's businesses. The key inputs of ROCE are, however, linked to incentives. The new strategic and operational measures are also more robust. The Remuneration Committee expects of course that it will be required to use its judgement, as it currently does, when assessing the extent to which targets have been met.\n\nDetails of the Policy changes can be found in full on page 172 \uf150 , but in summary the key changes are set out overleaf.",

This is in line with the negotiated increase for collectively-bargained employees and the broader pot for all other employees with effect from 1 April 2022.\n\nThe structure and quantum of the AIP remains unchanged. However, as noted above, we have considered the importance of operational excellence as central to the success of the Net Zero Acceleration Programme and have therefore reweighted the AIP measures to support this objective.\n\nFor 2022/23 the proposed measures and weightings are:\n\n- \u00b7 EPS growth -30%\n- \u00b7 Cash flow (defined as net debt to EBITDA) - 20%\n- \u00b7 Operational measures - 30%\n- \u00b7 Sustainability - 10%\n- \u00b7 Individual/strategic objectives - 10%\n\nMeasures will be both quantitative and qualitative. The operational measures include seven core areas which are Renewables, Distribution, Transmission, Thermal, Customer, People, and Other Growth and Transactions. The sustainability measures, which will also appear in the longer-term plan, will be linked to SSE's relative sustainability as assessed against four external ESG ratings agencies using their own benchmarks. Individual strategic measures will include progress being made towards inclusion and diversity targets.\n\nThe PSP award levels, subject to shareholder approval, will be 250% for the Chief Executive and 225% for the Finance Director and Chief Commercial Officer. Reflecting the higher award levels, the Committee has set tougher target ranges.\n\nThe proposed measures and weightings are:\n\n- \u00b7 Relative TSR - 50%\n- \u00b7 EPS growth - 20%\n- \u00b7 Strategic measures - 15%\n- \u00b7 Sustainability - 15%\n\nThe Remuneration Committee will also adjust any total pay outcomes downwards (to zero if necessary), for example, if they are deemed by the Committee to be disproportionate or out of line when we take into account the interests of our stakeholders or where there has been a mismatch between financial and non-financial performance over the relevant period.\n\nMore details of the performance measures, weightings and targets are set out on pages 196 to 198 \uf150 .\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Committee believes that the changes to policy, and the performance measures and targets for 2022/23 incentives, will sharpen our focus on delivering the Net Zero Acceleration Programme and support the retention and recruitment of the high calibre talent in a very competitive market.\n\nLooking ahead, we will continue to apply our core principles in terms of transparency in both decision-making and reporting and do so in a way that is fully cognisant of the perspectives of SSE's stakeholder groups.

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Policy\n\n## Introduction\n\nSSE's Directors' Remuneration Policy (the 'Policy') is set out as follows. The Policy is subject to a binding shareholder vote at SSE's AGM on 21 July 2022 and, if approved, will apply from this date. It is intended that the Policy will apply for a period of up to three years and will need to be re-approved at the 2025 AGM at the latest.\n\nThe Policy was reviewed and approved by the Remuneration Committee. As part of the process, the views of our larger shareholders and other shareholder advisory bodies were sought. In addition, the thoughts of other Board members, management and external advisers were considered. The members of the Committee then made decisions independently without inappropriate influence. No person participates in decisions relating to their personal remuneration.\n\n## Principles\n\nThe Committee believes it is essential that our overall remuneration policy is strongly aligned to SSE's purpose and strategy. It aims to ensure this by focusing on our core principles which are: Sustainable, Simple, Stewardship, Stakeholder-focused. In addition, we have reviewed our policy in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code which encourages a description of how the policy addresses the following:\n\n## Clarity\n\n- \u00b7 Our directors' remuneration policy is designed to be sustainable and simple and to support and reward diligent and effective stewardship that is vital to the delivery of SSE's core purpose of providing energy needed today while building a better world of energy for tomorrow, and our strategy of creating value for shareholders and all stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 The Policy updates the previous Policy, with minimal structural changes so is already embedded into the business and is well understood by participants and shareholders alike.\n- \u00b7 The Policy clearly sets out the terms under which it can be operated including appropriate limits in terms of quantum, the measures which can be used and discretions which could be applied if appropriate.\n- \u00b7 Transparency in approach has been a cornerstone of our Policy. Detailed disclosure of the relevant performance assessments and outcomes is provided for shareholders to consider.\n\n## Risk\n\n- \u00b7 Appropriate limits are stipulated in the Policy and within the respective plan rules.\n- \u00b7 The Committee also has appropriate discretions to override formulaic outturns under the assessment of the variable incentive plans.\n- \u00b7 The Committee undertakes an annual risk review of the Policy and its operation. Identified risks are considered with appropriate mitigation strategies or tolerance levels agreed.\n- \u00b7 Regular interaction with the Audit Committee and the SSHEA Committee ensures relevant risk factors are considered when setting or assessing performance targets.\n- \u00b7 Clawback and malus provisions are in place across all incentive plans and the 'triggers' have been reviewed and strengthened.\n\n## Proportionality\n\n- \u00b7 Variable incentive pay outcomes are clearly dependent on delivering the strategy.\n- \u00b7 Performance is assessed on a broad basis, including a combination of financial, operational and sustainability which ensures there is no undue focus on a single metric which may be at the detriment of other stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 The Committee also has the discretion - which it has used - to override formulaic outcomes if they are deemed inappropriate in light of the wider performance of the Company and considering the experience of stakeholders.\n\n## Simplicity\n\n- \u00b7 Our pay arrangements include a market standard annual incentive and long-term share plan, each of which is explained in detail in our Policy.\n- \u00b7 No complex or artificial structures are required to operate the plans.\n- \u00b7 We explain our approach to pay clearly and simply.\n\n## Predictability\n\n- \u00b7 The possible reward outcomes can be easily quantified, and these are reviewed by the Committee.\n- \u00b7 The graphical illustrations provided in the Policy, clearly show the potential scenarios of performance and pay outcomes which would result.\n- \u00b7 Performance is reviewed regularly so there are no surprises when performance is assessed at the end of the period.\n\n## Alignment to culture\n\n- \u00b7 At the heart of the Policy is a focus on the long-term sustainability of the business.\n- \u00b7 This reflects the whole business culture which is aligned to effective stewardship which creates value for all stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 Our incentive plans and, in particular the approach to measuring performance reflect our values which means doing the right thing, promoting fairness at work and paying our fair share.",

They all have a clear link to strategic objectives and support value creation for shareholders. Performance targets will be stretching and maximum performance will only be attained for true out-performance. The longer-term financial targets set for the awards under the Performance Share Plan will be reviewed and set in the light of the relevant business plan. Where possible, targets will be disclosed prospectively unless commercial sensitivity precludes this, in which case they may be disclosed at an appropriate time retrospectively.\n\n## Committee discretion\n\nAll incentive awards are subject to the terms of the relevant plan rules under which awards are made. The Committee may adjust or amend awards in accordance with the provisions of the relevant plan rules. This includes, but is not limited to, the following discretions:\n\n- \u00b7 In the event of a variation of the Company's share capital or reserves, or a demerger, special dividend, rights issue or other event, the number of shares subject to an Award and/or any performance condition attached to Awards, may be adjusted.\n- \u00b7 The Committee may adjust PSP performance conditions for subsisting awards as it considers appropriate to take account of any factors which are relevant in the opinion of the Committee, for example to reflect modifications of accounting standards.\n- \u00b7 In the event of a voluntary winding-up of the Company, the Committee may allow some or all of the outstanding PSP awards to vest (and be deemed exercised) on the date the resolution for the winding-up is passed.\n\nThe Committee may make minor changes to this Policy (for example for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation or corporate governance requirements or guidance) without seeking shareholder approval for that amendment.",

'Payments' includes the Committee sanctioning awards of variable remuneration and an award over shares is 'agreed' at the time the award is granted. Any payments made outside of the Directors' Remuneration Policy pursuant to legacy commitments will be disclosed in full in the relevant year's Annual Report.\n\n## Directors' service contracts and non-Executive Directors' letters of appointment\n\nCurrent Executive Directors have service contracts terminable by the Company immediately without notice upon breach by the individual or by the Company giving to the individual 12 months' notice or, at its discretion, payment in lieu of salary only during that notice. The payment in lieu of notice may be made in staged payments and may either reduce or cease completely where the departing Executive Director gains new employment. The Executive Director may terminate the contract by giving the Company 12 months' notice. Contracts for new Executive Directors will be limited to 12 months' notice by both parties (or payment in lieu of notice in respect of the Company). The service contracts are available to view at the Company's registered office.\n\nThe non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment, and are appointed for fixed terms of three years, subject to retirement and re-appointment at AGMs. Non-Executive Directors on termination are not entitled to any payment in lieu of notice or any compensation for loss of office.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe letters of appointment are available for shareholders to view on www.sse.com \uf295 .\n\n## Loss of office policy\n\nThe Committee takes a number of factors into account when determining leaving arrangements for Executive Directors:\n\n- \u00b7 The Committee must satisfy any contractual obligations provided they are consistent with the Policy or have been entered into on a date on or before 27 June 2012 in accordance with relevant legislation.\n- \u00b7 The treatment of outstanding share awards is governed by the relevant share plan rules, as set out below.\n- \u00b7 The Committee may determine that the Executive Director should receive reasonable outplacement support and legal advice at the expense of the Company and any payments required by statute.\n- \u00b7 The Company may at its discretion terminate any Executive Director's contract by providing notice or payment in lieu of notice (as set out above).\n\n## AIP\n\nThe Executive Director may, at the discretion of the Committee, remain eligible to receive an AIP award for the financial year in which they ceased employment if the Committee has decided that good leaver terms should apply. Any such AIP award will be determined by the Committee taking into account time in employment and performance. If an AIP award is received in such cases it may not be subject to deferral into deferred shares provided the post-employment share ownership policy has already been fulfilled or will be by other means.\n\n## Deferred and career shares\n\nIf an Executive Director's employment terminates in circumstances such as death, injury, disability, ill-health (as agreed by the Committee) or other circumstances that the Committee deems appropriate, unvested deferred and career shares shall vest in full at the time of termination of employment.\n\nIf an Executive Director leaves the business in other circumstances their deferred shares and unvested career shares shall lapse. Vested career shares shall not lapse.\n\nVested awards in the form of career shares awarded under previous Directors' Remuneration Policies shall, except in the case of death or change of control, be released two years after the date of cessation of employment, irrespective of the reason for such cessation.",

        "page_content": "## Performance share plan\n\nIf an Executive Director's employment terminates in circumstances such as death, injury, disability, ill-health (as agreed by the Committee) or other circumstances that the Committee deems appropriate, PSP shares may continue to vest. The PSP shares will normally be reduced to reflect the time elapsed in the three-year performance period when the Executive Director's employment ends and will normally remain subject to performance at the end of the performance period.\n\nThe Committee may determine, in exceptional circumstances, that PSP shares may be released at the time of cessation of employment. In this circumstance, it will determine the level of vesting taking into account the extent to which the performance conditions have been met at the time (subject to modification if the Committee considers that the performance condition would be met to a greater or lesser extent at the end of the original performance period) and the period the Executive Director has been in employment.\n\nThe Committee has the discretion to disapply time pro-rating or alter the time pro-rating fraction if it considers that the Executive Director's contribution to the business of the Company would not otherwise be properly recognised. In this circumstance, the vesting of PSP shares would remain subject to performance until the end of the performance period.\n\nIf the Executive Director's employment ends for any other reason, unvested PSP share awards will lapse. Vested PSP shares which are subject to a mandatory holding period will not lapse as a result of cessation of employment for any reason.\n\n## Pension\n\nWhen an Executive (including Executive Directors) who participate in the defined benefit pension scheme retire through ill-health they are entitled to an unreduced pension based on service to expected retirement.\n\nIn the event of any reorganisation or redundancy, Executives who are aged 50 or more with at least five years of service will be provided with an unreduced accrued pension. If an Executive has not reached age 50 at the time of this event their pension will be paid from age 50.\n\nFrom age 55 Executives are entitled to leave the Company and receive a pension, reduced for early payment, unless the Company gives consent and funds the pension being paid on an unreduced basis.\n\nDependent upon the circumstances surrounding the departure of the Executive Director and the financial health of the Company at the time, the Committee's policy is to give consideration to a cash commutation of the UURB pension at the time of leaving. Any cash commutation would limit SSE's liability, taking into account valuations provided by independent actuarial advisors, and would be undertaken on what was judged by the Committee to be on a cost neutral basis to SSE.\n\nThe following is information relating to the pension of Gregor Alexander as a participant in the HMRC-approved Scottish Hydro- Electric Pension Scheme the terms of which also apply to the UURBS arrangement.\n\n- (i)  Dependants' pensions on death are half of the member's pension entitlements, together with a capital sum equal to four times pensionable pay. On death in retirement, the Executive Director's spouse will receive a pension equal to half of that payable to the Director. In addition, on death within the first five years of retirement, a lump sum is payable equal to the balance outstanding of the first five years' pension payments\n- (ii) Post retirement increases are expected to be in line with RPI.\n\nThe following is information relating to the pension of Alistair Phillips-Davies, as a participant in the HMRC approved Southern Electric Group of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme, the terms of which also apply to the UURBS arrangement.\n\n- (i)  Dependants' pensions on death are four-ninths of the member's pensionable pay, together with a capital sum equal to four times pensionable pay. If death occurs after attaining the age of 55 an additional lump sum between three to five times notional pension is payable dependent upon age and length of service.\n- (ii) On death in retirement, the Director's spouse will receive a pension equal to two-thirds of that payable to the Director. In addition, on death within the first five years of retirement, a lump sum is payable equal to the balance outstanding of the first five years' pension payments.\n- (iii) Post retirement increases are expected to be in line with RPI (guaranteed up to the level of 5% per annum and discretionary above that level).\n\n## Other arrangements\n\nIf buyout awards are made on recruitment, the treatment on leaving would be determined at the time of the award.\n\nFor all-employee share plans, such as the Sharesave Scheme and the Share Incentive Plan, leavers will be treated in accordance with the HMRC approved plan rules.\n\n## Change of control\n\nOn a change of control, Executive Directors' awards will be treated in accordance with the rules of the applicable plan(s). In summary, in the event of a change of control of the Company, performance in the PSP will be measured to that date subject to modification if the Committee considers that the performance conditions would be met to a greater or lesser extent at the end of the original performance period. Awards will normally be scaled down to reflect the period up to the change of control, but the Committee has discretion to disapply or alter the pro-rating fraction if it considers that participants' contribution to the creation of shareholder value during the performance period would not otherwise be properly recognised.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Policy continued\n\nAny outstanding unvested deferred or career shares from the AIP will vest automatically, and any vested shares subject to a holding period will be released.\n\n## Recovery provisions\n\nThe Committee believes that it is right that it should have the ability to recover pay in circumstances where that pay is later proved to have been unfairly earned. The PSP and AIP have recovery provisions under malus and clawback.\n\nMalus is the ability to reduce or cancel unvested deferred AIP and PSP share awards. Clawback is the ability to take back value delivered through the cash element of AIP or vested AIP awards at any point: up to three years post-payment of cash under the AIP; and up to three years post- vesting of PSP shares. They would apply under the following circumstances at any point between the grant date and vesting date:\n\n- \u00b7 Material misstatement or restatement of accounts\n- \u00b7 Misconduct which results in a materially adverse financial effect\n- \u00b7 Serious reputational damage including material environmental or safety issue, or material operational or business failing\n- \u00b7 Factual error in calculating payment/vesting\n- \u00b7 Serious misconduct\n- \u00b7 Corporate failure\n- \u00b7 Material risk failure\n- \u00b7 Material detriment to stakeholders or to company's market reputation\n- \u00b7 Unreasonable failure to protect stakeholders' interests\n\n## Recruitment policy\n\nThe Committee will seek to align the remuneration package offered with its Directors' Remuneration Policy outlined on page 172 \uf150 . The overriding objective in determining a total remuneration package for a new recruit would be to make decisions which are in the best interests of the Company, its shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nBase salary would be set taking into account the individual's skills and experience and performance, salary levels at other similar sized UK companies and other energy businesses, remuneration of different groups of employees, and the wider internal pay arrangements.\n\nThe Committee will determine appropriate pension provision for any new Executive Director. When determining pension arrangements for new external appointments the Committee will limit contributions to those in line with employees generally, currently 12% of salary.\n\nVariable incentive levels will be in line with those set out in the policy table, with the maximum being no more than the current Chief Executive (AIP 150% of salary, PSP 250% of salary). Whilst it would generally be intended to set consistent performance measures across the executive team, depending on the timing and circumstances of a new appointment, it may be necessary to set alternative measures for the initial awards. PSP awards may be granted shortly following an appointment, subject to the Company not being in a closed period.\n\nThe Committee may make awards on appointing an Executive Director to 'buy out' remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In doing so the Committee will take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the form in which they were granted (e.g. cash or shares) and the time over which they would have vested. Generally buy-out awards will be made on a comparable basis to those forfeited. To facilitate these awards, the Committee may make awards under Company incentive plans and other available structures.\n\nThe Committee may make awards under SSE's incentive plans and under the Listing Rules exemption in LR9.4.2 which allows Companies to make grants to a Director to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment or retention of that Director. The use of the latter shall be limited to the granting of buy-out awards or share awards within the limits described above.\n\n## Shareholders' views\n\nThe Committee Chair, on behalf of the Committee, consulted with SSE's largest shareholders in developing the new Policy, as well as representatives from The Investment Association. This included a number of meetings which allowed a discussion of the proposals in the context of SSE's business strategy and the environment in which it operates. The feedback received was extremely helpful in informing the Committee's decisions. The Committee adopted its proposals following input from shareholders. The weighting of financial and non-financial measures in the PSP is one example. The balance of quantative and qualitative measures and targets is another.\n\nMore generally, the Committee Chair, on behalf of the Committee, periodically undertakes consultation with a number of institutional shareholders regarding a broad range of remuneration issues. The Committee finds such consultation meetings a valuable opportunity to receive feedback on the work of the Committee and the key issues that it is considering. The feedback received is extremely helpful in informing the Committee's decisions.\n\nIn addition, the Committee also monitors the views of other stakeholders and broader developments in executive remuneration generally.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration engagement across the Company\n\nThe Committee appreciates the importance of an appropriate relationship between the remuneration levels of the Executive Directors, senior executives, managers and other employees within the Company although comparison metrics are not used to determine pay policy. Remuneration at all levels in SSE is designed to support its remuneration principles, long-term business strategy and core purpose of providing the energy people need in a reliable and sustainable way. It is also designed to be consistent with and support the Company's core values of Safety, Service, Efficiency, Sustainability, Excellence and Teamwork. The structure of reward necessarily differs based on scope and responsibility of role, level of seniority and location.\n\nThe table in the At a Glance Section ( page 182 \uf150 ) illustrates how the core elements of executive pay align with the wider workforce.\n\n## In summary,\n\n- \u00b7 The senior management population also participate in annual and long-term incentive arrangements. In line with Executive Directors' arrangements, incentives for senior management have an emphasis on share awards and the performance metrics support those used at Board level.\n- \u00b7 All employees have the opportunity to be share owners through the Share Incentive Plan and the Sharesave Plan and those participating are able to express their views in the same way as other shareholders.\n- \u00b7 Pension planning is an important part of SSE's reward strategy for all employees because it is consistent with the long-term goals and horizons of the business, an approach it has been practising for a number of years. The terms of the funded final salary pension schemes apply equally to all members.\n- \u00b7 As part of its Employee Engagement Survey SSE invites all employees to provide a view on the benefits and pay that it provides.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is responsible for the remuneration of SSE's most senior Executives and the Chair of the Board and reviews the remuneration arrangements for all employees across the Group.\n\nThe Chair of the Remuneration Committee meets at least annually with SSE's recognised Trade Unions to discuss SSE's position on executive remuneration. They met in May and discussed aspects of policy explained in this report. Feedback from this meeting was shared with the Remuneration Committee.\n\n## Illustration of the Directors' Remuneration Policy for 2022/23\n\nThe charts below indicate a forward-looking potential single figure of remuneration value for 2022/23 at below threshold, target and maximum for each of the Executive Directors. With the increase in base salaries in 2022 and the proposed increase to PSP quantum the scenarios below have increased from the previous year.\n\n## Single total figure of remuneration - an illustration of the application of our policy\n\n<!-- image -->",

These benefits are non-pensionable.\n- 3 The pension values for Alistair Phillips-Davies and Gregor Alexander represent the increase in capital value of pension accrued over one-year times a multiple of 20 (net of CPI and Directors' contributions) in line with statutory reporting requirements.\n\n- 5 The PSP figures for 2020/21 have been readjusted in line with statutory reporting requirements, following last year's report to show the actual value upon vesting. The estimated value shown in the table for 2021/22 is based on the average share price in the three months to 31 March 2022 of \u00a316.165, as required by the reporting regulations. The award remains subject to service until May 2022 and so the prior year comparative will be restated in next year's report to show the actual value on vesting, as is required by the regulations. There was no share price appreciation.\n- 6 Directors have not received any other items in the nature of remuneration other than as disclosed in the table.\n\n## Rationale for 2021/22 single total figure of remuneration\n\nThere has been a year-on-year increase of 48% in the single total figure of remuneration. For the Executive Directors, remuneration has increased between 44% and 53%. This change is attributable to an increase in base salary aligned to the wider workforce, and an increase in AIP/PSP outcomes following a year of strong financial, operational and strategic performance. The PSP, in particular, has performed well. The share price has also increased by 27% in the year to 31 March 2022 and TSR, over the three years to the end of March 2022, has increased by over 66%.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the total single figure of remuneration for each Executive Director is appropriate.\n\n## Base salary\n\nIn line with the average base salary increase for the wider employee population, Executive Directors' salaries were increased on 1 April 2021 by 1% from \u00a3914,776 to \u00a3923,924 for the Chief Executive, from \u00a3707,047 to \u00a3714,117 for the Finance Director and from \u00a3630,000 to \u00a3636,300 for the Chief Commercial Officer.\n\n## Benefits\n\nBenefits are provided at an appropriate level taking into account market practice at similarly sized companies and the level of benefits provided for other employees in the Company. Core benefits include car allowance, private medical insurance and health screening. The Executive Directors also participate in the Company's all-employee share schemes on the same terms as other employees.\n\n## Pension\n\nThe Chief Executive and Finance Director are members of the Southern Electric Pension Scheme and the Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme respectively, and their plan membership predates their Board appointments. They participate in the same defined benefit pension arrangements that were available to all employees recruited at that time. The schemes were closed in 1999 and the service costs range from 32.5% to 37.5% of salary. These are both funded final salary pension schemes and the terms of these schemes apply equally to all members. The Executive Directors' service contracts provide for a possible maximum pension of two thirds final salary from the age of 60.\n\nIn relation to Executive Directors who are subject to the scheme-specific salary cap (which mirrors the provisions of the previous HMRC cap arrangements) the Company provides top-up (unfunded) arrangements which are designed to provide an equivalent pension on retirement from the age of 60 to that which they would have earned had they not been subject to the salary cap. From 1 April 2017 pensionable earnings increases were capped at RPI +1%. These are legacy arrangements and would not be used for any new external appointments.",

        "page_content": "The Chief Executive and Finance Director, in common with all other employees who joined at the same time (25 and 31 years ago respectively), have the following pension provisions relating to leaving the Company:\n\n- \u00b7 for retirement through ill-health an unreduced pension based on service to expected retirement is paid;\n- \u00b7 in the event of any reorganisation or redundancy an unreduced accrued pension is paid to a member who is aged 50 or above, with at least five years' service or, for a member who has not yet reached that age, it will be payable with effect from 50;\n- \u00b7 and from the age of 55, a scheme member is entitled to leave the Company and receive a pension, reduced for early payment, unless the Company gives consent and funds this pension on an unreduced basis.\n\nDependent on the circumstances surrounding the departure of the Executive Director and financial health of the Company at the time, the Committee's policy is to give consideration to a cash commutation of the unfunded unapproved retirement benefit (UURB) pension at the time of leaving. Any cash commutation will limit SSE's liability, taking into account valuations provided by independent actuarial advisors, and will be calculated on what was judged to be a cost neutral basis to SSE.\n\nThe Chief Commercial Officer, who has been with SSE since 1998, was already in receipt of a pension allowance of 30% of salary prior to his appointment as an Executive Director. While the arrangement was consistent with the approach used for all other members who have elected to receive a cash allowance in lieu of accruing future pension benefits, the Committee agreed that his future pension arrangements would be aligned with the level of contributions available to the wider workforce at 15% of salary on a phased basis over five years. Following confirmation of his expanded role from 1 November 2020, it was agreed that the phased reduction would be accelerated by two years. As part of the revised directors' remuneration policy, this change has again been accelerated. This means that his pension allowance will be in line with the employer contribution for the majority of SSE's employees taking into account length of service of 15% of salary from 1 January 2023.\n\nThe table below details pension accrued for each of the Executive Directors as at 31 March 2022 and 2021.\n\n|                          |   Accrued  pension as at  31 March 2022  \u00a3000s |   Accrued   pension as at  31 March 2021  \u00a3000s |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Alistair Phillips-Davies |                                            513 |                                             489 |\n| Gregor Alexander         |                                            461 |                                             443 |\n| Martin Pibworth  1       |                                              0 |                                               0 |",

The performance target range is set on a realistic basis but requires true outperformance for Executive Directors to achieve the maximum.

The Committee is committed to providing as much retrospective detail of the measures as possible, setting out clearly the decision-making process and the levels of attainment achieved, but mindful that any information which could be considered commercially sensitive cannot be disclosed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4.

Take account of wider environment\n\nThe Remuneration Committee believes that the range of measures used in the AIP ensures that performance is assessed using a balanced approach, without undue focus on a single metric which could be achieved at the expense of wider initiatives. AIP outturns for the wider employee population were also taken into account by the Committee.\n\nAIP earned for each of the Executive Directors is shown in the table below. The total award is made up of 67% cash and 33% which is deferred into shares and vests after three years.\n\n## 5. Apply discretion if required\n\nThe Committee considers the outcomes in the light of SSE's performance in the round and pay principles. While mindful of current cost of living pressures the Committee felt that the reward was reflective of performance and decided that no further discretion was required.\n\nMaximum\n\n|                           | (% of salary)   | AIP earned 1   | AIP cash   | AIP deferred   |\n|---------------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|----------------|\n| Alistair Phillips-Davies  | 150%            | 1,150,285      | 770,691    | 379,594        |\n| Gregor Alexander          | 130%            | 770,532        | 516,256    | 254,276        |\n| Martin Pibworth/thinspace | 130%            | 678,296        | 454,458    | 223,838        |\n\n## 2019 - 2022 Performance Share Plan\n\n## 1.

Take account of wider environment\n\nSSE's TSR has performed at the maximum level relative to both the FTSE 100 and the MSCI European Utilities Index, and performance in relation to Business Energy customer service ranking is also above median. EPS growth over the performance period has been close to the level for maximum vesting. While SSE's dividend commitment has been met over the three-year period, threshold performance at RPI has not been achieved following the resetting of the dividend policy in 2019.\n\nWhile the PSP applies to Executive Directors only, the Committee is mindful of the outturns of the long-term incentive arrangement (Leadership Share Plan - LSP) which applies to senior managers. On average, the LSP award has paid out at a higher level than the PSP outturn.\n\n## 5.

For a number of years, a Chief Executive pay ratio has been disclosed voluntarily. In 2018/19, the methodology was revised to meet the new reporting requirements. The methodology used is a hybrid approach combining Gender Pay Gap data (as disclosed in the Sustainability Report \uf223 ) with additional elements of pay which are important components of SSE employees' pay such as overtime, employer's contribution to pension and excluding salary sacrifice arrangements. This is believed to allow the most appropriate and consistent comparison.\n\nAs shown in the table below, the pay ratio has increased from 71:1 at median in 2020/21 to 102:1 in 2021/22. While the median remuneration for all employees has increased by 3.5%, the Chief Executive's remuneration has increased by 47%. This is due mainly to increased variable pay for the Chief Executive following a strong performance year and a 27% increase in the share price during the year and an increase in SSE's TSR over the three-year period of over 66%.\n\nSSE's is committed to being a responsible employer, and the remuneration policy is designed with fairness in mind - fairness to Executive Directors in recognition of the extent of their responsibilities and, fairness relative to the rest of the SSE team. More information on SSE's responsible employer ethos can be found within the Sustainability Report \uf223 which includes information on the commitment to being a real Living Wage employer, and other initiatives which help to ensure value is created and retained for employees and the organisation.",

FIT are founding members of, and adhere to, the Remuneration Consultants' Group Code of Conduct. The Code defines the roles of consultants, including the requirement to have due regard to the organisation's strategy, financial situation, pay philosophy, the Board's statutory duties and the views of investors and other stakeholders. The Committee reviews the advisers' performance annually to determine that it is satisfied with the quality, relevance, objectivity and independence of advice being provided. FIT provides no other services and has no other connection to the Company or individual Directors.\n\nFreshfields LLP also provided advice on legal matters, such as share plan rules, during the year.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThrough the internal Board evaluation process which was carried out during the year, it was confirmed that the Remuneration Committee continued to operate effectively. Details of the wider annual evaluation process are set out on pages 143 to 144 \uf150 .\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nThe Remuneration Committee carries out a remuneration risk assessment on an annual basis to identify and evaluate the risks inherent in our Directors' Remuneration Policy. Important risk mitigators identified included the broad balance of clear financial and non-financial performance measures, targets which are set in line with SSE's business plans and an overall approach to pay design which rewards the delivery of strong, yet sustainable, performance. The review of the Directors' Remuneration Policy during the year has also involved the systematic assessment of a variety of risks including strategic, operational, behavioural, talent and governance.\n\n## Shareholder voting in 2021\n\nOn 22 July 2021, shareholders approved the Annual report on remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2021 and the result is shown below.

        "page_content": "## Alternative Performance Measures\n\nWhen assessing, discussing and measuring the Group's financial performance, management refer to measures used for internal performance management. These measures are not defined or specified under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and as such are considered to be Alternative Performance Measures ('APMs').\n\nBy their nature, APMs are not uniformly applied by all preparers including other participants in the Group's industry. Accordingly, APMs used by the Group may not be comparable to other companies within the Group's industry.\n\n## Purpose\n\nAPMs are used by management to aid comparison and assess historical performance against internal performance benchmarks and across reporting periods. These measures provide an ongoing and consistent basis to assess performance by excluding items that are materially non-recurring, uncontrollable or exceptional. These measures can be classified in terms of their key financial characteristics:\n\n- \u00b7 Profit measures allow management to assess and benchmark underlying business performance during the year. They are primarily used by operational management to measure operating profit contribution and are also used by the Board to assess performance against business plan. The Group has six profit measures, of which adjusted operating profit and adjusted profit before tax are the main focus of management through the financial year and adjusted earnings per share is the main focus of management on an annual basis. In order to derive adjusted earnings per share, the Group has defined adjusted operating profit, adjusted net finance costs, and adjusted current tax charge as components of the adjusted earnings per share calculation. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management as a proxy for cash derived from ordinary operations of the Group.\n- \u00b7 Capital measures allow management to track and assess the progress of the Group's significant ongoing investment in capital assets and projects against their investment cases, including the expected timing of their operational deployment and also to provide a measure of progress against the Group's strategic Net Zero Acceleration Programme objectives.\n- \u00b7 Debt measures allow management to record and monitor both operating cash generation and the Group's ongoing financing and liquidity position.\n\n## Changes to APMs in the year\n\nThe Group has defined a new capital APM in the year of 'Adjusted investment, capital and acquisition expenditure'. The APM is comprised of the existing 'Adjusted investment and capital expenditure' metric, but also includes cash consideration paid for business combination acquisitions. During the year the Group completed the acquisition of a controlling 80% stake in its Japanese offshore renewable development platform, SSE Pacifico (see note 12) and announced the expected acquisition, in financial year ended 31 March 2023, of a European onshore renewable energy development platform from Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy ('SGRE'). As the Group expands internationally it is expected that there will be further acquisitions to enhance the Group's development portfolio. These acquisition costs are included in this new APM to better represent the Group's overall investments associated with its Net Zero Acceleration Programme.\n\nAs referred above, during the year the Group acquired a controlling 80% stake in SSE Pacifico (see note 12). As a result, the Group has now updated its APMs to clarify how non-controlling interests will be presented in future periods where there are expected to be material non-controlling interests. The Group believes that removing the non-controlling interest share from all of its profit, capital and debt measures on a consistent basis is the most simple, understandable and reflective presentation of the Group's interest in these businesses. There is no significant impact on adjusted metrics in the year ending 31 March 2022.\n\nOn 14 October 2021, the Group disposed of its Gas Production business (see note 12.2), but retained 60% of the decommissioning provision of the business. The Group has amended its adjusted profit measures to remove the effect of prospective revaluation adjustments to the decommissioning provision as it is not considered to be part of the Group's core continuing operations.\n\nThe following section explains the key APMs applied by the Group and referred to in these statements:\n\n## Profit measures\n\nClosest equivalent\n\n| Group APM                                                                        | Purpose         | IFRS measure     | Adjustments to reconcile to primary financial statements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax,  depreciation  and amortisation) | Profit  measure | Operating profit | \u00b7  Movement on operating and joint venture financing derivatives  ('certain/uni00A0re-measurements') \u00b7  Exceptional items \u00b7  Adjustments to retained Gas Production decommissioning provision \u00b7  Share of joint ventures and associates' interest and tax \u00b7  Depreciation and amortisation before exceptional charges (including |\n| Adjusted  operating profit                                                       | Profit  measure | Operating profit | \u00b7  Movement on operating and joint venture financing derivatives  ('certain/uni00A0re-measurements') \u00b7  Exceptional items \u00b7  Adjustments to retained Gas Production decommissioning provision \u00b7  Depreciation and amortisation expense on fair value uplifts \u00b7  Share of joint ventures and associates' interest and tax         |",

Certain of these contracts (predominately purchase contracts) are determined to be derivative financial instruments under IFRS 9 and as such are required to be recorded at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of those commodity contracts designated as IFRS 9 financial instruments are reflected in the income statement (as part of 'certain re-measurements'). The Group shows the change in the fair value of these forward contracts separately as this mark-to-market movement is not relevant to the underlying performance of its operating segments due to the volatility that can arise on revaluation. The Group will recognise the underlying value of these contracts as the relevant commodity is delivered, which will predominantly be within the subsequent 12 to 24 months. Conversely, commodity contracts that are not recorded as financial instruments under IFRS 9 (predominately sales contracts) are accounted for as 'own use' contracts and are consequently not recorded until the commodity is delivered and the contract is settled. In addition, gas inventory purchased by the Group's Gas Storage business for secondary trading opportunities is also held at fair value with gains and losses on re-measurement recognised as part of 'certain re-measurements'.\n\nFinancing derivatives include all fair value and cash flow interest rate hedges, non-hedge accounted (mark-to-market) interest rate derivatives, cash flow foreign exchange hedges and non-hedge accounted foreign exchange contracts entered into by the Group to manage its banking and liquidity requirements as well as risk management relating to interest rate and foreign exchange exposures. Changes in the fair value of those financing derivatives are reflected in the income statement (as part of 'certain re-measurements'). The Group shows the change in the fair value of these forward contracts separately as this mark-to-market movement is not relevant to the underlying performance of its operating segments.\n\nThe re-measurements arising from operating and financing derivatives, and the tax effects thereof, are disclosed separately to aid understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.",

        "page_content": "## Alternative Performance Measures continued\n\n## Rationale for adjustments to profit measure continued\n\n## 2  Exceptional Items\n\nExceptional charges or credits, and the tax effects thereof, are considered unusual by nature or scale and of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the underlying performance of the Group to be properly understood. Further explanation for the classification of an item as exceptional is included in note 3.2.\n\n## 3  Adjustments to retained Gas Production decommissioning provision\n\nOn 14 October 2021, the Group disposed of its Gas Production business but retained a 60% share of the decommissioning obligation of the business. Gas Production was presented as a discontinued operation prior to disposal as the transaction constituted the exit of all activity in that industry. Future adjustments to the decommissioning obligation will be accounted for through the Group's consolidated income statement. The adjustment is removed from the Group's adjusted profit measures as the revaluation of the provision is not considered to be part of the Group's core continuing operations.\n\n## 4  Share of joint ventures and associates' interest and tax\n\nThis adjustment can be split between the Group's share of interest and the Group's share of tax arising from its investments in equity accounted joint ventures and associates.\n\nThe Group is required to report profit before interest and tax ('operating profit') including its share of the profit after tax of its equity accounted joint ventures and associates. However, for internal performance management purposes and for consistency of treatment, SSE reports its adjusted operating profit measures before its share of the interest and/or tax on joint ventures and associates.\n\n## 5  Share of joint ventures and associates' depreciation and amortisation\n\nFor management purposes, the Group considers EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) based on a sum-of-the-parts derived metric which includes a share of the EBITDA from equity accounted investments. While this is not equal to adjusted cash generated from operating activities, it is considered useful by management in assessing a proxy for such a measure, given the complexity of the Group structure and the range of investment structures utilised. For the purpose of calculating the 'Net Debt to EBITDA' metric referred at page 90 \uf150 , 'adjusted EBITDA' is further refined to remove the proportion of adjusted EBITDA from equityaccounted joint ventures relating to off-balance sheet debt (see note 5.1(v)).\n\n## 6  Depreciation and amortisation expense on fair value uplifts\n\nThe Group's strategy includes the realisation of value and recycling of proceeds from divestments of stakes in its early stage offshore and international SSE Renewables developments. In addition, for strategic purposes the Group may also decide to bring in equity partners to other businesses and assets. Where SSE's interest in such vehicles changes from full to joint control, and the subsequent arrangement is classified as an equity accounted joint venture, SSE will recognise a fair value uplift on the remeasurement of its retained equity investment. Those uplifts will be treated as exceptional (and non-cash) gains in the year of the relevant transactions completing. These uplifts create assets which are subsequently depreciated or amortised over the remaining life of the underlying assets or contracts in those businesses with the charge being included in the Group's adjusted depreciation and amortisation expense. The Group's adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before tax and adjusted earnings per share have therefore been adjusted to exclude this additional depreciation and amortisation expense from the fair value uplift given the charges derived from significant one-off gains which are treated as exceptional when initially recognised.\n\n## 7  Release of deferred income\n\nThe Group deducts the amortisation of deferred income in the year from its adjusted EBITDA metric as it principally relates to customer contributions towards the build of depreciating assets. As the metric adds back depreciation, the amortisation credit is also deducted.\n\n## 8  Non-recurring joint venture refinancing costs\n\nThe Group's joint venture investment, Beatrice Offshore Winds Limited ('BOWL'), completed a refinancing of its debt in the year ended 31 March 2020, which resulted in transaction costs from the original debt of \u00a327.2m being expensed to the income statement of the joint venture. In addition, \u00a33.5m of costs related to the repayment of the original instrument were incurred. The Group's 40% share of the \u00a330.7m expense was \u00a312.3m, which was adjusted from the Group's adjusted profit before tax and the Group's adjusted finance costs in the year ended 31 March 2020 as refinancing of this scale is non-recurring, considered to be specific to this instance and therefore not representative of normal operations.\n\n## 9  Interest on net pension assets/liabilities (IAS 19 'Employee Benefits')\n\nThe Group's interest charges relating to defined benefit pension schemes are derived from the net assets/liabilities of the schemes as valued under IAS 19. This will mean that the charge recognised in any given year will be dependent on the impact of actuarial assumptions such as inflation and discount rates. The Group excludes these from its adjusted profit measures due to the non-cash nature of these charges or credits.\n\n## 10  Deferred tax\n\nThe Group adjusts for deferred tax when arriving at adjusted profit after tax, adjusted earnings per share and its adjusted effective rate of tax. Deferred tax arises as a result of differences in accounting and tax bases that give rise to potential future accounting credits or charges. As the Group remains committed to its ongoing capital programme, the liabilities associated are not expected to reverse and accordingly the Group excludes these from its adjusted profit measures.",

Consequently, their coupon payments are presented within dividends rather than within finance costs. As a result, the coupon payments are not included in SSE's adjusted profit before tax measure. In order to present total funding provided from sources other than ordinary shareholders, SSE presents its adjusted net debt measure inclusive of hybrid capital to better reflect the Group's funding position.\n\n## 13  Outstanding liquid funds\n\nOutstanding liquid funds are SSE cash balances held by counterparties as collateral at the year end. SSE includes these as cash until they are utilised for the purposes of calculating adjusted net debt. Loans with a maturity of less than three months are also included in this adjustment. The Group includes this adjustment in order to better reflect the immediate cash resources to which it has access, which in turn better reflects the Group's funding position.",

The Group excludes these liabilities from its adjusted net debt and hybrid capital measure to better reflect the Group's underlying funding position with its primary sources of capital.\n\n## 15  Debt and cash attributable to non-controlling holders\n\nThe Group's structure includes non-wholly owned but controlled subsidiaries which are consolidated within the financial statements of the Group under IFRS. There is no impact to current or prior years but in future the Group will remove the share of debt and cash in these subsidiaries proportionately attributable to the non-controlling interest holders from its adjusted net debt and hybrid capital metric to present net debt attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Group.\n\n|                                      | March 2022 \u00a3m   | March 2021 \u00a3m   | March 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Unadjusted net debt                  | (8,015.4)       | (7,810.4)       | (10,007.8)      |\n| Outstanding liquid funds             | 74.7            | ( 3 7. 1 )      | 256.4           |\n| Lease obligations                    | 393.5           | 421.0           | 455.2           |\n| Adjusted Net Debt                    | ( 7, 5 47. 2)   | ( 7, 426. 5)    | (9,296.2)       |\n| Hybrid equity                        | (1,051.0)       | (1,472.4)       | (1,169.7)       |\n| Adjusted Net Debt and Hybrid Capital | (8,598.2)       | (8,898.9)       | (10,465.9)      |\n\n## Capital measures\n\nClosest equivalent\n\n| Group APM                                                  | Purpose          | IFRS measure                                                                 | Adjustments to reconcile to primary financial statements                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Adjusted Investment and  Capital Expenditure               | Capital  measure | Capital additions  to intangible  assets and  property, plant  and equipment | \u00b7  Customer funded additions \u00b7  Allowances and certificates \u00b7  Additions acquired through business combinations \u00b7  Disposed or impaired additions \u00b7  Joint ventures and associate additions funding \u00b7  Non-controlling share of capital expenditure |\n| Adjusted Investment,  Capital and Acquisition  Expenditure | Capital  measure | Capital additions  to intangible  assets and  property, plant and equipment  | \u00b7  Customer funded additions \u00b7  Allowances and certificates \u00b7  Additions acquired through business combinations \u00b7  Disposed or impaired additions \u00b7  Joint ventures and associates' additions funding                                               |\n\n## Adjustments to capital measure\n\n## 16  Customer funded additions\n\nCustomer funded additions represents additions to electricity and other networks funded by customer contributions.

Where the Group acquires an established business requiring a fair value assessment in line with the principles of IFRS 3 'Business Combinations', the fair value of consolidated tangible or intangible assets are excluded from the Group's 'adjusted investment and capital expenditure', as they are not direct capital expenditure by the Group. However, these are included in the Group's new 'adjusted investment, capital and acquisition expenditure' metric, see 24 below.",

        "page_content": "## 19  Additions subsequently disposed/impaired\n\nIn the current year there were capex additions of \u00a313.9m related to the Gas Production business, which was disposed on 14 October 2021. In the prior year the Group funded \u00a319.7m of capex additions in relation to the Seagreen windfarm prior to part disposal. On 3 June 2020, the Group disposed of a 51% stake in Seagreen 1, therefore the capex incurred prior to that date has been excluded from the Group's net adjusted investment and capital expenditure metric. In the year ended 31 March 2020, there were additions of \u00a344.6m in the Group's Gas Production segment which were subsequently impaired following the annual impairment assessment. This adjustment also includes any subsequently derecognised development expenditure.\n\n## 20  Joint ventures and associates' additions funding\n\nJoint ventures and associates' additions included in the Group's capital measures represent the direct loan or equity funding provided by the Group to joint venture and associate arrangements in relation to capital expenditure projects. This has been included to better reflect the Group's use of directly funded equity accounted vehicles to grow the Group's asset base. Asset additions funded by project finance raised within the Group's joint ventures and associates is not included in this adjustment.\n\n## 21  Non-controlling share of capital expenditure\n\nThe Group's structure includes non-wholly owned but controlled subsidiaries which are consolidated within the financial statements of the Group under IFRS. In future, the Group will remove the share of capital additions attributable proportionately to these equity holders from its 'adjusted investment and capital expenditure' and 'adjusted investment, capital and acquisition expenditure' metrics. This is consistent with the adjustments noted elsewhere related to these non-controlling interests. This has no impact on the current or prior year metrics.\n\n## 22  Refinancing proceeds/refunds\n\nThe Group's model for developing large scale capital projects within joint ventures and associates involves project finance being raised within those entities. Where the Group funds early stage capex which is then subsequently reimbursed to SSE following the receipt of project finance within the vehicle, the refinance proceeds are included in the Group's net adjusted investment and capital expenditure metric. This is consistent with the inclusion of the initial investment in the metric as explained at 18, above. In the year ended 31 March 2021, the Group received reimbursed capex of \u00a3246.1m in relation to Seagreen windfarm and \u00a3182.5m in relation to Doggerbank windfarm. These receipts have been deducted from the Group's adjusted investment and capital expenditure metric.\n\n## 23  Lease additions\n\nAdditions of right of use assets under the Group's IFRS 16 compliant policies for lease contracts are excluded from the Group's adjusted capital measures as they do not represent directly funded capital investment. This is consistent with the treatment of lease obligations explained at 14, above.\n\n## 24  Acquisition cash consideration in relation to business combinations\n\nThe Group has outlined a significant investment programme which will partly be achieved through the acquisition of businesses with development opportunities for the Group. The cash consideration paid for these entities is included within the Group's new adjusted investment, capital and acquisition expenditure metric as it provides stakeholders an accurate basis of cash investment into the Group's total development pipeline and is consistent with the reporting of the Group's Net Zero Acceleration Programme.\n\n|                                                                        | March 2022 \u00a3m   | March 2021 \u00a3m   | March 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Capital additions to intangible assets                                 | 921.0           | 701.3           | 973.6           |\n| Capital additions to property, plant & equipment                       | 1,398.8         | 1,102.5         | 1,097.6         |\n| Capital additions to intangible assets and property, plant & equipment | 2,319.8         | 1,803.8         | 2,071.2         |\n| Customer funded additions                                              | (91.3)          | (61.8)          | (110.7)         |\n| Allowances and certificates                                            | (544.5)         | (509.0)         | (652.7)         |\n| Additions through business combinations                                | (197.8)         | -               | (26.4)          |\n| Additions subsequently disposed/impaired                               | (13.9)          | (19.7)          | (44.6)          |\n| Joint ventures and associates' additions                               | 682.5           | 172.7           | 167.1           |\n| Refinancing proceeds/refunds                                           | (136.7)         | (428.6)         | -               |\n| Lease asset additions                                                  | (85.7)          | (45.4)          | (46.5)          |\n| Adjusted Investment and Capital expenditure                            | 1,932.4         | 912.0           | 1,357.4         |\n| Acquisition cash consideration                                         | 141.3           | -               | -               |\n| Adjusted Investment, Capital and Acquisition Expenditure               | 2,073.7         | 912.0           | 1,357.4         |",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2022\n\n## 1. General information and basis of preparation\n\n## 1.1. General information\n\nSSE plc (the Company) is a company domiciled in Scotland. The address of the registered office is given on the back cover. The Group's operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report. The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2022 comprise those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group). The Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about the Group, these can be seen on pages 324 to 335 \uf150 .\n\n## 1.2. Basis of preparation\n\n## Statement of compliance\n\nThe financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 24 May 2022. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the period to 31 December 2023. The financial statements are therefore prepared on a going concern basis.\n\nIn addition, further details of the Group's liquidity position and going concern review are provided in A6 Accompanying Information to the Financial Statements on page 312 \uf150 .\n\n## Basis of measurement\n\nThe financial statements of the Group are prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain gas inventory, derivative financial instruments, financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss or other comprehensive income on initial recognition, assets of the Group pension schemes, all of which are measured at their fair value, and liabilities of the Group pension schemes which are measured using the projected unit credit method. The directors believe the financial statements present a true and fair view. The financial statements of the Group are presented in pounds sterling. The basis for including operations and transactions conducted in currencies other than pounds sterling is provided in A1 Accompanying Information to the Financial Statements on page 290 \uf150 .\n\n## Use of estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements conforming with adopted IFRS requires the use of certain accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies. The areas involving a higher level of judgement or estimation are summarised at pages 222 to 224 \uf150 .\n\n## Changes to presentation - prior year adjustments\n\n## Discontinued operations\n\nOn 2 August 2021, the Group announced it had agreed to sell its 33.3% stake in gas distribution operator SGN to a consortium comprising existing SGN shareholders Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board and Brookfield Super-Core Infrastructure Partners for cash consideration of \u00a31,225m. The transaction completed on 22 March 2022, with the Group recognising an exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a3576.5m within discontinued activities. The Group assessed that the investment met the criteria to be classified as held for sale on 11 June 2021 when an Exclusivity Agreement was signed by the consortium. Accordingly, from 11 June 2021 the Group ceased to equity account for its investment in SGN on designation as held for sale. As the investment in SGN comprised a separate single major line of business, the investment was also classified as a discontinued operation. Therefore, comparative information for the year ended 31 March 2021 has been restated. The impact of reclassification of the SGN investment to discontinued operations has been to reduce adjusted operating profit for continuing operations for March 2021 by \u00a3173.0m; reduce adjusted profit before tax for continuing operations for March 2021 by \u00a3116.0m; and reduce adjusted earnings per share for continuing operations for March 2021 by 9.1p. Total results for the Group in the prior year are unchanged.\n\n## Segments\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of IFRS 8 'Operating Segments' the Group has aligned its segmental disclosures with its revised internal reporting following changes to the Group's structure and operations. These segments are used internally by the Group Executive Committee to in order to assess operating performance and to make decisions on how to allocate capital. Consequently, the segmental results reported in the Group's operating segments have been restated with effect from 1 April 2021. Following the Group's sale of its Contacting and Rail business to Aurelius Group, the primary retained activities of the Enterprise business is Distributed Energy which will develop and provide the Group's solar and battery storage operations and focus on distributed generation, heat and cooling networks, smart buildings and EV charging. Accordingly, the result from the Group's out of areas networks business and Neos Networks Limited joint venture will now be reported within SSEN Distribution and Corporate Unallocated respectively. Comparative segmental information in note 5 has been represented to reflect the change to these segments. The impact of the restatements are an increase to reported revenue of SSEN Distribution (March 2021: \u00a325.0m) and a decrease to the reported revenue of Distributed Energy (March 2021: \u00a325.0m), and an increase to the adjusted operating profit of SSEN Distribution (March 2021 \u00a38.5m), an increase to the adjusted operating loss of Distributed Energy (March 2021: \u00a35.7m) and an increase to the adjusted operating loss of Corporate Unallocated (March 2021: \u00a32.8m).\n\n## Changes to estimates\n\nThere have been no changes to the basis of accounting estimates during the current and prior year.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2022\n\n## 2. New accounting policies and reporting changes\n\nThe principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below and in the A1 Accompanying Information to the Financial Statements on pages 290 to 300 \uf150 .\n\n## 2.1 New standards, amendments and interpretations effective or adopted by the Group\n\nPhase 2 of the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform became effective for the Group from 1 April 2021. Under Phase 2, provided that the new basis for calculating cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis, reliefs permit hedge accounting relationships to continue unaffected. The Group has applied these reliefs to continue hedge accounting on affected instruments and therefore adoption of the amendment had no impact on the financial statements.\n\nThe amendment to IFRS 16 'Covid-19 Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021' had no impact on the financial statements.\n\n## 2.2 New standards, amendments and interpretations issued, but not yet adopted by the Group\n\nA number of standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued but not yet adopted by the Group within these financial statements, because application is not yet mandatory or because UK adoption remains outstanding at the date the financial statements were authorised for issue.\n\nAmendments to IAS 16 'Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds Before Intended Use' is effective from 1 January 2022 and was endorsed by the UK Endorsement Board in April 2022, subsequent to the balance sheet date. The standard will be applied from 1 April 2022, with retrospective application in periods presented. During the year ended 31 March 2022, the Group earned pre-commissioning revenue during the testing and commissioning phases of its Keadby 2 CCGT and Gordonbush windfarm extension project. Restatement of prior year comparatives will not have a material impact on reported results in those periods.\n\nIFRS 17 'Insurance contracts' is expected to be effective from 1 January 2023 (1 April 2023 for the Group) but remains subject to UK endorsement. The Group's initial expectation is that adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThere are a number of other interpretations and amendments issued but not yet effective at 31 March 2022. These are not anticipated to have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 3. Adjusted accounting measures\n\nThe Group applies the use of adjusted accounting measures or alternative performance measures ('APMs') throughout the Annual Report and Financial Statements. These measures enable the Directors to present the underlying performance of the Group and its segments to the users of the statements in a consistent and meaningful manner. The adjustments applied and certain terms such as 'adjusted operating profit', 'adjusted earnings per share', 'adjusted EBITDA', 'adjusted investment and capital expenditure', 'adjusted investment, capital and acquisition expenditure' and 'adjusted net debt and hybrid equity' that are not defined under IFRS and are explained in more detail below. In addition, the section 'Alternative Performance Measures' at page 204 \uf150 provides further context and explanation of these terms.\n\n## 3.1 Adjusted measures\n\nThe Directors assess the performance of the Group and its reportable segments based on 'adjusted measures'. These measures are used for internal performance management and are believed to be appropriate for explaining underlying performance to users of the accounts. These measures are also deemed useful for ordinary shareholders of the Company and for other stakeholders.\n\nThe performance of the reportable segments is reported based on adjusted profit before interest and tax ('adjusted operating profit'). This is reconciled to reported profit before interest and tax by adding back exceptional items and certain re-measurements (see note 3.2 below), depreciation on fair value uplifts, the share of operating profit attributable to non-controlling interests, adjustments to the retained Gas Production decommissioning provision and after the removal of interest and taxation on profits from equity-accounted joint ventures and associates.\n\nThe performance of the Group is reported based on adjusted profit before tax which excludes exceptional items and certain remeasurements (see note 3.2 below), depreciation on fair value uplifts, the share of profit before tax attributable to non-controlling interests, non-recurring financing costs in joint ventures, the net interest costs associated with defined benefit schemes, adjustments to the retained Gas Production decommissioning provision and taxation on profits from equity-accounted joint ventures and associates. The interest charges or credits on defined benefit schemes removed are non-cash and are subject to variation based on actuarial valuations of scheme liabilities.\n\nThe Group also uses adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation ('adjusted EBITDA') as an alternative operating performance measure which acts as a management proxy for cash generated from operating activities. This does not take into account the rights and obligations that SSE has in relation to its equity-accounted joint ventures and associates. This measure excludes exceptional items and certain re-measurements (see note 3.2 below), the depreciation charged on fair value uplifts, the share of EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interests, adjustments to the retained Gas Production decommissioning provision, nonrecurring financing costs in joint ventures, the net interest costs associated with defined benefit schemes, depreciation and amortisation from equity-accounted joint ventures and associates and interest and taxation on profits from equity-accounted joint ventures and associates. For the purpose of calculating the 'Net Debt to EBITDA' metric referred at page 90 \uf150 , 'adjusted EBITDA' is further adjusted to remove the proportion of adjusted EBITDA from equity-accounted joint ventures relating to off-balance sheet debt (see note 5.1(v)).",

        "page_content": "The Group's key performance measure is adjusted earnings per share (EPS), which is based on basic earnings per share before exceptional items and certain re-measurements (see note 3.2 below), depreciation on fair value uplifts, adjustments to the retained Gas Production decommissioning provision, non-recurring financing costs in joint ventures, the net interest costs associated with defined benefit schemes and after the removal of deferred taxation and other taxation items. Deferred taxation is excluded from the Group's adjusted EPS because of the Group's significant ongoing capital investment programme, which means that the deferred tax is unlikely to reverse. Adjusted profit after tax is presented on a basis consistent with adjusted EPS except for the non-inclusion of payments to holders of hybrid equity.\n\nThe financial statements also include an 'adjusted net debt and hybrid equity' measure. This presents financing information on the basis used for internal liquidity risk management. This measure excludes obligations due under lease arrangements and the share of net debt attributable to non-controlling interests, and includes cash held as collateral on commodity trading exchanges, cash presented as held for sale and other short term loans. The measure represents the capital owed to investors, lenders and equity holders other than the ordinary shareholders. As with 'adjusted earnings per share', this measure is considered to be of relevance to the ordinary shareholders of the Group as well as other stakeholders and interested parties.\n\nFinally, the financial statements include an 'adjusted investment and capital expenditure' and an 'adjusted investment, capital and acquisition expenditure' measure. These metrics represent the capital invested by the Group in projects that are anticipated to provide a return on investment over future years or which otherwise support Group operations and is consistent with internally applied metrics. They therefore include capital additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and also the Group's direct funding of joint venture and associates capital projects. The Group has considered it appropriate to report these values both internally and externally in this manner due to its use of equity-accounted investment vehicles to grow the Group's asset base, where the Group is providing a source of funding to the vehicle through either loans or equity. The Group does not include project funded capital additions in these metrics, nor does it include other capital invested in joint ventures and associates. Where initial capital funding of an equity accounted joint venture is refunded, these refunds are deducted from the metrics in the year the refund is received. In addition, the Group excludes from this metric additions to its property, plant and equipment funded by Customer Contributions and additions to intangible assets associated with Allowances and Certificates. The Group also excludes the share of investment and capital expenditure attributable to non-controlling interests. The 'adjusted investment, capital and acquisition expenditure' measure also includes cash consideration paid by the Group in business combinations which contribute to growth of the Group's capital asset base and is considered to be relevant metric in context of the Group's Net Zero Acceleration Programme. As with 'adjusted earnings per share', these measures are considered to be of relevance to the ordinary shareholders of the Group as well as other stakeholders and interested parties.\n\nReconciliations from reported measures to adjusted measures along with further description of the rationale for those adjustments are included in the 'Adjusted Performance Measures' section at pages 204 to 212 \uf150 .\n\nAPM Where the Group have referred to an adjusted performance measure in the financial statements the following sign is presented to denote this.\n\n## 3.2 Exceptional items and certain re-measurements\n\nExceptional items are those charges or credits that are considered unusual by nature and/or scale and of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the financial statements to be properly understood. The trigger points for recognition of items as exceptional items will tend to be non-recurring although exceptional charges (or credits) may impact the same asset class or segment over time.\n\nMarket conditions that have deteriorated or improved significantly over time will only be captured to the extent observable at the balance sheet date. Examples of items that may be considered exceptional include material asset or business impairment charges, reversals of historic impairments, business restructuring costs and reorganisation costs, significant realised gains or losses on disposal, unrealised fair value adjustments on part disposal of a subsidiary and provisions in relation to contractual settlements associated with or material significant disputes and claims.\n\nThe Group operates a policy framework for estimating whether items are considered to be exceptional. This framework, which is reviewed annually, estimates the materiality of each broad set of potentially exceptional circumstances, after consideration of strategic impact and likelihood of recurrence, by reference to the Group's key performance measure of adjusted earnings per share. This framework estimates that any relevant item greater than \u00a330.0m will be considered exceptional, with lower thresholds applied to circumstances that are considered to have a greater strategic impact and are less likely to recur. The only exception to this threshold is for gains or losses on disposal or divestment of early stage international or offshore wind farm development projects which are considered non-exceptional in line with the Group's strategy to generate recurring gains from developer divestments.\n\nCertain re-measurements are re-measurements arising on certain commodity, interest rate and currency contracts which are accounted for as held for trading or as fair value hedges in accordance with the Group's policy for such financial instruments, or remeasurements on stocks of commodities held at the balance sheet date. The amount shown in the before exceptional items and certain re-measurements results for these contracts is the amount settled in the year as disclosed in note 24.1.\n\nThis excludes commodity contracts not treated as financial instruments under IFRS 9 where held for the Group's own use requirements which are not recorded until the underlying commodity is delivered.\n\nThe impact of changes in Corporation Tax rates on deferred tax balances are also included within certain remeasurements.",

Adjusted accounting measures continued\n\n## 3.3 Other additional disclosures\n\nAs permitted by IAS 1 'Presentation of financial statements', the Group's income statement discloses additional information in respect of joint ventures and associates, exceptional items and certain re-measurements to aid understanding of the Group's financial performance and to present results clearly and consistently.\n\n## 4. Accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nIn the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, management are required to make judgements and estimates that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. Changes in the assumptions underlying the estimates could result in a significant impact to the financial statements. The Group's key accounting judgement and estimation areas are noted below, with the most significant financial judgement areas as specifically considered by the Audit Committee being highlighted separately.\n\n## 4.1 Significant financial judgements and estimation uncertainties\n\nThe preparation of these financial statements has specifically considered the following significant financial judgements, some of which are also areas of estimation uncertainty as noted below.\n\n## (i) Impairment testing and valuation of certain non-current assets - financial judgement and estimation uncertainty\n\nThe Group reviews the carrying amounts of its goodwill, other intangible assets, specific property, plant and equipment and investment assets to determine whether any impairment of the carrying value of those assets requires to be recorded. Where an indicator of impairment or impairment reversal exists, the recoverable amount of those assets is determined by reference to value in use calculations or fair value less cost to sell assessments, if more appropriate. The specific assets under review in the year ended 31 March 2022 are intangible development assets and specific property, plant and equipment assets related to gas storage and thermal power generation. In addition, the Group performed an impairment review over the carrying value of its investment in Neos Networks Limited.\n\nIn conducting its reviews, the Group makes judgements and estimates in considering both the level of cash generating unit (CGU) at which common assets such as goodwill are assessed against, as well as the estimates and assumptions behind the calculation of recoverable amount of the respective assets or CGUs.\n\nChanges to the estimates and assumptions on factors such as regulation and legislation changes (including climate change related regulation), power, gas, carbon and other commodity prices, volatility of gas prices, plant running regimes and load factors, discount rates and other inputs could impact the assessed recoverable value of assets and CGUs and consequently impact the Group's income statement and balance sheet.\n\nFurther detail of the calculation basis and key assumptions used in the impairment review, the resulting impairment reversals and the sensitivity of this assessment to key assumptions is disclosed at note 15. Detail on the accounting policies applied is included in the Accompanying Information section A1.\n\n## (ii) Retirement benefit obligations - estimation uncertainty\n\nThe assumptions in relation to the cost of providing post-retirement benefits during the year are based on the Group's best estimates and are set after consultation with qualified actuaries. While these assumptions are believed to be appropriate, a change in these assumptions would impact the level of the retirement benefit obligation recorded and the cost to the Group of administering the schemes.\n\nFurther detail of the calculation basis and key assumptions used, the resulting movements in obligations, and the sensitivity of key assumptions to the obligation is disclosed at note 23.\n\n## (iii) Revenue recognition - Customers unbilled supply of energy/uni00A0- estimation uncertainty\n\nRevenue from energy supply activities undertaken by the Business Energy and Airtricity businesses includes an estimate of the value of electricity or gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end. This estimation comprises both billed revenue and unbilled revenue and is calculated based on applying the tariffs and contract rates applicable to customers against estimated customer consumption, taking account of various factors including usage patterns, weather trends and externally notified aggregated volumes supplied to customers from national settlements bodies. A change in the assumptions underpinning the calculation would have an impact on the amount of revenue recognised in any given period. The sensitivity associated with this judgement factor is disclosed at note 18.\n\nThis estimation is subject to an internal corroboration process which compares of calculated unbilled volumes to a theoretical 'perfect billing' benchmark measure of unbilled volumes (in GWh and millions of therms) derived from historical weather-adjusted consumption patterns and aggregated metering data used in industry reconciliation processes. Furthermore, actual meter readings and billings continue to be compared to unbilled estimates between the balance sheet date and the finalisation of the financial statements.\n\nGiven the non-routine process, the number and the extent of differing inputs and the requirement of management to apply judgement noted above, the estimated revenue is considered a significant estimate made by management in preparing the financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## (iv) Valuation of other receivables - financial judgement and estimation uncertainty\n\nThe Group holds a \u00a3100m loan note due from Ovo Energy Limited following the disposal of SSE Energy Services on 15 January 2020. The loan carries interest at 13.25% and is presented cumulative of accrued interest payments, discounted at 13.25%. At 31 March 2022, the carrying value (net of expected credit loss provision of \u00a31.8m) is \u00a3131.0m.\n\nConsistent with the prior year, the Group has assessed recoverability of the loan note receivable and has recognised a provision for expected credit loss in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9. Due to recent market volatility, the Group's assessment of the value of the loan note is now considered a more significant financial judgement. While the carrying value is considered to be appropriate, changes in economic conditions could lead to a change in the level of expected credit loss incurred by the Group.\n\n## (v) Impact of climate change and the transition to net zero - financial judgement and estimation uncertainty\n\nClimate change and the transition to net zero have been considered in the preparation of these financial statements. The Group has a clearly articulated Net Zero Acceleration Programme ('NZAP') set out on pages 4 to 5 \uf150 to lead in the UK's transition to net zero and aligns its investment plans and business activities to that strategy. The impact of future climate change regulation could have a material impact on the currently reported amounts of the Group's assets and liabilities.\n\nIn preparing these financial statements, the following has been considered:\n\n## Valuation of property, plant and equipment, and impairment assessment of goodwill\n\nIn the medium term, the transition to net zero may result in regulation restricting electricity generation from unabated gas fired power stations. The Group's view is that flexible generation capacity, such as the Group's fleet of CCGT power stations, will be an essential part of the net zero transition in order to provide security of supply to a market which is increasingly dependent upon renewable sources, which are inherently intermittent. The majority of the Group's GB CCGT fleet is nearing the end of its economic life and it is not currently expected that regulation to require abatement would be introduced before the planned closure of those power stations. Of the value capitalised at 31 March 2022, only two assets are forecast to continue to operate beyond 2030, being Great Island and Keadby 2. The Group's view is that Great Island will continue to be essential to providing security of supply in the Irish electricity market. Keadby 2 is nearing completion and has achieved market leading efficiency throughout test operations. Therefore, the Group considers that other assets operating in the market would be more likely to close before Keadby 2 and the plant will continue to be required to balance the UK electricity market beyond 2030. As a result, the useful economic life of both assets has not been shortened when preparing the 31 March 2022 financial statements. The Group assesses the useful economic life of its Property, Plant and Equipment assets annually. In the short term, the economic return from the balancing activity provided by the Group's GB CCGT assets has increased due to scarcity of supply in the UK electricity market, resulting in the reversal of historic impairments at 31 March 2022. See note 15.2.\n\nA significant increase in renewable generation capacity in the Group's core markets could potentially result in an oversupply of renewable electricity at a point in the future, which would lead to a consequential decrease in the power price achievable for the Group's wind generation assets. The Group has not assessed that this constitutes an indicator of impairment at 31 March 2022 as the Group's baseline investment case models assume a centrally approved volume of new build in these markets. The Group's policy is to test the goodwill balances associated with wind generation portfolio for impairment on an annual basis. Through this impairment assessment (see note 15.1), a sensitivity to power price, which may arise in a market with significant new build, was modelled. This scenario indicated that, despite a modelled 10% reduction in power price, there remained significant headroom on the carrying value in the Group's wind generation assets.\n\nAnother climate related risk to SSE's valuation bases could be changes to weather patterns resulting from global warming. This in turn could result in calmer, drier weather patterns, which would reduce volumes achievable for the Group's wind and hydro generation assets (although noting that this would likely lead to capacity constraints and hence higher prices). This has not been assessed as an indicator of impairment at 31 March 2022, as there is no currently observable evidence to support that scenario directly. However, the Group has performed a sensitivity to its impairment modelling and has assessed that a 15% reduction in achievable volume would result in significant headroom on the carrying value of the assets at 31 March 2022 (see note 15.1).\n\n## Valuations of decommissioning provisions\n\nThe Group holds decommissioning provisions for its Renewable and Thermal generation assets and has retained a 60% share for the decommissioning of its disposed Gas Production business. As noted above, the Group's view at 31 March 2022 is that climate change regulation will not bring forward the closure dates of its CCGT fleet, many of which are expected to close before 2030. Similarly, it is expected that fundamental changes to weather patterns, or the impact of new wind generation capacity will not bring forward the decommissioning of the Group's current wind farm portfolio.\n\nThe discounted share of the Gas Production provision is \u00a3249.4m. At 31 March 2022, the impact of discounting of this retained provision is \u00a333.8m, which is expected to be incurred across the period to 31 March 2037. If the decommissioning activity was accelerated due to changes in legislation, the costs of unwinding the discounting of the provision would be recognised earlier.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2022\n\n## 4. Accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty continued\n\n## 4.2 Other accounting judgements - changes from prior year\n\n## (i) Accounting for the impacts of coronavirus - accounting judgement and estimation uncertainty\n\nFor the years ended 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2021, the Group included a specific accounting judgement and estimation uncertainty in relation to the impact of coronavirus on its operations and going concern assessments. During the current year, the UK economy has continued to recover from the effects of the pandemic, and therefore the specific accounting judgement and estimation uncertainty in relation to the impact of coronavirus is no longer required.\n\n## 4.3 Other areas of estimation uncertainty\n\n## (i) Tax provisioning\n\nThe Group has open tax issues with the tax authorities in the UK. Where management makes a judgement that an outflow of funds is probable, and a reliable estimate of the dispute can be made, provision is made for the best estimate of the most likely liability.\n\nIn estimating any such liability, the Group applies a risk-based approach, taking into account the specific circumstances of each dispute based on management's interpretation of tax law and supported, where appropriate, by discussion and analysis by external tax advisors. These estimates are inherently judgemental and could change substantially over time as disputes progress and new facts emerge. Provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, however the resolution of tax issues can take a considerable period of time to conclude and it is possible that amounts ultimately paid will be different from the amounts provided. Provisions for uncertain tax positions are included in current tax liabilities, and total \u00a327.9m at 31 March 2022 (2021: \u00a337.6m). The Group estimates that a reasonably possible range of settlement outcomes for the uncertain tax provisions given their binary nature is between nil and the full value of the provision.\n\n## (ii) Decommissioning costs\n\nThe calculation of the Group's decommissioning provisions involves the estimation of quantum and timing of cash flows to settle the obligation. The Group engages independent valuation experts to estimate the cost of decommissioning its Renewable, Thermal and Gas Storage assets every three years based on current technology and prices. The last independent assessment for Renewable and Thermal generation assets was performed in the year to 31 March 2022. The last formal assessment for Gas Storage assets was performed in the year to 31 March 2020. Retained decommissioning costs in relation to the disposed Gas Production business are periodically agreed with the field operators and reflect the latest expected economic production lives of the fields.\n\nThe dates for settlement of future decommissioning costs are uncertain, particularly for the disposed gas exploration and production business where reassessment of gas and liquids reserves and fluctuations in commodity prices can lengthen or shorten the field life.\n\nFurther detail on the assumptions applied, including expected decommissioning dates, and movement in decommissioning costs during the year are disclosed at note 20.\n\n## 5. Segmental information\n\nThe changes to the Group's segments in the year are explained at note 1.2 and includes the realignment of the activities of the Distributed Energy business (from the Enterprise segment) and the impact of the Group's investment in SGN being classified as a discontinued operation prior to disposal on 22 March 2022. Comparative information has been represented to reflect the change to these segments. The Group's Gas Production business was disposed on 14 October 2021 and is presented separately as a discontinued operation. The Group's 'Corporate unallocated' segment is the Group's residual corporate central costs which cannot be allocated to individual segments and which now includes the contribution from the Group's Neos Networks joint venture.\n\nThe types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues are:\n\n| Business area         | Reported segments     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Continuing operations | Continuing operations | Continuing operations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Transmission          | SSEN   Transmission   | The economically regulated high voltage transmission of electricity from generating plant to the  distribution network in the North of Scotland.

Included within trade and other payables (note 19) is \u00a3242.5m (2021: \u00a3240.6m) of contract related liabilities. Contract related assets reflect the Group's right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that have transferred to the customer, and contract related liabilities reflect the Group's obligation to transfer future goods or services for which the Group has already received consideration. Contract related assets and liabilities principally arose in the Distributed Energy reporting segment with changes during the periods reflecting ongoing contract progress, offset by cash receipts or customer invoicing.\n\nThe Group has not disclosed information related to the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations on the basis that the Group's contracts either have an original expected duration of less than one year, or permit the Group to recognise revenue as invoiced.\n\nRevenue by geographical location on continuing operations is as follows:\n\n|         | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|\n| UK      | 7,292.1   | 5,834.4   |\n| Ireland | 1,316.1   | 992.0     |\n|         | 8,608.2   | 6,826.4   |",

The net exceptional credit is primarily due to impairment reversals of \u00a3331.5m in relation to the Group's GB combined cycle gas turbine ('CCGT') power stations and the Group's Great Island CCGT plant in Ireland and impairment reversals of \u00a397.3m related to the Group's Gas Storage operations at Atwick and Aldbrough. These credits have been offset by an impairment loss of \u00a3106.9m recognised in relation to the Group's investment in Neos Networks, a further \u00a318.9m loss recognised on completion of the disposal of SSE Contracting on 30 June 2021 and \u00a36.2m consideration adjustment associated with the disposal of the Group's 50% stake in Neos Networks, which completed in the year ended 31 March 2019.\n\nIn discontinued operations, the Group recognised an exceptional gain on the disposal of the Group's 33.3% investment in SGN of \u00a3576.5m, offset by an exceptional charge of \u00a3120.8m associated with the disposal of its Gas Production assets, which completed on 14 October 2021.",

As a result of the assessment, the Group has recognised an exceptional impairment reversal of \u00a3331.6m to the carrying value of the assets.\n\n## (ii) Gas Storage - impairment reversal\n\nAt 31 March 2022, the Group has carried out a formal impairment review in order to assess the carrying value of its Gas Storage operations at Atwick and Aldbrough (see note 15.2). As a result of the assessment, the Group has recognised an exceptional impairment reversal of \u00a397.3m to the carrying value of the assets.\n\n## (iii) SSE Contracting - loss on disposal\n\nOn 30 June 2021, the Group completed the sale of its Contracting and Rail business to the Aurelius Group for headline consideration of \u00a322.5m and \u00a35m of contingent consideration, based on earning targets within the business. Due to working capital adjustments, cash consideration received was \u00a30.2m. The Group recorded a further exceptional loss on disposal of \u00a318.9m on completion, in addition to the exceptional impairment loss of \u00a351.2m recognised during the year ended 31 March 2021.\n\n## (iv) Neos Networks - investment impairment and adjustments to consideration\n\nAt 31 March 2022, the Group has assessed that the value of its investment in Neos Networks has been impaired by \u00a3106.9m. See note 15 for detail of this assessment.\n\nIn the year ended 31 March 2019, the Group disposed of 50% of its stake in Neos Networks Limited (formerly SSE Telecommunications Limited) to Infracapital Partners III, 'Infracap', for initial consideration of \u00a3215.0m and the potential for a further \u00a3165m of contingent consideration dependent on achievement of certain targets. In the year ended 31 March 2022, the Group reassessed its position relating to the retained contingent elements and its contractual position with Infracap, with the net impact being the recognition of an exceptional charge of \u00a36.2m.\n\n## (v) Other credits\n\nAt 31 March 2022, the Group recognised further exceptional credits of \u00a38.1m relating to reversal of previously recognised exceptional charges or judgements. These included i) reassessment of impairments associated with Heat Networks assets (credit of \u00a30.6m), ii) credit of \u00a33.2m (2021: \u00a31.4m) in relation the unwind of discounting on deferred consideration recognised on the part disposal of SSE Slough Multifuel Limited in the year ending 31 March 2021, iii) credit of \u00a34.3m in relation to a gain on disposal of historically impaired land at Seabank.\n\n## Exceptional items within discontinued operations in the year ended 31 March 2022 (vi) SGN disposal gain\n\nOn 2 August 2021, the Group announced it had agreed to sell its 33.3% investment in SGN to a consortium comprising existing SGN shareholders Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board and Brookfield Super-Core Infrastructure Partners for cash consideration of \u00a31,225m. The transaction completed on 22 March 2022, with the Group recognising an exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a3576.5m. See note 12.2 for further information.",

Exceptional items and certain re-measurements continued\n\n## 7.1 Exceptional items continued\n\n## (vii) Gas Production - loss on disposal\n\nThe Group recorded an exceptional disposal loss of \u00a3120.8m related to sale of its Gas Production assets and liabilities to Viaro Energy through its subsidiary RockRose Energy Limited which completed on 14 October 2021. At 30 September 2021 an impairment charge of \u00a393.9m was recognised in relation to the loss on sale incurred to 30 September 2021 under the transaction's lock box mechanism. The further \u00a326.9m recognised in the second half of the financial year represents the profit of the business due to the buyer between 1 October 2021 and the disposal date on 14 October 2021. See note 12.2 for further information.\n\n## Exceptional items in the year ended 31 March 2021\n\nIn the year to 31 March 2021, the Group recognised a net exceptional credit of \u00a3850.3m in its continuing operations. The net exceptional credit was primarily due to gains on disposal of the Group's stakes in Ferrybridge Multifuel (\u00a3669.9m), Walney offshore windfarm (\u00a3188.7m) and Maple SmartMeterCo (\u00a370.4m). In addition, the Group reversed \u00a326.1m of prior year exceptional provisions for bad debt arising from coronavirus and recorded exceptional gains following the fair value uplift of its retained stakes in SSE Slough Multifuel Limited (\u00a321.3m) and Seagreen Holdco 1 Limited (\u00a325.7m). These exceptional credits were offset by an impairment to the Group's Great Island Thermal CCGT plant of \u00a358.1m and a write down to fair value less costs to sell SSE Contracting, which was held for sale at 31 March 2021, of \u00a351.2m. Finally, the Group incurred \u00a324.2m of further charges related to the disposal of SSE Energy Services which was completed in 2020 and reduced the overall gain on disposal, completed in the year ended 31 March 2019, of SSE Telecommunications Limited by \u00a321.8m.\n\nThe net exceptional charges/(credits) recognised can be summarised as follows:\n\nProperty, plant\n\n|                                         | and equipment  (note 14) \u00a3m   | Intangible assets  (note 13) \u00a3m   | Provisions and  other charges \u00a3m   | Trade  receivables \u00a3m   | Other  receivables \u00a3m   | Total charges/ (credits) \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Thermal Electricity Generation (i)      | 58.1                          | -                                 | -                                  | -                       | -                       | 58.1                          |\n| Customer bad debt provisioning (ii)     | -                             | -                                 | -                                  | (26.1)                  | -                       | (26.1)                        |\n| SSE Contracting (iii)                   | -                             | -                                 | 51.2                               | -                       | -                       | 51.2                          |\n| SSE Energy Services disposal costs (iv) | 15.1                          | 5.2                               | 3.9                                | -                       | -                       | 24.2                          |\n| Neos Networks (v)                       | -                             | -                                 | 20.2                               | -                       | 1.6                     | 21.8                          |\n| Other charges (vi)                      | (1.9)                         | -                                 | -                                  | -                       | (1.6)                   | (3.5)                         |\n| Disposal gains (vii)                    | -                             | -                                 | -                                  | -                       | (976.0)                 | (976.0)                       |\n| Total exceptional items                 | 71.3                          | 5.2                               | 75.3                               | (26.1)                  | (976.0)                 | (850.3)                       |\n\n## (i) Thermal Electricity Generation - impairment charges\n\nAt 31 March 2021, the Group carried out a formal impairment review in order to assess the carrying value of its CCGT plant at Great Island. As a result of the assessment, the Group recognised an exceptional impairment of \u00a358.1m to the carrying value of the asset, which arose following reductions in forward price curves and forecast electricity demand in Ireland.\n\n## (ii) Customer bad debt provisioning\n\nIn the year ending 31 March 2020, the Group recognised an exceptional provision for exposure to bad debts of \u00a333.7m specifically related to the coronavirus pandemic within its Business Energy (\u00a327.7m) and Airtricity (\u00a36.0m) businesses. The initial outbreak of the pandemic happened late in 2019 and the UK remained in lockdown at the date of approval of the Annual Report on 16 June 2020, which meant that there was significant uncertainty surrounded the judgement at that date. The provision reflected the Group's best estimate at that date and was treated as an adjusting post balance sheet event. During the year to 31 March 2021, the Group achieved higher cash collections in recovery of its debt than was expected, largely due to government support schemes and other factors. As a result, an exceptional reversal of the provision of \u00a320.1m in its Business Energy and \u00a36.0m in its Airtricity businesses was recognised.\n\n## (iii) SSE Contracting - impairment charges\n\nOn 1 April 2021, subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Group announced the sale of its Contracting & Rail business to Aurelius Group. The transaction was for initial consideration of \u00a317.5m, plus a loan note receivable of \u00a35m, and a further \u00a35m of contingent consideration based upon future financial performance of the business. At 31 March 2021, the Group classified its interest in the business as held for sale and impaired the carrying amount of the held for sale asset to its net realisable value, resulting in an impairment of \u00a351.2m. The transaction completed on 30 June 2021.\n\n## (iv) SSE Energy Services disposal costs\n\nIn 2020, the Group disposed of its SSE Energy Services business to Ovo Energy Limited, incurring an exceptional loss of \u00a3237.7m. The calculation of the loss included estimates for costs of disposal and separation which were subsequently re-estimated in the year to 31 March 2021. These additional costs of disposal, which total \u00a324.2m, included increased estimates of the cost of IT separation and decommissioning and the impairment of SSE properties which were wholly (or substantially) leased to the disposal group.",

        "page_content": "## (v) Neos Networks adjustment to consideration\n\nIn the financial year to 31 March 2019, the Group disposed of 50% of its stake in Neos Networks Limited (formerly SSE Telecommunications Limited) to Infracapital Partners III, 'Infracap', for initial consideration of \u00a3215.0m and the potential for a further \u00a3165m of contingent consideration dependent on achievement of certain targets. In the year ended 31 March 2021, the Group received further cash proceeds of \u00a344m relating to previously accrued deferred consideration but also reassessed its position relating to the retained contingent elements and its contractual position with Infracap, with the net impact being the recognition of an exceptional charge of \u00a320.2m.\n\n## (vi) Other charges\n\nAt 31 March 2021, the Group recognised further exceptional credits of \u00a33.4m relating to reversal of previously recognised exceptional charges or judgements. These included i) reassessment of impairments associated with Heat Networks assets (credit of \u00a32.1m), ii) credit of \u00a31.3m in relation to a gain on disposal of the historically impaired Barkip anerobic digestion plant.\n\n## (vii) Disposal gains\n\nDuring the year ended 31 March 2021 the Group progressed with its disposal plan for non-core assets announced in June 2020, which resulted in exceptional gains on disposal. The exceptional gains on disposal totalling \u00a3976.0m are summarised below. Further detail on the disposals in the year is provided in note 12.\n\nOn 13 October 2020, the Group announced it had reached an agreement to dispose of its 50% investment in Multifuel Energy Limited and Multifuel Energy 2 Limited (together 'MEL') to European Diversified Infrastructure Fund III for headline consideration of \u00a3995m. The transaction completed on 7 January 2021. The Group recorded an exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a3669.9m.\n\nOn 2 September 2020, the Group agreed to sell its subsidiary, SSE Renewables Walney Limited, to Greencoat UK Wind Plc for consideration of \u00a3350m, resulting in an exceptional gain on sale of \u00a3188.7m. SSE Renewables Walney Limited was the holding company of the Group's non-operated 25.1% stake in Walney Offshore Wind Farm. The disposal was not considered to be aligned to the Group's strategic objective of gaining value from divestment of stakes in offshore or international wind developments, therefore the gain on disposal was recognised as exceptional.\n\nOn 23 September 2020, the Group disposed of its 33% investment in Maple Topco Limited, the smart meter services provider, for proceeds of \u00a395.3m, and recognised an exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a370.4m.\n\nOn 3 June 2020, the Group disposed of a 51% stake in its wholly owned subsidiary, Seagreen Holdco 1 Ltd ('Seagreen 1'), to Total. The transaction was for initial cash proceeds of \u00a370m, plus contingent consideration of up to \u00a360m dependent upon future criteria being met. The Group assessed that control of the company was lost on that date, and that the investment in Seagreen 1 should be accounted for as an equity accounted joint venture under the principles of IFRS 11 'Joint Arrangements'. The Group acquired the joint venture investment at fair value under the principles of IFRS 10 'Consolidated Financial Statements', resulting in a total gain of \u00a349.0m. Of that gain, \u00a325.7m was recognised as exceptional, as it represented the fair value gain on acquisition of the joint venture investment retained by the Group. The remaining \u00a323.3m of the gain was included in underlying operations, in line with the Group's stated exceptional policy (see note 3.2).\n\nOn 2 April 2020, the Group disposed of a 50% stake in its wholly owned subsidiary, SSE Slough Multifuel Ltd, to Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners. The transaction was for initial cash proceeds of \u00a310m, plus contingent consideration of up to \u00a359.1m dependent upon future criteria being met. The Group assessed that control of the company was lost on that date, and that the investment in Slough Multifuel should be accounted for as an equity accounted joint venture under the principles of IFRS 11. The Group acquired the joint venture investment at fair value under the principles of IFRS 10, resulting in a total gain of \u00a341.7m. Of that gain, \u00a321.3m was recognised as exceptional, as it represented the fair value gain on acquisition of the joint venture investment retained by the Group. The remaining \u00a320.4m of the gain was included in underlying operations, in line with the Group's stated exceptional policy (see note 3.2).\n\n## Exceptional items in the year ended 31 March 2020\n\nIn the year to 31 March 2020, the Group recognised a net exceptional charge of \u00a3209.7m in its continuing operations and a charge of \u00a3529.0m in its discontinued operations. The net exceptional charge in continuing operations was primarily due to the closure of Fiddler's Ferry coal fired power station (\u00a3112.3m), provisions for bad debts as a result of coronavirus of \u00a333.7m, impairments to SSE assets as a result of the disposal of SSE Energy Services (\u00a348.8m) and other asset impairments and restructuring costs of \u00a345.6m. These exceptional charges were offset by gains on disposal of \u00a330.6m in total related to recognition of additional contingent consideration, offset by related costs and including \u00a32.4m of discount unwind, in relation to the 31 March 2019 disposal of SSE Telecommunications and a completion accounts adjustment to the gain on sale of Stronelairg and Dunmaglass windfarms, also from 31 March 2019 financial year.\n\nIn the discontinued operations, the Group incurred an exceptional impairment on its Gas Production assets of \u00a3291.3m to adjust the carrying value of the assets to their expected fair value on disposal, a loss on disposal of SSE Energy Services of \u00a3226.9m and restructuring costs of \u00a310.8m within SSE Energy Services.",

Certain of these contracts (predominately electricity, gas and other commodity purchase contracts) are determined to be derivative financial instruments under IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' and as such are required to be recorded at their fair value. Conversely, commodity contracts that are not financial instruments under IFRS 9 (predominately electricity sales contracts) are accounted for as 'own use' contracts and are not recorded at their fair value. In addition, inventory purchased to utilise excess capacity ahead of an optimised sale in the market by the Gas Storage business is held as trading inventory at fair value.\n\nChanges in the fair value through the profit and loss statement of those commodity contracts designated as financial instruments and trading inventory are therefore reflected in the income statement. The Group shows the change in the fair value of these forward contracts and trading inventory separately as 'certain re-measurements', as the Group does not believe this mark-to-market movement is relevant to the underlying performance of its operating segments.\n\nAt 31 March 2022, volatility in global commodity markets has resulted in an 'in the money' mark-to-market remeasurement on commodity contracts (predominately gas purchases) designated as financial instruments and trading inventory of \u00a32,100.4m (2021: \u00a3590.1m). However, the Group has executory 'own use' designated commodity contracts (predominately electricity sales) which, if classified as financial instruments and remeasured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9, would significantly reduce the total fair value remeasurement and closing asset value. A significant proportion of 'in the money' mark-to-market remeasurement recorded at 31 March 2022 and unvalued 'own use' designated commodity contracts are expected to reverse in the next financial year as the relevant commodity is delivered. The remaining settlement of these contracts will predominately be within the subsequent 12 to 24 months. The mark-to-market gain in the year has resulted in a deferred tax charge of \u00a3408.0m, which has also been classified as exceptional.\n\nThe re-measurements arising from IFRS 9 and the associated deferred tax are disclosed separately to aid understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.\n\nThis category also includes the income statement movement on financing derivatives (and hedged items) as described in note 24.\n\n## 7.3 Change in UK corporation tax rates\n\nThe Government announced in the Budget on 3 March 2021 that the main rate of corporation tax will increase to 25% for the financial year beginning 1 April 2023. Prior to this date, the rate of corporation tax will remain at 19%. The increase to 25% was substantively enacted at 24 May 2021 and therefore the deferred tax balances have been re-measured at 31 March 2022. The rate change resulted in an income statement charge for continuing operations of \u00a3244.7m and an increase to the Group's deferred tax liabilities (including the effect of equity accounted items) of \u00a3279.5m. The impact of the rate change on the Group's share of profits of its equity accounted investments was a charge of \u00a355.2m for continuing operations and a charge of \u00a385.6m for discontinued operations.\n\nFinance Bill 2021 also included draft legislation in respect of Capital Allowance 'Super-deductions' of 130% in respect of General Pool plant and machinery, alongside First Year Allowances of 50% for Special Rate Pool plant and machinery for the two years commencing 1 April 2021. The Group expects these changes, which were substantively enacted on 24 May 2021, to significantly increase the deduction for Capital Allowances in the financial years ending 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2023. An estimate of the super-deduction has been taken into account when calculating the effective tax for the current year.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe Group has separately recognised the tax effect of the exceptional items and certain re-measurements summarised above.",

Profits earned by the Group in the Republic of Ireland are taxable at either 12.5% or 25%, depending upon the nature of the income.\n\nThe 'adjusted current tax charge' and the 'adjusted effective rate of tax', which are presented in order to best represent underlying performance by making similar adjustments to the 'adjusted profit before tax' measure, are arrived at after the following adjustments:\n\n| Continuing operations                                            | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2022 %   | 2021 \u00a3m (restated*)   | 2021 % (restated*)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|-----------------------|----------------------|\n| Group tax charge and effective rate                              | 882.8     | 25.4     | 224.3                 | 9.3                  |\n| Less: reported deferred tax charge and effective rate            | ( 797.4)  | (22.9)   | (145.4)               | (6.1)                |\n| Reported current tax charge and effective rate                   | 85.4      | 2.5      | 78.9                  | 3.2                  |\n| Effect of adjusting items                                        |           | 4.8      |                       | 5.1                  |\n| Reported current tax charge and effective rate on adjusted basis | 85.4      | 7.3      | 78.9                  | 8.3                  |\n| add:                                                             |           |          |                       |                      |\n| Share of current tax from joint ventures and associates          | 30.6      | 2.6      | 13.2                  | 1.4                  |\n| less:                                                            |           |          |                       |                      |\n| Current tax credit on exceptional items                          | (8.9)     | (0.7)    | (6.2)                 | (0.6)                |\n| Adjusted current tax charge and effective rate APM               | 107.1     | 9.2      | 85.9                  | 9.1                  |\n\n## Tax charge/(credit) recognised in other comprehensive income/(loss):\n\n|                                              | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Relating to:                                 |           |           |\n| Pension scheme actuarial movements           | 72.6      | (3.1)     |\n| Cash flow and net investment hedge movements | 4.4       | (9.9)     |\n| Other                                        | (1.9)     | (1.7)     |\n|                                              | 75.1      | (14.7)    |\n\nAll tax recognised through other comprehensive income is deferred tax.\n\nSee further Taxation disclosures at A2 \uf150 .\n\n## 10.2 Current tax liabilities\n\n|                                   | 2022 \u00a3m   |   2021 \u00a3m |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Corporation tax (asset)/liability | (8.8)     |       0.1 |\n\n## Uncertain tax positions\n\nThe Group invests heavily in infrastructure, on which significant amounts of capital allowances are potentially available. The extent to which capital allowances are available on any single asset is, however, very much dependent upon the fact pattern for the asset involved, and there will often be an element of uncertainty as to how capital allowances legislation applies in those circumstances. Reaching agreement with tax authorities as to the amount of capital allowances available can take a number of years and sometimes can only be resolved through a formal legal process.\n\nThe calculation of the Group's total tax charge therefore necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in relation to certain items for which the tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the tax authorities or, if required, through a formal legal process. At 31 March 2022, the Group has recognised provisions totalling \u00a327.9m in respect of uncertain tax positions, primarily in relation to the availability of capital allowances (2021: \u00a337.6m). The Group estimates that a reasonably possible range of settlement outcomes for the uncertain tax positions could be in the range from nil to the full value of the provision, due to the binary nature of the decision as to whether capital allowances are available or not.",

Taxation continued\n\n## 10.2 Current tax liabilities continued\n\nDue to the uncertainty associated with such tax positions, it is possible that at a future date, and on conclusion of these open tax positions, the final outcomes may vary significantly. While a range of outcomes is reasonably possible, the Group continues to believe that it has made appropriate provision for periods which are open and not yet agreed with the tax authorities.\n\nIn December 2020, the Group's case concerning the availability of capital allowances on Glendoe Hydro Electric Station was heard at the Court of Appeal. A decision was released in February 2021, which was largely in the Group's favour. HMRC have sought permission to have an appeal heard against the decision by the Supreme Court, with the Supreme Court granting HMRC leave to appeal on 30 March 2022. The case has not yet been listed for hearing at the Supreme Court. Any movement in the amounts carried for other uncertain tax positions during the next twelve months will be driven by tax litigation the Group is not directly involved in and is unable to predict the outcome of.\n\n## 10.3 Deferred taxation\n\nThe following are the deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting periods:\n\n|                                                              | Accelerated capital allowances \u00a3m   | Fair value  gains/ (losses) on  derivatives \u00a3m   | Retirement benefit obligations \u00a3m   | Other  \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|------------|\n| At 31 March 2020                                             | 704.5                               | (140.6)                                          | 65.0                                | 16.9        | 645.8      |\n| (Credit)/charge to income statement on continuing operations | 13.5                                | 119.0                                            | 5.9                                 | 7.0         | 145.4      |\n| (Credit)/charge to equity                                    | -                                   | (3.7)                                            | (3.1)                               | (1.7)       | (8.5)      |\n| (Credit)/charge recognised on disposal                       | (0.2)                               | -                                                | -                                   | (5.7)       | (5.9)      |\n| Transfers                                                    | 15.8                                | -                                                | -                                   | (15.8)      | -          |\n| Transferred to held for sale                                 | 0.2                                 | -                                                | -                                   | -           | 0.2        |\n| Exchange adjustments                                         | -                                   | -                                                | -                                   | (2.7)       | (2.7)      |\n| At 31 March 2021                                             | 733.8                               | (25.3)                                           | 67.8                                | (2.0)       | 774.3      |\n| (Credit)/charge to income statement on continuing operations | 407.6                               | 399.4                                            | 5.8                                 | (15.4)      | 797.4      |\n| (Credit)/charge to equity                                    | -                                   | 4.4                                              | 72.6                                | (1.9)       | 75.1       |\n| Exchange adjustment                                          | 0.2                                 | -                                                | -                                   | (1.4)       | (1.2)      |\n| At 31 March 2022                                             | 1,141.6                             | 378.5                                            | 146.2                               | (20.7)      | 1,645.6    |\n\nCertain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset, including the asset balances analysed in the tables above.

The Group has now disposed of its offshore interest which formed the majority of the unrecognised deferred tax asset at 31 March 2021. The group has not recognised a deferred tax asset on trading losses of \u00a347.6m (2021: \u00a349.6m) in the Republic of Ireland. These assets have not been recognised as the Group is uncertain that there will be sufficient future profits against which to utilise the assets. There is no time limit for expiry of the losses or allowances to which they relate.\n\nNo deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future. Total unremitted earnings at 31 March 2022 were \u00a3350.8m (2021: \u00a3281.5m).",

Based on shares in issue at 31 March 2022, this would equate to a final dividend of \u00a3646.0m.\n\n## 11.2 Basic and adjusted earnings per share\n\nThe calculation of basic earnings per ordinary share at 31 March 2022 is based on the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 31 March 2022.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share has been calculated by excluding the charge for deferred tax, interest on net pension liabilities under IAS 19, retained Gas Production decommissioning costs, the depreciation charged on fair value uplifts and the impact of exceptional items and certain re-measurements (note 7).\n\n| Continuing operations                                                  | 2022 Earnings  \u00a3m   | 2022 Earnings per  share pence   | 2021 Earnings  \u00a3m (restated*)   | 2021 Earnings per  share pence (restated*)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders                         | 3,031.4             | 287.3                            | 2,276.2                         | 218.7                                        |\n| Less: earnings attributable to discontinued operations                 | (482.7)             | (45.7)                           | (129.1)                         | (12.4)                                       |\n| Basic earnings on continuing operations used to calculate adjusted EPS | 2,548.7             | 241.6                            | 2,147.1                         | 206.3                                        |\n| Exceptional items and certain re-measurements (note 7)                 | (1,658.9)           | (157.3)                          | (1,380.9)                       | (132.8)                                      |\n| Basic excluding exceptional items and certain re-measurements          | 889.8               | 84.3                             | 766.2                           | 73.5                                         |\n| Adjusted for:                                                          |                     |                                  |                                 |                                              |\n| Decommissioning Gas Production                                         | 13.1                | 1.2                              | -                               | -                                            |\n| Depreciation charge on fair value uplifts                              | 20.6                | 2.0                              | 20.6                            | 2.0                                          |\n| Interest on net pension scheme assets/(liabilities) (note 9)           | ( 7.6)              | (0.7)                            | (8.3)                           | (0.8)                                        |\n| Deferred tax                                                           | 74.5                | 7.1                              | 28.8                            | 2.8                                          |\n| Deferred tax from share of joint ventures and associates               | 15.8                | 1.5                              | 9.1                             | 0.9                                          |\n| Adjusted APM                                                           | 1,006.2             | 95.4                             | 816.4                           | 78.4                                         |\n| Basic                                                                  | 2,548.7             | 241.6                            | 2,147.1                         | 206.3                                        |\n| Dilutive effect of outstanding share options                           | -                   | (0.5)                            | -                               | (0.3)                                        |\n| Diluted                                                                | 2,548.7             | 241.1                            | 2,147.1                         | 206.0                                        |",

Acquisitions, disposals and held-for-sale assets\n\n## 12.1 Acquisitions\n\n## Acquisition of 80% equity interest in Japanese offshore wind development platform\n\nOn 29 October 2021 the Group, through its wholly owned subsidiary SSE Renewables International Holdings Limited, completed the acquisition of an 80% equity interest in an offshore wind development platform from Pacifico Energy and its affiliates for $193m USD upfront cash consideration and a further $30m USD deferred consideration subject to a number of conditions. This acquisition is aligned to the Group's published strategy to pursue overseas renewable opportunities.\n\nAn 80% equity stake was acquired in the following entities and vehicles: SSE Pacifico K.K., Aichi Offshore Wind Power No.1 G.K., Aichi Offshore Wind Power No.2 G.K., Enshunada Offshore Wind Power No.1 G.K., Goto-Fukue Offshore Wind Power G.K., Izu Islands Offshore Wind Power G.K., Minami-Izu Offshore Wind Power No.1 G.K., Niigata Offshore Wind Power No.1 G.K., Oki Islands Offshore Wind Power G.K., Wakayama-West Offshore Wind Power No.1 G.K. and Wakayama-West Offshore Wind Power No.2 G.K.\n\nAcquisition costs of \u00a37.2m were expensed to operating costs in the year. The subsidiaries acquired had nil revenue and contributed a loss of \u00a30.1m to the consolidated result of the Group for the year. The assets and liabilities acquired largely comprise tangible and intangible assets, being windfarm site development costs and goodwill as set out in the table below. The goodwill recognised represents early stage intangible development costs that do not qualify for separate recognition. The non-controlling interest acquired was measured at fair value, where fair value represented the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the assets and liabilities acquired through the transaction.",

In the prior year there were no significant acquisitions. The acquired intangible assets in note 13 of \u00a3197.8m consist of the goodwill balance and development assets noted above (\u00a3197.2m) plus other immaterial acquired assets. The cash consideration for the business combination of \u00a3141.3m is included in the Group's Adjusted investment, capital and acquisition metric.\n\n## 12.2 Disposals\n\n## (i) Significant disposals\n\n## Current year disposals\n\nDuring the year the Group completed its strategic disposal plan for non-core assets announced in June 2020, and continued its programme of strategic partnering generating developer gains. As a result, it recognised an exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a3576.5m of its investment in SGN (discontinued), a combined exceptional loss of \u00a3120.8m on disposal of SSE E&P UK Limited (discontinued) and other less material exceptional gains and losses on disposal (see note 7) and a non-exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a367.1m. The disposals below primarily comprise sales of stakes in non-operated investment assets, or the sale of a stake in early stage offshore windfarm development, which aligns to the Group's stated policy to realise value from these assets.\n\nSale of investment in SSE Contracting: On 30 June 2021, the Group completed the sale of its Contracting and Rail business to the Aurelius Group for headline consideration of \u00a322.5m and \u00a35m of contingent consideration, based on earning targets within the business. Due to working capital movements in the business subsequent to the transaction agreement, cash consideration received was \u00a30.2m. The Group recorded an additional exceptional loss on disposal of \u00a318.9m on completion, in addition to the exceptional impairment loss of \u00a351.2m recognised during the year ended 31 March 2021.\n\nSale of stake in Dogger Bank C: On 10 February 2022, SSE completed the sale of a 10% stake in Dogger Bank C to Eni for consideration of \u00a370.0m and contingent consideration of up to \u00a340m, resulting in a non-exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a364.3m. The gain has been recognised within the adjusted profit of the Group in line with the Group's stated exceptional policy for gains on disposal of divestments in early stage offshore windfarms (see note 3.2). After the sale the Group's shareholding in Dogger Bank C is 40%.\n\nOther disposals: On 19 August 2021 the Group received a dividend of \u00a34.8m following the sale of Smarter Grid Solutions by the Environmental Energies Fund Limited, resulting in a non-exceptional gain on sale of \u00a32.8m.\n\n## Sale of discontinued operations\n\nSale of investment in SGN: On 2 August 2021, the Group announced it had agreed to sell its 33.3% investment in SGN to a consortium comprising existing SGN shareholders Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board and Brookfield Super-Core Infrastructure Partners for cash consideration of \u00a31,225m. The agreement was conditional on certain regulatory approvals and completed on 22 March 2022, with the Group recognising an exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a3576.5m.\n\nSale of investment in Gas Production: On 14 October 2021, the Group completed the sale of its Gas Production business to Viaro Energy through its subsidiary RockRose Energy Limited.

The Group recorded a combined loss on sale of \u00a3120.8m following on completion of the disposal.\n\n## Prior year disposals\n\nSale of investment in Ferrybridge Multifuel: On 13 October 2020, the Group announced it had reached an agreement to dispose of its 50% joint venture investment in Multifuel Energy Limited and Multifuel Energy 2 Limited (together 'MEL'), to European Diversified Infrastructure Fund III for headline consideration of \u00a3995m.

Acquisitions, disposals and held-for-sale assets continued\n\n## 12.2 Disposals continued\n\nSale of investment in Walney Windfarm: On 2 September 2020, the Group agreed to sell its subsidiary, SSE Renewables Walney Limited, to Greencoat UK Wind Plc for consideration of \u00a3350m, resulting in an exceptional gain on sale of \u00a3188.7m. SSE Renewables Walney Limited was the holding company of the Group's non-operated 25.1% joint venture stake in Walney Offshore Windfarm. As essentially a financial investment and as Walney Offshore Wind Farm Limited has been operational for several years, the disposal is not considered to be aligned to the Group's strategic objective of gaining value from divestment of stakes in offshore or international wind developments, therefore the gain on disposal has been recognised as exceptional.\n\nSale of investment in Maple Smart Meter Assets: On 23 September 2020, the Group disposed of its 33% joint venture investment in Maple Topco Limited, the smart meter services provider, for proceeds of \u00a395.3m, recognising an exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a370.4m.\n\nSale of stake in Doggerbank A&B Windfarms: On 4 December 2020, the Group announced it had agreed to sell a 10% stake in Doggerbank A and Doggerbank B windfarms to Eni for consideration of \u00a3206.3m, including an interest adjustment of \u00a33.8m, resulting in a non-exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a3202.8m. The gain has been recognised within the adjusted profit of the Group in line with the Group's stated exceptional policy for gains on disposal of divestments in offshore windfarms (see note 3.2).\n\nOn the same date, Eni entered into an agreement with Equinor to purchase a further 10% stake in the development. Following these transactions, SSE and Equinor each hold a 40% equity stake and Eni a 20% stake.\n\nSale of stake in Seagreen 1 Windfarm: On 3 June 2020, the Group disposed of a 51% stake in its wholly owned subsidiary, Seagreen Holdco 1 Ltd ('Seagreen 1'), to Total. The transaction was for initial cash proceeds of \u00a370m, plus contingent consideration of up to \u00a360m dependent upon future criteria being met. The Group has assessed that control of the company was lost on that date, and that the investment in Seagreen 1 should be accounted for as an equity accounted joint venture under the principles of IFRS 11 'Joint Arrangements'. The Group acquired the joint venture investment at fair value under the principles of IFRS 10 'Consolidated Financial Statements', resulting in a total gain of \u00a349.0m. Of that gain, \u00a325.7m was recognised as exceptional, as it represented the fair value gain on acquisition of the joint venture investment retained by the Group. The remaining \u00a323.3m of the gain was included in underlying operations, in line with the Group's stated exceptional policy (see note 3.2).\n\nSale of stake in Slough Multifuel: On 2 April 2020, the Group disposed of a 50% stake in its wholly owned subsidiary, SSE Slough Multifuel Ltd, to Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners. The transaction was for initial cash proceeds of \u00a310m, plus contingent consideration of up to \u00a359.1m dependent upon future criteria being met. The Group has assessed that control of the company was lost on that date, and that the investment in Slough Multifuel should be accounted for as an equity accounted joint venture under the principles of IFRS 11 'Joint Arrangements'. The Group acquired the joint venture investment at fair value under the principles of IFRS 10 'Consolidated Financial Statements', resulting in a total gain of \u00a341.7m. Of that gain, \u00a321.3m was recognised as exceptional, as it represented the fair value gain on acquisition of the joint venture investment retained by the Group. The remaining \u00a320.4m of the gain was included in underlying operations, in line with the Group's stated exceptional policy (see note 3.2).",

        "page_content": "Intangible assets have been analysed as current and non-current as follows:\n\n|             | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Current     | 459.3     | 374.9     |\n| Non-current | 1,127.8   | 841.3     |\n|             | 1,587.1   | 1,216.2   |\n\n## (i) Goodwill\n\nAt inception, goodwill arising from business combinations is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) for impairment testing purposes. Certain goodwill valuations have changed in the current year following retranslation. Commentary on the impairment testing of the related CGUs, with the exception of two historic balances totalling \u00a38.2m, is included in note 15.\n\nA summary of the goodwill allocated to CGUs and the Group's operating segments is presented below:\n\n| Cash-generating unit   | Operating segment                       |   2022 \u00a3m | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Onshore windfarms      | SSE Renewables                          |      71.3 | 73.7      |\n| Offshore windfarms     | SSE Renewables                          |     214.9 | 214.9     |\n| SSE Pacifico 1         | SSE Renewables                          |     185.2 | -         |\n| Energy Solutions 2     | GB Business Energy & Distributed Energy |      32.4 | 32.4      |\n| Ireland Supply 3       | SSE Airtricity                          |       8.2 | 8.2       |\n|                        |                                         |     512   | 329.2     |\n\n## (ii) Allowances and certificates\n\nAllowances and Certificates consist of purchased carbon emissions allowances and generated or purchased renewable obligations certificates (ROCs). These allowances and certificates will be utilised in settlement of environmental obligations incurred by the Group's Thermal and GB Business Energy supply business and are therefore distinct from allowances and certificates in excess of the Group's environmental obligations which are recorded within inventories.\n\n## (iii) Development assets\n\nDevelopment costs relate to the design, construction and testing of Thermal and Renewable generation sites, which the Group believes will generate probable future economic benefits. Costs capitalised as development intangibles include options over land rights, planning application costs, environmental impact studies and other costs incurred in bringing windfarms and other development projects to the consented stage. These may be costs incurred directly or at a cost as part of the fair value attribution on acquisition.\n\nAt the point the development reaches the consent stage and is approved for construction, the carrying value is transferred to property, plant and equipment (note 14). At the point a project is no longer expected to reach the consented stage, the carrying amount of the project is impaired.\n\n## (iv) Other intangible assets\n\nIncluded within other intangible assets are brands, customer lists and contracts.\n\nNo exceptional or non-exceptional impairment charges have been recognised in the year (2021: \u00a3nil).\n\n## (v) Software assets\n\nSoftware assets include application software license fees, software development work, software upgrades and purchased PC software/uni00A0packages.\n\nExceptional charges of \u00a35.2m were recognised in the prior year in relation to the disposal of SSE Energy Services (recognised within continuing operations) (note 7).",

Impairment testing\n\nGoodwill and intangibles that are not amortised are reviewed at least annually for impairment. PPE, investments and other intangibles are assessed annually for impairment (or impairment reversals) triggers.\n\nThe Group's accounting policies and methodologies for impairment testing are described at Accompanying Information sections A1.2 \uf150\n\n.\n\nThe key operating and valuation assumptions, specific considerations and outcome of tests for all impairment reviews are noted in the following sections. The discount rates used are pre-tax real, except where noted, and reflect specific risks attributable to the relevant assets subject to impairment review. The discount rates applied in both 2022 and 2021 remain consistent across all CGUs, except where noted, reflecting the Group's view of cost of capital and risk. The recoverable amounts derived from the VIU or FVLCS calculations are compared to the carrying amount of each asset or CGU to determine whether an impairment charge requires to be recognised. The reviews carried out for the 2022 financial statements were carried out in the fourth quarter of the year, which is consistent with previous reviews. Note that the actual outcomes may differ from the assumptions included in the assessments at the balance sheet date.",

The calculations use, as their starting point, pre-tax cash flow projections based on the Group's five year Corporate Model as approved by the Board.

Fair value less costs to sell valuations are derived from market analysis for similar transactions, adjusted to specific circumstances of the Group's investment to reflect the amount the Group believes will be recoverable in a sale transaction.\n\n## Changes from prior year\n\nThe assets identified for impairment reviews in the prior year (being GB CCGTs, the Great Island CCGTs and the Group's discontinued Gas Production assets) remained subject to impairment testing at 31 March 2022, with the exception of the now disposed Gas Production assets. In addition to these assets, the Group's Gas Storage assets displayed indicators of impairment reversal following improved financial performance during the year. This improved financial performance was mainly due to global gas price volatility during the year, with the asset providing opportunities for the Group to trade within this volatility. Finally, the Group's 50% joint venture investment in Neos Networks Limited displayed indicators of impairment following the loss of a major contract, subsequent to increases in the Group's investment during the year.",

In the second half of the  financial year, observable power prices have  increased further, resulting in a further  impairment reversal in the second half of the  year. The conclusion presented opposite  represents the total impairment reversal  recognised for the year. | the impairment reversal to \u00a330.7m and a 0.5%  decrease in the discount rate would increase the  impairment reversal to \u00a344.9m. A 20% decrease in gross margin would result in an  impairment of \u00a353.0m, and a 20% increase in gross  margin would result in an impairment reversal of  \u00a354.2m, which would represent a full reversal of  historic impairments.  A \u20ac10/KW decrease in non-contracted capacity  market price would decrease the impairment  reversal to \u00a320.2m and a \u20ac10/KW increase would  increase the impairment reversal to \u00a354.2m,   which would represent a full reversal of historic  impairments.

The liabilities of the arrangement are principally met by the parties through the contracts for the output of the windfarm. North Falls Offshore Windfarm Limited is the Greater Gabbard extension and thus also a joint operation.\n\nThe Group also has an unincorporated arrangement with Equinor under which it accounts for its 66.7% share of the Aldbrough gas storage facility owned by SSE Hornsea Limited. The Group also had a similar arrangement for its North Sea Gas Production assets at Greater Laggan, Sean, ECA and Bacton, all of which are owned by SSE E&P UK Limited and were disposed on 14 October 2021.",

The Ovo loan note carries interest of 13.25% and is presented cumulative of accrued interest repayments, discounted at 13.25%.\n\nUnbilled energy income represents an estimate of the value of electricity or gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end. Detail of the calculation applied to estimate this balance is included at note 4.1(iii). A 5% sensitivity on the unbilled energy accrual would equate to an increase or decrease in the receivable balance of \u00a324.6m (2021: \u00a316.3m).\n\nContract related assets comprise amounts for goods or services provided under customer contracts, where the right to consideration is contingent on a performance obligation other than the passage of time. The Group has therefore recognised a contract asset for any work performed where payment is not yet due. The Group has assessed that the disclosures required under IFRS 15 to reconcile and explain opening and closing contract assets are immaterial for the Group financial statements.\n\nOther receivables include financial assets totalling \u00a34.9m (2021: \u00a33.8m). Cash held as collateral relates to amounts deposited on commodity trading exchanges of \u00a383.8m (2021: \u00a32.7m).\n\nTrade receivables and other financial assets are part of the Group's financial exposure to credit risk as explained in accompanying information note A6.",

        "page_content": "## Decommissioning provisions\n\nProvision has been made for the estimated net present value of decommissioning the Group's Thermal and Renewable power generation assets, Gas Storage facilities and a retained 60% share of decommissioning costs of the disposed Gas Production business. Cost estimates are based on the forecast remediation or clean-up costs based on current technology and prices for Renewable, Thermal and Gas Storage assets are reviewed by independent valuation experts every three years. In the intervening years, management update cost estimates based on factors arising since the last formal valuation date. Retained decommissioning costs in relation to the disposed Gas Production business are periodically agreed with the field operators. The cost estimates include a risk adjustment and are inflated to the projected decommissioning date using a market observable inflation rate. This projection is discounted using a risk-free discount rate based on UK gilt rates with maturity date similar to the expected decommissioning date.\n\nThere is a wide range of assumed decommissioning dates across the obligation due to the number of assets and their varying ages, which is summarised in the table below. Decommissioning dates are based on the useful economic lives of the individual assets based on technology and price forecasts at the balance sheet date. It is possible that the forecast decommissioning dates will change due to technology advances or decisions to repower wind farms when the current turbines reach the end of their respective lives. The date of decommissioning of the Gas Production business can vary based on hydrocarbon reserve estimates and market commodity prices, which can shorten or lengthen the economic life of the field.\n\n| Business Unit      |   Value of  provision   \u00a3m | Number of  decommissioning  sites   | Forecast  decommissioning  dates   |\n|--------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Renewables         |                      297.7 | 47                                  | 2025 - 2049                        |\n| Thermal            |                      222.6 | 15                                  | 2022 - 2048                        |\n| Gas Storage        |                      160.8 | 18 1                                | 2028 - 2048                        |\n| Gas Production     |                      249.4 | 4 2                                 | 2022 - 2037                        |\n| Distributed Energy |                        9.6 | 1                                   | 2027                               |\n| Total              |                      940.1 |                                     |                                    |\n\nThe Group's decommissioning provision has increased significantly during the year from \u00a3776.8m to \u00a3940.1m, primarily due to the financial assumptions applied in calculating the obligation. An increase in the long term inflation rate to 3.8% (2021: 1.8%) has not been offset by the increase in the risk free discount rates applied of between 1.6%-1.8% (2021: 0.8%-1.3%) which has had a significant impact on the closing provision. During the year, the Group incurred \u00a311.1m of decommissioning spend, primarily related to the Fiddlers Ferry and Ferrybridge sites, included within Thermal above. Based on work completed to date, provisions accrued for the decommissioning of these power stations are expected to be sufficient for the final cost of the works.\n\n## Impact of climate change on the Group's decommissioning provisions\n\nThe Group has assessed that the most likely impact of climate change on its decommissioning provisions would be the enactment of legislation that would result in the earlier closure of its unabated gas fired power stations. The decommissioning provision included in the table above for these assets is based on forecast closure dates under legislation enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore forecast closure dates have not been accelerated. In the sensitivity analysis below, a scenario has been included assuming legislation is enacted that would result in closure of these assets from 2030.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nSensitivity analysis reflecting reasonably probable fluctuations to the main assumptions used in the calculation of the decommissioning provisions is set out below:\n\n| Estimated impact on the decommissioning provision of:   | 2022   \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Increasing the projected cost estimate by 10%           | 1,027.8     |\n| Increasing the inflation rate by 1.0%                   | 1,051.2     |\n| Decreasing the discount rate by 0.5%                    | 992.1       |\n| Closure of unabated gas CCGTs from 2030                 | 931.7 1     |",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2022\n\n## 20. Provisions continued\n\n## Legal and restructuring provisions\n\nProvision has been made for costs associated with the restructure of the Group, including the disposal of SSE Energy Services, Neos Networks Limited and the Group's Contracting business. Provisions include IT costs, physical separation costs and provisions for onerous contracts arising on disposal and are calculated on a best estimate basis and are expected to be utilised in the next 12-24 months. In the year the Group recognised a charge of \u00a335.0m for a tax indemnity provided to RockRose Energy Limited ('RRE') following the disposal of SSE E&P Limited on 14 October 2021 (see note 12.2). The tax indemnity is contingent upon clearance of RRE's tax treatment for the acquisition and expected to be settled in the next 12-24 months.\n\nProvisions have also been made for ongoing contract and legal disputes. Where outcomes are unknown, a range of possible scenarios is calculated, with the most likely being reflected in the provision. The timing of settlement for legal provisions is more uncertain as it is dependent upon legal resolution being achieved.\n\n## Employee related provisions\n\nEmployee related provisions include the Group's employer financed retirement benefit provision for certain directors and former directors and employees, which is valued in accordance with IAS 19 using assumptions consistent with the Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme (see note 23 for assumptions applied). In addition, the Group has legal obligations arising from severance payments due to employees, which are measured based on length of service. At 31 March 2022, the provisions for severance are related to the closure of Fiddler's Ferry power station.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nOther provisions include onerous contract provisions, mutualisation obligations and other contractual obligations and are calculated based on a best estimate basis. The timing of settlement of these provisions varies by obligation between 2022 and 2025.\n\n## 21. Sources of finance\n\n## 21.1 Capital management\n\nThe Board's policy is to maintain a strong balance sheet and credit rating to support investor, counterparty and market confidence in the Group and to underpin future development of the business. The Group's credit ratings are also important in maintaining an efficient cost of capital and in determining collateral requirements throughout the Group. As at 31 March 2022, the Group's long-term credit rating was BBB+ stable outlook for Standard & Poor's and Baa1 stable outlook for Moody's.\n\nThe maintenance of a medium-term corporate model is a key control in monitoring the development of the Group's capital structure and allows for detailed scenarios and sensitivity testing. Key ratios drawn from this analysis underpin regular updates to the Board and include the ratios used by the rating agencies in assessing the Group's credit ratings.\n\nThe Group's debt requirements are principally met through issuing bonds denominated in Sterling and Euros as well as private placements and medium term bank loans including those with the European Investment Bank. On 1 April 2021, the Group exercised its option to redeem its \u20ac600m hybrid equity bond (\u00a3421.1m). The bond had no fixed redemption date, but the Group had the option to redeem all of the bond on 1 April 2021 or every 5 years thereafter.\n\nSSE's adjusted net debt and hybrid capital was \u00a38.6bn at 31 March 2022, compared with \u00a38.9bn at 31 March 2021.\n\nAdjusted net debt and hybrid capital is stated after removing lease obligations and cash held as collateral in line with the Group's presentation basis which is explained on page 210 \uf150 . Cash held as collateral refers to amounts deposited on commodity trading exchanges which are reported within 'trade and other receivables' on the face of the balance sheet.\n\nThe \u00a31.5bn of committed bank facilities, being a \u00a31.3bn Revolving Credit Facility with a March 2026 maturity and a \u00a30.2bn bilateral facility with an October 2026 maturity. These facilities can also be utilised to cover short term funding requirements; however, they remain undrawn for most of the time and were undrawn at 31 March 2022. In addition, the Group has an established \u20ac1.5bn Euro commercial paper programme (paper can be issued in a range of currencies and swapped into Sterling) and at 31 March 2022 \u00a3507m of commercial paper was outstanding compared to \u00a3nil at 31 March 2021.",

In doing so, the Group will maintain its capital discipline and will continue to operate within the current economic environment prudently. There were no changes to the Group's capital management approach during the year.\n\n## 21.2 Loans and other borrowings\n\n|                                                    | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Current                                            |           |           |\n| Short-term loans                                   | 1,118.7   | 864.7     |\n| Lease obligations                                  | 72.1      | 72.9      |\n|                                                    | 1,190.8   | 937.6     |\n| Non-current                                        |           |           |\n| Loans                                              | 7,552.5   | 8,124.9   |\n| Lease obligations                                  | 321.4     | 348.1     |\n|                                                    | 7,873.9   | 8,473.0   |\n| Total loans and borrowings                         | 9,064.7   | 9,410.6   |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                          | (1,049.3) | (1,600.2) |\n| Unadjusted net debt                                | 8,015.4   | 7,810.4   |\n| Add/(less):                                        |           |           |\n| Hybrid equity                                      | 1,051.0   | 1,472.4   |\n| Lease obligations                                  | (393.5)   | (421.0)   |\n| Cash held as collateral and other short term loans | (74.7)    | 37.1      |\n| Adjusted net debt and hybrid capital APM           | 8,598.2   | 8,898.9   |\n\nCash and cash equivalents (which are presented as a single class of asset on the face of the balance sheet) comprise cash at bank and short term highly liquid investments with a maturity of six months or less.

The pricing was committed to in March 2022 and the proceeds will be received on 30 June 2022.\n\nIn April 2022 SSE plc issued a \u20ac1bn NC6 equity accounted Hybrid bond @ 4% to re-finance the dual tranche debt accounted Hybrid bonds whose first call date occurs on 16 September 2022 although SSE will take advantage of the 3 month par call option on these Hybrid bonds meaning the bonds will be repaid on 16 June 2022. The \u20ac1bn equity accounted Hybrid bond was left in Euros with the proceeds used to cover the portion of the maturing Hybrid that was swapped to Euros and a portion of the costs associated with the acquisition of the European onshore renewables development platform from Siemens Gamesa Renewables Energy.",

The $900m tranche was swapped back to both Euros and Sterling, bringing the all-in rate down to 2.72% and resulting in an all-in funding cost for both tranches to SSE of 3.02% per annum. Due to these hybrid instruments having a fixed redemption date, they are accounted for as a debt item and are included within Loans and Other Borrowings in note 21.2. This is in contrast to the Hybrid instruments issued in 2015 and 2020 which have no fixed redemption date and are accounted for as Equity, see note 22.5.",

Retirement benefit obligations\n\n## Defined benefit schemes\n\nThe Group has two funded final salary pension schemes which provide defined benefits based on final pensionable pay. The schemes are subject to independent valuations at least every three years. The future benefit obligations are valued by actuarial methods on the basis of an appropriate assessment of the relevant parameters.\n\nThe Group also has an Employer Financed Retirement Benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme, SSE Pensions+ under a master trust with Aviva. The Group matches employee contributions up to a specified limit, in most circumstances this is set at 6%. The Group may also provide additional contributions of 3% after five years and a further 3% after ten year's continuous Group service.\n\nThe Group presents its pension scheme valuations under two different measurement bases, an actuarial valuation and an IAS 19 valuation as required by accounting standards. The IAS 19 valuation is used to determine the assets and obligations recognised in the Group's consolidated balance sheet and is calculated annually by scheme actuaries, whereas the formal actuarial valuation is used to determine the contributions the Group make to the scheme. The actuarial valuation is recalculated for each scheme every three years.\n\n## Actuarial valuations\n\nThe individual pension scheme details based on the latest formal actuarial valuations are as follows:\n\n|                                         | Scottish Hydro Electric   | Southern Electric   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|\n| Latest formal actuarial valuation       | 31 March 2021             | 31 March 2019       |\n| Valuation carried out by                | Hymans Robertson          | Aon Hewitt          |\n| Value of assets based on valuation      | \u00a32,050.5m                 | \u00a32,257.8m           |\n| Value of liabilities based on valuation | \u00a31,782.2m                 | \u00a32,544.4m           |\n| Valuation method adopted                | Projected Unit            | Projected Unit      |\n| Average salary increase                 | RPI+0.5%                  | RPI+0.5%            |\n| Average pension increase                | RPI                       | RPI                 |\n| Value of fund assets/accrued benefits   | 115.1%                    | 88.7%               |\n\n## Future contributions\n\n## Scottish Hydro Electric Scheme\n\nThe last actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 31 March 2021 and showed a surplus of \u00a3268.3m on a projected unit basis. Following this valuation, the Group agreed to a new schedule of contributions to the scheme which continues to cease contributions to the scheme during the year ended 31 March 2021 for a period until the surplus on gilts funding basis is negative for two successive quarterly valuations. Consequently, the Group is not expected to make contributions to the scheme in the year ending 31 March 2023.\n\nThe next triennial funding valuation will be carried out as at 31 March 2024.\n\n## Southern Electric Pension Scheme\n\nThe last actuarial valuation of the Scheme was finalised in the year ended 31 March 2019 and showed a deficit of \u00a3286.6m as at 31 March 2019 on a projected unit basis. The Group continues to pay deficit contributions which, along with investment returns from returnseeking assets, is expected to make good this shortfall by 31 March 2027. The next funding valuation will be carried out as at 31 March 2022. This process began during the year and is expected to be finalised by 31 December 2022. As part of that process the Trustee and Company will agree future contributions to the scheme based on the valuation. The Company also pays contributions in respect of current accrual, with some active members also paying contributions. Total contributions of approximately \u00a356.7m are expected to be paid by the Company during the year ending on 31 March 2023, including deficit repair contributions of \u00a338.9m.\n\n## Pension summary as measured under IAS 19:\n\n|                           |                 | Net actuarial gain/(loss) recognised in  respect of the pension asset in the  statement of comprehensive income   | Net actuarial gain/(loss) recognised in  respect of the pension asset in the  statement of comprehensive income   |         |         |\n|---------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n|                           | Scheme type     | 2022 \u00a3m                                                                                                           | 2021 \u00a3m                                                                                                           | 2022 \u00a3m | 2021 \u00a3m |\n| Scottish Hydro Electric   | Defined benefit | (24.6)                                                                                                            | 8.6                                                                                                               | 517.5   | 543.1   |\n| Southern Electric         | Defined benefit | 221.9                                                                                                             | (24.4)                                                                                                            | 67.4    | (186.1) |\n| Net actuarial gain/(loss) |                 | 197.3                                                                                                             | (15.8)                                                                                                            | 584.9   | 357.0   |",

        "page_content": "## IFRC 14 surplus restrictions\n\nThe value of Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme assets recognised was previously impacted by the asset ceiling test which restricts the surplus that can be recognised to assets that can be recovered through future refunds or reductions in future contributions to the schemes, and may increase the value of scheme liabilities where there are minimum funding liabilities in relation to agreed contributions. IFRIC 14 'IAS 19 - The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction' clarifies that future refunds may be recognised if the sponsoring entity has an unconditional right to a refund in certain circumstances.\n\nIn 2016/17 the Group agreed with the trustees to the Scottish Hydro Electric pensions scheme an amendment to the scheme rules to clarify that the Company has a clear right to any surplus upon final winding up of the scheme. This amendment removes the previous restriction on recognition of any surplus and as such the previously applied restriction is no longer recognised. The net pension asset of the Scottish Hydro Electric Scheme at 31 March 2022 was equal to \u00a3517.5m (2021: \u00a3543.1m).\n\nAt 31 March 2022, the Southern Electric Pension Scheme has a net surplus of \u00a367.4m (2021: \u00a3186.1m net deficit), and unrecognised future contributions of \u00a3195.7m (2021: \u00a3224.9m). The Group has assessed that it has the right to recognise current and any future surpluses on the scheme, therefore has not recognised a liability for future unrecoverable contributions.\n\n## 23.1 Pension scheme assumptions\n\nBoth schemes have been updated to 31 March 2022 by qualified independent actuaries. The valuations have been prepared for the purposes of meeting the requirements of IAS 19. The major assumptions used by the actuaries in both schemes were:\n\n|                                          | At 31 March  2022   | At 31 March 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|\n| Rate of increase in pensionable salaries | 4.2%                | 3.7%               |\n| Rate of increase in pension payments     | 3.7%                | 3.2%               |\n| Discount rate                            | 2.7%                | 2.0%               |\n| Inflation rate                           | 3.7%                | 3.2%               |\n\nThe assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at 31 March 2022 are based on standard actuarial mortality tables, and include an allowance for future improvements in longevity. The assumptions, equivalent to future longevity for members in normal health at age 65, are as follows:\n\n## Scottish Hydro Electric\n\n|                   | At 31 March 2022   | At 31 March 2022   | At 31 March 2021   | At 31 March 2021   |\n|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                   | Male               | Female             | Male               | Female             |\n| Currently aged 65 | 22                 | 24                 | 23                 | 24                 |\n| Currently aged 45 | 24                 | 27                 | 25                 | 27                 |\n\n## Southern Electric\n\n|                   | At 31 March 2022   | At 31 March 2022   | At 31 March 2021   | At 31 March 2021   |\n|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                   | Male               | Female             | Male               | Female             |\n| Currently aged 65 | 23                 | 25                 | 23                 | 25                 |\n| Currently aged 45 | 24                 | 26                 | 24                 | 26                 |",

Retirement benefit obligations continued\n\n## 23.4 Movements in the combined defined benefit asset obligations and assets during the year continued\n\n## Defined contribution scheme\n\nThe total contribution paid by the Group to defined contribution pension schemes was \u00a357.3m (2021: \u00a361.6m).\n\n## Employer financed retirement benefit (EFRB) pension costs\n\nThe decrease in the year in relation to EFRB was \u00a31.1m (2021: \u00a35.8m). This is included in Employee related provisions (note 20).\n\n## Staff costs analysis\n\nThe pension costs in note 8 can be analysed as follows:\n\n|                                      |   2022 \u00a3m |   2021 \u00a3m |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Service costs                        |      36.1 |      35.1 |\n| Defined contribution scheme payments |      57.3 |      61.6 |\n|                                      |      93.4 |      96.7 |\n\n## 23.5 Pension scheme risk assessment and mitigation\n\n## Risks to which the Pension Schemes exposes the Group\n\nThe nature of the Group's defined benefit pension schemes expose the Group to the risk of paying unanticipated additional contributions to the schemes in times of adverse experience. The most financially significant risks are likely to be:\n\n## (i) Asset volatility\n\nThe liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The schemes hold a proportion of growth assets (equities, diversified growth fund and global absolute return fund) which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term, create volatility and risk in the short-term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the schemes' long term objectives. The SHEPS has a much lower proportion of growth assets than the SEPS reflecting the maturity of each scheme.\n\n## (ii) Changes in bond yields\n\nA decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the schemes' liabilities for accounting purposes. However, this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes' bond holdings and its interest rate hedging in both schemes.\n\n## (iii) Inflation risk\n\nThe majority of the schemes' benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation). The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit, although this is further limited by the inflation hedging in both schemes.\n\n## (iv) Life expectancy\n\nThe majority of the schemes' obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members, so an increase in the life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities. The sensitivity analysis disclosed is intended to provide an indication of the impact on the value of the schemes' liabilities of the risks highlighted.\n\n## (v) Liability versus asset risk\n\nThe risk that movement in the value of the schemes' liabilities are not met by corresponding movements in the value of the schemes' assets will expose the Group to movements in the overall funding surplus.\n\n## 23.6 Risk mitigation\n\n## (i) De-risking\n\nThe Trustees have taken a number of steps to control the level of investment risk including reducing the Schemes' exposures to higher risk assets and increasing the level of protection against adverse movements in interest rates and inflation. The Trustees of both schemes continue to review the risk exposures in light of the longer term objectives of the respective schemes. Detailed below are further details on the hedging of pensioner longevity risk.\n\n## (ii) Asset buy-in\n\nOn 1 October 2019, the Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme entered into an asset buy-in, transferring the risk of volatility in the assumptions used to calculate the obligation for 1,800 pensioners and 567 dependents (covering c.\u00a3800m of the scheme's liabilities) to a third party. The asset buy-in is valued under the accounting principles of IFRS 13 and is considered a Level 3 instrument in the fair value hierarchy. This is in addition to a previous buy-in completed during the year ended 31 March 2018 when c.\u00a3250m of the scheme's assets and liabilities related to 617 pensioners and 190 dependents were transferred to a third party. The Group has now insured against volatility in obligations related to all pensioners to third parties (insurer PIC) and is now only exposed to valuation fluctuations related to active and deferred members and any members who retire after 1 October 2019.",

        "page_content": "## (iii) Asset-liability matching strategies used by the Scheme\n\nThe Company and trustees of the schemes have agreed a long term investment strategy that seeks to reduce investment risk as and when appropriate. The asset-liability matching strategy is part of this approach which aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the pension schemes by investing in assets which perform in line with the liabilities of the schemes so as to protect against inflation being higher than expected. This has been adopted for a proportion of the schemes' assets, which is designed to provide partial protection against adverse movements in interest rates and inflation. The trustees of the respective schemes review the schemes' asset allocation on an ongoing basis in light of changes in the funding position and market opportunities.\n\n## 23.7 Risk assessment\n\n## (i) Maturity profile of the defined benefit obligations\n\nThe weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 17 years (2021: 18 years) for the Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme and 16 years (2021: 17 years) for the Southern Electric Pension Scheme.\n\n## (ii) Information about the defined benefit obligations\n\nStatus of members is weighted by the liabilities of each scheme.\n\n|                  |   Scottish Hydro  Electric % |   Southern  Electric Scheme % |\n|------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Active members   |                           23 |                            28 |\n| Deferred members |                           14 |                             9 |\n| Pensioners       |                           63 |                            63 |\n|                  |                          100 |                           100 |\n\n## 23.8 Pension scheme policies\n\n## (i) Recognition of gains and losses\n\nThe Group recognises actuarial gains and losses in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income following the re-measurement of the net defined benefit liabilities of the schemes.\n\n## (ii) Methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses\n\nThe sensitivities disclosed are calculated using approximate methods taking into account the duration of the schemes' liabilities. While these have been calculated consistently with the previous financial year, the method applied may change over time with financial conditions and assumptions.\n\n## (iii) Asset recognition\n\nThe Group has recognised net pension assets in relation to the Scottish Hydro Electric pension scheme due to a surplus existing under IAS 19 accounting. The Group will only recognise a surplus should it have rights to that surplus under the rules of the pension scheme. The company no longer applies the 'asset ceiling' restriction mandated by IFRIC 14. Details on this key accounting consideration are provided above.\n\n## (iv) Fair value assessment of scheme assets\n\nThe Group seeks to assess whether there is a quotable market value (referenced as 'quotable' above) in relation to pension scheme assets held. This assessment is based on regular reviews conducted in conjunction with the trustees of the schemes. For assets where no quotable market value exists, these assets will be valued based on a set methodology agreed by trustees and scheme advisors and then regularly assessed.\n\nCurrently only one unquotable value exists within the two pension schemes of the Group, this being insurance contracts (or 'buy-in') held by the Scottish Hydro Electric Scheme. These assets are currently valued consistently with the scheme's liabilities with the expected return on these assets being set equal to the discount rate.",

In practice contractual variations may arise on the final settlement of these contractual costs.\n\n## 25.2 Contingent assets and liabilities\n\nThe Group has unrecognised contingent assets in relation to the part disposal transactions of Neos Networks Limited, SSE Slough Multifuel Limited, Seagreen and Doggerbank C and the disposal of SSE Contracting. In total, contingent consideration receivable is up to \u00a3187.1m, for which the Group has recognised a net receivable of \u00a34.1m. The payments of the remaining \u00a3183.0m are subject to various earn outs or contract and planning milestones, some of which the Group has assessed are unachievable or are out of the Group's control. At 31 March 2022, the Group has assessed that there is neither the required certainty of receipt, nor the ability to accurately assess the amounts receivable for recognition of these amounts.\n\nContingent liabilities for the Group solely relate to SSE plc, and have been disclosed within note 12 to the Company Financial Statements.\n\n## 26. Post balance sheet events\n\n## 26.1 Acquisition - European onshore renewables development platform\n\nOn 19 April 2022 the Group announced that it had entered into an agreement with Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy ('SGRE') to acquire SGRE's existing European onshore renewable energy development platform for consideration of \u20ac580m, subject to a number of conditions. The SGRE portfolio is mainly located in Spain with the remainder across France, Italy and Greece. The transaction is expected to complete by the end of September 2022 subject to the receipt of relevant foreign direct investment and regulatory approvals. This acquisition is aligned to the Group's published strategy to pursue overseas renewable opportunities.\n\n## 26.2 Issuance of hybrid equity bond\n\nIn April 2022 SSE plc issued a \u20ac1bn NC6 equity accounted Hybrid bond @ 4% to re-finance the dual tranche debt accounted Hybrid bonds whose first call date occurs on 16 September 2022 although SSE will take advantage of the 3 month par call option on these Hybrid bonds meaning the bonds will be repaid on 16 June 2022. The \u20ac1bn equity accounted Hybrid bond was left in Euros with the proceeds used to cover the portion of the maturing Hybrid that was swapped to Euros and a portion of the costs associated with the acquisition of the European onshore renewables development platform from SGRE.\n\n## 26.3 Issuance of private placement debt\n\nIn March 2022 the Group, through its Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission entity priced and committed to a \u00a3350m dual tranche private placement being a \u00a3175m 10 year tranche @ 3.13% and \u00a3175m 15 year tranche @ 3.24% giving an all in average rate of 3.19%. The pricing was committed to in March 2022 and the proceeds will be received on 30 June 2022.\n\n## 26.4 Fiddlers Ferry site disposal\n\nSubsequent to the year end, the board committed to dispose of the Fiddlers Ferry site, pending resolution of a final agreement with anticipated completion expected within 6 months.",

        "page_content": "## Accompanying information\n\n## A1. Basis of consolidation and significant accounting policies\n\n## A1.1 Basis of consolidation\n\nThe financial statements consolidate the results of the Company and its subsidiaries together with the Group's share of the results and net assets of its interests in joint arrangements and associates. Where necessary to ensure consistency, the accounting policies of the subsidiaries, joint arrangements or associates have been adjusted to align to the accounting policies of the Group. Intra-Group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from Intra-Group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains and losses arising from transactions with joint arrangements and associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the entity. Non-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiaries that is not attributable, either directly or indirectly, to SSE plc shareholders.\n\n## Subsidiaries (Accompanying Information A3)\n\nSubsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group or the Company. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity in order to obtain variable returns from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries acquired are consolidated in the financial statements of the Group from the date that control commences until the date control ceases. Transactions with non-controlling interests that relate to their ownership interests and do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.\n\n## Interests in joint arrangements and associates (note 16 and Accompanying Information A3)\n\nJoint arrangements, as defined by IFRS 11 'Joint Arrangements', are those arrangements that convey to two or more parties 'joint control'. Joint control exists when decisions about the 'relevant activities', being the financial, operational or strategic policies of the arrangement, are made with the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Whilst this assessment is principally focused on any 'Reserved Matters', being the material activities that typically require all significant shareholders to approve, other contractual agreements such as Power Purchase Agreements and Management Services Agreements are also considered. The Group's investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the investee's legal form and the investor's contractual rights and obligations over the assets and liabilities of the investee.\n\nAssociates are those investments over which the Group has significant influence but neither control nor joint control.\n\nThe Group's interests in its joint operations are accounted for by recognising its share of the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of the operation. In these arrangements, the Group's share of the revenue will be eliminated as it relates to its purchased share of the output from the arrangement.\n\nThe Group's joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting where the joint venture and associate net investments (comprising both equity and long term loans) are carried at historical cost plus the Group's share of post-acquisition results, less any impairment in value. For those investments that were formerly subsidiaries of the Group, this will also include any fair value uplift arising from loss of control. The Group recognises its share of the results of these equity-accounted operations after tax and interest in the income statement.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the parent. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured accordingly.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Any gain or loss arising on the restatement of such items is taken to the income statement as a Finance Cost, with the exception of exchange gains or losses on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity or exchange gains or losses incurred as part of a qualifying cash flow hedge. These exchange gains or losses are transferred to the translation reserve to the extent the hedge is effective. Non-monetary assets that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the historic rate at the date of/uni00A0transaction.\n\nFor the purpose of presenting the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group's foreign operations are translated into pounds sterling at the balance sheet closing rate. The results of these operations are translated at the average rate in the relevant period. Exchange differences on retranslation of the opening net assets and the results of foreign operations are transferred to the translation reserve and are reported in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\n\nThe average and spot rates for the principal functional currencies that the Group's foreign operations are denominated in are shown in the table below.\n\n|           |                    |   2022 |   2021 | Change   |\n|-----------|--------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| EUR v GBP | Year end spot rate | 1.1856 | 1.1745 | 0.9%     |\n| EUR v GBP | Average spot rate  | 1.175  | 1.1249 | 4.5%     |",

        "page_content": "## A1.2 Significant accounting policies\n\n## Revenue (notes 2 and 5)\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised to the extent that it reflects the expected consideration for goods or services provided to the customer under contract, over the performance obligations they are being provided. For each separable performance obligation identified, the Group determines whether it is satisfied at a 'point in time' or 'over time' based upon an evaluation of the receipt and consumption of benefits, control of assets and enforceable payment rights associated with that obligation. If the criteria required for 'over time' recognition are not met, the performance obligation is deemed to be satisfied at a 'point in time'.\n\nRevenue principally arises as a result of the Group's activities in energy production, storage, transmission, distribution, supply and related services in the energy markets in Great Britain and Ireland. The key policies applied by each Business Area are as follows:\n\n## Transmission\n\n## Use of electricity transmission networks\n\nRevenue from use of electricity transmission networks is derived from the allowed revenue as defined by the parameters in the relevant electricity transmission licence, which informs the tariffs we set.\n\nElectricity transmission revenue is determined in accordance with the regulatory licence, based on an Ofgem approved revenue model and is recognised 'over time' as charged to National Grid. Where this revenue differs from the allowed revenue, there may be an over- or underrecovery of revenue which will be reflected in future financial year's allowed revenue as set out in the regulatory licence. No accounting adjustments are therefore made for over- or under-recoveries in the year that they arise.\n\n## Transmission network contracted services\n\nWhere the Group has an ongoing obligation to provide contracted services (transmission network connections), revenues are recognised 'over time' consistent with the customer receiving and consuming the benefits of that service across the expected contractual service period. Any assets constructed in order to deliver the service are capitalised and depreciated over their useful life. Payments from customers are typically received from customers in advance of providing the contracted service and are deferred on balance sheet. No extended warranty periods are offered.\n\n## Distribution\n\n## Use of electricity distribution networks\n\nRevenue from use of electricity distribution networks is derived from the allowed revenue as defined by the parameters in the relevant electricity distribution licence, which informs the tariffs we set.\n\nElectricity distribution revenue recognised is based on the volume of electricity distributed 'over time', as use of distribution service is determined by the customer, and the set customer tariff. As with electricity transmission revenue, any over- or under-recovery of revenue is reflected in future financial year's allowed revenue as set out in the regulatory licence. No accounting adjustments are therefore made for over- or under-recoveries in the year that they arise.\n\nThe Distribution business is responsible for recovering industry charges for supplier failures from customers under Ofgem's Supplier of Last Resort scheme. The Group's policy is to recognise revenue for recovered amounts when the Group is entitled to invoice customers through its regulated use of system tariff. The Group recognises its obligation to pay amounts recovered to eligible suppliers when the Group is entitled to invoice customers through its regulated use of system tariff.\n\n## Distribution network contracted services\n\nWhere the Group has an ongoing obligation to provide contracted services (such as for distribution network connections), revenues are recognised 'over time' consistent with the customer receiving and consuming the benefits of that service across the expected contractual service period. Any assets constructed in order to deliver the service are capitalised and depreciated over their useful life. Payments from customers are typically received from customers in advance of providing the contracted service and are deferred on balance sheet. No extended warranty periods are offered.\n\n## Renewables\n\n## Electricity generation\n\nRevenue from the physical generation of electricity is recognised 'point in time' as generated and supplied to the national settlements body. Revenue is measured at either the spot price at the time of delivery, or trade price where that trade is eligible for 'own use' designation.\n\n## Renewables contracted services\n\nRevenue from national support schemes, such as Renewable Obligation Certificates, is recognised at the point the performance obligation has been met. This is typically considered to be either at the point electricity has been physically generated or over the contractual period, depending on the underlying performance obligation. Revenue is measured either at the market rate at the point of generation, or at the fixed contractual consideration, depending on the individual scheme mechanic.\n\nRevenue from other ancillary generation services is recognised 'over time' consistent with the customer receiving and consuming the benefits of those services across the expected contractual service period, and at the contracted consideration.",

Revenue is measured at either the spot price at the time of delivery, or trade price where that trade is eligible for 'own use' designation.\n\n## Gas storage\n\nRevenue from gas storage trading activities is recognised 'point in time' as injected back into the network. Revenue is measured at either the spot price at the time of delivery, or trade price where that trade is eligible for 'own use' designation.\n\n## Thermal Generation contracted services\n\nRevenue from national support schemes, such as the Capacity Market, is recognised at the point the performance obligation has been met. This is typically considered to be either at the point electricity has been physically generated or over the contractual period, depending on the underlying performance obligation. Revenue is measured either at the market rate at the point of generation, or at the fixed contractual consideration, depending on the individual scheme mechanic.\n\nRevenue from other ancillary generation services is recognised 'over time' consistent with the customer receiving and consuming the benefits of those services across the expected contractual service period, and at the contracted consideration.\n\n## Customers\n\n## Supply of energy\n\nRevenue on the supply of energy comprises sales to domestic and business end-user customers based on actual energy consumption including an estimate of the value of electricity and gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end. Revenue is recognised 'over time' consistent with the delivery of energy to the customer as we consider the receipt and consumption of the benefits of the energy to be simultaneous. Revenue is measured based on the applicable customer tariff rate and after deduction of any applicable contractual discounts.\n\nDetails of the estimation process for the value of electricity and gas supplied to customers is given within note 4.1(iii).\n\nPayments from customers may be received in advance of providing the contracted service and are deferred on balance sheet. Amounts received from customers in relation to energy management services provided by Third Party Intermediaries ('TPIs') are offset against payments to those TPIs, reflecting the responsibility for providing the energy management service.\n\n## Energy related services\n\nWhere the Group has an ongoing obligation to provide contracted energy related services, revenues are recognised 'over time' consistent with the customer receiving and consuming the benefits of that service across the expected contractual service period at the fixed contracted rate. Where the Group has an obligation to perform a specific service, revenues are recognised 'point in time', following performance of the service at the fixed contracted consideration. No extended warranty periods are offered.\n\n## Distributed Energy\n\n## Construction related services\n\nConstruction related service revenue primarily relates to the Contracting and Rail business, which was disposed on 30 June 2021. For construction related services, revenue is recognised for each identified performance obligation 'over time' by applying an input method to determine the proportion of total contract revenue (being fixed price consideration plus the latest estimate of variable consideration) that should be recognised. The input method applied is calculated by reference to the costs incurred to date on that performance obligation, relative to the total expected costs to satisfy that performance obligation, provided the contract outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty. Revenue from non-contracted agreements or variations to contracted work is only recognised to the extent there is additional supporting evidence to their recoverability and may be subject to constraints on recognition. Revenue on contracts in customer dispute is recognised only to the extent it is considered to be highly probable that the revenue will be recovered.\n\nCommissions in relation to acquisition of construction related contracts are expensed as incurred. No extended warranty periods are offered. Payments from customers are based on agreed billing schedules, with payment milestones typically aligned with delivery of performance obligations.\n\n## EPM & I\n\n## Commodity optimisation and other services\n\nIncome from sales commodity optimisation trading occurring in any business unit is presented net in cost of sales alongside purchase commodity optimisation trades.\n\nRevenue arising on commodities purchased in excess of the Group's requirements and recorded as inventory assets, such as Renewables Obligation Certificates, is recognised 'point in time' on disposal of these inventory assets to third parties.\n\nRevenue from other ancillary services is recognised 'over time' consistent with the customer receiving and consuming the benefits of those services across the expected contractual service period, and at the contracted consideration.",

        "page_content": "## Physical energy production\n\nRevenue from the physical production of natural gas, crude oil and condensates arises from the Group's interest in various joint ventures and associates and is based on the entitlement method; whereby the Group's share of interest and production sharing terms are used to determine the allocation of production to each party in the arrangement. Revenue is recognised 'point in time' based on the production that has been delivered to the customer at the specified delivery point and measured based on the applicable market price as specified in the customer contracts. On the 14 October 2021 the Gas Production business was disposed.\n\nAside from where specifically noted above, consideration is due when the performance obligation has been satisfied. As the period between satisfaction of the performance obligation and receipt of consideration from the customer is expected to be less than a year, the Group has applied the practical expedient not to adjust revenue for the effect of any financing components.\n\nRevenue from sources other than the Group's contracts with customers principally comprise meter rental income within the Enterprise business, and Contract for Difference income within certain Joint Venture arrangements.\n\nIncome on meter rental agreements, which are classified as operating leases, are presented as revenue where they relate to the core operating activities of that business. Lease payments are recognised as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nContract for Differences are agreements between a low carbon electricity generator and the Low Carbon Contracts Company ('LCCC'), a UK Government owned entity responsible for delivering support mechanisms for low-carbon electricity generation. These agreements are not considered to be contracts with a customer, as the LCCC does not receive any goods or services from the generator. These arrangements are instead considered to be Government Grants, with income arising from these grants recognised in the income statement in the period in which generation takes place. This income is presented as revenue where they relate to the core operating activities of that business.\n\n## Cost of sales (note 6)\n\nCost of sales includes fuel and energy purchases, direct employee benefits, and depreciation of property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe net result from sales and purchases of commodity optimisation trades - comprising both realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from optimisation trading activities - is also presented within cost of sales, reflecting the underlying economic purpose of this trading activity.\n\n## Finance income and costs (note 9)\n\nInterest income and costs are recognised in the income statement as they accrue, on an effective interest method. The issue costs and interest payable on bonds and all other interest payable and receivable is reflected in the income statement on the same basis.\n\nInterest on the funding attributable to major capital projects is capitalised during the period of construction and depreciated as part of the total cost over the useful life of the asset.\n\nThe accounting policy for foreign exchange translation of monetary assets and liabilities is described on page 290 \uf150 and for lease liability charges on page 297 \uf150 .\n\n## Taxation (note 10)\n\nTaxation on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Taxation is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities other than in business combinations that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset within the same tax authority and where the Group intends to either settle them on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.",

Goodwill is subject to an annual review for impairment (or more frequently if necessary) in accordance with the Group's impairment accounting policy.\n\nContingent consideration is classified as a liability and subsequently re-measured through the income statement. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nChanges in ownership that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions.\n\n## Held for disposal assets and liabilities and discontinued operations (note 12)\n\nNon-current assets are classified as held for disposal if their recoverable value is likely to be recovered via a sale or distribution as opposed to continued use by the Group. In order to be classified as assets held for disposal, assets must meet all of the following conditions; the disposal is highly probable, it is available for immediate disposal, it is being actively marketed and the disposal is likely to occur within one year.\n\nAssets that qualify as held for disposal and related liabilities are disclosed separately from other assets and liabilities in the balance sheet prospectively from the date of classification. Non-current assets determined as held for disposal are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell, no depreciation is charged in respect of these assets after classification as held for disposal.\n\nAssets or groups of assets and related liabilities that qualify as held for disposal are classified as discontinued operations when they represent a separate major line of business or geographical area, are part of a single plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area or are acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Income and expenses relating to these discontinued operations are disclosed in a single net amount after taxes in the income statement, with comparative amounts re-presented accordingly.\n\nIntra-Group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from trading between continuing and discontinued operations continue to be eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Intangible assets (note 13)\n\n## Goodwill and impairment testing\n\nGoodwill arising on a business combination represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least on an annual basis.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to those cash-generating units (CGUs) expected to benefit from the combination's synergies. The cash-generating units used for goodwill impairment testing purposes will represent how goodwill was attributed but may not represent reportable business segments.\n\nGoodwill may also arise upon investments in joint arrangements and associates. Goodwill arising on a joint operation is recorded as a separate asset and any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. Goodwill arising on a joint venture or associate is recorded within the carrying amount of the Group's investment and any impairment loss is included within the share of result from joint ventures and associates. On disposal or closure of a previously acquired investment or business, any attributed goodwill will be included in determining the profit or loss on disposal.\n\n## Allowances and certificates\n\nAllowances and certificates consist of purchased carbon emissions allowances and generated or purchased obligations certificates. These allowances and certificates will be utilised in settlement of environmental obligations incurred by the Group's Generation and Business and Domestic Energy Supply businesses.\n\nThe EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) has been in operation since 1 January 2005, with the Group operating under the established EU ETS carbon pricing system since that date. Since 1 January 2021, following Brexit, the UK Government has established a UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) to replace the EU ETS with the Group's UK generation assets now operating under the UK ETS carbon pricing system. Carbon allowances purchased are recorded at cost within intangible assets. Forward carbon contracts are measured at fair value with gains or losses arising on re-measurement being recognised in the income statement. A liability is recognised based on the level of emissions recorded. Up to the level of allowances held, including forward carbon contracts, the liability is measured at the cost of purchase. When the carbon emission liability exceeds the carbon allowances held, the difference is measured at market value selling price. Subsequent movements in market value are prospectively recognised in operating profit.\n\nThe carbon allowance intangible asset is surrendered at the end of the compliance period to the extent requested reflecting the consumption of the economic benefit and is recorded as being utilised. As a result, no amortisation is booked but an impairment charge may be recognised should the carrying value of allowances exceed market or fair value.",

        "page_content": "Under the Renewable Obligations Certificates (ROCs) scheme, certificates obtained from own generation are awarded by a third party, Ofgem. ROCs can be traded with third parties and are ultimately used by suppliers to demonstrate to Ofgem that they have met their obligation to source a set proportion of the electricity they supply from renewable sources. The value of a ROC to a supplier comprises two elements: the 'buy-out' price which is set annually in advance of the compliance period by Ofgem; and the 'recycle' price which is determined after the compliance period by Ofgem. The recycle price element is estimated at the balance sheet date based on assumptions at that point in time around likely levels of renewable generation and supply over the remaining compliance period, and is therefore subject to possible future variation.\n\nWhere ROCs are self-generated or purchased to fulfil the Group's liability under the renewables obligation, they are recorded at market value at the point of generation or purchased within intangible assets. Following disposal of the Group's Energy Services business in January 2020, the Group now holds ROCs in excess of the Group's renewables obligation. Due to limited evidence of liquidity or net settlement for ROC trades, we have determined that any purchased ROCs in excess of the Group's renewables obligation are recorded at the lower of cost or net realisable value within inventories. Similarly, the fair value of any forward contracts entered into at the balance sheet date for the purchase or sale of ROCs in future periods are not recognised, as there is insufficient liquidity for net settlement. The Group's liability under the renewables obligation is recognised based on electricity supplied to customers, the obligation level set by Ofgem and the prevailing market price.\n\nThe intangible assets are surrendered at the end of the compliance period reflecting the consumption of economic benefit and release of the associated liability. As a result, no amortisation is recorded during the period.\n\n## Research and development\n\nExpenditure on research activities is charged to the income statement as incurred.\n\nExpenditure on development activities is capitalised as intangible assets if the project or process is considered to be technically and commercially feasible and the Group intends to complete the project or process for use or for sale. Development projects include wind farm developments, thermal generation and gas storage projects, prospective gas production assets and other developments relating to proven technologies. Costs incurred in bringing these projects to the consent stage include options over land rights, planning application costs and environmental impact studies and may be costs incurred directly or part of the fair value exercise on acquisition of an interest in a project. At the point that the project reaches the consent stage and is approved by the Board, the carrying value of the project is transferred to property, plant and equipment as assets under construction. Once in operation, depreciation will be charged over the expected useful life of the asset. The asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected to/uni00A0arise.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets that have been acquired separately by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Expenditure on internally generated brands or customer lists are expensed as incurred. Expenditure on internally developed software assets and application software licences includes contractors' fees and directly attributable labour and overheads. Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of these assets. The amortisation periods utilised are as follows:\n\n|                                                             | Years         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Brands                                                      | 10            |\n| Customer lists                                              | Contract term |\n| Developed software assets and application software licences | 3-15          |\n\nThe useful lives of all the intangible assets are reviewed annually and amended, as required, on a prospective basis. Intangible assets are derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from their use.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment (note 14)\n\n## Owned assets\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairments. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and other directly attributable costs. Where the asset is a qualifying asset, for which a considerable period of time is required to prepare the asset for use or sale, borrowing costs will be capitalised as part of the asset's cost. Where an item of property, plant and equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, the components are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment, and depreciated accordingly. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.",

Basis of consolidation and significant accounting policies continued\n\n## A1.2 Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Right of use assets\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Where a modification to a lease agreement decreases the scope of the lease, the carrying amount of the right of use asset is adjusted and a gain or loss is recognised in proportion to the decrease in scope of the lease. All other modifications to lease agreements are accounted for as a reassessment of the lease liability with a corresponding adjustment to the right of use asset.\n\n## Hydro civil assets\n\nThe Group is obliged under the Reservoirs Act 1975 to maintain its hydro infrastructure network, including its dams, tunnels and other hydro civil engineering structures (hydro civil assets). All items of property, plant and equipment within hydro civil assets, with the exception of land, are subject to depreciation.\n\nIn accordance with the transition provisions of IFRS 1 'First-time Adoption of IFRS', the Group identified the carrying value of these assets at privatisation and has treated this value as deemed cost. Following this assessment, the assets, and all subsequent enhancement and replacement expenditure, has been subject to depreciation over a useful economic life of 75 years. All subsequent maintenance expenditure is chargeable directly to the income statement.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nDepreciation is charged to the income statement to write off cost, less residual values, on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives. Heritable and freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation policy, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at least annually, for all asset classes to ensure that the current method is the most appropriate. Depreciation commences following the asset commissioning period and when the asset is available for commercial operation. The estimated useful lives for assets depreciated on a straight line basis are as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                                                  | Years     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Wholesale specific assets                                                                                                        |           |\n| Hydro civil assets (classified within Renewable power generation assets)                                                         | 75 to 100 |\n| Thermal and hydro power stations including electrical and mechanical assets (classified within Thermal power  generation assets) | 20 to 60  |\n| Onshore wind farms (classified within Renewable power generation assets)                                                         | 20 to 25  |\n| Offshore wind farms (classified within Renewable power generation assets)                                                        | 20 to 25  |\n| Gas storage facilities (classified within other assets)                                                                          | 25 to 50  |\n| Overhead lines, underground cables and other network assets (classified within Distribution or Transmission network  assets)     | 5 to 80   |\n| Office buildings (classified within land & buildings)                                                                            | 30 to 40  |\n| Fixtures, IT assets, vehicles and mobile plant (classified within other assets)                                                  | 3 to 15   |\n\nAssets held under leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease agreement.\n\n## Subsequent expenditure\n\nIt is the Group policy to capitalise qualifying replacement expenditure and depreciate it over the expected useful life of the replaced asset. Replaced assets are derecognised at this point and the costs recorded as costs of disposal. Where an item of property, plant and equipment is replaced and it is not practicable to determine the carrying amount of the replaced part, the cost of the replacement adjusted for inflation will be used as an approximation of the cost of the replaced part at the time it was acquired or constructed.\n\nExpenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property, plant and equipment that is accounted for separately is capitalised. Other subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits of the item of property, plant and equipment to which it relates. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Derecognition\n\nAn item of property, plant or equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds received with the carrying amount of the asset and are included in the income statement. Any gain or loss on derecognition of the asset is included in the income statement in the period of derecognition.",

        "page_content": "## Lease arrangements (note 21)\n\nLease arrangements are separately distinguished from service contracts on the basis of whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. If the Group is deemed to control the use of an identified asset, a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability are recognised on the balance sheet.\n\nRight of use assets are capitalised and held as part of property, plant and equipment. The accounting policy for such arrangements is described on page 296 \uf150 .\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments discounted using the rate implicit in the lease if that can be readily determined. If the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined the incremental borrowing rate is used. Where the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Group has applied the intercompany borrowing rate which is based on the Group's external medium-term borrowing rates with premia adjustments for any subsidiary specific risk factors.\n\nIn determining whether any break and/or extension clauses should be included within the lease term, the Group has considered that where an internal decision has been made to break or extend the lease agreement, that decision shall be applied in determining the appropriate lease term. Where an internal decision has not been made, and where the non-cancellable element of the lease term has longer than five years remaining, it is considered that any clauses will not be triggered as any decision beyond that date is not reasonably certain. For all leases with less than five years remaining, an assessment is made at each reporting period on a lease-by-lease basis on whether the clause is reasonably certain to be triggered. Reassessment of break and/or extension judgements made in prior periods could result in recalculation of the lease liability and adjustments to associated balances.\n\nThe lease liability is subsequently adjusted for unwind of discounting, repayments and other modifications to the underlying agreement. Lease modifications are accounted for as a separate lease where the scope of the lease increases through the right to use one or more underlying assets and where the consideration of the lease increases by an amount that is equivalent to the standalone price of the increase in scope. Where a modification decreases the scope of the lease, the carrying amount of the right of use asset is adjusted and a gain or loss is recognised in proportion to the decrease in scope of the lease. All other modifications are accounted for as a reassessment of the lease liability with a corresponding adjustment to the right of use asset.\n\nLeases with a duration of 12 months or less and leases for assets which are deemed 'low value' are expensed to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Impairment review (note 15)\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's PP&E and other intangible assets and the Group's investments in joint ventures and associates, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or where there are indications that a previously recognised impairment loss has reduced. For PP&E assets that have previously been identified as exhibiting indications of impairment, the review of impairment will be performed annually until there is sufficient evidence to confirm that any potential impairment loss has been appropriately recognised, or until previously recognised impairment losses have been fully written back. For goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life or which are not yet ready for use, the test for impairment is carried out annually. In addition, financial assets measured at amortised cost are also reviewed for impairment annually.\n\nFor assets subject to impairment testing, the asset's carrying value is compared to the asset's (or cash-generating unit (CGU)'s, in the case of goodwill), recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell (FVLCS) and the value-in-use (VIU) of the asset or CGU. For financial assets measured at amortised cost the impairment is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate.\n\nIf the carrying amount of the asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment charge will be recognised immediately in the income statement. Reversals of previous impairment charges are recognised if the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU significantly exceeds the carrying amount. Previous impairments of goodwill are not reversed.\n\nValue in use (VIU) calculations require the estimation of future cash flows to be derived from the respective assets (or CGUs) and the selection of an appropriate discount rate in order to calculate their present value. The VIU methodology is consistent with the approach taken by management to evaluate economic value and is deemed to be the most appropriate for reviews of PP&E asset and the Group's identified goodwill-related CGUs. The methodology is based on the pre-tax cash flows arising from the specific assets, underlying assets or CGUs, and discounted using a pre-tax discount rate based on the Group's cost of funding and adjusted for any specific risks. The estimation of the timing and value of underlying projected cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates involves management judgement. Subsequent changes to these estimates or judgements may impact the carrying value of the assets.\n\nThe fair value less costs to sell methodology also uses a present value technique, unless there is a quoted price in an active market for that asset. The methodology is based on the post-tax cash flows arising from the specific assets, underlying assets or CGUs, and discounted using a post-tax discount rate determined in the same manner as the rates used in the VIU calculations, adjusted for the relevant taxation rate.\n\nAny impairment charge identified will initially be adjusted against the goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit. Any excess charge will be allocated against the remaining assets of the cash-generating unit. Reversals of previous impairment charges are allocated against the carrying value of assets previously subject to an impairment charge.",

Basis of consolidation and significant accounting policies continued\n\n## A1.2 Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Inventories (note 17)\n\nInventories - aside from inventory purchased by the Gas Storage business for secondary trading opportunities - are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.\n\nGas inventory purchased by the Gas Storage business for secondary trading opportunities is held at fair value with reference to the forward month market price. Gains and losses on remeasurement at fair value are recognised within the Income Statement, as a 'certain remeasurement' item.\n\n## Provisions (note 20)\n\nA provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it can be measured reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.\n\nIf the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.\n\n## Decommissioning\n\nThe Group engages independent experts to estimate the cost of decommissioning its Renewable, Thermal and Gas Storage assets every three years. In the intervening years, management updates the external valuation based on factors arising since the last formal valuation date. Provision is made for the net present value of the estimated cost of decommissioning gas storage facilities, wind farms and power stations at the end of the useful life of the facilities. This includes development assets, where if a present obligation exists, provision is recognised during construction and prior to commencement of operations from the site. The estimates are based on technology and prices at the balance sheet date and excludes any salvage value related to those assets. A corresponding decommissioning asset is recognised and is included within property, plant and equipment when it gives access to future economic benefits, and is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the asset. Changes in these provisions are recognised prospectively. The unwinding of the discount on the provision is included in finance costs.\n\nThe Group retained a decommissioning obligation following the disposal of its Gas Production business. The decommissioning cost estimates are updated periodically by field operators based on current technology and prices. Field operators also provide estimated end of field life dates for each field, which can change based on market commodity prices.\n\n## Retirement benefit obligations (note 23)\n\nDefined benefit pension schemes\n\nThe Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes, one of which is operated by the Company. Pension scheme assets are measured using bid market values. Pension scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit credit actuarial method and are discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.\n\nAny increase in the present value of liabilities within the Group's defined benefit pension schemes expected to arise from employee service in the year is charged as service costs to operating profit.\n\nNet interest costs are based on net schemes' liabilities adjusted for minimum funding requirement and pension surplus restrictions under IFRIC 14 'IAS 19-The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction'. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Pension scheme surpluses, to the extent that they are considered recoverable, or deficits are recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance sheet.",

        "page_content": "## Defined contribution pension schemes\n\nThe Group also operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. The amounts charged represent the contributions payable to the schemes in the year and are charged directly to the income statement.\n\n## Equity and equity-related compensation benefits\n\nThe Group operates a number of employee share schemes as described in the Remuneration Report. These schemes enable Group employees to acquire shares of the Company.\n\nThe exercise prices of the sharesave scheme are set at a discount to market price at the date of the grant. The fair value of the sharesave scheme option granted is measured at the grant date by use of a Black-Scholes model. The fair value of the options granted is recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the period that the scheme vests. Estimates are updated for non-market conditions at each balance sheet date with any adjustment in respect of the current and prior years being recognised in the income statement. The costs associated with the other main employee schemes are recognised over the period to which they relate. The charge related to the equity shares in the Company awarded under the share schemes is treated as an increase in the cost of investment held by the Company in the subsidiary companies of the Group. The disclosures on equity and equity-related compensation benefits have been removed on the grounds of materiality in relation to the Group.\n\n## Financial instruments (note 24)\n\nThe Group uses a range of financial instruments to hedge exposures to financial risks, such as interest rate, foreign exchange and energy price fluctuations in its normal course of business and in accordance with the Group's risk management policies. The Group's risk management policies are further explained in A6 \uf150 .\n\nAs previously noted in the 31 March 2018 Annual Report, the Group's review of the IFRS 9 hedge accounting model concluded that whilst adoption would not change the treatment of existing hedging arrangements, the changes made would not result in any additional hedge designations either. As such, the existing hedge accounting model under IAS 39 appropriately reflects our risk management activities in the financial statements. Therefore, as permitted by IFRS 9, the Group has elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39. This policy choice will be periodically reviewed to consider any changes in our risk management activities.\n\n## Interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives\n\nFinancial derivative instruments are used by the Group to hedge interest rate and currency exposures. All such derivatives are recognised at fair value and are re-measured to fair value each reporting period. Certain derivative financial instruments are designated as being held for hedging purposes. The designation of the hedge relationship is established at the inception of the hedge and procedures are applied to ensure the derivative is highly effective in achieving its objective and that the effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured. The treatment of gains and losses on re-measurement is dependent on the classification of the hedge and whether the hedge relationship is designated as either a 'fair value' or 'cash flow' hedge. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are treated as if held for trading, with all fair value movements being recorded through the income statement.\n\nA derivative classified as a 'fair value' hedge recognises gains and losses from re-measurement immediately in the income statement. Loans and borrowings are measured at cost except where they form the underlying transaction in an effective fair value hedge relationship. In such cases, the carrying value of the loan or borrowing is adjusted to reflect fair value movements with the gain or loss being reported in the income statement.\n\nA derivative classified as a 'cash flow' hedge recognises the portion of gains or losses on the derivative which are deemed to be effective directly in equity in the hedge reserve. Any ineffective portion of the gains or losses is recognised in the consolidated income statement. When hedged cash flows result in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the associated gains or losses previously recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the income/uni00A0statement.",

        "page_content": "## Accompanying information continued\n\n## A1. Basis of consolidation and significant accounting policies continued\n\n## A1.2 Significant accounting policies continued\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At the point of discontinuation, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity remains in equity until the forecast transaction affects profit or loss. On settlement, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Commodity derivatives\n\nWithin its regular course of business, the Group routinely enters into sale and purchase derivative contracts for commodities such as electricity, gas, coal, carbon allowances and oil. Where the contract was entered into and continues to be held for the purpose of receipt or delivery in accordance with the Group's expected sale, purchase or usage requirements, the contracts are designated as 'own use' contracts and are measured at cost. These contracts are not within the scope of IFRS 9.\n\nDerivative commodity contracts which are not designated as own use contracts are accounted for as trading derivatives and are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value. Where a hedge accounting relationship is designated and is proven to be effective, the changes in fair value will be recognised in accordance with the rules noted above. There are currently no designated hedge relationships in relation to commodity contracts.\n\nOther commodity contracts, where own use is not established and a hedge accounting relationship is not designated, are measured at fair value with gains and losses on re-measurement being recognised in the income statement in cost of sales.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nDerivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives where the characteristics of the derivatives are not closely related to those of the host contracts.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nHedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted in a manner similar to effective cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity, in the translation reserve, and any gain or loss on the ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in the income statement. On disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any gains or losses recognised directly in equity is transferred to the income statement.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables do not carry any interest and are measured at cost less an appropriate allowance for lifetime expected credit losses.\n\n## Interest-bearing loans and borrowings\n\nAll such loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value including transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, except where the loan or borrowing is the hedged item in an effective fair value hedge relationship.\n\n## Share capital\n\nOrdinary shares are accounted for as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds received. Own equity instruments that are reacquired are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the Group Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group's own equity instruments.\n\n## Hybrid equity\n\nHybrid equity comprises issued bonds that qualify for recognition as equity. Accordingly, any coupon payments are accounted for as dividends and are recognised directly in equity at the time the payment obligation arises. This is because the coupon payments are discretionary and relate to equity. Coupon payments consequently do not have any impact on the income statement. Coupon payments are recognised in the cash flow statement in the same way as dividends to ordinary shareholders. Tax credits in relation to the coupon payments are linked to the past transactions or events that support the coupon payments and consequently the tax credits are reported in the income statement.\n\n## Hybrid debt\n\nHybrid debt comprises issued bonds that have a fixed redemption date and are accounted within Loans and Borrowings. Coupon payments are recognised within the income statement as a finance cost.",

The Group's Gas Production business, which is presented as a discontinued operation in the current year (until the business was disposed on 14 October 2021) and prior year, is taxed at a UK corporation tax rate of 30% plus a supplementary charge of 10% (combined 40%). Profits earned by the Group in the Republic of Ireland are taxable at either 12.5% or 25%, depending upon the nature of the income.\n\nCapital allowances are tax reliefs provided in law for the expenditure the Group makes on property, plant and equipment. The rates are determined by Parliament annually and spread the tax relief due over a number of years. This contrasts with the accounting treatment for such spending, where the expenditure on property, plant and equipment is treated as an asset with the cost being depreciated over the useful life of the asset, or impaired if the value of such assets is considered to have reduced materially.\n\nThe different accounting treatment of property, plant and equipment for tax and accounting purposes means that the taxable income of the Group is not the same as the profit reported in the financial statements. The substantial reversals of impairments and impairments undertaken in previous years in relation to certain property, plant and equipment assets, result in the depreciation or impairment charge to profit for the year differing to the amount of capital allowances due to the Group.\n\nShort term temporary differences arise on items such as provisions for restructuring costs and onerous contracts, and retirement benefit obligations, because the treatment of such items is different for tax and accounting purposes. These differences usually reverse in the year following that in which they arise, as is reflected in the deferred tax charge in these financial statements. Where interest charges or other costs are capitalised in the accounts, tax relief is either given as the charges are incurred or when the costs are taken to the income statement.\n\nAs explained at Accompanying Information A1 and A6 \uf150 , the Group measures its operating and financing derivatives at fair value under IFRS 9. As a result of the Group's subsidiaries applying the HMRC's 'disregard regulations', the re-measurement movements have no current tax effect impacting only the deferred tax position.\n\nAs detailed at note 22 and explained in the Accompanying Information A1 \uf150 , the Group has issued Hybrid equity securities which are treated as a component of equity. While the coupon payments relating to these securities are treated as distributions to the holders of the equity instruments, tax relief is allowed on the amount paid in the year. These tax credits are linked to the past transactions or events that support the coupon payments and consequently the tax credits are reported in the income statement.",

Scotia Gas Networks Limited ('SGN') operates the gas distribution networks in Scotland and the South of England. The Group's gas supply activity incurs gas distribution charges while the Group also provides services to SGN in the form of a management services agreement for corporate and shared services. On 2 August 2021, the Group announced it had agreed to sell its 33.3% stake in SGN. The Group assessed that the investment met the criteria to be classified as held for sale on 11 June 2021 when an Exclusivity Agreement was signed by the acquiring consortium. Accordingly, from 11 June 2021 the Group ceased to equity account for SGN. On 22 March 2022 the Group completed its disposal its interest in SGN.\n\nThe amounts outstanding are trading balances, are unsecured and will be settled in cash. No guarantees have been given or received. No provisions have been made for doubtful debts in respect of the amounts owed by related parties. Aggregate capital loans to joint ventures and associates are shown in note 16.\n\n## A6. Financial risk management\n\nThis note presents information about the fair value of the Group's financial instruments, the Group's exposure to the risks associated with those instruments, the Group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group's management of capital. Further qualitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 Credit risk\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk\n- \u00b7 Commodity risk\n- \u00b7 Currency risk\n- \u00b7 Interest rate risk\n\nThe Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework. The Group's policies for risk management are established to identify the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Exposure to commodity, currency and interest rate risks arise in the normal course of the Group's business and derivative financial instruments are entered into to hedge exposure to these risks.",

        "page_content": "## Accompanying information continued\n\n## A6. Financial risk management continued\n\nSSE has a Group wide risk committee reporting to the Group Executive Committee, which is responsible for reviewing the strategic, market, credit, operational and liquidity risks and exposures that arise from the Group's operating activities. In addition, the Group has two dedicated Energy Market risk committees reporting to the Group Executive Committee and Board respectively, with the Group Executive Sub-committee chaired by the Group Finance Director and the Board Sub-committee chaired by Non-Executive Director Tony Cocker. These Committees oversee the Group's management of its energy market exposures, including its approach to hedging.\n\nDuring the year ended 31 March 2022, the Group was exposed to exceptional volatility in energy markets impacting the primary commodities to which it is exposed (Gas, Carbon and Power). The Group's approach to hedging, and the diversity of its energy portfolios (across Wind, Hydro, Thermal and Customers) has provided significant mitigation of these exposures. Exceptional rises and volatility in commodity prices have created a particular challenge in managing counter-party credit and collateral exposures and requirements, to ensure continued access to energy markets to enable hedging and prompt optimisation of SSE's energy portfolios. This market access has been successfully maintained.\n\nExposure to the commodity, currency and interest rate risks noted arise in the normal course of the Group's business and derivative financial instruments are entered into to hedge exposure to these risks. The objectives and policies for holding or issuing financial instruments and similar contracts, and the strategies for achieving those objectives that have been followed during the year are explained below.\n\n## A6.1 Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations.\n\nCredit risk arising from the Group's normal commercial operations is controlled by individual business units operating in accordance with Group policies and procedures. Generally, for significant contracts, individual business units enter into contracts or agreements with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings only, or where suitable collateral or other security has been provided. Counterparty credit validation is undertaken prior to contractual commitment.\n\nCredit risk management for the Group's SSEN Transmission and SSEN Distribution businesses is performed in accordance with industry standards as set out by the Regulator and is financially controlled by the individual business units. The Group's greatest credit risks lie with the operations of the Customers business, the wholesale procurement activities conducted by Energy Portfolio Management ('EPM') under a trust arrangement and the activities carried out by the Group's Treasury function. In all cases, specific credit risk controls that match the risk profile of those activities are applied. Exposure to credit risk in the retail supply of electricity and gas to end user customers arises from the potential of a customer defaulting on their invoiced payables. The Group exposure to retail supply customers is limited to customers of the Group's Airtricity business. The creditworthiness of these customers is reviewed from a variety of internal and external information. The financial strength and creditworthiness of business customers is assessed prior to commencing, and for the duration of, their contract of supply.\n\nExposure to credit risk in the procurement of wholesale energy and fuel is managed by reference to agreed transaction credit limits which are determined by whether the counterparty:\n\n- \u00b7 holds an investment grade credit rating; or\n- \u00b7 can be assessed as adequately creditworthy in accordance with internal credit rules using information from other external credit agencies; or\n- \u00b7 can provide a guarantee from an investment grade rated entity or post suitable collateral or provide other acceptable assurances in accordance with group procedures where they have failed to meet the above conditions; or\n- \u00b7 can be allocated a non-standard credit limit approved by the relevant Risk or Treasury Committee within its authorised limits as delegated by the Group Board.\n\nCredit support clauses and Master Netting Agreements are typically included or entered into in order to mitigate the impact to the Group against counterparty failure or non-delivery. As part of its normal activities, EPM transacts significant volumes of commodity derivative products through cleared exchanges to mitigate credit risk. Such exchanges are subject to strict regulation by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and participants in these exchanges are obliged to meet rigorous capital adequacy requirements.\n\nIndividual counterparty credit exposures are monitored regularly and are subject to approved limits. At 31 March 2022, EPM had pledged \u00a3545.9m (2021: \u00a3201.8m) of cash collateral and letters of credit and had received \u00a395.8m (2021: \u00a380.1m) of cash collateral and letters of credit principally to reduce exposures on credit risk.\n\nBank credit exposures, which are monitored and reported on daily, are calculated on a mark-to-market basis and adjusted for future volatility and probability of default. Any issues relating to these credit exposures are presented for discussion and review by the Tax and Treasury Committee.\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits which are readily convertible to cash. These are subject to insignificant risk of change in value or credit risk.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are entered into to cover the Group's market risks - commodity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk - and are consequently covered elsewhere in this note.\n\nTrade receivables represent the most significant exposure to credit risk and are stated after an allowance for impairment.",

Trade receivables do not contain a significant financing element, and therefore expected credit losses are measured using the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires lifetime expected credit losses to be recognised on initial recognition. A provision matrix is utilised to estimate the lifetime expected credit losses, based on the age, status and risk of each class of receivable, which is updated periodically to include changes to both forward-looking and historical inputs.\n\n## A6.3 Liquidity risk and Going Concern\n\nLiquidity risk, the risk that the Group will have insufficient funds to meet its liabilities, is managed by the Group's Treasury function. The Group can be exposed to significant movements in its liquidity position due to changes in commodity prices, working capital requirements, the impact of the seasonal nature of the business and phasing of its capital investment and recycling programmes.\n\nTreasury is responsible for managing the banking and liquidity requirements of the Group, risk management relating to interest rate and foreign exchange exposures, and for managing the credit risk relating to the banking counterparties with which it transacts. Short term liquidity is reviewed daily by Treasury, while the longer term liquidity position is reviewed on a regular basis by the Board. The department's operations are governed by policies determined by the Board and any breaches of these policies are reported to the Tax and Treasury Committee and Audit Committee.\n\nIn relation to the Group's liquidity risk, the Group's policy is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.\n\nDuring the year, the Group's internal approach to managing liquidity was to seek to ensure that the Group had available committed borrowings and facilities equal to at least 105% of forecast borrowings over a rolling 6 month period.\n\nThe Group uses cash flow forecasts to monitor its ongoing borrowing requirements. Typically, the Group will fund any short term borrowing positions by issuing commercial paper or borrowing from committed and uncommitted bank lines and will invest in money market funds when it has a cash surplus. Details of the Group's borrowings are disclosed at note 21. In addition to the borrowing facilities listed at note 21.3, the Group has \u00a3100m of uncommitted bank lines and a \u00a315m overdraft facility.\n\nThe refinancing requirement in the 22/23 financial year is \u00a32.1bn, being the $255m (\u00a3163m) US Private Placement maturing 19 April 2022; \u00a3507m of short term Commercial Paper that matures over April and May; \u00a3300m Eurobond maturing 22 September 2022; \u00a3150m of EIB loans maturing in October 2022. On 22 April 2022, subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Group announced it would redeem its $900m and \u00a3300m debt accounted hybrid securities on 16 June 2022. The redemption of these instruments has been included in the assumed refinancing requirement within the going concern assessment. The directors are confident in the ability of the Group to maintain a funding level above 105% for the going concern assessment period based on the strong credit standing and borrowing history of the Group for both fixed debt and commercial paper, as discussed more fully below.\n\nGiven the committed bank facilities of \u00a31.5bn maintained by the Group and the current commercial paper market conditions, the Directors have concluded that both the Group and SSE plc as parent company have sufficient headroom to continue as a going concern. In coming to this conclusion, the Directors have taken into account the Group's credit rating and the successful issuance of \u00a312.8bn of medium to long term debt and Hybrid equity since February 2012, including \u00a31.2bn in March and April 2022 (being \u00a3350m dual tranche 10 and 15 year private placement and \u20ac1bn (\u00a3830m) NC6 equity accounted Hybrid). The Group's period of Going Concern assessment is performed to 31 December 2023, 21 months from the balance sheet date, which is at least 12 months from the filing deadline of its subsidiary companies. As well as taking account of the factors noted, the Going Concern conclusion is arrived at after applying stress testing sensitivities to the Group's cash flow and funding projections including removal of proceeds from unconfirmed future divestments, negative and positive sensitivities on operating cash flows and uncommitted capex and other adjustments. The Group has also considered its obligations under its debt covenants. There have been no breaches of covenant in the year and the Group's projections support the expectation that there will be no breach of covenants over the period to 31 December 2023. The statement of going concern is included in the Audit Committee Report.",

These are each allocated financial limits, subject to the maintenance of a minimum credit rating of investment grade or better allocated by a recognised major ratings group. In respect of short-term cash management, counterparties are subject to review and approval according to defined criteria.\n\nAs at 31 March 2022, the value of outstanding cash collateral posted in respect of mark-to-market related margin calls on exchange traded positions was (\u00a374.7m) (2021: \u00a337.1m).\n\nThe contractual cash flows shown in the following tables are the contractual undiscounted cashflows under the relevant financial instruments. Where the contractual cashflows are variable based on a price, foreign exchange rate or index in the future, the contractual cashflows in the following tables have been determined with reference to the relevant price, foreign exchange rate, interest rate or index as at the balance sheet date. In determining the interest element of contractual cashflows in cases where the Group has a choice as to the length of interest calculation periods and the interest rate that applies varies with the period selected, the contractual cashflows have been calculated assuming the Group selects the shortest available interest calculation periods. Where the holder of an instrument has a choice of when to redeem, the amounts in the following tables are on the assumption the holder redeems at the earliest opportunity.\n\nThe following are the undiscounted contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest and excluding the impact of netting/uni00A0agreements:\n\n2022\n\n2022\n\n| Liquidity Risk                                      | Carrying  value \u00a3m   | Contractual  cash flows \u00a3m   | 2022 0-12 months \u00a3m   | 2022 1-2 years \u00a3m   | 2022 2-5 years \u00a3m   | 2022 > 5 years \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Financial Liabilities                               |                      |                              |                       |                     |                     |                     |\n| Loans and Borrowings                                |                      |                              |                       |                     |                     |                     |\n| Commercial paper and cash advances                  | 506.1                | (507.1)                      | (507.1)               | -

        "page_content": "## Current hedging approach\n\nThe Group has traded in three principal commodities during the year, as well as the spreads between two or more commodity prices: power (baseload and other products); gas; and carbon (emissions allowances). Each commodity has different liquidity characteristics, which impacts on the degree of hedging possible. Similarly, each of the Group's assets carries different exposures to the commodity market and thus requires a different approach to hedging. As such, the Group's current hedging approach varies by each class of asset as/uni00A0follows:\n\n| Asset class     | Minimum hedge target                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Principal commodity exposures   |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| GB Wind         | Target to hedge of less than 100% of anticipated wind energy output for the   coming 12 months.

The assets were commercially operated throughout the year   and the business managed its exposure to changes in the spread between   summer and winter prices, market volatility and plant availability. | Gas                             |\n| Business Energy | Sales to contract customers are 100% hedged: at point of sale for fixed, upon  instruction for flexi and on a rolling basis for tariff customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Power, Gas, Carbon              |\n\nHowever, there are three principal areas where significant variations in earnings cannot be fully mitigated through hedging:\n\n- \u00b7 The impact of the weather on the volume of electricity produced from renewable sources;\n- \u00b7 The impact of operational matters such as unplanned outages; and\n- \u00b7 The ability of flexible thermal power stations to earn extrinsic income by providing services to the electricity system and by responding to shorter-term electricity market conditions.\n\nHedging is carried out by each asset class trading internally with EPM to affect these hedges and EPM trading onwards with external counterparties. EPM is only able to accept internal trades when there is sufficient liquidity to offset them in the external market or they can be offset with internal trades from other asset classes. In this way, the commodity risks to which EPM is individually exposed, are/uni00A0minimised.\n\nThe volumetric extent to which assets are hedged are reported monthly, and to the EMRC on at least a quarterly basis. Variations to the/uni00A0hedging approach above will be required as markets and other factors (such as asset disposals) change. The EMRC also receives reporting on credit risk, other risk measures, and market liquidity in assessing whether any variations to the hedging approach are/uni00A0required.\n\nThe Group measures and manages the Commodity Risk associated with the financial and non-financial commodity contracts it is exposed to. However, only certain commodity contracts within the Group constitute financial instruments under IFRS 9. As a result, it is only the fair value of IFRS 9 financial instruments which represents the exposure of the Group's commodity price risk under IFRS 7. This is a consequence of the Group's accounting policy which stipulates that commodity contracts which are designated as financial instruments under IFRS 9 should be accounted for on a fair value basis with changes in fair value reflected in profit or equity. Conversely, commodity contracts that are not designated as financial instruments under IFRS 9 will be accounted for as 'own use' contracts. As fair value changes in own use contracts are not reflected through profit or equity, these do not represent the IFRS 7 commodity price risk. Furthermore, other physical contracts can be treated as the hedging instrument in documented cash flow hedging relationships where the hedged item is the forecast future purchase requirement to meet production or customer demand. The accounting policies associated with financial instruments are explained in the Accompanying Information section A1 \uf150 .\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe Group's exposure to commodity price risk according to IFRS 7 is measured by reference to the Group's IFRS 9 commodity contracts. IFRS 7 requires disclosure of a sensitivity analysis for market risks that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Group's financial position and performance to changes in market variables impacting upon the fair value or cash flows associated with the Group's financial instruments.\n\nTherefore, the sensitivity analysis provided discloses the effect on profit or loss and equity at the balance sheet date assuming that a reasonably possible change in the relevant commodity price had occurred and been applied to the risk exposures in existence at that date. The reasonably possible changes in commodity prices used in the sensitivity analysis were determined based on calculated or implied volatilities where available, or historical data.",

This analysis should be used with caution as the impacts disclosed are not necessarily indicative of the actual impacts that would be experienced given it does not consider all interrelationships, consequences and effects of such a change in those prices.\n\n## A6.5 Currency risk\n\nThe Group publishes its consolidated financial statements in Sterling but also conducts business in foreign currencies. As a result, it is subject to foreign currency exchange risk arising from exchange rate movements which will be reflected in the Group's transaction costs or in the underlying foreign currency assets of its foreign operations.\n\nThe Group's policy is to use forward contracts, swaps and options to manage its exposures to foreign exchange risk. All such exposures are transactional in nature, and relate primarily to procurement contracts, commodity purchasing and related freight requirements, commodity hedging, long term plant servicing and maintenance agreements, and the purchase and sale of carbon emission certificates. The policy is to seek to hedge 100% of its currency requirements arising under all committed contracts excepting commodity hedge transactions, the requirements for which are significantly less predictable. The policy for these latter transactions is to assess the Group's requirements on a rolling basis and to enter into cover contracts as appropriate.\n\nThe Group has foreign subsidiary operations with significant Euro-denominated net assets. The Group's policy is to hedge its net investment in its foreign operations by ensuring the net assets whose functional currency cash flows are denominated in Euros are matched by borrowings in Euros. For the acquired net assets whose functional cash flows are in Sterling, the Group will ensure Sterling denominated borrowings are in place to minimise currency risk.\n\nSignificant exposures are reported to, and discussed by, the Tax and Treasury Committee on an ongoing basis and additionally form part of the bi-annual Treasury report to the Audit Committee.\n\nAt the balance sheet date, the total nominal value of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group has committed to is:\n\n|                                    | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts | 4,176.4   | 4,395.5   |",

The floating rate borrowings are provided by banks including the European Investment Bank (EIB). Such instruments include interest rate swaps and options, forward rate agreements and, in the case of debt raised in currencies other than Sterling, cross currency swaps. These practices serve to reduce the volatility of the Group's financial performance.\n\nAlthough interest rate derivatives are primarily used to hedge risk relating to current borrowings, under certain circumstances they may also be used to hedge future borrowings. Any such pre-hedging is unwound at the time of pricing the underlying debt, either through cash settlement on a net present value basis or by transacting offsetting trades. The floating rate borrowings mainly comprise cash advances from the European Investment Bank (EIB), however the Group is currently carrying a surplus cash position of \u00a31.0bn.\n\nThe impact of a change in interest rates is dependent on the specific details of the financial asset or liability in question. Changes in fixed rate financial assets and liabilities, which account for the majority of cash, loans and borrowings, are not measured at fair value through the income statement. In addition to this, changes to fixed-to-floating hedging instruments which are recorded under cash flow hedge accounting also do not impact the income statement. Changes in variable rate instruments and hedging instruments and hedged items recorded under fair value hedge accounting are recorded through the income statement. The exposure measured is therefore based on variable rate debt and instruments.",

Fair value of financial instruments continued\n\n## A7.1 Fair value of financial instruments within the group continued\n\n## A7.1.1 Basis of determining fair value\n\nCertain assets and liabilities have been classified and carried at amortised cost on inception in line with IFRS 9 criteria. The carrying value of these assets are approximately equivalent to fair value due to short term maturity aside from loans and borrowings which are subject to longer maturity dates.\n\nAll other financial assets and liabilities are measured at either Fair Value through Profit and Loss ('FVTPL') or Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income ('FVTOCI'). Fair values for energy derivatives are based on unadjusted quoted market prices, where actively traded. For energy derivatives that are not actively traded, interest rate instruments, foreign currency hedge contracts and cross currency swap contracts associated with foreign currency denominated long-term fixed rate debt, the fair values are determined by reference to closing rate market prices for similar instruments. Fair values for unquoted equity instruments are derived from venture capital or growth equity firm valuation statements.\n\nThe fair values are stated at a specific date and may be different from the amounts which will actually be paid or received on settlement of the instruments. The fair value of items such as property, plant and equipment, internally generated brands or the Group's customer base are not included as these are not considered financial instruments.\n\n## A7.2 Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n- \u00b7 Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. 2022 2022 2022\n\n|                              | Level 1 \u00a3m   | Level 2 \u00a3m   | Level 3 \u00a3m   | 2022 Total \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| Financial assets             |              |              |              |                 |\n| Energy derivatives           | 884.1        | 2,246.4      | -            | 3,130.5         |\n| Interest rate derivatives    | -            | 176.8        | -            | 176.8           |\n| Foreign exchange derivatives | -            | 6.1          | -            | 6.1             |\n| Loan note receivable         | -            | -            | 136.4        | 136.4           |\n| Unquoted equity investments  | -            | -            | 8.7          | 8.7             |\n|                              | 884.1        | 2,429.3      | 145.1        | 3,458.5         |\n| Financial liabilities        |              |              |              |                 |\n| Energy derivatives           | -            | (828.7)      | -            | (828.7)         |\n| Interest rate derivatives    | -            | (376.1)      | -            | (376.1)         |\n| Foreign exchange derivatives | -            | (46.3)       | -            | (46.3)          |\n| Loans and borrowings         | -            | (31.6)       | -            | (31.6)          |\n|                              | -            | (1,282.7)    | -            | (1,282.7)       |\n\nThere were no significant transfers out of level 1 into level 2 and out of level 2 into level 1 during the year ended 31 March 2022.\n\n|                              | 2021 Level 1 \u00a3m   | 2021 Level 2 \u00a3m   | 2021 Level 3 \u00a3m   | 2021 Total \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Financial assets             |                   |                   |                   |                 |\n| Energy derivatives           | 68.8              | 275.9             | -                 | 344.7           |\n| Interest rate derivatives    | -                 | 217.6             | -                 | 217.6           |\n| Foreign exchange derivatives | -                 | 23.3              | -                 | 23.3            |\n| Loan note receivable         | -                 | -                 | 115.9             | 115.9           |\n| Unquoted equity investments  | -                 | -                 | 3.6               | 3.6             |\n|                              | 68.8              | 516.8             | 119.5             | 705.1           |\n| Financial liabilities        |                   |                   |                   |                 |\n| Energy derivatives           | -                 | (138.1)           | -                 | (138.1)         |\n| Interest rate derivatives    | -                 | (489.7)           | -                 | (489.7)         |\n| Foreign exchange derivatives | -                 | (63.0)            | -                 | (63.0)          |\n| Loans and borrowings         | -                 | (3.2)             | -                 | (3.2)           |\n|                              | -                 | (694.0)           | -                 | (694.0)         |\n\nThere were no significant transfers out of level 1 into level 2 and out of level 2 into level 1 during the year ended 31 March 2021.",

Hedge accounting\n\n## A8.1 Cash flow hedges\n\nThe Group designates contracts which qualify as hedges for accounting purposes either as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. Cash flow hedges are contracts entered into to hedge a forecast transaction or cash flow risk generally arising from a change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates and which meet the effectiveness criteria prescribed by IFRS 9. The Group's accounting policy on cash flow hedges is explained in the Accompanying Information section A1.\n\nThe following table indicates the contractual maturities of the expected transactions and the qualifying cash flow hedges associated. Non-Sterling denominated contractual cash flows have been converted at the forward foreign exchange rate.\n\n| Cash flow hedges             | 2022 Carrying  amount   | 2022 Expected  cash  flows   | 2022 0-12  months   | 2022 1-2 years   | 2022 2-5 years   | 2022 > 5 years   | 2021 Carrying  amount   | 2021 Expected  cash  flows   | 2021 0-12  months   | 2021 1-2 years   | 2021 2-5 years   | 2021 > 5 years   |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Interest rate swaps:         |                         |                              |                     |                  |                  |                  |                         |                              |                     |                  |                  |                  |\n| Assets                       | 5.7                     | 6.1                          | -                   | 2.3              | 3.4              | 0.4              | 0.1                     | 0.2                          | -                   | (0.1)            | -                | 0.3              |\n| Liabilities                  | -                       | -                            | -                   | -                | -                | -                | (8.4)                   | (8.5)                        | -                   | (1.9)            | (5.5)            | (1.1)            |\n|                              | 5.7                     | 6.1                          | -                   | 2.3              | 3.4              | 0.4              | (8.3)                   | (8.3)                        | -                   | (2.0)            | (5.5)            | (0.8)            |\n| Cross currency swaps:        |                         |                              |                     |                  |                  |                  |                         |                              |                     |                  |                  |                  |\n| Assets                       | 160.5                   | 169.9                        | 27.8                | 96.5             | 45.6             | -                | 137.1                   | 142.3                        | 4.5                 | 17.0             | 123.0            | (2.2)            |\n| Liabilities                  | (132.7)                 | (127.9)                      | (54.2)              | (19.0)           | (47.7)           | ( 7.0)           | (157.0)                 | (151.1)                      | ( 7. 6)             | (98.6)           | (49.1)           | 4.2              |\n|                              | 27.8                    | 42.0                         | (26.4)              | 77.5             | (2.1)            | ( 7.0)           | (19.9)                  | (8.8)                        | (3.1)               | (81.6)           | 73.9             | 2.0              |\n| Forward exchange  contracts: |                         |                              |                     |                  |                  |                  |                         |                              |                     |                  |                  |                  |\n| Assets                       | 0.6                     | 9.6                          | 9.6                 | -                | -                | -                | 11.7                    | 169.6                        | 169.6               | -                | -                | -                |\n| Liabilities                  | (43.4)                  | 521.8                        | 348.0               | 137.1            | 36.7             | -                | (52.6)                  | (890.1)                      | (292.7)             | (430.7)          | (166.7)          | -                |\n|                              | (42.8)                  | 531.4                        | 357.6               | 137.1            | 36.7             | -                | (40.9)                  | (720.5)                      | (123.1)             | (430.7)          | (166.7)          | -                |\n\n## A8.2 Net investment hedge\n\nThe Group's net investment hedge consists of debt issued in the same currency (\u20ac) as the net investment in foreign subsidiaries with \u20ac denominated functional currencies being the Airtricity Supply business and the thermal plants and wind farms in Ireland. The hedge compares the element of the net assets whose functional cash flows are denominated in \u20ac to the matching portion of the \u20ac borrowings held by the Group. This therefore provides protection against movements in foreign exchange rates.\n\nGains and losses in the hedge are recognised in equity and will be transferred to the income statement on disposal of the foreign operation (2022: \u00a39.4m gain, 2021: \u00a337.3m gain). Gains and losses on the ineffective portion of the hedge are recognised immediately in the income statement (2022: \u00a3nil, 2021: \u00a3nil).",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Company financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2022\n\n## 1. Principal accounting policies\n\n## 1.1 General information\n\nSSE plc (the Company) is a company domiciled in Scotland. The address of the registered office is given on the back cover. The Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about the Group.\n\n## 1.2 Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law) including Financial Reporting Standard 101, 'Reduced Disclosure Framework'.\n\nUnder section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income statement and related notes.\n\nIt has also taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions available under FRS 101.\n\n- \u00b7 A Cash flow statement and related notes;\n- \u00b7 Related party disclosures;\n- \u00b7 Disclosures in respect of capital management; and\n- \u00b7 The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs.\n\nAs the consolidated financial statements of SSE plc include the equivalent disclosure, the Company has also taken advantage of the exemptions, under FRS 101, available in respect of the following disclosure:\n\n- \u00b7 Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair value measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial instrument disclosures.\n\nThe Company previously assessed that, on the basis of materiality, the disclosures required under IFRS 2 Share-based Payment should be removed. The Company has assessed that at 31 March 2022 these disclosures continue to be immaterial to the Company's financial statements.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Directors consider that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future (further details are contained in A6 Accompanying Information of the consolidated financial statements). The financial statements are therefore prepared on a going concern basis.\n\n## Basis of measurement\n\nThe financial statements of the Company are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments, availablefor-sale financial assets and assets of the Company pension scheme which are stated at their fair value, and liabilities of the Company pension scheme which are measured using the projected unit credit method. The directors believe the financial statements present a true and fair view. The financial statements of the Company are presented in pounds sterling.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nIn the process of applying the Company's accounting policies, management necessarily makes judgements and estimates that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. Changes in the assumptions underlying the estimates could result in a significant impact to the financial statements. The Group's key accounting judgement and estimation areas are noted in note 4.1 of the consolidated financial statements, with the most significant financial judgement areas as specifically discussed by the Audit Committee being highlighted separately. In particular, note 4.1(ii), Retirement Benefit Obligations, and the related disclosures in note 23 of the consolidated financial statements are relevant to the Company.\n\n## Significant accounting policies\n\nThe significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these individual financial statements are set out below. These policies have been applied consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment charges.\n\n## Interests in joint arrangements and associates\n\nAssociates are those investments over which the Company has significant influence but neither control nor joint control.\n\nThe Company's joint ventures and associates are stated at cost less any impairment.\n\n## Applicable Group accounting policies\n\nThe following significant accounting policies are consistent with those applied for the Group consolidated financial statements:\n\n- \u00b7 Equity and equity-related compensation benefits (Supplementary information A1.2 \uf150 )\n- \u00b7 Defined benefit pension scheme (Supplementary information A1.2 \uf150 )\n- \u00b7 Taxation (Supplementary information A1.2 \uf150 )\n- \u00b7 Financial instruments (Supplementary information A1 and A6 \uf150 )",

Supplementary financial information\n\n## 2.1 Auditor remuneration\n\nThe amounts paid to the Company's auditor in respect of the audit of these financial statements was \u00a30.4m (2021: \u00a30.4m).\n\nAmounts paid to the Company's auditor in respect of services to the Company other than the audit of the Company's financial statements have not been disclosed as the information is required instead to be disclosed on a consolidated basis.\n\n## 2.2 Employee numbers\n\nThe average number of people employed by the Company (including Executive Directors) during the year was 3 (2021: 3).\n\nThe costs associated with the employees of the Company, who are the Executive Directors of the Group, are borne by Group companies.

This amendment removes the previous restriction on recognition of any surplus. The net pension asset of the Scottish Hydro Electric Scheme at 31 March 2022 was equal to \u00a3517.5m (2021: \u00a3543.1m).\n\nThe individual pension scheme details based on the latest formal actuarial valuations are as follows:\n\n|                                         | Scottish Hydro Electric   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Latest formal actuarial valuation       | 31 March 2021             |\n| Valuation carried out by                | Hymans Robertson          |\n| Value of assets based on valuation      | \u00a32,050.5m                 |\n| Value of liabilities based on valuation | \u00a31,782.2m                 |\n| Valuation method adopted                | Projected Unit            |\n| Average salary increase                 | RPI +0.5%                 |\n| Average pension increase                | RPI                       |\n| Value of fund assets/accrued benefits   | 115.1%                    |\n\n## 10.1 Pension scheme assumptions\n\nThe scheme has been updated to 31 March 2022 by qualified independent actuaries.

The major assumptions used by the actuaries in the scheme were:\n\n|                                          | At   31 March   2022   | At   31 March   2021   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Rate of increase in pensionable salaries | 4.2%                   | 3.7%                   |\n| Rate of increase in pension payments     | 3.7%                   | 3.2%                   |\n| Discount rate                            | 2.7%                   | 2.0%                   |\n| Inflation rate                           | 3.7%                   | 3.2%                   |\n\nThe assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at 31 March 2022 are based on standard actuarial mortality tables, and include an allowance for future improvements in longevity. The assumptions, equivalent to future longevity for members in normal health at age 65, are as follows:\n\n|                   |   At   31 March   2022 Male |   At   31 March   2022 Female |   At   31 March   2021 Male |   At   31 March   2021 Female |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Currently aged 65 |                          22 |                            24 |                          23 |                            24 |\n| Currently aged 45 |                          24 |                            27 |                          25 |                            27 |",

The reduction in sensitivity is due to the conversion of the longevity swap to buy-in in during the year.\n\n## Asset buy-in\n\nOn 1 October 2019, the Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme entered into an asset buy-in, transferring the risk of volatility in the assumptions used to calculate the obligation for 1,800 pensioners and 567 dependents (covering c\u00a3800m of the scheme's liabilities) to a third party. The asset buy-in is valued under the accounting principles of IFRS 13 and is considered a Level 3 instrument in the fair value hierarchy. This is in addition to a previous buy-in completed during the year ended 31 March 2018 when c\u00a3250m of the scheme's assets and liabilities related to 617 pensioners and 190 dependents were transferred to a third party. The Company has now insured against volatility in obligations related to all pensioners to third parties (insurer PIC) and is now only exposed to valuation fluctuations related to active and deferred members.\n\n## 10.2 Valuation of pension scheme\n\n|                                             | Quoted \u00a3m   | Unquoted \u00a3m   | Value at  31 March   2022 \u00a3m   | Quoted \u00a3m   | Unquoted \u00a3m   | Value at  31 March   2021 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------|---------------|--------------------------------|-------------|---------------|--------------------------------|\n| Equities                                    | 39.5        | -             | 39.5                           | 50.3        | -             | 50.3                           |\n| Government bonds                            | 719.1       | -             | 719.1                          | 660.9       | -             | 660.9                          |\n| Insurance contracts                         | -           | 713.5         | 713.5                          | -           | 780.3         | 780.3                          |\n| Other investments                           | 448.9       | -             | 448.9                          | 482.6       | -             | 482.6                          |\n| Total fair value of plan assets             |             |               | 1,921.0                        |             |               | 1,974.1                        |\n| Present value of defined benefit obligation |             |               | (1,403.5)                      |             |               | (1,431.0)                      |\n| Surplus in the scheme                       |             |               | 517.5                          |             |               | 543.1                          |\n| Deferred tax thereon (i)                    |             |               | (129.4)                        |             |               | (103.2)                        |\n| Net pension asset                           |             |               | 388.1                          |             |               | 439.9                          |",

Estimates are based on the forecast remediation or clean-up costs at the projected date of decommissioning and are discounted for the time value of money. Within the agreement for the disposal of its Gas Production assets to Viaro Energy on 14 October 2021 (see note 12), the Company agreed to retain 60% (\u00a3238.2m) of the decommissioning provision within the business. \u00a313.1m has been provided for decommissioning since the completion of the disposal due to post disposal movements in inflation and discounting assumptions. It is expected that the costs associated with decommissioning of these Gas Production assets will be incurred between 2022 and 2037.\n\n## Legal & restructuring provisions\n\nThe Company holds provision related to reorganisation of the Group and certain provisions arising on disposal of subsidiaries or investments. In the year the Company recognised a charge of \u00a335.0m for a tax indemnity provided to RockRose Energy Limited following the disposal of SSE E&P Limited on 14 October 2021. The tax indemnity is expected to be settled in the next 12-24 months. In the year the Company also recognised a provision for transaction costs associated with the disposal of its investment in SGN. These costs are expected to be settled in the next financial year.",

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework' (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the group and parent in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nThe non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company and we remain independent of the group and the parent company in conducting the audit.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the group and parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- \u00b7 Confirming our understanding of management's Going Concern process as well as the review controls in place over the preparation of the group's Going Concern model and the memoranda on going concern;\n- \u00b7 Engaging early with management to ensure all key matters were considered in their assessment;\n- \u00b7 Obtaining management's board approved forecast cash flows, covenant forecasts and sensitivities prepared by management to 31 December 2023, ensuring the same forecasts are used elsewhere within the group for accounting estimates and that the forecasts were consistent with the accelerated climate commitments made in November 2021. We tested for arithmetical accuracy of the models as well as checking the net debt position at the year-end date which is the starting point for the model. We assessed the reasonableness of the cashflow forecast by analysing management's historical forecasting accuracy. We also ensured climate change considerations were factored into future cash flows. We performed reverse stress testing to understand how severe the downside scenarios would need be to result in negative liquidity or a covenant breach and how plausible were the scenarios. The EY assessment included consideration of all maturing debt through to 31 March 2024;\n- \u00b7 We assessed management ability to raise new external funding by reviewing the strength of subscriptions to the \u20ac1bn April 22 bond issue and the interest in, and rates attached to the \u00a3350m Private placement in March 22. We engaged with specialist debt advisory colleagues to assess SSE's on going attractiveness to lenders and their ability to continue to raise new debt;\n- \u00b7 Reviewing management's assessment of mitigating options potentially available to the group to reduce cash flow spend in the Going Concern period, to determine their plausibility and whether such actions could be implemented by management. We have obtained support to determine whether these were within the control of management and evaluated the impact of these mitigations in light of our understanding of the business and its cost structures;",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Read the borrowing facilities agreements to assess their continued availability to the group and to ensure completeness of covenants identified by management;\n- \u00b7 Reviewed market data for indicators of potential contradictory evidence to challenge the company's going concern assessment including review of profit warnings within the sector and review of industry analyst reports. We held discussions with the Audit Committee to confirm the going concern position prepared by management; and\n- \u00b7 We considered whether management's disclosures in the financial statements sufficiently and appropriately reflect the going concern assessment and outcomes.\n\nThe audit procedures performed in evaluating the director's assessment were performed by the Group audit team, and specialist colleagues from our capital debt advisory team. We also considered the financial and non-financial information communicated to us from our component teams for sources of potential contrary indicators which may cast doubt over the going concern assessment.\n\n## Our key observations\n\nThe group is forecast to continue to be profitable and generate positive cashflows during the going concern period. The group is forecast to raise new debt to maintain adequate liquidity and headroom within its covenants. The strength of the ability of the group to raise new funds is evidenced by the successful issue of a \u00a3350m private placement in March 22 and a \u20ac1bn Hybrid bond in April 22 and continued strong credit rating agency positions. Our reverse stress test scenario indicated that the group would need to be exposed to severe downside events impacting profitability and cash flows in order to breach liquidity or covenants. The severe downside scenario assumed full repayment of debt maturing over the going concern period, no new refinancing over the going concern period, no uncommitted disposal proceeds, a central contingency against budget performance, offset by mitigating actions within managements control. Management consider such a scenario to be highly unlikely, however, in such unlikely event management consider that the impact can be mitigated by further cash and cost saving measures which are within their control, or through external fund raising, or a combination of both during the going concern period.\n\nThe group's principal source of funding (the revolving credit facility) extends beyond the going concern period (to 2025/2026). Having considered the severe downside and reverse stress test scenarios, we have not identified a plausible scenario where the Group would be unable to maintain cash flow liquidity and covenant headroom during the going concern period.\n\nWe found the capital commitments in the cash flow forecasts to be aligned with the accelerated climate commitments made in November 2021.\n\n## Going concern conclusion\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period to 31 December 2023.\n\nIn relation to the group and parent company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Overview of our audit approach\n\n| Audit scope       | \u00b7  We performed an audit of the complete financial information of 19 components, audit procedures on specific  balances for a further 16 components and specified procedures for 3 components. \u00b7  The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 98% of adjusted profit  before tax, 96% of Revenue and 93% of Total assets.   |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Key audit matters | \u00b7  Impairment and reversal of impairment of certain power stations and gas storage assets; \u00b7  Group and parent pension obligations; \u00b7  Accounting for estimated revenue recognised; \u00b7  Accounting for the SSE disposal programme.                                                                                                                                 |\n| Materiality       | \u00b7  Overall Group materiality of \u00a357.9m which represents 5% of adjusted profit before tax.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n\n## An overview of the scope of the parent company and group audits\n\n## Tailoring the scope\n\nOur assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each company within the Group.

Separate procedures were performed in relation to the acquisition accounting in Japan by the Primary team.\n\nOf the 35 components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of 19 (2021: 20) components ('full scope components') which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining 16 (2021: 17) components ('specific scope components'), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.\n\nThe reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 98% (2021: 95%) of the Group's adjusted profit before tax, 96% (2021: 94%) of the Group's Revenue and 93% (2021: 93%) of the Group's Total assets. For the current year, the full scope components contributed 78% (2021: 56%) of the Group's adjusted profit before tax, 94% (2021: 92%) of the Group's Revenue and 77% (2021: 83%) of the Group's Total assets. The specific scope component contributed 20% (2021: 39%) of the Group's adjusted profit before tax, 2% (2021: 2%) of the Group's Revenue and 16% (2021: 10%) of the Group's Total assets. The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group. We also instructed 3 locations to perform specified procedures over certain aspects of Cash & Bank, Goodwill and Equity Investments in associates and JCE, due to significant balances held within each location.\n\nOf the remaining 114 (2021: 97) components that together represent 2% (2021: 5%) of the Group's adjusted profit before tax, none are individually greater than 1% (2021: 1%) of the Group's adjusted profit before tax. For these components, we performed other procedures, including analytical review, intercompany eliminations and obtaining audit evidence to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the group financial statements.\n\nThe charts below illustrate the coverage obtained from the work performed by our audit teams.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Changes from the prior year\n\nThere have been minimal changes in scoping from the prior year. Both SGN and E&P have been removed reflecting the disposals of each entity. There have been some modifications to specific scope entities to reflect higher levels of trading within certain entities compared to the prior period to maintain appropriate coverage.\n\n## Involvement with component teams\n\nIn establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction. Of the 19 full scope components, audit procedures were performed on 2 of these directly by the primary audit team. For the 17 full scope and 16 specific scope components, where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.\n\nThe majority of full and specific scope components were led by the lead audit engagement partner, Annie Graham. For the remaining entities there were regular calls held between the lead audit engagement partner and component partners, with either file reviews performed by the primary team over audit documentation that has not been retained within the group audit file, or retention of key audit documentation on the group audit file.\n\nThis has been the first audit conducted by EY that was not fully remote due to COVID-19 restrictions. Other than the Irish Airtricity entities in scope, all other entities in scope were based within Scotland (Perth and Glasgow), where lead audit partner Annie Graham visited UK divisions throughout the year-end audit. The majority of management meetings continued to be held remotely across both the UK and Ireland.",

        "page_content": "These visits involved discussion of audit approach, attending planning and closing meetings (some of which were held virtually), meeting with local management and reviewing relevant audit working papers on risk areas. The primary team interacted regularly with the component teams where appropriate during various stages of the audit, reviewed relevant working papers and were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.\n\n## Climate change\n\nThere has been increasing interest from stakeholders as to how climate change will impact SSE plc. The energy sector has a critical role to play in decarbonisation, by removing carbon from electricity which in turn will support other sectors. SSE operates principally within the UK and Ireland and both are seeking to achieve net zero across their economies by 2050. The UK Government's Net Zero Strategy outlines plans to decarbonise the UK's power system by 2035 and Ireland's Climate Action Plan 2021 is targeting up to 81% emission reduction from electricity by 2030.\n\nSSE's long-term net zero ambitions are supported by a series of interim targets approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), as referenced by SSE within page 54 \uf150 .\n\nFollowing on from COP26, in November 2021 SSE plc published new accelerated science-based targets on the 1.5\u00b0C power sector pathway, committing to a \u00a312.5bn five-year investment plan. SSE intend to cut absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions by 72.5% between 2017 and 2030 and are targeting net zero for scopes 1 and 2 by 2040, providing the appropriate policy mechanisms are in place to support security of supply for customers.\n\nThe Group has determined that the most significant future impacts from climate change on its operations will be from variable wind generation risk caused by changes in climate patterns, storm damage network risk through increased severity of extreme weather events, accelerated gas closure risk through climate change and wind-capture market risk where the average wholesale power prices are lower as a result of more zero marginal cost wind generation coming on to the electricity system. These are explained on pages 42 to 55 \uf150 in the required Task Force for Climate related Financial Disclosures and on pages 68 to 81 \uf150 in the principal risks and uncertainties, which form part of the 'Other information,' rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures on these disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated.\n\nAs explained in note 2 within Accounting judgments and estimation uncertainty governmental and societal responses to climate change risks are still developing, and are interdependent upon each other, and consequently financial statements cannot capture all possible future outcomes as these are not yet known. The degree of certainty of these changes may also mean that they cannot be taken into account when determining asset and liability valuations and the timing of future cash flows under the requirements of IAS 36. Budgets and forecasts for SSE plc reflect the \u00a312.5bn investment programme announced by SSE in November 2021. In notes 15 and 20 to the financial statements supplementary sensitivity disclosures reflecting the impact of climate with regards to valuation of property, plant and equipment, impairment assessment of goodwill and valuation of decommissioning provisions and the impact of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions have been provided and significant judgements and estimates relating to climate change have been described within the aforementioned notes. We have ensured the completeness of climate consideration as part of our impairment audit procedures, including those referred to within our impairment KAM below.\n\nIn order to respond to the impact of climate change, we ensured we had the appropriate skills and experience on the audit team. Our audit team included professionals with significant experience in climate change and energy valuations. Our audit procedures were carried out by the group and component teams, with the component teams working under the direction of the group team.\n\nOur audit effort in considering climate change was focused on ensuring that the effects of material climate risks disclosed on pages 42 to 55 \uf150 have been appropriately reflected in asset values and useful life and associated disclosures where values are determined through modelling future cash flows, being Impairment considerations over Intangible assets and PP&E, and in the timing and nature of liabilities recognised, being decommissioning provisions. Details of our procedures and findings on impairment are included in our key audit matters below. We also challenged the Directors' considerations of climate change in their assessment of going concern and viability and associated disclosures.\n\nIn addition, in connection with our audit of the financial statements, we read the Other information in the annual report and Accounts and, in doing so, considered whether the Other information is materiality inconsistent with the financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appeared to be materially misstated.\n\nWhilst the group have stated their commitment to the Paris Agreement to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and also to their acceleration plan of their net zero ambitions which plans a 5 year, 10 year and 30 year roadmap, there may still be some areas in which the group currently unable to determine the full future economic impact on their business model, operational plans and customers to achieve this and therefore as set out above the potential impacts are incorporated to the extent of management's best estimate at 31 March 2022.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",

The materiality has been capped at the group materiality of \u00a357.9m.\n\n| Starting basis   | \u00b7  Profit before tax - \u00a33,482.2m                                                                                                                                                    |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Adjustments      | \u00b7  Movement on operating and financing derivatives - (\u00a32,121.4m) \u00b7  Non-recurring exceptional items - (\u00a3269.2m) \u00b7  JV Tax - \u00a346.3m \u00b7  Variance from forecast to actual PBT - \u00a321.1m |\n| Materiality      | \u00b7  Totals \u00a31,159m adjusted profit before tax \u00b7  Materiality of \u00a357.9m (5% of materiality basis)                                                                                     |\n\n## Performance materiality\n\nThe application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group's overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 50% (2021: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely \u00a328.9m (2021: \u00a327.0m). We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to the differences identified during the prior year audit.\n\nAudit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was \u00a34.9m to \u00a315.9m (2021: \u00a33.9m to \u00a37.9m).\n\n## Reporting threshold\n\nAn amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of \u00a32.9m (2021: \u00a32.7m), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nWe evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report set out on pages 1 to 203 \uf150 , including the strategic report and the directors' report set out on pages 1 to 111 \uf150 and 112 to 203 \uf150 respectively, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.",

If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\n\nIn our opinion, the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 the information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n- \u00b7 the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n\n## Matters on which we are required to report by exception\n\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- \u00b7 the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n- \u00b7 certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n- \u00b7 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\n\n## Corporate Governance Statement\n\nWe have reviewed the directors' statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the group and company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 Directors' statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identified set out on page 92 \uf150 ;\n- \u00b7 Directors' explanation as to its assessment of the company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate set out on page 86 \uf150 ;\n- \u00b7 Director's statement on whether it has a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meets its liabilities set out on page 203 \uf150 ;\n- \u00b7 Directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 153 \uf150 ;\n- \u00b7 Board's confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 68 and 161 \uf150 ;\n- \u00b7 The section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out on page 161 \uf150 ; and\n- \u00b7 The section describing the work of the audit committee set out on page 152 \uf150 .\n\n## Responsibilities of directors\n\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement set out on page 203 \uf150 , the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Independent auditor's report to the members of SSE plc continued\n\n## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\nHowever, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the company and management.\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the group and determined that the most significant are IFRS, FRS101, the Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code and relevant tax compliance regulations in the jurisdictions in which the group operates. We also considered non-compliance of regulatory requirements, including the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) and regulations levied by the UK Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulatory Authority. We have spoken with the SSE head of regulation to confirm our understanding.\n- \u00b7 We understood how SSE plc is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the company Secretary. We verified our enquiries through our review of board minutes and papers provided to the Audit Committee.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the susceptibility of the group's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with management from various parts of the business to understand where it considered there was susceptibility to fraud. We also considered performance targets and their propensity to influence on efforts made by management to manage earnings. We considered the programmes and controls that the group has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those programmes and controls. Where the risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk.\n- \u00b7 Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved: journal entry testing, with a focus on manual consolidation journals and journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the business; enquiries of legal counsel, group management, internal audit, business area management at all full and specific scope management; and focused testing. In addition, we completed procedures to conclude on the compliance of the disclosures in the annual report and accounts with all applicable requirements.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## Other matters we are required to address\n\n- \u00b7 Following the recommendation from the audit committee we were appointed by the company on 18 July 2019 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2020 and subsequent financial periods.\n- \u00b7 The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is 3 years, covering the years ending 31 March 2020 to 31 March 2022.\n- \u00b7 The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee.\n\n## Use of our report\n\nThis report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n## Annie Graham (Senior statutory auditor)\n\nfor and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP, Statutory Auditor Glasgow 24 May 2022",

The paragraphs that follow describe how SSE's Renewable and Thermal Generation and Business Energy (non-domestic supply) businesses interact with Energy Portfolio Management (EPM), which is the Group's energy markets business. The basis of preparation defines the revenues, costs and profits of each business and describe in more detail the transfer pricing arrangements in place for the financial year ended 31 March 2022. The CSS has been prepared on a going concern basis as set out in note A6.3 \uf150 of SSE plc's Annual Report.",

        "page_content": "## Summary\n\nThe Group's 'Renewables' business sells electricity and Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) from onshore and offshore windfarms and qualifying hydro to the Group's EPM business.\n\n'Thermal Generation' sells electricity in respect of gas generation to EPM. It also receives external income in respect of ancillary services, balancing market participation and other contractual arrangements with third parties including government. It purchases its requirement for gas, oil and carbon from EPM.\n\n'Business Energy' sells electricity and gas to circa 0.5m business customer accounts in Great Britain and procures electricity, gas REGOS, RGGOs and ROCs from EPM.\n\nEPM acts as a route to market for Renewables and Thermal Generation and as counterparty with the external market for the procurement of electricity and gas for SSE Energy Services and Business Energy. EPM does not form part of the CSS as it is not within the scope defined by Ofgem. The policies governing the forward hedging activity undertaken by EPM are overseen by Energy Markets Risk Committee, whose responsibilities and roles are described on page 162 \uf150 of SSE Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2022.\n\n## Renewable Electricity Generation\n\nThe Renewables profit and loss account above is based on the Group's electricity generation activity derived from natural sources of energy to produce electricity which includes wind, hydro and pump storage powered generation.\n\nRenewables as presented in the CSS includes revenue and operating profit for wholly owned renewable generation assets and also a proportion of turnover and operating profit in respect of joint ventures, joint operations and associate generation companies 1 . The principal Joint Ventures, Joint Operations and Associates included are Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Limited, Clyde Windfarm (Scotland) Limited, Stronelairg Windfarm Limited, Dunmaglass Windfarm Limited and Greater Gabbard Offshore Winds Ltd. A full list can be found in note A3 of SSE's audited financial statements.\n\nThe Renewables profitability statement bears the risks and rewards for plant performance and renewable generation output, changes in the power price achieved for renewable generation and the impact of weather.\n\nIndividual line items in the Renewables profit and loss account above are comprised of:\n\nRevenue From Sales of Electricity revenue is recognised as generated and supplied to the national settlements body. Revenue is sold to the wholesale market through EPM at either the spot price at the time of delivery, or trade price where that trade is eligible for 'own use' designation. Revenue includes the sale of ROCs generated from qualifying plant to EPM. Generation volumes are the volume of power actually sold to the wholesale market.\n\nOther Revenue includes ancillary services, capacity income, balancing market participation and other miscellaneous income.\n\nTransportation Costs include Use of System charges and market participation costs.\n\nOther Direct Costs include power purchase agreement ('PPA') costs, site costs and management charges from EPM.\n\nIndirect Costs include salaries and other people costs, asset maintenance, rates, corporate costs and IT charges.\n\nDepreciation and Amortisation the depreciation shown in the CSS is the underlying charge based on the useful remaining life of the assets.\n\n- 1 The PPA's that SSE has with its joint venture companies Clyde Windfarm (Scotland) Limited, Stronelairg Windfarm Limited and Dunmaglass Windfarm Limited provide SSE with contractual entitlement to 100% of the output of the windfarms. Accordingly, SSE has reported its rights to those volumes within its Renewables statistics and has also, as mandated by Ofgem, included 50% of the JV revenue in the CSS.\n\n## Thermal Electricity Generation\n\nThe Thermal profit and loss account above is based on the Group's conventional (thermal) electricity generation activity. Conventional generation is considered to be any generation where fuel is consumed to produce electricity and includes gas and oil fuelled generation.\n\nThermal Generation as presented in the CSS includes revenue and operating profit for wholly owned thermal generation assets and also a proportion of turnover and operating profit in respect of joint ventures 2 . The principal joint ventures included are Seabank Power Ltd and Marchwood Power Ltd. A full list can be found in note A3 \uf150 of SSE's audited financial statements.\n\nThe Thermal Generation profitability statement bears the risks and rewards for plant performance, changes in market 'spark' (the marginal profit for generating electricity by gas), changes in government and EU policy particularly surrounding emissions.\n\nIndividual line items in the Thermal profit and loss account above are comprised of:\n\nRevenue From Sales of Electricity revenue is recognised as generated and supplied to the national settlements body. Revenue is sold to the wholesale market through EPM at either the spot price at the time of delivery, or trade price where that trade is eligible for 'own use' designation. Generation volumes are the volume of power sold to the wholesale market.",

The cost of fuel also includes the long term external purchase contracts and the impact of financial hedges. The WACOF (weighted average cost of fuel) calculation includes the costs of carbon emissions (reported in the environmental and social obligations cost line in the CSS).\n\nTransportation Costs include Use of System charges and market participation costs.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Costs include carbon costs.\n\nOther Direct Costs include power purchase agreement ('PPA') costs, site costs and management charges from EPM.\n\nIndirect Costs include salaries and other people costs, asset maintenance, rates, corporate costs and IT charges.\n\nDepreciation and Amortisation the depreciation shown in the CSS is the underlying charge based on the useful remaining life of the assets and excludes exceptional asset impairments.\n\n- 2 The tolling arrangements that SSE has with its joint venture companies Seabank Power Ltd (ended 30 September 2021) and Marchwood Power Ltd provide SSE with contractual entitlement to 100% of the output of the power stations. Accordingly, SSE has reported its rights to those volumes within its Thermal Generation statistics and has also, as mandated by Ofgem, included 50% of the JV revenue in the CSS.\n\n## Business Energy (Non-domestic)\n\nRevenue from Sales of Electricity and Gas revenues are the value of electricity and gas supplied to business customers in Great Britain during the year and includes an estimate of the value of units supplied between the date of the last bill and the year end. Non-domestic volumes are expressed at customer meter point. RCRC has been allocated to direct fuel costs in the year ended 31 March 2022. In the year ended 31 March 2021 this was allocated to Revenue.\n\nDirect Fuel Costs Business Energy does not engage in the trading of electricity and gas and procures all of its electricity and gas from EPM. The method by which EPM procures energy is at an arm's length arrangement on behalf of Business Energy is governed by Business Energy's forward hedging policy. The forward trades between Business Energy and EPM are priced at wholesale market prices at the time of execution and any differences in volume and reconciliation at the time of delivery is marked to the spot price on the day. WACOG (weighted average cost of gas) also includes all Allocation reconciliations and Unidentified Gas. The WACOE and WACOG also consist of trades marked to wholesale prices when committed at the point of sale for fixed price customer contracts or when a customer instructs SSE to purchase energy in respect of flexi-priced contracts. This transfer pricing methodology reflects how Business Energy actually acquired its energy. There have been no material changes in the transfer pricing policy in respect of Business Energy since the CSS for the financial year ending 31 March 2022.\n\nTransportation Costs these include transportation, transmission and distribution use of system costs and BSUOS.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Obligation Costs relate to policies designed to modernise and decarbonise the energy system in Great Britain and include ROCs, Feed in Tariff, charges under the Capacity Mechanism and CfD schemes and charges in relation to 'assistance for areas with high electricity distribution costs' (AAHEDC). REGO, RGGOs and GOO costs related to these schemes are also included in this section of the CSS. Industry Mutualisation costs have also been allocated to this element of the statement.\n\nOther Direct Costs include: industry settlement costs, management and market access charges from EPM and other miscellaneous costs.\n\nIndirect Costs include: sales and marketing, customer service, bad debts and collections, metering costs, commercial costs, central costs - including information technology, property, corporate, telecoms costs and costs incurred to meet Smart Metering rollout obligations for the year. Where costs cannot be directly allocated to a fuel (electricity/gas), they have been allocated using costing models based on activity, customer revenue or customer numbers - whichever is the most appropriate.\n\nBusiness Energy's profit and loss account bears the risk and rewards arising from the volatility in demand for energy, caused by the weather, consumption per customer and customer churn. It is also exposed to swings in wholesale costs and the uncertainty surrounding its share of government environmental and social schemes.",

There are items which are in the financial statements and not in the CSS; and also there are items which Ofgem has requested be included in the CSS which are not in the financial statements.\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 Non-GB Electricity Generation relates to SSE's Renewables business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland;\n- 2 SSE applies equity accounting for the majority of its investments in JVs and Associates (which means it only includes its share of the profits/losses), in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Ofgem mandated basis of preparation of the CSS requires that the proportionate share of revenue, costs and profits are shown in the CSS. The revenue shown in the CSS for JVs and Associates is not present in the financial statements and is therefore a reconciling item. The share of profits however are present in both CSS and financial statements, therefore no reconciliation is necessary;\n- 3 During the year the Group disposed of a 10% stake in Doggerbank C, recognising total gain on disposal of \u00a364.3m (see note 12 of SSE's Annual Report). The gain has been excluded from the regulated revenue and profit presented in the CSS, but is included in the underlying operating profit within the financial statements in accordance with the Group's accounting policy for such divestments;\n- 4 Non-GB Electricity Generation relates to SSE's Thermal business in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n## Adjustments to reported profit before tax\n\nSSE focuses its internal and external reporting on 'adjusted profit before tax' which excludes exceptional items, re-measurements arising from IFRS 9, depreciation on fair value uplifts and removes taxation on profits of joint ventures and associates, because this reflects the underlying profits of SSE, reflects the basis on which it is managed and avoids the volatility that arises out of IFRS 9. Therefore, these items have been excluded from the CSS.",

        "page_content": "## CSS audit opinion\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe have audited the financial statements of SSE plc (the Company) for the year ended 31 March 2022, which comprise the Consolidated Segmental Statement (CSS), Basis of preparation, Reconciliation of CSS to the Annual Report of SSE plc and the related disclosure notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is a special purpose framework comprising the financial reporting provisions of Ofgem's Standard condition 16B of Electricity Generation licences and Standard 19A of Electricity and Gas Supply Licences.\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying CSS of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2022 is prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the requirements of Standard condition 16B of Electricity Generation licences and Standard 19A of Electricity and Gas Supply Licences and the basis of preparation on pages 347 to 351 \uf150 .\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) including ' ISA (UK) 800 (Revised) Special Considerations - Audits of Financial Statements Prepared in Accordance with Special Purpose Frameworks '. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the CSS, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 19 months through to 31 December 2023.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Emphasis of matter - basis of accounting and restriction on distribution and use\n\nWe draw attention to pages 347 to 351 \uf150 of the CSS, which describe the basis of accounting. The CSS is prepared to assist the Company in complying with the financial reporting provisions of the contract referred to above. As a result, the CSS may not be suitable for another purpose. Our report is intended solely for the Company, in accordance with our engagement letter dated 10 May 2022, and should not be distributed to or used by parties other than the Company. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the CSS and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the CSS does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the CSS itself. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of directors\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the CSS in accordance with the financial reporting provisions of Section Z of the contract, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of CSS that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the CSS, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.",

        "page_content": "## CSS audit opinion continued\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\n## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management.\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the company and determined that the most significant are IFRS, FRS 101, the Companies Act 2006, the UK Corporate Governance Code and relevant tax compliance regulations in the jurisdictions in which the group operates. We also considered non-compliance of regulatory requirements, including the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) and regulations levied by the UK Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulatory Authority. We have spoken with the SSE head of regulation to confirm our understanding.\n- \u00b7 We understood how SSE plc is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the company Secretary. We verified our enquiries through our review of board minutes and papers provided to the Audit Committee.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the susceptibility of the Company's CCS to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with management from various parts of the business to understand where it considered there was susceptibility to fraud. We also considered performance targets and their propensity to influence on efforts made by management to manage earnings. We considered the programmes and controls that the group has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those programmes and controls. Where the risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk.\n- \u00b7 Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify noncompliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved: journal entry testing, with a focus on manual consolidation journals and journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the business; enquiries of legal counsel, group management, internal audit, business area management at all full and specific scope management; and focused testing. In addition, we completed procedures to conclude on the compliance of the disclosures in the annual report and accounts with all applicable requirements.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities \uf295 . This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## Other matter\n\nWe have reported separately on the statutory financial statements of SSE plc.\n\nErnst & Young LLP\n\nGlasgow 24 May 2022",

It includes a dedicated Investors section where you can find electronic copies of Company reports and further information about shareholder services including:\n\n- \u00b7 share price information;\n- \u00b7 dividend history and trading graphs;\n- \u00b7 the Scrip dividend scheme;\n- \u00b7 telephone and internet share dealing; and\n- \u00b7 downloadable shareholder forms.\n\n## Digital news\n\nSSE uses a dedicated news and views website (available at www.sse.com/news-and-views \uf295 ) and Twitter ( www.twitter.com/ sse \uf295 ) to keep shareholders, investors, journalists, employees and other interested parties up-to-date with news from the Company.\n\n## Sustainable communications\n\nSSE's sustainable communications strategy aims to reduce the volume of paper being used in its communications with shareholders and other stakeholders. Shareholders are able to access a wide range of shareholder documentation, including Annual Reports, the Notice of Annual General Meeting and useful forms through the Investors section of SSE's website, www.sse.com/investors \uf295 . We encourage shareholders to accept electronic formats as the default method for accessing shareholder documentation and dividend information.\n\nAll new shareholders are automatically registered as opting to access shareholder documentation through the 'Investors' area of our website.

Interim dividends are paid in March, and final dividends are paid in September once approved by shareholders at the AGM. With significant focus on payment methods for dividends in recent years, in terms of efficiency, cost and security, SSE plc made the decision that from September 2019, it would no longer be paying dividends by cheque. All dividends are now credited to a shareholder's nominated UK bank/building society account. If you haven't already registered your UK bank/building society account details with Link Registrar or would like to amend the details on your account, you can do this by:\n\n- \u00b7 logging in to the dedicated Shareholder Portal at www.sse-shares.com \uf295 ; or\n- \u00b7 calling Link on 0345 143 4005* and speaking to one of the team.\n\nIf you do not have a UK bank or building society account, your dividends can be paid directly into a bank account outside of the UK using the International Payment service.

The terms of the offer through which the merger was effected was that for every Southern Electric plc ordinary share held, shareholders received one Scottish and Southern Energy plc (now SSE plc) ordinary share. A number of shareholders did not respond to the original merger offer, resulting in subsequent tracing communications over the following years. In 2017, more than 12 years after the formation of SSE, a complete tracing programme was initiated through the asset reunification company Capita Employee Benefits (Consulting) Limited (Capita Tracing), to locate dissentient shareholders and reunite them with their funds. The steps agreed were designed to enable the best possible outcome for dissentient shareholders and provided clear details of the actions required to claim their asset entitlement. Following the completion of all reasonable steps over \u00a32m (in a combination of shares and accrued dividends) was returned to dissentient shareholders. As required by the Companies Act 2006, the remainder totalling over \u00a39m was transferred to the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice.
