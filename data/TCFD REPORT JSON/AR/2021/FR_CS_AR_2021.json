In this challenging period, we enhanced our healthcare o/ff ering, supported the economic recovery, and announced ambitious commitments in favor of the climate transition.\n\nAs highlighted in the yearly edition of our Future Risk Report , the climate crisis continues to be a major concern, and 2021 was an important year for climate action ahead of and at COP26. This international gathering underpinned that the urgency for action is escalating, and the demand for risk mitigation and adaptation is accelerating. AXA is playing its role with renewed commitments on climate, cementing our position as a leader. This includes strengthening our exclusion thresholds for oil and gas to cover only the most responsible players and increasing our green investment target to \u20ac26/uni00A0billion by 2023. We have also made significant investments in the fight against deforestation, allocating \u20ac1.5/uni00A0billion to support sustainable forest management and stepped up our e/ff orts to preserve biodiversity via our investments and insurance activities. The creation of the Net Zero Insurance Alliance which is led by AXA and now brings together more than twenty of the world's leading insurers and reinsurers, is another important example of our engagement. The NZIA, working under the auspices of the UN Principles for Sustainable Insurance, is focused on extending our commitments to climate neutrality to the insurance business in the appropriate collective setting.\n\n2021 was also an important year for AXA in terms of structuring our actions around our purpose, ' act for human progress by protecting what matters '. Climate change and the COVID-19 crisis have only exacerbated the protection gap, both in mature and emerging markets. Accordingly, AXA has committed to creating simple, fair and accessible insurance products through our Inclusive Protection business to address this pressing issue. As a result of this strategy, we now protect nearly 10/uni00A0million emerging clients worldwide, enabling these individuals and their communities, to improve their overall financial health and protection, and ultimately ensure sustained economic growth in the face of unexpected events. We are also focused on extending this strategy to mature markets to address the growing social issues facing the lower middle class that are not always covered by traditional insurance products.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe strength of our balance sheet, with a Solvency ratio of 217% up 17/uni00A0points from 200%, has enabled the Board of Directors to propose an increased dividend of \u20ac1.54 per share following the completion of a share buyback of \u20ac1.7/uni00A0billion. These operations are in line with our long-term policy of steadily increasing earnings per share. It is also the result of the commitment of our employees, agents and partners, whom/uni00A0I would like to warmly thank for their dedicated work and their involvement in contributing to AXA's performance.\n\nIn a context that remains di/ff icult,/uni00A0I am truly impressed by all that our employees have done to contribute to this solid performance. While the pandemic has taken its toll on all of us,/uni00A0I am also very happy to note that the morale at AXA remains very strong with an eNPS at 36 (employee recommendation indicator) at the end of 2021, up 2/uni00A0points from June of last year. It represents a remarkable achievement and a testament to our resilience as an organization. It is also a reflection of the success of our Smart Working strategy to give our employees more flexibility. The cumulative daily challenges we face as a result of the pandemic also meant that awareness around the topic of mental health is increasingly important, and here too/uni00A0I am very proud of the role AXA has taken, o/ff ering psychological support to our employees and customers and also working to destigmatize this issue and make it more mainstream.\n\nThis year will also be my last contribution to the Annual Report as Chairman of the Board of Directors of AXA before my retirement. In March/uni00A02021, following a thorough succession planning process conducted by the Compensation and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, the Board unanimously decided to appoint Antoine Gosset-Grainville as Chairman of the Board of Directors a/f\\_t er the Annual General Assembly meeting in April/uni00A02022. His extensive experience in the business world and in public service, as well as his experience as the co-founder and head of a major law firm in Paris, will be assets that will enable AXA to continue its development and ensure its future success.\n\nAfter 27/uni00A0years at AXA,/uni00A0I will be leaving with emotion and pride, feeling confident that AXA is in a strong position, financially solid, engaged with society to tackle the future challenges and with a great leadership team. On behalf of the Board of Directors,/uni00A0I would also like to express my sincere thanks to Thomas Buberl and the Management Committee members for their exceptional stewardship of AXA through this tumultuous period, which puts us well on track to achieve the objectives of the 2021-2023/uni00A0strategic plan.\n\nDenis Duverne",

Coming out of a crisis that disrupted societies and shut down the economy, we laid the foundations for a solid and sustainable recovery. AXA demonstrated its strength, agility and commitment to act for the benefit of all.\n\nIn line with our dual mission - to protect and finance the economy - we have amplified this momentum. Wherever we operate, we have stood by our clients and invested in future growth. In France, we were one of the leading contributors to SME funding and recovery schemes.\n\nWe have also drawn lessons from this exceptional episode. In a world of work that is undergoing profound transformation, we have expanded the use of remote working and shi/f\\_t ed our culture toward more flexibility and trust. In the context of a crisis that has revealed the importance of health, we have once again extended our employee care and wellbeing program, confirming our ambition to make AXA one of the best companies to work for.\n\nIn 2021, the Group's operating performance was excellent, with revenues up by 6% to \u20ac100/uni00A0billion and a 61% increase in underlying earnings to \u20ac6.8/uni00A0billion. In particular, this year has confirmed the relevance of the strategic repositioning carried out since 2016: despite a persistently high level of natural catastrophes, our Property & Casualty Commercial business met its targets, with AXA XL recording underlying earnings of \u20ac1.2/uni00A0billion.\n\nThese good results are also reflected in the confidence of our clients, with 97% of our lines of business achieving a Net Promoter Score above or equal market average. The satisfaction of our 95/uni00A0million clients is our first reward, and/uni00A0I would like to thank them for their continued trust. We will continue to be at their side to bring serenity in the face of ever-changing risks.\n\nOnce again this year, AXA kept up its innovation e/ff orts to meet new protection needs. In particular, we deployed a digital healthcare platform in our main European markets, with the ambition to streamline and enhance users' healthcare experience.\n\nFinally, with a Solvency/uni00A0II ratio of 217%, up 17/uni00A0points, the Group has demonstrated its great strength. This allows us to pursue our attractive capital management policy, with the launch in 2021 of a \u20ac1.7/uni00A0billion share buyback program.\n\nIn line with our purpose - ' act for human progress by protecting what matters ' - we have also stepped up our commitments in the fight against climate change and protection of biodiversity. The Group has strengthened its exclusion thresholds in the energy sector to cover only the most responsible players, raised its green investment target to \u20ac26/uni00A0billion by 2023 and taken over the chairmanship of the Net Zero Insurance Alliance, a coalition of insurers committed to decarbonizing their portfolios.\n\nThis year has therefore confirmed our determination to meet the objectives of the ' Driving Progress 2023 ' plan and to capitalize on AXA's transformation to seize new growth opportunities.\n\nAt the time of writing, Russia has invaded Ukraine triggering a war in Europe for the first time in more than 75 years. The direct impact of this war on our business is limited at this stage, as AXA exited the Ukrainian market in 2019 and has non-material exposures in Russia. The Group continues to monitor the situation closely to ensure compliance with international sanctions, while supporting humanitarian e/ff orts on the ground. However, the World and Europe are facing an unchartered, highly volatile situation, and indirect consequences of the conflict could have lasting consequences on our environment, starting with equity markets, interest rates and inflation, that we will need to assess and adapt to in the coming weeks and months.\n\n2022 marks the end of Denis Duverne's term as Chairman of AXA's Board of Directors./uni00A0I am pleased to have worked alongside him over the past six years and to have benefited from his exceptional knowledge of the Group and his deep experience. His convictions on the role of our industry in society have been a strength in developing our ESG commitments and bringing our purpose to life./uni00A0I would like to express my gratitude to him for our always stimulating and constructive discussions and his great support in the transformation of AXA since 2016.\n\nFinally,/uni00A0I would like to express my gratitude for the exceptional work of the Group's 149,000/uni00A0employees, agents and partners who, despite uncertainties and the jolts of the health situation, have maintained an unfailing commitment to serving our stakeholders./uni00A0I know/uni00A0I can count on their energy and exceptional dedication to lead AXA towards a successful future.\n\nThomas Buberl\n\nChief Executive O/ff icer\n\nI\n\nI",

Future dividends will depend on a variety of factors including AXA's earnings, consolidated financial condition, applicable capital and solvency requirements, prevailing financial market conditions and the general economic environment. Proposals for dividend payments are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and are submitted for approval to the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nAXA's dividend policy is based on underlying Earnings per share. AXA targets to pay aggregate dividends in a general range of 55%-65% of underlying Earnings per share. The dividend proposed by the Board of Directors in any particular year may vary considerably depending on a variety of factors (as noted\n\nabove) which may have an impact on this target from one year to another. In assessing the dividend to be paid in any given year, Management tries to strike the appropriate balance between (i)/uni00A0prudent capital management, (ii)/uni00A0reinvestment of previous results to support business development, and (iii)/uni00A0an attractive dividend for shareholders.\n\nA dividend of \u20ac1.54 per share for the 2021 fiscal year will be proposed to the Shareholders' Meeting to be held on April/uni00A028, 2022.\n\nThe following table sets forth information on the dividends declared and paid in respect of the last five fiscal years:\n\n|   Fiscal year | Distribution  (in Euro/uni00A0million)   | Number of shares  (on December/uni00A031)   | Net dividend  per/uni00A0share  (in Euro)   | Dividend per share  eligible for a tax relief  (in Euro)   | Gross dividend   | per/uni00A0share  (in Euro)   |    |    |    |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|----|----|----|\n|          2017 | 3,056                                    | 2,425,235,751                               | 1.26  (b)                                   | 1.26                                                       | (b)              | 1.26  (b)                     |    |    |    |\n|          2018 | 3,249                                    | 2,424,916,626                               | 1.34  (c)                                   |                                                            | 1.34  (c)        | 1.34  (c)                     |    |    |    |\n|          2019 | 1,765                                    | 2,417,695,123                               | 0.73  (d)                                   |                                                            | 0.73  (d)        | 0.73  (d)                     |    |    |    |\n|          2020 | 3,458                                    | 2,418,389,408                               | 1.43                                        | (e)                                                        | 1.43  (e)        | 1.43  (e)                     |    |    |    |\n|          2021 | 3,729/uni00A0 (a)                        | 2,421,568,696                               | 1.54                                        | (f)                                                        | 1.54  (f)        | 1.54  (f)                     |    |    |    |\n\nDividends not claimed within five years a/f\\_t er the payout date become the property of the French Public Treasury.\n\nFor further information on AXA's dividend, see Note/uni00A029.5 'Other items: Restriction on dividend payments to shareholders' in Part/uni00A06 'Consolidated Financial Statements' and Section/uni00A07.3 'General Information - Bylaws - Rights, preferences and restrictions attached to the shares' of this Annual Report.

In line with the green bond market standards (ICMA's Green Bond Principles), AXA will publish an allocation and impact report annually to track the financing of Green Projects and their associated positive environmental impacts.\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITIONS\n\nThis issuance is consistent with the Group's expectations for debt gearing over its 2020-2023/uni00A0strategic plan, as communicated at AXA's 2020 Investor Day.\n\nThis first green subordinated bond issuance placed with institutional investors in April matures in 2041. The initial fixed coupon has been set at 1.375% per annum until the end of the 6-month call window period (October/uni00A02031), when it will become a floating coupon based on 3-month EURIBOR plus a margin including a 100 basis points step up.\n\nInvestor demand was strong with more than 100 institutional investors participating, mainly asset managers, insurers and pension funds essentially across Europe.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe bonds will be treated as capital from a regulatory and rating agencies' perspective within applicable limits. The transaction was structured for the bonds to be eligible as Tier/uni00A02 capital under Solvency/uni00A0II.\n\nThe bonds are rated BBB+/Stable by Standard & Poor's, A3(hyb)/ Stable by Moody's and BBB/Stable by Fitch. Settlement of the bonds took place on April/uni00A07, 2021.\n\n## AXA allocated \u20ac2/uni00A0billion to French Recovery Participatory Loan scheme\n\nOn April/uni00A026, 2021, AXA announced a \u20ac2/uni00A0billion allocation to the Pr\u00eats Participatifs Relance to strengthen SME capital in France.\n\nThis scheme, deployed in coordination with the French Insurance Federation (FFA) and a network of partner banks, aims to provide up to \u20ac14/uni00A0billion in participative loans by June/uni00A02022 to French companies a/ff ected by the crisis linked to COVID-19. Guaranteed 30% by the State, these participative loans meet insurer investment criteria and constitute a suitable investment to finance the economic recovery.\n\nThe loans will help strengthen the balance sheet and finance the growth of nearly 12,000/uni00A0SMEs in all sectors of the French economy. They will be granted to beneficiaries under simple terms and at attractive rates.\n\nThis initiative complements AXA's previous commitments to financing the economy, such as the \u20ac500/uni00A0million mandate given to the CAPZA Expansion fund to support French SMEs. Deployed since July/uni00A02020, this mechanism helps strengthen the capital of companies a/ff ected by the health crisis and o/ff ers them targeted support to continue their development.\n\n## Shareplan 2021\n\nOn August/uni00A023, 2021, the AXA Group announced that it would o/ff er to its employees, in and outside of France, the opportunity to subscribe to shares issued by way of a capital increase reserved to employees ('Shareplan 2021'). This operation, deeply rooted in AXA's culture, is a powerful lever to strengthen the existing links with our teams, by associating them even further to the Group's performance and its long-term successes. Approximately 21,000/uni00A0employees in 36/uni00A0countries, representing nearly 19% of the eligible employees, subscribed to Shareplan 2021.\n\nThe aggregate proceeds from the o/ff ering amount to nearly \u20ac293/uni00A0million, for a total of 13,828,756 newly-issued shares, subscribed at a price of \u20ac18.86/uni00A0for the classic plan and \u20ac21.98/uni00A0for the leveraged plan. The new shares are created with full rights as of January/uni00A01, 2021. This o/ff ering increases the total number of outstanding AXA shares which amounts to 2,432,985,381 on November/uni00A026, 2021.\n\nFollowing Shareplan 2021, AXA's employees hold 4.16% of the share capital and 5.69% of the voting rights.",

This strategy aims to implement a hybrid way of working, combining remote work and o/ff ice presence by enabling employees on a voluntary basis to work remotely with two days as a general guide.\n\nThese principles will be deployed by 2023, they have been applied in the major entities employing over 70% of AXA employees. The program will include change management and training measures, adaptation of workspaces and provision of IT equipment. Particular attention will be paid to the autonomy and responsibility of teams, and to the cohesion and well-being of employees. Smart working will not preclude eligible employees to work full time in the o/ff ice if they want to or need to, depending on the specificity of their job.\n\nThis decision is based on the successful implementation of remote working - with 38% of employees regularly working from home prior to the crisis, and 90% of them wishing to increase the practice of remote working in the future - as well as on the experience gained during the COVID-19 health crisis during which full remote working guaranteed operational continuity.\n\n## AXA France's settlement o/ff er to restaurants - Group impact\n\nOn June/uni00A010, 2021, in the context of continuing judicial uncertainty, AXA France announced the launch of a settlement offer to 15,000/uni00A0restaurant owners who hold non-damage business interruption policies.\n\nAXA estimated the cost of these settlements to be ca. \u20ac0.3/uni00A0billion, gross of tax and before reinsurance. The cost of the settlements, net of tax and a/f\\_t er reinsurance, was o/ff set in 2021 by favorable developments related to COVID-19 in France and in Europe.\n\n## AXA published its 2021 Climate Report\n\nOn June/uni00A029, 2021, AXA announced the publication of its 6 th /uni00A0Climate Report. This report fulfils the legal requirements for non-financial reporting as well as the voluntary approach of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which AXA has supported since its creation. It describes AXA's responsible investment and insurance initiatives in the fight against climate change and measures the Group's progress in its ambition to reach the objectives of the Paris Agreement.\n\nAmong the various indicators measuring AXA's activities with regard to climate change, this report highlights the 'warming potential' methodology, which measures the impact of the Group's\n\nI\n\nI\n\ninvestments on global warming by 2050. At the end of 2020, it stood at 2.7\u00b0C, significantly below the market, whose potential was 3.2\u00b0C. This indicator is key for AXA, which committed to limiting the warming potential of its investments to 1.5\u00b0C by 2050.\n\nThe report also shows that the 'green' share of AXA's portfolios is increasing - driven in particular by the \u20ac26/uni00A0billion green investments planned by 2023 - and that the carbon footprint of General Account Savings investments continues to decline, in line with the -20% target by 2025 set by AXA's strategic plan ' Driving Progress 2023 '.\n\nThese indicators are part of a fundamental methodological e/ff ort by the financial industry to measure its climate impact, anticipate and manage climate-related risks for its business and stakeholders, and determine e/ff ective action plans.\n\n## AXA released its 2021 Future Risks Report: Climate change and cyber risk top the list of/uni202Fconcerns\n\nOn September/uni00A029, 2021, AXA released the 8 th /uni00A0edition of its/uni00A0Future Risks Report. This global study measures and ranks the evolution of the perception of emerging risks as seen by a panel of Risk Management experts as well as by public opinion. More than 23,000/uni00A0 people were surveyed. This report is produced in partnership with the IPSOS research institute and the geopolitical analysis consultancy Eurasia Group.\n\nClimate change risks/uni00A0are back at the top of the global ranking. Awareness is highest in Europe, where experts and the public once again place this risk at the top of the list. It is only in third place in Asia and the Middle East and fourth place in Africa, where the pandemic remains the main concern.\n\nThe study reveals a strong concern about/uni00A0cyber risk/uni00A0in a context still marked by the acceleration of the digital transformation and the explosion in the number of cyber-attacks. For the first time, this risk takes the lead in the United States and the second place in all other geographies.\n\nThis edition was marked by the return of climate change as the number one risk, but also by the strong concern regarding cyber risk. In the a/f\\_t ermath of the health crisis, this report also reveals society's high expectations towards public and private players to o/ff  er new and collective protection to face constantly evolving risks.\n\n## AXA announced a plan to fight against deforestation to preserve biodiversity\n\nOn October/uni00A014, 2021, AXA announced new commitments to preserve biodiversity by implementing a plan to fight against the deterioration of forest ecosystems. Deforestation is one of the main causes of biodiversity loss and carbon emissions. It even represents a double loss for the climate because forests are the greatest contributors to carbon capture.",

Currently, with more than 60,000/uni00A0hectares of forests in its portfolio, managed on behalf of the AXA Group, all of which are certified by the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification or the Forest Stewardship Council, AXA Investment Managers is an active player in sustainable forest management.\n\nAXA will also/uni00A0strengthen its investment and insurance requirements in activities that actively contribute to deforestation. This will concern certain soy, palm oil, timber, and cattle production in regions where these industries strongly contribute to deforestation.\n\nFurthermore, AXA is joining the World Heritage Sites initiative, launched by the United Nations Principles for Sustainable Insurance and WWF, and will implement/uni00A0specific exclusions on its insurance activities to protect the main biodiversity reserves identified by UNESCO./uni00A0Half of these sites, spread over 110/uni00A0countries, are recognized as biodiversity hotspots, and play a key role in natural disaster prevention.\n\nLastly, AXA will continue its ongoing commitment to biodiversity conservation through its work as a founding member of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures. This initiative will play a key role in developing a reporting framework that will enable financial institutions to identify and analyze economic activities that have a direct and indirect material impact on biodiversity.\n\n## AXA extends its oil and gas exclusions to/uni202Fsupport the energy transition\n\nOn October/uni00A029, 2021, in the run-up to COP26, AXA extended its commitment to fight climate change and protect biodiversity. AXA announced several new milestones in its approach to the energy sector by strengthening its existing Oil and Gas exclusions, with a specific focus on unconventional activities and new greenfield explorations.\n\nAXA's new commitments are the following/uni00A0 (1) :\n\nFirstly, AXA will stop investing in and underwriting new upstream oil greenfield exploration projects unless they are carried out by companies with the most far-reaching and credible transition plans.\n\n- /uni25A0 AXA excludes all new direct investments in listed equities and corporate bonds in developed markets in Oil and Gas companies operating in upstream and/or oilfield services and/\n\n## ACTIVITY REPORT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n2.1/uni00A0OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS\n\nor downstream subsectors, as well as most midstream players. AXA selects integrated Oil and Gas companies for investments based on a restrictive selection process. Less than 5% of the approximately 650/uni00A0companies identified in the Global Oil and Gas Exit List by NGO Urgewald/uni00A0 (2) meet AXA's criteria.\n\n- /uni25A0 From 2023, AXA will apply the same selection process, and take into account the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) framework as it becomes available, for its underwriting business of new insurance coverage on new upstream oil greenfield exploration projects.\n\nSecondly, AXA will significantly reduce its investment and insurance exposure to unconventional exploration and production from its business from 2022, as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 Arctic: AXA extends the scope of its Arctic investment and underwriting restrictions beyond the Arctic circle and the 70\u00b0N zone in alignment with the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP). Only businesses with Norwegian operations in the AMAP region will be maintained, given their high environmental standards and lower operational carbon footprint. AXA will strengthen the thresholds applicable to both its investments and insurance activities in this particularly fragile region, excluding new investments and underwriting coverage for Oil and Gas extraction activities carried out in the AMAP region by companies deriving more than 10% of their production from the AMAP region or producing more than 5% of the worldwide volume of AMAP-based Oil & Gas. For underwriting, exemptions may be granted if the projects are carried out by Oil and Gas companies with the most farreaching and credible transition plans;\n- /uni25A0 Oil sands: on top of the existing restrictions in place, AXA will adopt a more stringent policy by ceasing direct investments in companies producing more than 5% of the worldwide volume of oil sands. For underwriting, current exclusions will be extended to all lines of business;\n- /uni25A0 Fracking/shale Oil and Gas: AXA will no longer directly invest in companies, nor provide any insurance coverage to activities of companies, deriving more than 30% of their production from fracking/shale Oil and Gas.\n\nLastly, AXA continues to intensify its investments in green and low-carbon energies.\n\n- /uni25A0 The Group's green investment target increases to \u20ac26/uni00A0billion by 2023, compared to \u20ac24/uni00A0billion announced at the end of 2020.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n2",

Despite this support, markets were set back several times by the appearance of new COVID-19 variants, and towards the end of the year the economic recovery was dampened by the Omicron variant. Meanwhile, major vaccination programs supported the recovery of developed and emerging economies.\n\nMoreover, as observed in the first half of the year, the reopening of economies created a sudden uptick in demand that the value chain and labor market supply could not meet. Some of the resulting bottlenecks and supply-chain disruptions continued into the second half of the year. In turn, this long-term disconnect led to a sustained surge in prices and therefore inflation, which, though still expected to be broadly transitory, has been higher and more persistent than initially anticipated.\n\nWhile inflation prompted central banks and governmental authorities to rethink their monetary policies, most of them remained generally accommodative to economic recovery. Not all public bodies reacted in the same way. The European Central Bank (ECB) positioned itself to continue to stimulate economic growth while assuming inflation would decline, while the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and Bank of England (BoE) chose to react quicker to the inflationary pressures. The combined e/ff ect was an overall strong year of GDP growth mixed across geographies, as China and the United States more than o/ff set their previous contractions, while the Eurozone, the United Kingdom and Japan did not.\n\nIn Europe, while vaccinations were o/ff  to a slow start, fewer and targeted restrictions along with a ramped-up vaccine roll-out gave way to overall economic recovery. Supply disruptions weighed on some economies more than others, with Germany notably su/ff ering as car production was heavily a/ff ected. Eurozone GDP rose by 5% in 2021, with France outperforming the broader Eurozone, with GDP up 7% over the year.\n\nThe United Kingdom launched a faster vaccination program, but also had a more severe economic contraction from which to recover, as the spread of the virus in 2020 hit the country harder than other European countries. The rebound in 2021 reached +7% growth. However, a combination of the lingering pandemic and Brexit-related supply restrictions appeared likely to restrain growth outlook.\n\nThe United States posted a smaller economic contraction than Europe in 2020, and 2021 also rebounded to a growth of +6%. This dynamic resulted from the fast launch of the vaccination campaigns along with a swift easing of pandemic-related restrictions and ongoing large stimulus packages.\n\nIn Asia, China also posted a strong recovery in 2021, totalling +8% for the year, as it benefited from strong export demand. However, a zero-tolerance COVID-19 policy caused significant restrictions which dampened growth in 2021. Meanwhile, government policies surrounding energy, housing and inequality all weighed on growth throughout the year. In Japan, the vaccination campaigns started later then other major economies. However, a removal of the State of Emergency boosted the recovery and growth was up 2% for the year.\n\n## STOCK MARKETS\n\n| (main  indexes)   | December/uni00A03 1,  2021   | December/uni00A031, 2021/ December/uni00A031, 2020   | December/uni00A031, 2020   | December/uni00A031, 2020/ December/uni00A031, 2019   |\n|-------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| CAC/uni00A040     | 7,153                        | 29%                                                  | 5,551                      | -7%                                                  |\n| Eurostoxx 50      | 4,298                        | 21%                                                  | 3,553                      | -5%                                                  |\n| FTSE 100          | 7,385                        | 14%                                                  | 6,461                      | -14%                                                 |\n| Nikkei            | 28,792                       | 5%                                                   | 27,444                     | 16%                                                  |\n| S&P/uni00A0500    | 4,766                        | 27%                                                  | 3,756                      | 16%                                                  |\n| MSCI World        | 3,232                        | 20%                                                  | 2,690                      | 14%                                                  |\n| MSCI Emerging     | 1,232                        | -5%                                                  | 1,291                      | 16%                                                  |\n\nSource: Bloomberg.\n\nI\n\nI",

A/f\\_t er a cautious first quarter, developed equity markets rose quickly in the second quarter before slowing down to levels which still achieved strong gains for the year. Continued monetary accommodation from major central banks contributed to these gains. The Eurostoxx 50 posted year-on-year gains of 21.0%, including a post-financial crisis high in November/uni00A02021. This strong performance was outpaced by the S&P/uni00A0500, which rose by 26.9% over the same period, closing at a record high close to 4,800.

The S&P/uni00A0500 implied volatility index (VIX) trended lower in 2021 with a modest rise in mid-December associated with uncertainties surrounding the emergence of the Omicron variant.

This trend was particularly visible in the United States, where President Biden's control of Congress enabled significant fiscal stimulus in March/uni00A02021. The US 10-year Treasury yields rose to 1.74% by March/uni00A031, 2021, the highest level reached during the year. Yields subsequently retreated below 1.20% by August/uni00A02021, as the United States su/ff ered another COVID-19 outbreak, and closed the year at 1.51%. European bond yields followed a similar pattern. For instance, the benchmark German Bund yields reached -0.10% in mid-May 2021, but then fell back to -0.50% in August/uni00A02021, to close 2021 at -0.18%. Only the 10-year gilt yields broke this pattern as they rose to around 0.90% in March and May/uni00A02021 before retracting to 0.50% in August/uni00A02021. However, with the unpredictable communication from the Bank of England on rate hikes, gilt yields first reached 1.20% in October/uni00A02021 while ending the year at 0.97%.\n\nCorporate spreads ended the year close to the pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels and with negligible volatility. In Europe, the iTraxx Main index spread finished the year practically unchanged at 48 and iTraxx Crossover at 243. Similarly, in the United States, both the CDX IG and CDX HY index spreads remained nearly stable at 50 and at 293, respectively.\n\nThe mid-November to mid-December 2021 spread correction was triggered by a firmer position of central banks with regards to the outlook for monetary policy combined with emerging concerns about the Omicron variant. However, even this impact was modest by historical standards and the spread widening was fully resorbed by year-end as market concerns faded.\n\nI\n\nI",

In 2021, previsions of continued fiscal stimulus, a faster recovery and a reversal of accommodation from the US Federal Reserve supported a strong rise for the US Dollar, which rose 7.1% against the Euro. This was in contrast\n\nwith the Japanese Yen which continued to drop 3.7% from a continued weak yield. The Bank of England rate hike expectations spurred the British Pound Sterling to rise 6.2%, even as broader concerns about trade agreements post-Brexit still weighed. Lastly, a traditionally safe-haven favorite, the Swiss Franc strengthened against the Euro by 4.2% by the end of the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## Market Conditions\n\n## INSURANCE ACTIVITIES\n\n## Current Engines\n\nIn 2021, the French Savings insurance market grew by 30% to reach \u20ac151.1/uni00A0billion premiums, following a year significantly impacted by the COVID-19 sanitary crisis. In fact, the industry witnessed historical records in premiums collection, especially in Unit-Linked, which represented 39% of total premiums. On the Pension savings market, French households significantly increased investments in the Plan \u00c9pargne Retraite (PER) product (reserves reaching ca. \u20ac50/uni00A0billion) and covering more than 4/uni00A0million clients.\n\nThe French Protection & complementary Health insurance market faced several uncertainties in 2021, such as increased medical expenses following the third and final implementation phase of the 100% Health regulation ( 100% Sant\u00e9 ), which provides free dentures and hearing aids without co-payment, as well as higher non-urgent care postponed since 2020 due to repeated lockdowns and waves of infections.\n\nThe French Property & Casualty insurance market returned to relatively normal levels following the economic turmoil caused by the COVID-19 crisis. While Motor frequency came back gradually to historical levels, insurers faced challenges due to inflation on labor and material costs from inventory shortages following worldwide supply chain disruptions.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIn Europe (excluding France), Property & Casualty insurance markets su/ff ered from a series of severe natural events causing major property and infrastructure damage. This was notably the case in Germany and Belgium from the July floods resulting from the heavy rainfall due to the Bernd low-pressure system. Furthermore, the lingering context of the COVID-19 pandemic brought about changes in the consumers' behavior, with notably a less extensive use of personal cars due to the reduction of commute to work and vacation travels. This increased the strong market pressure on pricing in Motor Individual business. On the other hand, the other lines of businesses benefited from the recovery of the economy. Measures on tari/ff s were taken to cover persistent uncertainties on the economic and legal environment and the increase in damages caused by natural events. In Life & Savings, the more favorable economic context restored policyholders' confidence, leading to a recovery in activity with positive flows. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, customers have shown a high interest towards Health insurance and are now more willing to turn to private insurers for extended coverage and high quality services. This has led to an improvement of the insurance o/ff er, notably thanks to the further acceleration in the digitalization of services, such as teleconsultation, and continuous developments of new digital partnerships for innovative services.",

        "page_content": "In Japan , the Life & Savings insurance market recovered from the 2020 depression and improved by 4.3% in terms of GWP while new business premiums increased by 13.3% (Life & Savings +14.2% and Health +12.9%). The market experienced another State of Emergency due to the sanitary situation and economic activity settled back to normality at the end of 2021 with the acceleration of vaccination campaigns. The relaxation of restrictions on sales activities and the development of remote sales also contributed to the market recovery in 2021. The Property & Casualty insurance market slightly decreased by 0.8% as the drop in Personal Accident, Marine and Compulsory Automobile Liability Insurance ('CALI') businesses was almost o/ff set by increases in Motor, Household and Casualty.\n\nIn Hong Kong , the Property & Casualty insurance market showed stronger price competition especially on large contracts. The travel insurance premium continued to shrink due to containment measures linked to the COVID-19 crisis. The Life & Savings insurance market continued to be impacted by border restrictions as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, resulting in lower new business sales to Mainland Chinese Visitors. To mitigate this, short-pay products like high-guaranteed endowment plans were introduced by market participants targeting higher domestic growth. The Health insurance market experienced fierce competition while tax-deductible voluntary Health insurance certified plans were still among the key products sold during the tax season.\n\nThe United States Property sector endured another costly year, with weather disasters causing materially higher damage than previous years, primarily due to a very active Atlantic hurricane season with 21 named tropical storms, most notably hurricane Ida damaging New Orleans and causing flooding in New Jersey and New York City. The United States also recorded exceptional winter storms in Texas in February, as well as Tornadoes hitting/uni00A06 Central and Southeastern States, mainly Colorado, in December. A/f\\_t er su/ff  ering material COVID-19 losses last year, the sector recovered partially in 2021, as a consequence of e/ff ective vaccination campaigns and overall lower mobility restrictions enforced by public authorities. These developments supported carriers to restore profitability through increased pricing, tighter terms and conditions, as well as more selective capacity deployment.\n\n## ACTIVITY REPORT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n2.2/uni00A0MARKET ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe United States Casualty sector benefited from the recovery of the economic activity following the COVID-19 crisis, although liability losses are still subject to court decisions and rulings to come. Persistent social inflation sustained the need for increased pricing and selective underwriting. With rapidly increasing Cyber threats, insurers have/uni00A0been implementing restrictive measures and re-assessing their risk appetite to mitigate deriving losses.\n\n## High Potentials\n\nIn Asia High Potentials , the insurance market benefited across geographies from the e/ff ects of economic recoveries and increasing customers' risk awareness towards insurance protections. However, it remained challenged by regulatory changes in China, where the Property & Casualty insurance market decreased by 0.4%, penalized by the Motor price deregulation issued in September/uni00A02020 (7% decrease), but compensated by the development of Non-Motor products (13% annual growth). The Health market grew by 22%, a/f\\_t er an average annual growth rate of 39% between 2016 and 2020. The breakthrough of the pandemic also increased consumers' awareness of Health insurance, while the new regulatory requirement issued in August/uni00A02021 on Internet Health products constrained the growth pace during the second part of the year. The Life & Savings insurance market experienced a slowdown, negatively impacting the net profit and New Business Value of most players. In Thailand, the Life & Savings insurance market increased by 2.6% from higher in-force premiums, while new business continued decreasing by 4.5%. In Indonesia, the Life & Savings  insurance market increased by 11% driven by the growth of bancassurance business (+12%), partly o/ff set by a decrease in the agency network (-10%).\n\nIn International markets , the Property & Casualty insurance market showed a positive dynamic mainly in Commercial lines in Mexico and Brazil. The Health business experienced a further strong growth in Mexico in a context of high inflation environment, and was impacted significantly by a higher frequency of COVID-19 cases.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n2",

A reconciliation from Underlying earnings and Combined Ratio to the most directly reconcilable line item, subtotal or total in the financial statements of the corresponding period is provided in the above tables. Underlying Return on Equity and Underlying Earnings per share are reconciled to the financial statements in the table set forth on page/uni00A055  of this Annual Report, and the calculation methodology of the Debt Gearing is set out on page/uni00A052  of this Annual Report. For further information on any of the above-mentioned APMs, see the Glossary on pages/uni00A0501 to/uni00A0505  this Annual Report.\n\n## UNDERLYING EARNINGS\n\nUnderlying earnings represent the net income (Group share), before the impact of the following items net of policyholder participation, Deferred Acquisition Costs, Value of Business inforce, taxes and minority interests:\n\n- /uni25A0 realized gains and losses, change in impairment valuation allowances (on assets not designated under fair value option or trading assets) and cost at inception, intrinsic value and pay-o/ff   of derivatives used for the economic hedging of realized gains and impairments of equity securities (other than the funds backing contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders);\n- /uni25A0 profit or loss on financial assets accounted for under fair value option (excluding assets backing liabilities for which the financial risk is borne by the policyholder), foreign exchange impacts on assets and liabilities, and derivatives related to invested assets and liabilities;\n- /uni25A0 impairments of goodwill, impairments and amortization of intangibles related to customers and distribution agreements;\n- /uni25A0 integration and restructuring costs related to newly acquired companies as well as restructuring and associated costs related to productivity improvement plans; and\n- /uni25A0 exceptional operations (primarily changes in scope and discontinued operations).\n\n## UNDERLYING RETURN ON EQUITY\n\nThe Underlying Return on Equity (' Underlying RoE ') is calculated as underlying earnings net of financial charges related to undated and deeply subordinated debts (recorded through shareholders' equity as disclosed in Part/uni00A06.6 - Note/uni00A013 'Shareholders' Equity and Minority Interests' of this Annual Report) divided by the average of opening and closing shareholders' equity excluding:\n\n- /uni25A0 reserves relating to the change in the fair value through shareholders' equity as disclosed in Part/uni00A06.4 'Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity' of this Annual Report;\n- /uni25A0 undated and deeply subordinated debts as disclosed in Part/uni00A06.6 - Note/uni00A013 'Shareholders' equity and minority interests' of this Annual Report.\n\n## UNDERLYING EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\nUnderlying earnings per share corresponds to Group share Underlying earnings net of financial charges related to undated subordinated debts (recorded through shareholders' equity as disclosed in Part/uni00A06.6 - Note/uni00A013 'Shareholders' equity and minority interests' of this Annual Report), divided by the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares over the period.\n\n## COMBINED RATIO (APPLICABLE FOR/uni202FPROPERTY & CASUALTY, HEALTH/uni202FAND/uni202FPROTECTION)\n\nThe Combined Ratio is the sum of the all accident year loss ratio net of reinsurance and the underlying expense ratio.\n\n- /uni25A0 All accident year loss ratio net of reinsurance is the ratio of:\n- \u00b7 all accident years claims charge gross of reinsurance + claims handling costs + result of reinsurance ceded on all accident years excluding the unwind of the discount rate used in calculating technical reserves, to\n- \u00b7 earned revenues gross of reinsurance.\n- /uni25A0 Expense ratio is the ratio of:\n- \u00b7 expenses (excluding claims handling costs, including changes in Value of Business In-force amortization), to\n- \u00b7 earned revenues gross of reinsurance.\n\nI\n\nI",

Debt Gearing is used by the Management to measure the financial leverage of the Group and the extent to which its operations are funded by creditors as opposed to shareholders. AXA's Debt Gearing is calculated by dividing the gross debt (financing debt as disclosed in Part/uni00A06.6 - Note/uni00A017 'Financing debt' and undated\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\nand deeply subordinated debts as disclosed in Part/uni00A06.6 - Note/uni00A013 'Shareholders' equity and minority interests' of this Annual Report) by total capital employed (shareholders' equity excluding undated and deeply subordinated debts and reserves relating to the change in the fair value of financial instruments and of hedge accounting derivatives) plus gross debt. Furthermore, mandatory exchangeable bonds into EQH shares issued by AXA in May/uni00A02018, and redeemed in May/uni00A02021 in exchange of EQH shares, were excluded from Debt Gearing since EQH had been deconsolidated.\n\n## Commentary on Group Earnings\n\n## UNDERLYING EARNINGS\n\nUnderlying earnings amounted to \u20ac6,762/uni00A0 million, up \u20ac2,497/uni00A0million (+59%) versus 2020 on a reported basis. On a constant exchange rate basis (up \u20ac2,618/uni00A0million or +61%) and excluding COVID-19 losses (\u20ac-1,531/uni00A0million), as well as Natural Catastrophe charges above the normalized level/uni00A0 (1) (\u20ac-502/uni00A0million) in 2020, underlying earnings increased by \u20ac585/uni00A0million (+9%).\n\nProperty & Casualty underlying earnings increased by \u20ac2,484/uni00A0million to \u20ac4,059/uni00A0million. Excluding the COVID-19 losses as well as Natural Catastrophes above the normalized level in 2020, Property & Casualty underlying earnings increased by \u20ac435/uni00A0million (+12%) driven by an improved all year combined ratio (-0.7/uni00A0point to 94.6%) stemming from (i)/uni00A0 a favorable current year technical result excluding Nat Cat charges (-1.6/uni00A0points) primarily at AXA XL from significant tari/ff  increases and disciplined underwriting, as well as from Motor frequency benefits (-1.0/uni00A0point) across Europe and in France, (ii)/uni00A0 favorable prior year reserve developments (-1.0/uni00A0point) primarily at AXA XL mostly driven by a release of COVID-19 IBNR reserves and in Europe despite exceptional French Business Interruption settlement costs (+0.8/uni00A0point), and (iii)/uni00A0 an improved expense ratio (-0.7/uni00A0point) from favorable business mix combined with cost reduction initiatives across geographies, partly o/ff set by (iv)/uni00A0 higher Nat Cat charges (+2.6/uni00A0points to 5.7%) in Europe (+3.2/uni00A0points to 6.1%), notably in Germany, Belgium and Switzerland following the summer European floods, and at AXA XL (+4.1/uni00A0points to 8.1%) driven by a very active Atlantic hurricane season (21 named storms) notably hurricane Ida in August, combined with the Texas winter storm in February and European floods in July. (v)/uni00A0 Investment result increased by \u20ac49/uni00A0million driven by higher funds distribution,\n\nmostly in Europe and in France, and (vi)/uni00A0 income taxes decreased by \u20ac98/uni00A0million as the impact of higher pre-tax underlying earnings was more than o/ff set by a favorable geographical mix.\n\nLife & Savings underlying earnings increased by \u20ac74/uni00A0million (+3%) to \u20ac2,380/uni00A0million. Excluding the disposals of the activities in Central & Eastern Europe and in Greece (\u20ac-26/uni00A0million), underlying earnings increased by \u20ac99/uni00A0million (+4%) mainly driven by (i)/uni00A0 fees & revenues net of commissions (\u20ac+146/uni00A0million) reflecting the increase in Unit-Linked management fees from the strong inflows over the past years as well as a favorable market performance combined with the positive impact from more favorable economic assumptions on Deferred Acquisition Costs and Unearned Revenues Reserve amortization pattern, partly o/ff set by higher commissions as a result of the acceleration of business growth in 2021, and (ii)/uni00A0 an improved net technical margin (\u20ac+87/uni00A0million) mainly in France driven by higher volumes combined with the non-repeat of the change in annuities discount rate and the impact from the extension of disability coverage to vulnerable customers in the context of the COVID-19 crisis in the first semester of 2020, partly o/ff set by the strengthening of actuarial assumptions in Protection business, as well as an improved mortality margin across Europe, partly compensated by the recurring/uni00A0impact of a reinsurance transaction on a closed book of whole-life insurance policies implemented in 2H/uni00A02021 in/uni00A0Hong Kong. This was partly o/ff set by (iii)/uni00A0 higher general expenses (\u20ac-57/uni00A0million) as well as (iv)/uni00A0 higher income taxes (\u20ac-47/uni00A0million), combined with (v)/uni00A0 a resilient investment margin (\u20ac-46/uni00A0million) as the yield dilution was partly compensated by higher funds distribution and management actions on crediting interests.\n\nI\n\nI",

On a constant exchange rate basis, management fees increased by 0.7/uni00A0bps due to a change in product mix stemming from higher asset values in Alternative and Equity products.\n\nGross revenues increased by \u20ac255/uni00A0million (+20%) to \u20ac1,523/uni00A0million mainly driven by (i)/uni00A0 higher management fees (\u20ac+131/uni00A0million) stemming from higher average assets under management, as well as (ii)/uni00A0 higher distribution fees (\u20ac+61/uni00A0million) coming from strong commercial momentum, and (iii)/uni00A0 higher performance fees (\u20ac+47/uni00A0million) in a context of favorable market conditions.\n\nUnderlying earnings before tax increased by \u20ac108/uni00A0million (+30%) on both reported and constant exchange rate basis to \u20ac470/uni00A0million as a result of higher revenues.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe underlying cost income ratio decreased by 3.8/uni00A0points to 68.1%.

On a constant exchange rate basis, income tax expenses increased by \u20ac36/uni00A0million (+38%) due to higher pre-tax underlying earnings as well as the non-repeat of a favorable tax one-o/ff  in 2020.\n\nIncome from affiliates and associates increased by \u20ac4/uni00A0million (+22%) to \u20ac22/uni00A0million.

        "page_content": "2.4/uni00A0LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n## 2.4 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nInformation in this section should be read in conjunction with Note/uni00A04 'Financial and insurance Risk Management' in Part/uni00A06 'Consolidated Financial Statements' of this Annual Report. The report of the Statutory Auditors on the Consolidated Financial Statements covers only the information included in Note/uni00A04.\n\nLiquidity management is a core part of the Group's financial planning and includes the management of our debt and the maturities of our debt instruments and, more generally, the Group's capital allocation strategy. Liquidity resources result mainly from Insurance and Asset Management operations, as well as from capital raising activities and committed bank credit lines.\n\nOver the past several years, the Group has expanded its core operations ((re)insurance and Asset Management) through a combination of organic growth, direct investments and acquisitions. This expansion has been funded primarily through a combination of (i)/uni00A0dividends received from operating subsidiaries, (ii)/uni00A0proceeds from the issuance of debt instruments (mainly subordinated debt) and internal borrowings, (iii)/uni00A0the issuance of ordinary shares, and (iv)/uni00A0proceeds from the sale of non-core businesses and assets.\n\nEach of the major operating subsidiaries of the Group is responsible for managing its own liquidity position, in coordination with the Company. The Company, as the holding company of the AXA Group, coordinates funding and liquidity management and, in this role, participates in financing the operations of certain of its subsidiaries. Certain of AXA's subsidiaries, including XL Group Limited, AXA Konzern/uni00A0AG, AXA UK/uni00A0Plc. and AXA Mediterranean Holding/uni00A0SA, are also holding companies and consequently, depend on dividends received from their own subsidiaries to meet their obligations. The Group's operating (re)insurance companies are required to meet multiple regulatory constraints and, in particular, a minimum solvency ratio. The level of internal dividends paid by operating subsidiaries must therefore take into account these constraints. Cash positions also fluctuate as a result of cash-settled margin calls from counterparties related to collateral agreements on derivatives. While the use of derivatives has been decreasing at the Company level, the Company's statutory results may be significantly impacted by unrealized gains and losses on derivatives used to hedge, in particular, currency and interest rate risks.\n\nI\n\nThe Company anticipates that cash dividends received from its operating subsidiaries and other financing sources available to the Company will continue to cover its operating expenses (including interest payments on its outstanding debt and borrowings) and dividend payments until the end of the current strategic plan. AXA expects that anticipated investments in subsidiaries and existing operations, future acquisitions and strategic investments and share repurchase transactions will be funded from available cash remaining a/f\\_t er payments of dividends and operating expenses, proceeds from the sale of non-strategic assets and businesses and future issuances of debt and/or equity instruments.\n\nAs a holding company, AXA is not subject to legal restrictions on dividend payments, provided that its accumulated profits are sufficient to cover distributions. However, regulatory or governmental authorities may recommend or request holding companies of insurance groups such as AXA to limit their dividend payments and many subsidiaries, particularly insurance subsidiaries, are subject to local regulatory restrictions on the amount of dividends they can pay to their shareholders. Furthermore, subject to the completion of the [Internal Reinsurance Transformation] as described in Section/uni00A02.1 'Operating Highlights' of this Annual Report, the ACPR, while remaining the supervising authority for the Group, will also have supervisory power over AXA as an ACPR-licensed reinsurance company. For more information on these restrictions, see Note/uni00A029.4 'Other items: restrictions on dividend payments to shareholders' in Part/uni00A06 'Consolidated Financial Statements' and paragraphs 'The Group's or its (re) insurance entities failure to meet their solvency and capital adequacy requirements could have a material adverse e/ff ect on our business, liquidity, ratings, results of operations and financial condition', 'We are dependent on our subsidiaries to cover our operating expenses and dividend payments' and 'The Group and our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision and adverse judicial decisions in/uni00A0the/uni00A0various jurisdictions in which we/uni00A0operate' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors'/uni00A0 (1) of this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\n2",

These funds are mainly used to pay policyholder benefits, claims and claims expenses, policy surrenders and other operating expenses and to purchase financial assets and meet potential collateral exchange obligations in relation to derivatives. The liquidity of the Group's insurance operations is a/ff ected by, among other things, the overall quality of the Group's investments and the Group's ability to liquidate its financial assets in a timely manner and to meet policyholder benefits and insurance claims as they fall due. The Group regularly reviews the quality of its assets to ensure adequate liquidity in stress scenarios.\n\nInformation on projected payments and surrenders related to Life & Savings and Property & Casualty insurance contracts are disclosed in Note/uni00A014.10.1 'Payment and surrender projections' in Part/uni00A06 'Consolidated Financial Statements' of this Annual Report.\n\nInformation in this section should be read in conjunction with, in particular, sub-sections 'Market-related risks', '(Re)Insurance Pricing and Underwriting-related risks' and 'Operational risks' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors'/uni00A0 (1) of this Annual Report.\n\n## PROPERTY & CASUALTY (INCLUDING REINSURANCE AND HEALTH)\n\nLiquidity needs of Property & Casualty subsidiaries can be a/ff ected by actual claims experience. Property & Casualty Insurance's net cash flows are generally positive. They can be negative in the case of exceptional loss events, such as natural or man-made catastrophe events. A portion of these cash flows is invested in liquid, short-term bonds and other listed securities in order to manage the liquidity risk that may arise from such events.\n\n(1)\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## LIFE & SAVINGS (INCLUDING HEALTH)\n\nLiquidity needs of Life & Savings subsidiaries can be a/ff ected by a number of factors including fluctuations in the level of surrenders, withdrawals, maturities and guarantees to policyholders.\n\nThe investment strategy of AXA's Life & Savings subsidiaries is designed to match the investment returns and estimated maturities of their investments with expected cash flows on their insurance contracts. Entities regularly monitor the valuation and duration of their investments and the performance of their financial assets. Financial market performance may a/ff ect the level of surrenders and withdrawals on life insurance policies, as well as immediate and projected long-term cash needs. Group operating entities seek to adjust their investment portfolios to reflect such considerations and react in a targeted manner.\n\n## ASSET MANAGEMENT\n\nThe principal sources of liquidity for AXA's Asset Management subsidiaries are operating cash flows, repurchase agreements, borrowings from credit institutions, drawings on credit facilities and proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares (where applicable).\n\nThe financing needs of Asset Management subsidiaries arise principally from their activities, which require working capital, in particular to constitute seed money for new funds at AXA Investment Managers.",

At year-end 2021, AXA had:\n\n- /uni25A0 a large cash position across all business lines (information on cash flows from operations is provided in Note/uni00A012 'Cash and cash equivalents' in Part/uni00A06 'Consolidated Financial Statements' of this Annual Report). As of December/uni00A031, 2021, AXA's consolidated statement of financial position included cash and cash equivalents of \u20ac25.1/uni00A0billion, net of bank overdra/f\\_t s of \u20ac0.7/uni00A0billion;\n- /uni25A0 broad access to various markets via standardized debt programs: for example, at the end of 2021, this included a maximum capacity of \u20ac6.0/uni00A0billion of French commercial paper, $2.0/uni00A0billion of US commercial paper, \u20ac18.0/uni00A0billion under a Euro Medium Term Note ('EMTN') program (of which \u20ac15/uni00A0billion have already been issued) and \u20ac1.5/uni00A0billion of French titres n\u00e9gociables \u00e0 moyen terme ;\n- /uni25A0 a debt profile characterized by debt that is mostly subordinated, with a long maturity profile. In 2021, AXA SA has issued \u20ac0.9/uni00A0billion of debts/uni00A0 (1) (net of repayments) and debt stands at \u20ac18.1/uni00A0billion at year-end 2021. Debt gearing/uni00A0 (2) has decreased (26.4% at year-end 2021, versus 26.8% at year-end 2020) driven by an increase in shareholders equity. The interest coverage/uni00A0 (3) has increased (14.3x at year-end 2021, versus 10.0x at year-end 2020) driven by higher Group Underlying earnings in 2021 and given 2020 was impacted by one-o/ff  impacts related to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nAXA has put in place a robust liquidity Risk Management framework which is reviewed on a regular basis through a quarterly monitoring of liquidity and solvency requirements in stressed environments both at local and Group level. For additional information, please refer to Section/uni00A05.2 'Internal control and Risk Management'/uni00A0 (4) and Section/uni00A05.5 'Liquidity risk'/uni00A0 (5) of this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## ACTIVITY REPORT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n2.4/uni00A0LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nAt year-end 2021, Group entities held, in the aggregate, more than \u20ac228/uni00A0billion of government and related bonds of which \u20ac139/uni00A0billion were issued by Eurozone countries, which enables them to address local liquidity needs through highly liquid assets. AXA SA also maintained broadly stable credit lines at \u20ac8.4/uni00A0billion at year-end 2021 (\u20ac8.2/uni00A0billion in 2020). AXA has its own liquidity requirements resulting mainly from solvency needs of entities under severe stress scenarios and collateralized derivatives held by AXA SA. The derivatives book is monitored and managed on a daily basis by the Treasury Department. For additional information on the currencies in which our cash and cash equivalents are held, please refer to paragraph 'Exchange Rate Risk related to the operating activities of Group subsidiaries' in Section/uni00A05.3 'Market Risks' of this Annual Report. For additional information on the extent to which our borrowings are at fixed rates, please refer to Note/uni00A013.1.1 'Change in shareholders' equity Group share in 2021', Note/uni00A017 'Financing Debt' and Note/uni00A018.2 'Other Debt Instruments Issued, Notes and Bank Overdra/f\\_t s (Other than Financing Debt) by Issuance' in Part/uni00A06 'Consolidated Financial Statements' of this Annual Report. For additional information on the use of financial instruments for hedging purposes, please refer to Note/uni00A020 'Derivative instruments' in Part/uni00A06 'Consolidated Financial Statements' of this Annual Report.\n\nIn addition, as part of its risk control framework, the Company remains vigilant regarding contractual provisions, such as rating triggers or restrictive covenants in financing and other documentation that may give lenders, security holders or other counterparties, the right to accelerate repayment, demand collateral or seek other similar remedies under circumstances that could have a material adverse e/ff ect on the Group's consolidated financial position. At year-end 2021, AXA had no rating triggers and no financial covenants in its credit facilities.\n\n2",

Those dividends were paid in cash.\n\nFor additional information, please refer to Appendix/uni00A0III 'AXA parent company financial statements' of this Annual Report.\n\n## Impact of regulatory requirements\n\nThe Group's operations are subject to a wide variety of insurance and other laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including regulatory capital and solvency requirements. For additional information, please refer to Section/uni00A07.3 'General Information - Regulation and Supervision'/uni00A0 (1) of this Annual Report.\n\n## REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe Group's operating (re)insurance entities are subject to local regulatory capital requirements which are designed to protect policyholders and to monitor capital adequacy.\n\nIn the event that the Group or any of its (re)insurance entities fail to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements, insurance regulators would have broad authority to require or take various regulatory actions. A failure of the Group and/or any of its (re) insurance entities to meet its regulatory capital requirements and/ or a deterioration of its solvency position may also result in the need for significant amounts of new capital, which could adversely a/ff  ect the Group's liquidity position. For additional information, see paragraph 'The Group's or its (re)insurance entities' failure to meet their solvency and capital adequacy requirements could have a material adverse e/ff ect on our business, liquidity, ratings, results of operations and financial condition' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors'/uni00A0 (2) of this Annual Report.\n\nThe Group maintained eligible own funds in excess of its Solvency Capital Requirement at all times during 2021 and monitors compliance with such requirement on a continuous basis.\n\n## CAPITAL MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES\n\nThe AXA Group's capital management policy is based on the following principles:\n\n- /uni25A0 AXA aims at operating with a target Solvency/uni00A0II ratio of approximately 190%;\n- /uni25A0 AXA intends to pay dividends for an amount representing a payout ratio ranging from 55% to 65% of the Group's Underlying Earnings per share;\n- /uni25A0 finally, AXA applies strict financial discipline on the use of cash. AXA intends to buy back shares to at least neutralize the dilution resulting from employee share o/ff erings and the exercise of stock options or to neutralize the dilutive impact of certain disposals on the Group's Underlying Earnings per share. AXA may also use share buybacks to return excess financial resources to its shareholders.\n\nIf AXA's Solvency/uni00A0II ratio were to deviate excessively from its target level of 190%, AXA may take measures to improve it, such as being more selective on growth initiatives, increasing reinsurance or reducing its appetite for investment risk. In any case, AXA's policy is to maintain its Solvency/uni00A0II ratio above its risk appetite limit level of 140%.\n\nThe AXA Group has defined and implemented capital management standards in order to ensure that the Company and its subsidiaries are well positioned from a competitive point of view and maintain an adequate solvency ratio in accordance with local regulation requirements. In addition, the Management has developed various contingency plans. These plans may involve the use of reinsurance, sales of investment portfolios and/or other assets, measures to reduce capital strain of new business, or other measures. There can be no assurance, however, that these plans will be e/ff ective and achieve their objectives.\n\nI\n\nI",

The classification depends upon the extent to which the own fund item is immediately available to absorb losses including in case of a winding-up (permanent availability) and subordinated to all other obligations including towards policyholders and beneficiaries. Capital elements of the highest quality are classified in Tier/uni00A01. Eligibility limits apply to these components to cover the Solvency Capital Requirement ('SCR').\n\nFor compliance with the SCR, the following quantitative limits apply: (a) the eligible amount of Tier/uni00A01 items must be at least one half of the SCR, (b) the eligible amount of Tier/uni00A03 items must be less than 15% of the SCR, and (c) the sum of the eligible amounts of Tier/uni00A02 and Tier/uni00A03 items must not exceed 50% of the SCR.\n\nHybrid debt instruments eligible for Tier/uni00A01 must not exceed 20% of the total amount of Tier/uni00A01 capital.\n\n## DATED AND UNDATED SUBORDINATED DEBT DESCRIPTION\n\nDated and undated subordinated notes issued by the Company qualify as eligible own funds.\n\nSubordinated notes issued by the Company since January/uni00A018, 2015, have been structured to be eligible as own funds regulatory capital under Solvency/uni00A0II regulations. Subordinated notes issued prior to January/uni00A017, 2015, mostly benefit from the transitional provisions set forth in Directive 2014/51/EU (Omnibus/uni00A0II), which amended the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive, as they were previously eligible under the Solvency/uni00A0I regime and were issued prior to the entry into force of Delegated Regulation EU/uni00A02015/35 of October/uni00A010, 2014.\n\nThe Company has issued dated subordinated notes ('TSR'), undated subordinated notes ('TSDI') and undated deeply subordinated notes ('TSS'), which include provisions designed to allow the Company to ensure the continuity of its activities in the event its financial position deteriorates.\n\nCertain TSR include clauses which permit or force the Company to defer interest payments. In addition, redemption at maturity is subject to (i)/uni00A0the prior approval by the Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le\n\nI\n\nI\n\nprudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (the'ACPR'), and (ii)/uni00A0the absence of any event (a)/uni00A0making the own funds of the Company and/or the Group insu/ff icient to cover its regulatory capital requirements, or (b)/uni00A0pursuant to which the Company would have to take specified action in relation to payments under the notes due to its financial condition, or (c)/uni00A0having an adverse e/ff ect on its insurance subsidiaries claim payments ability.\n\nPursuant to the terms and conditions of AXA's TSDI, the Company may, at its option, under certain circumstances and shall, in other circumstances, defer interest payment ( e.g. no dividend declared or paid in the preceding Annual Shareholders' Meeting or receipt by the Company or by certain of its principal insurance subsidiaries of a regulatory demand to restore their solvency position). Payment of deferred interest may become due in certain specified cases ( e.g. payment of a dividend, notification of the end of a regulatory demand to restore solvency, liquidation of the Company or redemption of the TSDI).\n\nIn particular, most of the Company's TSS include loss absorption mechanisms which provide that under certain circumstances where the Company does not meet its regulatory capital requirements, the principal amount of each of the relevant TSS will be written down. In such event, interest will become payable on the reduced principal amount only. The principal may be reinstated when the Company returns to financial health, as defined under the terms and conditions of the TSS.\n\nIn addition, for most of the Company's TSS, upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Company's consolidated net earnings and shareholders' equity, the Company is required to defer payment of interest. In such events, the Company may choose to pay such deferred interest by way of alternative coupon settlement mechanisms within five years (such as, issuance of new shares or other securities including TSS or preference shares, sale of treasury shares, or an increase in the principal amount of the relevant notes, subject to applicable limits), failing which the interest is forfeited. However, the settlement of deferred interest becomes due, on a best e/ff orts basis, in certain circumstances including redemption of the notes, liquidation of the Company, payment of a dividend or interest on any other TSS, any share buyback outside the Company's buy-back program, or any redemption or repurchase of other TSS.\n\nFinally, under its TSS, the Company has an option to cancel payments of interest upon the deterioration of its financial position, unless certain events have occurred in the preceding year ( e.g. a dividend payment or interest payment on any TSS, any share buy-back outside the Group share buy-back program or a repurchase or redemption of any TSS).",

Management believes the Group is well positioned for sustained profitable growth, notably in a continued hardening pricing cycle for Property & Casualty Commercial lines and a growing Health market.\n\nIn its current 3-year plan ' Driving Progress 2023 ', AXA is focused on the delivery of five strategic actions: (i)/uni00A0 expand Health and Protection, including through services and across all geographies; (ii)/uni00A0 simplify customer experience and accelerate e/ff iciency, particularly in Europe and France; (iii)/uni00A0 strengthen underwriting performance, notably at AXA XL; (iv)/uni00A0 sustain our climate leadership position in shaping the climate transition; and (v)/uni00A0 grow cash flows across the Group through continued life in-force management and Group simplification, and disciplined capital management.\n\n2.6/uni00A0OUTLOOK\n\nAt AXA XL, the insurance portfolio was successfully re-underwritten, resulting in improved technical profitability in 2021. Focus is now shi/f\\_t  ing to disciplined growth. In Reinsurance, exposure to Natural Catastrophe risks is being substantially curtailed to further reduce associated potential earnings volatility.\n\nConsidering the strong overall operating performance delivered in 2021, resulting from the Group's successful transformation and strategic actions, and assuming current operating conditions persist, Management believes AXA is positioned to deliver underlying Earnings per share growth at the high end of the 3-7% CAGR target range over 2020 (rebased for COVID-19 and excess Nat Cat losses) and 2023, and to exceed its \u20ac14/uni00A0billion cumulative cash upstream target for 2021-2023.\n\nAXA's strategy is designed to deliver sustained earnings and dividend growth, supported by enhanced cash generation, a strong balance sheet and disciplined capital management.

In this context, AXA chose to adopt, in 2008, the Corporate Governance Code for French corporations (Code de gouvernement d'entreprises des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s cot\u00e9es) published by the Afep (Association fran\u00e7aise des entreprises priv\u00e9es) and the Medef (Mouvement des entreprises de France) (the 'Afep-Medef Code'). The Board of Directors believes that AXA's corporate governance practices/uni00A0(i) are in line with the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code (revised in January/uni00A02020/uni00A0and available on AXA's website -/uni00A0www.axa.com) and its accompanying guide, and (ii) have followed the evolution of corporate governance practices in France and abroad, as well as the recommendations and standards of shareholders, regulators, the French High Committee for Corporate Governance (Haut Comit\u00e9 de Gouvernement d'Entreprise), proxy advisors, rating agencies and other stakeholders.\n\n## PRESENTATION OF AXA'S GOVERNANCE\n\n## AXA's corporate governance framework\n\nSince April/uni00A02010, AXA has operated with a unitary Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board is assisted by three Board Committees: the Audit Committee, the Finance Committee and the Compensation &/uni00A0Governance Committee.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe Board has adopted internal terms of reference (the 'Board's Terms of Reference') which notably detail the role and responsibilities of the Board and its Committees, as well as matters reserved for Board decisions. The Board's Terms of Reference include corporate governance requirements which, in certain instances, go beyond French regulatory requirements notably in relation to the role of the independent directors on the Board Committees.\n\n## Separation of the positions of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive O/ff icer\n\nFollowing Mr./uni00A0Henri de Castries' decision to step down from his positions of Chairman and Chief Executive O/ff icer announced on March/uni00A021, 2016, the Board of Directors decided to split the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive O/ff icer, appointing Mr./uni00A0 Denis/uni00A0 Duverne, former Deputy Chief Executive Officer and member of the Board, as non-executive Chairman and Mr./uni00A0Thomas/uni00A0Buberl as Chief Executive O/ff  icer on September/uni00A01, 2016.\n\nThis decision reflected the Board's conclusions that splitting the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive O/ff icer was consistent with the interest of the Company at that time. The Board concluded that the separation of roles would ensure that the Group benefits from the mix and complementarity of the respective experiences and skills of Mr./uni00A0Thomas/uni00A0Buberl and Mr./uni00A0Denis/uni00A0Duverne and would lead to a smooth transition.\n\nThis governance is also in line with the recommendations issued by the Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (ACPR) in July/uni00A02020/uni00A0in favor of splitting the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive O/ff icer of entities under its supervision.\n\nFollowing the decision to split the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive O/ff icer, the Board of Directors decided to maintain the position of Senior Independent Director.",

It also broadens the analytical perspective of the issues discussed at Board meetings.\n\nConsequently, in view of the Group's global presence, the Board of Directors, assisted in this task by its Compensation &/uni00A0Governance Committee, has set the target to have Board members with diverse nationalities and cultures to ensure a balanced and complementary Board composition, in terms of gender, expertise, experience and tenure.\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors are normally appointed for a four-year term by the Shareholders' Meeting. On December/uni00A031, 2021, the Board of Directors comprised seventeen members -/uni00A0nine women and eight men. An overview of the Board of Directors as well as the profile, experience and expertise of each director is provided in pages 107 to 115  of this Annual Report.\n\nThe objective of this diversity policy is to ensure that, over time, the Board maintains a diverse Board composition to support the Group's Management in the development of its strategic plan and the definition of its long-term objectives.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3",

Candidates shortlisted by the Committee meet with its members, the Chairman of the Board, the Chair of the other Board Committees and the Chief Executive O/ff icer. The Committee then submits its recommendations to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe implementation of the Board of Directors diversity policy is reviewed and monitored each/uni00A0year as part of the Board's selfassessment process. In this respect, the Board notably assesses the selection process for directors and measures the progress made against the predefined diversity targets. The results of this self-assessment are also discussed once a/uni00A0year during a Board meeting.\n\n## RESULTS OBTAINED IN THE PAST YEAR\n\nIn 2021, the Board, having considered these diversity criteria, managed to reinforce the diversity of profiles and expertise amongst directors, while maintaining a balanced representation of men and women within the Board.\n\n## TARGETS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS' DIVERSITY POLICY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Criteria       | Targets                                                              | Implementation and results obtained in past/uni00A0years                                                                                  | Implementation and results obtained in past/uni00A0years                                                                                  | Implementation and results obtained in past/uni00A0years                                                                                  |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Gender balance | At least 40% of directors  of/uni00A0each/uni00A0gender (Target met) | Representation of women on the Board: /uni25A0  9/uni00A0women (1/uni00A0less than in 2020) and 8/uni00A0men (2/uni00A0more than in 2020) | Representation of women on the Board: /uni25A0  9/uni00A0women (1/uni00A0less than in 2020) and 8/uni00A0men (2/uni00A0more than in 2020) | Representation of women on the Board: /uni25A0  9/uni00A0women (1/uni00A0less than in 2020) and 8/uni00A0men (2/uni00A0more than in 2020) |\n|                |                                                                      | 63                                                                                                                                        | 63                                                                                                                                        | 63                                                                                                                                        |\n|                |                                                                      | 50                                                                                                                                        | 53 47                                                                                                                                     | 53 47                                                                                                                                     |\n\nI\n\nI",

Group subsidiaries owned, directly or indirectly, by AXA does not automatically/uni00A0(i) place them in a situation of conflict of interest, or (ii) impair their independence in any way. The Board believes that allowing its members to sit on the b oards of certain Group subsidiaries is beneficial to the Board's overall knowledge and appreciation of the activity, operations, strategy and risk profile of the entire Group. Indeed, directors who hold directorships in subsidiaries may, where appropriate, provide the Board with useful insights and a precise and practical vision of the strategy, operational activities, processes and teams of the concerned subsidiaries, and more generally of the Group's business and organization. Directors who also serve on the b oards of Group subsidiaries, however, are required to abstain from participating in the debates and decisions of the AXA Board which could a/ff ect the interests of the entity in which they hold a directorship to prevent any conflict of interest or potential independence issues.\n\nOn February/uni00A023, 2022, the AXA Board of Directors determined that, on December/uni00A031, 2021, twelve of the seventeen/uni00A0Board members were independent a/f\\_t er assessing the criteria of the Afep-Medef Code: Mmes/uni00A0Patricia/uni00A0Barbizet, Clotilde/uni00A0Delbos, Rachel/uni00A0Duan, Isabel/uni00A0Hudson, Angelien/uni00A0Kemna and Marie-France Tschudin and Messrs./uni00A0Denis/uni00A0Duverne, Jean-Pierre/uni00A0Clamadieu, Guillaume/uni00A0Faury, Ramon/uni00A0Fernandez, Andr\u00e9/uni00A0Fran\u00e7ois-Poncet and Antoine/uni00A0GossetGrainville.\n\nOne member of the Board of Directors (currently Mrs./uni00A0Helen/uni00A0Browne) is the AXA employee shareholders' representative. This representative is appointed by the shareholders every four/uni00A0years from a list of candidates selected by the Group's employee shareholders, following an internal selection process.\n\nIn addition, in June/uni00A02018, two directors representing the employees, Mmes/uni00A0Martine/uni00A0Bi\u00e8vre and Bettina/uni00A0Cramm, were appointed as members of the AXA Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors does not have any non-voting members (censors).\n\nAXA\n\nI\n\n3",

In addition, the Board inter alia:\n\n- /uni25A0 chooses the appropriate corporate governance framework;\n- /uni25A0 appoints and dismisses the Chairman, any Vice-Chairman/ Senior Independent Director, the Chief Executive O/ff icer, any Deputy Chief Executive O/ff icer, any dirigeant effectif (executive who e/ff ectively runs the Company as required by Solvency/uni00A0II), and determines their respective compensation;\n- /uni25A0 convenes Shareholders' Meetings;\n- /uni25A0 proposes directors for appointment to the Shareholders' Meeting and/or coopts directors to the Board;\n- /uni25A0 reviews and endorses (arr\u00eate) the Company's and the Group's half-year and annual financial statements;\n- /uni25A0 presents a report on corporate governance to the Shareholders' Meeting;\n- /uni25A0 fulfills all the Board obligations set out in Solvency/uni00A0II;\n- /uni25A0 adopts and oversees the general principles of the Group's Remuneration policy;\n- /uni25A0 reviews the strategies and the policies on the taking, management and monitoring of risks as well as the conclusions of the internal assessment of risks and solvency (ORSA -/uni00A0Own Risk and Solvency Assessment -/uni00A0report);\n- /uni25A0 proposes Statutory Auditors for appointment to the Shareholders' Meeting and approves non-audit services.\n\nThe Chief Executive O/ff icer, who is also a Board member, is vested with the broadest powers to act in all circumstances on behalf of the Company and to represent the Company in its relationships with third parties. However, the Board of Directors also reserves the approval of certain material transactions to itself in its Terms of Reference, including disposals or acquisitions (over \u20ac500/uni00A0million), significant financing operations and any material transaction outside the strategy announced by the Company.\n\nTo ensure that the personal interests of the members of the Board of Directors and those of the Company are appropriately aligned, the Board's Terms of Reference provide that each member of the Board of Directors (with the exception of the directors representing the employees) must hold, within two/uni00A0years following his/her first appointment, a number of AXA shares with a value at least equal to the gross annual amount of his/her compensation (director's fees) earned in respect of the previous fiscal/uni00A0year/uni00A0 (1) .\n\n## CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nIn accordance with French law, the Chairman's role is to organize and oversee the work of the Board of Directors. In this context, he sets the agenda of the Board meetings, holds regular discussions with the Chief Executive O/ff icer and the directors, requests any document or information necessary to help the Board of Directors for the preparation of its meetings, verifies the quality of the information provided and more generally, ensures that Board members are in a position to fulfill their role. Prior to each meeting, Board members receive documentation concerning matters to be reviewed, generally eight days in advance of Board meetings.\n\nThe Chairman convenes the members of the Board without directors who are members of the Executive Management being present, in particular to allow debates on the performance and compensation of the Executive Management and succession planning.\n\nFollowing its decision to appoint Mr./uni00A0Denis Duverne as Chairman, the Board decided, in light of his experience and expertise and knowledge of the AXA Group, to extend the role of the Chairman as follows/uni00A0 (2) :\n\n- /uni25A0 promote the Company's values and culture in particular in relation to corporate responsibility and professional ethics;\n- /uni25A0 upon request by the Chief Executive O/ff icer, represent the Company in its relations, nationally and internationally with public bodies, institutions, regulators, shareholders and the Company's main strategic partners and stakeholders;\n- /uni25A0 consult with the Chief Executive O/ff icer on major topics and events relating to the Company (including the Company's strategy, major acquisition or divestment projects, significant financial transactions, major community projects and the appointment of the most senior executives of the Group);\n- /uni25A0 upon invitation of the Chief Executive O/ff icer, take part in internal meetings with Group executives and teams to provide his opinion on strategic issues or projects;\n- /uni25A0 assist and advise the Chief Executive O/ff icer.\n\nIn this context, in 2021, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, notably:\n\n- /uni25A0 represented the Company at various national and international events attended by certain of the Group's main partners and strategic stakeholders;\n- /uni25A0 had discussions with the main institutional shareholders of the Company, in particular prior to the Shareholders' Meeting; and\n- /uni25A0 at the request of the Chief Executive O/ff icer, participated in internal meetings in connection with significant events concerning the Company ( e.g. disposal and acquisition projects\u2026).\n\nI\n\nI",

He may also request the Chairman to convene the Board on a specific agenda.\n\nThe Senior Independent Director reports on his activities to the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nIn 2021, the Senior Independent Director, also acting as Chairman of the Compensation &/uni00A0Governance Committee:\n\n- /uni25A0 maintained regular dialogue with the Chairman of the Board and with the Executive Management ( i.e. the Chief Executive O/ff icer and the Deputy Chief Executive O/ff icers (Directeurs G\u00e9n\u00e9raux Adjoints) );\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## 3.1/uni00A0CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE\n\n- /uni25A0 was actively involved in the preparation of Board and Committees meetings, working closely with the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Executive Management;\n- /uni25A0 contributed to the selection process of the future members of the Board of Directors and its Committees;\n- /uni25A0 worked closely with the Chairman of the Board on the organization of the annual self-assessment of the Board;\n- /uni25A0 contributed to the review of all communications made to shareholders in particular on corporate governance topics and Executive Management compensation.\n\nHe reported on his activities at the Shareholders' Meeting of April/uni00A029, 2021.\n\n## BOARD ACTIVITIES IN 2021\n\nIn 2021, the Board of Directors met eleven times and held two executive sessions without the presence of the Executive Management.\n\nIn 2021, the Board notably focused on the review of the Group's strategy, the examination of the 2020/uni00A0financial statements and the 2021/uni00A0half-year financial statements, the capital management, the review of proposed significant disposals and acquisitions, the transformation of the Company into a licensed reinsurer in addition to its current activity as Group holding company, the review of the Board Committee reports, the review of the ORSA -/uni00A0Own Risk and Solvency Assessment -/uni00A0report and AXA's Internal Model as well as other written policies required under Solvency/uni00A0II, the Group's Pre-emptive Recovery Plan, internal control and r isk m anagement, the review of the Group's Corporate Responsibility strategy and environmental policy, the approval of non-audit services, the self-assessment of the Board of Directors, the reappointments, appointments and cooptation as well as the independence of its members, the review of the composition of the Board and its Committees and the succession plans for the Chairman of the Board and the Executive Management.\n\nIn March/uni00A02021, the Board of Directors held its annual strategy session with presentations by Group senior executives on a variety of key strategic topics related to the implementation of the Strategic Plan.\n\nIn 2021, three training sessions were also organized by the Chairman of the Board on r isk m anagement (internal model, ORSA report), on health activity and on cyber risk.\n\nTraining sessions were also organized for new members of the Board of Directors to familiarize them with the Group's main activities and issues.

The conclusions of this self-assessment are discussed annually at the Board of Directors.\n\nSince 2013, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation of its Compensation &/uni00A0Governance Committee, has periodically entrusted the annual assessment of the Board of Directors to an external consultant.\n\nIn 2019/uni00A0and in 2020, the Board self-assessment was conducted internally.\n\nIn 2021/uni00A0(as in 2018), the Board self-assessment was carried out by a consultant (SpencerStuart) who collected each of the individual director's inputs, views and suggestions on the Board work and its performance. Each director's view on other members' participation and contribution to the Board work was also collected.\n\nDuring its meetings of December/uni00A02021/uni00A0and February/uni00A02022, the Compensation &/uni00A0Governance Committee thoroughly reviewed/uni00A0(i) the conclusions of the Board self-assessment and (ii) the main areas of improvement and made recommendations to the Board of Directors which were examined and approved during the Board meeting of February/uni00A023, 2022.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe 2021/uni00A0self-assessment demonstrated that perception of directors on the overall functioning of the Board of Directors had remained very positive, both regarding its dynamics and its performance.\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors nevertheless identified the following areas for improvement:\n\n- /uni25A0 closely monitor/uni00A0 (i) the composition of the Board and progressively reduce its size and (ii)/uni00A0the selection of future Board members with the objective of appointing one director with insurance expertise and one/uni00A0director with digital transformation expertise;\n- /uni25A0 conduct a thorough review of the Committees' duties to reexamine their current structure and explore improvement options;\n- /uni25A0 add to the agenda of Board's meetings sessions dedicated to operational performance and competitor review;\n- /uni25A0 increase the exposure of the future Group's leaders to the Board through dedicated sessions or informal events and update annually the Board on key positions' succession;\n- /uni25A0 continue to further invest in building a Board cohesion through the organization of informal events.",

However, under French law, Board Committees do not have any formal decision-making power and are advisory only.\n\nThe Committees may request external consulting expertise if necessary. They may also invite external participants to attend their meetings.\n\nAll Committees are composed of members with expertise in the relevant areas, and their composition is regularly reviewed by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe role, organization and responsibilities of each Committee are set out in the Board's Terms of Reference and in the Audit Committee Terms of Reference available on AXA's website.\n\nI\n\nI",

In this context, its main objective is to encourage the achievement of ambitious objectives and the creation of long-term value by setting challenging performance criteria.\n\nAXA's executive compensation structure is based on an in-depth analysis of market practices in France and abroad, within the financial services sector (insurance companies, banks, asset managers,/uni00A0etc.) and of other international groups.\n\nAXA Group's overall policy on executive compensation focuses on the variable part of the compensation package, which is the compensation at risk for beneficiaries. The structure of AXA's executive compensation is composed of a variable portion which represents a significant part of the aggregate compensation. This is designed to align executive compensation more directly with the operational strategy of the Group and the interests of the shareholders while encouraging performance:\n\n- /uni25A0 both on an individual and collective level; and\n- /uni25A0 over the short, medium and long term.\n\n| Individual  Skills   | Individual  Skills   |                 |                   |\n|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n|                      |                      |                 | Deferred Variable |\n|                      |                      | Annual Variable | Annual Variable   |\n\nI\n\nI",

Their independence is assessed annually by the Board in accordance with the criteria set forth in the Afep-Medef Code. The Senior Independent Director is the Chairman of the Committee and presents the compensation policy of the Company each/uni00A0year at the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe Committee meets frequently with the Group Executives and the departments of the Company including Group H uman R esources and Group Legal. The Committee is empowered to undertake or commission specific reviews and to use external consulting expertise to the extent deemed appropriate. Thus, during the last few/uni00A0years, the Committee worked several times with a compensation-consulting firm in order to benefit from an external technical expertise and an independent overview in order to compare AXA's variable compensation practices with general market practices.\n\n## Solvency/uni00A0II Group remuneration policy\n\nSolvency/uni00A0II regulations came into force on January/uni00A01, 2016, and include a number of specific compensation and governance requirements applicable to European insurers and reinsurers. In this context, AXA has undertaken a comprehensive review of its existing compensation policies and practices against the requirements of Solvency/uni00A0II and has adopted a Remuneration Policy applicable to all AXA employees as of January/uni00A01, 2016. This Remuneration Policy is designed to support the Group's longterm business strategy and to align the interests of its employees with those of other stakeholders by/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0establishing a clear link between performance and remuneration over the short, medium and long term, (ii)/uni00A0ensuring that the Group can o/ff er competitive compensation arrangements across the multiple markets in which it operates while avoiding potential conflicts of interest that may lead to undue risk taking for short-term gain, and (iii)/uni00A0ensuring compliance with Solvency/uni00A0II regulations and any other applicable regulatory requirements.\n\nThe AXA Group Remuneration Policy is designed to:\n\n- /uni25A0 attract, develop and motivate critical skills and best talents;\n- /uni25A0 drive superior performance;\n- /uni25A0 align compensation levels with business performance;\n- /uni25A0 ensure that employees are not incentivized to take inappropriate and/or excessive risks and that they operate within AXA's overall risk framework; and\n- /uni25A0 ensure compliance of the Group's practices with all applicable regulatory requirements.\n- It follows four main guiding principles:\n- /uni25A0 competitiveness and market consistency of the remuneration practices;\n- /uni25A0 fairness based on individual and collective performance, in order to ensure remuneration is reflecting employee's individual quantitative and qualitative achievements and impact;\n- /uni25A0 internal equity based on remuneration policies and procedures designed to ensure that employees are paid equitably based on objective and justifiable professional criteria (such as but not limited to role, skills, contribution or impact), and do not discriminate on the basis of factors irrelevant to the role duties;\n- /uni25A0 achievement of the Group's overall financial and operational objectives over the short, medium and long term as well as execution against medium and long-term strategic objectives as a prerequisite to fund any mid-to-long term award.\n\nThe requirements set out in the Group Remuneration Policy may be supplemented in order to comply with local regulatory requirements or best practices. The Policy is reviewed and updated annually to mirror, as the case may be, changes in the internal organization and the nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent to AXA's business and to reflect exchanges with the French insurance regulator ( Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (ACPR)).\n\n## Remuneration structure\n\nAXA applies a pay-for-performance approach which/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0promotes long-term sustainable performance by incorporating risk adjustment mechanisms in variable compensation schemes, and (ii)/uni00A0recognizes employees who bring the greatest value to the firm on the basis of financial results while demonstrating individual leadership and behaviours. The intent of this approach is to attract and retain the best skills and talents, to foster employee engagement and to strengthen AXA's leadership.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3",

Fixed remuneration primarily reflects the relevant organizational responsibility, professional experience, technical and leadership skills required of the role, criticality or scarcity of skills, as well as the individual's capability to sustainably perform the duties of the role;\n- /uni25A0 a variable component which primarily reflects the business and individual performance, including performance in excess of that required to fulfil the role description. It comprises of an upfront cash element (annual cash bonus) and a deferred element recognizing the importance of aligning remuneration over long-term value creation. The deferred element is awarded through Performance Shares. This variable component depends on the Group's global performance, on the beneficiary's operating business performance, and on the achievement of the executive's individual objectives including demonstrated abilities for leadership. The variable portion is designed to represent a substantial component of the executive's global compensation and, where an executive attains or exceeds the set objectives, to position the compensation levels of AXA executives between the median and the third quartile (or, in certain cases, beyond the third quartile) of the market reference.\n\nThe target level of the executives' compensation and the structure of the elements which compose such compensation are based on a detailed analysis of market practices as well as potential applicable national and international regulations, and also take into consideration various other factors including the equity principles within the Group and the previous compensation level of the executive.\n\nEach/uni00A0year, AXA, with the assistance of specialized firms, conducts compensation reviews in order to ensure the competitiveness and consistency of executives' compensation and to measure the suitability of the Remuneration policies. In this context, three markets are used as a reference:\n\n- /uni25A0 a first market composed of 12/uni00A0companies in the French CAC40 index (companies selected to form the panel, which may vary from/uni00A0year-to-year, are comparable to AXA in terms of stock capitalization, revenues, sector, number of employees and/ or geographic coverage);\n- /uni25A0 a second market composed exclusively of international financial companies comparable in size and scope to the AXA Group (mainly insurance companies and banks) which are principally based in the main European markets (France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain and Switzerland);\n- /uni25A0 a third market composed exclusively of international financial companies comparable in size and scope to the AXA Group (mainly insurance companies and banks) which are principally based in the United States and Asia.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## Annual cash compensation\n\n## TOTAL TARGET COMPENSATION\n\n## Total target compensation of the Chief Executive O/ff icer\n\nThe Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation &/uni00A0Governance Committee, has decided to maintain unchanged in 2021/uni00A0the total annual cash compensation target of the Chief Executive O/ff icer, Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl, at \u20ac2,900,000.\n\nThis total target compensation is composed of a fixed annual compensation and a target annual variable compensation.\n\nThe fixed annual compensation of the Chief Executive O/ff icer amounts to \u20ac1,450,000/uni00A0and the variable component of his compensation is set at \u20ac1,450,000, i.e. 100% of his fixed annual compensation.\n\nThe total amount of compensation of the Chief Executive O/ff icer and the balance between its di/ff erent components (fixed and variable) are mainly based on a study by an external advisory firm (Willis Towers Watson) on compensation practices for similar positions within a sample of CAC40  companies as well as the main European companies in the financial sector (insurance companies, banks), and follows the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code, the G20, the European Commission and the Financial Stability Board in terms of compensation.\n\n## Total compensation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors, upon proposal of its Compensation &/uni00A0Governance Committee, has decided to maintain unchanged in 2021/uni00A0the fixed annual compensation of the Chairman of the Board, Mr./uni00A0Denis Duverne, at \u20ac1,200,000.\n\nThe Board of Directors upon recommendation from its Compensation &/uni00A0Governance Committee and pursuant to the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code considered that the compensation structure best suited for the Chairman of the Board of Directors was to limit his compensation to a sole fixed annual compensation.\n\nIn order to determine the Chairman of the Board of Directors' fixed annual compensation, the Board of Directions consulted an external advisory firm (Willis Towers Watson) regarding compensation practices for similar positions within a sample of CAC40  companies as well as the main European companies in the financial sector (insurance companies, banks).\n\nThe Board of Directors also took into account Mr./uni00A0Denis Duverne's expertise and experience as well as the extensive duties that it entrusted him with as Chairman of the Board of Directors as described in Section/uni00A03.1 of this Annual Report.\n\nFurthermore, Mr./uni00A0Denis Duverne, who claimed his rights to pension as of September/uni00A01, 2016, has decided to waive payment, for his entire term of o/ff ice as Chairman of the Board of Directors, of the annuities which he would have received as from September/uni00A01, 2016, under the complementary pension scheme for Group executive o/ff icers in France, amounting to circa \u20ac750,000/uni00A0per/uni00A0year.

This metric is measured based on/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0 underlying earnings per share, (ii)/uni00A0cash remittance, (iii)/uni00A0gross revenues in P&C Commercial lines, and in Protection, Health and Unit-Linked products, (iv)/uni00A0Net Promoter Score (customer recommendation index), and (v)/uni00A0non-commission expenses. The relative weight of each indicator is, respectively, 30%, 20%, 20%, 15% and 15%.\n\nThe selected indicators to measure the Group performance reflect objectives widely disclosed internally and externally with respect to growth, profitability, capital management, operational e/ff iciency and proximity with clients. Thus, these indicators, directly linked to the strategic orientations of the Group, are both financial and operating criteria and rely on the achievement of a predefined budget or target;\n\n- /uni25A0 I ndividual performance for 30%, which is evaluated based on objectives specifically related to strategic initiatives set and reviewed each/uni00A0year.\n\nThe individual performance of the Chief Executive O/ff icer is assessed on the basis of various indicators and qualitative and quantifiable objectives set by the Board of Directors through a written target letter drawn up at the beginning of each calendar/uni00A0year, as well as on the basis of demonstrated leadership abilities by the Chief Executive O/ff icer. This letter includes detailed objectives about the Group's progress in the elaboration of its strategic plan as well as other performance indicators and objectives designed to assess the level of achievement of global strategic initiatives and/or relating to certain geographic areas, and the evolution of certain investments contributing to the development of the Group's operations.\n\nIn order to evaluate Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl's individual performance in 2021, the Board of Directors assessed the achievement of the following objectives set in his target letter:\n\n- \u00b7 Managing the COVID-19 crisis and its aftermath at AXA XL and across the Group (achievement rate: 130%)\n\nWhile the COVID-19 crisis continues, the Group managed to successfully navigate through the crisis with/uni00A0(i) AXA XL delivering on its earnings target (despite a heavy natural catastrophe charge in 2021) thanks to an extensive re-\n\nI\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## 3.2/uni00A0EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND SHARE OWNERSHIP\n\nunderwriting of its portfolio and restructuring of its organization to drive greater P&L focus and accountability, (ii) a settlement o/ff er made to French restaurant owners to resolve contested business interruption claims and (iii) execution of a Group-wide project to clarify coverage terms on business interruption, cyber and other Commercial lines going forward.\n\n## \u00b7 Expanding Health and Protection (achievement rate: 95%)\n\nAXA launched innovative and di/ff erentiating healthcare initiatives in 2021, including the deployment of a digital healthcare platform in partnership with Microsoft (live in Italy, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) and the expansion of Emma, AXA's digital healthcare service orchestration platform in Asia, available to more than 3/uni00A0million customers.\n\nThe Group also made progress in implementing its strategic development priorities in health and protection, with the definition of an ambitious strategy for its international employee benefits business.\n\nThe Group's health strategy in China remains an area of focus in a challenging regulatory context.\n\n- \u00b7 Simplifying customer experience and developing cost optimization measures (achievement rate: 80%)\n\nAXA made good progress in simplifying and optimizing customer journeys, with a Net Promoter Score (NPS), above average in 97% of business lines. The Group has intensified its e/ff  orts with the deployment of common methodologies and pilot projects in key markets.\n\nEntities are delivering on e/ff iciency objectives, in line with the cost base reduction targets of \u20ac0.5bn in 2023/uni00A0 versus 2019.\n\nThe Group's cloud Program remains an area of focus and a new leadership team has been appointed at AXA Group Operations to ensure execution of this project going forward.\n\n- \u00b7 Growing cash flow across the Group (achievement rate: 130%)\n\nThe cash management strategy allowed to deliver above targets on all dimensions. The Group executed disposals of AXA Bank Belgium as well as its operations in Greece, the Gulf and P&C activities in India. It also signed transactions for the disposal of Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nAXA pursued its Life in-force management policy in 2021, including the conclusion of a significant reinsurance transaction in Hong Kong and proactive portfolio management across entities. At the same time, the Group has increased cash upstream, with \u20ac4.4/uni00A0billion in remittances.\n\nTaking into consideration the strength of its balance sheet and cash flow management, AXA successfully launched a \u20ac1.7/uni00A0billion share buy-back program in November/uni00A02021.\n\nI\n\n3",

Each of these two metrics is in any case capped at a 150% achievement rate.\n\nThe determination of the actual amount of variable compensation to be paid to the Chief Executive O/ff icer is based on the following additive formula: Variable compensation due = Target Variable compensation x (70% Group Performance +30% Individual Performance).\n\nSince 2020/uni00A0performance/uni00A0year, the weight of the Group Performance within the variable compensation assessment has increased to 70% leading to a decrease of the Individual Performance weight to 30%. With this evolution, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation &/uni00A0Governance Committee, wished to strengthen the formulaic/quantitative component of the Chief Executive O/ff icer's variable compensation, in line with market practices in France and abroad, as well as feedback received from a number of institutional investors. Similarly, in order to take into account the comments of some institutional investors, the level of transparency of each Group Performance indicator has been improved to henceforth indicate not only the target for each criterion but also the relevant floor and cap as well as the related level of payout.\n\nI",

In this context, the number of LTIs granted is set so that the executives are between the median and the 3 rd /uni00A0quartile of market references considering the global amount of the variable part (comprised of one part in cash and one part in LTIs). The Compensation &/uni00A0Governance Committee and the Board of Directors however ensure that the Performance Shares granted to the Group executives and valued in accordance with IFRS/uni00A0standards are not disproportionate compared to the aggregate compensation and shares granted to the executives concerned.\n\nThese Performance Shares are integrally subject to performance conditions (please refer to pages/uni00A0139 /uni00A0and following) and therefore do not guarantee any grant or minimal gain for the beneficiaries.\n\nThe Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation &/uni00A0Governance Committee, decided that Mr./uni00A0Denis Duverne, as Chairman of the Board of Directors shall not receive any Performance Shares or other long-term incentive during his term of o/ff ice.\n\n## SUMMARY OF COMPENSATION, OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES GRANTED/uni00A0TO/uni00A0MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE MEMBERS\n\n## MEMB ERS OF THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE\n\n|                                                               | Year 2020   | Year 2020                                               | Year 2020                                           | Year 2020                                                         | Year 2020                                                                         | Year 2021   | Year 2021                   | Year 2021                                                                       | Year 2021                                                         | Year 2021                                                                         | Year 2021         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| (in Euro)                                                     | Country     | Compen- sation  granted in  respect of  the/uni00A0year | Value of  options  granted  during  the/uni00A0year | Value of  perfor- mance  shares  granted  during  the/uni00A0year | Value of  interna- tional per- formance  shares  granted  during  the/uni00A0year | Total       | respect of  the/uni00A0year | Compen- sation  granted in  Value of  options  granted  during  the/uni00A0year | Value of  perfor- mance  shares  granted  during  the/uni00A0year | Value of  interna- tional per- formance  shares  granted  during  the/uni00A0year | Total (b)         |\n| Thomas  Buberl Chief Executive  O/ff icer                     | France      | 2,490,794/uni00A0 (a)                                   | -                                                   | 1,548,189                                                         | -                                                                                 | 4,038,983   | 3,176,645/uni00A0           | (a) -                                                                           | 1,938,986                                                         | -                                                                                 | 5,115,631/uni00A0 |\n| Total of the other  Management Committee  members/uni00A0 (c) |             | 18,161,419                                              | -                                                   | 3,677,688                                                         | 2,354,013                                                                         | 24,193,120  | 20,183,821                  | -                                                                               | 2,609,825                                                         | 4,174,232                                                                         | 26,967,877        |\n\nOn each date of grant, the fair value of stock options and Performance Shares is determined in accordance with IFRS/uni00A0standards.

Furthermore, the grant to AXA executive o/ff icers shall depend on the level of achievement of the strategic objectives previously defined by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Company, in line with market best practices, applies a regular and consistent formula to determine the number of shares to be granted each/uni00A0year to the beneficiaries.\n\nThe Board of Directors also decided that the total number of performance shares granted to the Company's executive o/ff icers each/uni00A0year may not exceed 10% of the aggregate number of shares subject to performance conditions (Performance Shares and Restricted Shares) granted during the same/uni00A0year, to avoid an excessive concentration of performance shares granted to the executive o/ff icers.\n\nSince 2020, the annual grant of shares subject to performance conditions occurs in March in order to simplify the structure of the senior executives' total variable remuneration, so that they are granted/uni00A0(i) a variable remuneration in the form of cash (annual bonus), and (ii) shares over  the same month.\n\n## RULES REGARDING SHARES SUBJECT TO PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS AND PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS\n\nEach beneficiary receives an initial preliminary allocation of shares subject to performance conditions (Performance Shares or Restricted Shares) which is then used as a reference to calculate the number of shares that will be definitely granted at the end of a 3-year performance period.\n\nDuring the performance period, all shares subject to performance conditions initially granted, are integrally subject to performance criteria regardless of the beneficiary's status.\n\n## Performance Shares SNFP\n\nFor Performance Shares granted in 2021, the Board of Directors has reviewed, upon recommendation from its Compensation &/uni00A0 Governance Committee, the nature and the weight of performance conditions as well as the level of corresponding targets,  allowing an alignment  with the new strategic orientations of the Group whilst  meeting with regulatory requirements, including a greater consideration of non-financial criteria.\n\nThe Group performance weights for 40% of the total performance while the operating business performance weights for 60%. For beneficiaries in Group functions (including AXA executive o/ff icers) as well as Heads of Control Functions, the considered operating business is the AXA Group.\n\nFor Performance Shares granted in 2021, the global performance rate is calculated based on the performance achievement on:\n\n- /uni25A0 one criterion linked to cash remittance by the operating business, weighting for 30%;\n- /uni25A0 one criterion linked to underlying earnings of the operating business (for beneficiaries in Group functions, the considered indicator is the underlying earnings per share), weighting for 30%;\n- /uni25A0 one relative criterion linked to Sustainability strategy based on the DJSI weighting for 10%. Accordingly, the average of the scores achieved by AXA according to the DJSI during the performance period will be compared to the average of the scores achieved by the other companies included in the DJSI over the same period. Consequently, under this indicator, 100% of the shares will be granted if AXA's score is equal to the 95 th /uni00A0percentile/uni00A0 (1) (compared to 85 th /uni00A0percentile beforehand);\n- /uni25A0 one criterion linked to Sustainability strategy based on the reduction in Group operations carbon emissions, weighting for 10%;\n- /uni25A0 one criterion linked to Sustainability strategy based on reduction in Group carbon footprint in Group's General Account assets, weighting for 10%;\n- /uni25A0 one relative criterion meant to compare the growth of the total return of the AXA share (TSR) with the growth of the TSR of the stock reference index of the insurance sector (SXIP index/uni00A0 (2) ) (the 'TSR criterion'), weighting for 10%.\n\nRegarding each afore mentioned criterion (except the TSR criterion for the members of the Management Committee), should the performance be:\n\n- /uni25A0 lower than 70% of the performance required to reach the target (the 'floor'), no share would be delivered to the beneficiaries at the end of the acquisition period; consequently, the beneficiaries are not guaranteed a minimal grant/gain;\n- /uni25A0 equal to 70% of the performance required to reach the target, the number of shares definitively granted would be equal to 50% of the number initially granted for the members of the Management Committee and 70% for all other beneficiaries;\n- /uni25A0 equal to 100% of the performance required to reach the target, the number of shares definitively granted would be equal to 100% of the number initially granted and for all beneficiaries;\n- /uni25A0 equal to or higher than 130% of the performance required to reach the target, the number of shares definitively granted would be equal to 130% of the number initially granted and for all beneficiaries.\n\nI\n\nI",

Thus, only in the event of achievement at a level of 100% of the performance conditions, the beneficiary will acquire definitively the number of Performance\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## 3.2/uni00A0EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND SHARE OWNERSHIP\n\nShares initially granted. For each criterion, between the di/ff erent level of performance (floor, target and cap), the number of shares definitely granted is calculated on a linear basis depending on the achieve performance.\n\nFor Performance Shares granted in 2021, the global performance rate is calculated as follows: 30% performance of the operating business (cash remittance) +30% performance of the operating business (underlying earnings) +10% Sustainability Strategy (DJSI) +10% Sustainability Strategy (operations carbon emission) +10% Sustainability Strategy (carbon footprint in assets) +10%

The Performance Shares granted to the Chief Executive O/ff icer will remain acquired at the end of a 3-year acquisition period, with the entirety of the acquired share restricted from sale during a 2-year holding period.\n\nThe amounts corresponding to International Performance Shares and International Restricted Shares are expensed each/uni00A0year under the variable accounting method. They do not create any dilution for shareholders since no new shares are issued. The payment is made in shares. Should this type of payment not be possible for legal, tax or any other reason, the payment could be made in cash.\n\n## Restricted Shares\n\nFrom 2022, the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of its Compensation and Governance Committee, may grant Restricted Shares to Group employees who are not senior managers. For Restricted Shares beneficiaries, the sole performance condition is the achievement of an average result of AXA's score in the DJSI index, calculated over the performance period, greater than or equal to the 75 th /uni00A0percentile. In the event of AXA's average\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## 3.2/uni00A0EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND SHARE OWNERSHIP\n\nscore, calculated over the performance period, equals to the 50 th /uni00A0percentile, only half of the shares initially granted would be acquired. Finally, in the event the AXA's average score, calculated over the performance period, is lower than the 50 th /uni00A0 percentile, no shares would be granted. Therefore, this scheme does not guarantee a minimum gain to the beneficiaries. Among the di/ff erent performance levels, the number of shares definitively granted is calculated on a linear basis depending on the achieved performance.\n\nFor Performance Shares and Restricted Shares, the achievement rate of the performance criterion (performance rate) is used to determine the number of AXA shares which will be definitively acquired by the beneficiaries at the end of the acquisition period, under the condition that the beneficiary is still employed by the AXA Group. The number of AXA shares definitively granted shall therefore be equal to the number of rights to AXA shares initially granted multiplied by the performance rate, which may not exceed 130% for the Performance Shares and 100% for the Restricted Shares. Furthermore, for the Performances Shares and Restricted Shares, in the event that no dividend would be proposed for payment (outside regulatory constraint) by the Board of Directors to the Company shareholders for any of the fiscal/uni00A0years of the performance period, the number of shares definitively acquired shall be automatically divided by two.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3",

This restriction applies from the date of grant until such time as the beneficiary receives the securities underlying the award upon, for example, the lapse of restrictions on shares subject to performance conditions or similar events. In accordance with the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code, the executive o/ff icers of the Company make a formal commitment to not resort to such hedging transactions.\n\n## PERFORMANCE SHARES/INTERNATIONAL PERFORMANCE SHARES ACQUIRED BY/uni00A0CORPORATE OFFICERS DURING 2021\n\n| Corporate  o/ff icers   |                                                                      | Plan date   | Nature of the  plan   | Number  of shares  granted   | Acquisition  date   | Shares  acquired  during  the/uni00A0year   | Performance  rate over the  acquisition  period   | Performance  rate over the  acquisition  period   | End of the  restriction  period   |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Thomas  Buberl          | Chief Executive O/ff icer                                            | 27/06/2018  | Performance  Shares   | 112,211                      | 27/06/2021          | 66,068                                      | 58.88%/uni00A0                                    | (a)                                               | 27/06/2023                        |\n| Denis  Duverne          | Chairman of the  Board of Directors                                  | -           | -                     | -                            | -                   | -                                           |                                                   | -                                                 |                                   |\n| Helen  Browne           | Representative  of employee  shareholders to the  Board of Directors | 27/06/2018  | Performance  Shares   | 13,983                       | 27/06/2021          | 13,099                                      | 93.68%/uni00A0                                    | (b)                                               | 27/06/2023                        |\n\nIn the table above all dates that are indicated are in the format of day/month/year.\n\nI\n\nI",

The purpose of these grants was to associate them with AXA's share price performance and encourage their performance over the long term. In 2019, a/f\\_t er having progressively reduced the number of stock options beneficiaries over the past few/uni00A0years, AXA's Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation &/uni00A0Governance Committee, in order to simplify AXA's compensation policy and in line with market practice and feedback received from a number of institutional investors, decided to cease awarding stock options to corporate o/ff icers and AXA employees.\n\nPrevious plans are still valid until their expiration (maximum duration period of 10/uni00A0years). They were granted at market value, with no discount, and become exercisable by tranches, generally in thirds between 3/uni00A0and 5/uni00A0years following the grant date.\n\nPursuant to the stock option plan rules, beneficiaries who resign from the Group lose the right to exercise their options.\n\nOn December/uni00A031, 2021, 180/uni00A0AXA employees held a total of 9,988,710/uni00A0outstanding options, representing 0.41% of the Company's share capital on the same date.\n\n## PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS\n\nAll options granted to all members of the Management Committee until 2018/uni00A0were subject to performance condition. This performance condition also applied to the last tranche of each option grant ( i.e. the last third of the options granted) for all other beneficiaries of options.\n\nPursuant to this performance condition, the options become fully exercisable only if the AXA share price performs at least as well as the stock reference index of the insurance sector/uni00A0 (1) . No option submitted to such performance condition can be exercised as long as this criterion has not been reached. This external performance condition subjects the acquisition of the right to exercise the options to the achievement of a fully objective and public performance and allows to measure the relative performance of AXA compared to its main European competitors over a period of at least three/uni00A0years.\n\nIf the performance condition has not been met at the expiry date of the options, these options are automatically cancelled.\n\nFurthermore, the Board of Directors decided that a second performance condition would apply to the all options granted in 2017/uni00A0and 2018, pursuant to which beneficiaries would not be able to exercise their stock options in the event the net income of the Group share is negative, and for as long as it remains.\n\nI\n\nI",

These shares shall be held during his entire term of o/ff ice as Chief Executive O/ff icer;\n- /uni25A0 for Performance Shares granted, the Chief Executive O/ff icer must, at every Performance Share acquisition date, hold in registered form at least 25% of the Performance Shares acquired during his entire term of o/ff ice as Chief Executive O/ff icer.\n\nThese restrictions do not apply if the Chief Executive O/ff icer complies with his Minimum Shareholding Requirement.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3",

However, Mr./uni00A0Denis Duverne decided to waive payment of the annuities amounting to circa \u20ac750,000/uni00A0per/uni00A0year before taxes and social security charges, until termination of his term of o/ff ice as Chairman of the Board without any retroactive payment.\n\nThis collective defined benefits pension scheme has been closed to any new beneficiary as of December/uni00A031, 2016. As a result, no executive employees (directeurs) or executive o/ff icer appointed a/f\\_t  er this date shall benefit from it.\n\nThe Directive 2014/50/UE/of the European Parliament and of the Council of April/uni00A016, 2014, provides that, as from January/uni00A01, 2020, future pension rights must be portable and consequently can no longer be acquired in the existing defined benefit pension scheme. The collective defined benefits pension scheme was amended in 2020/uni00A0in order to ensure compliance with European Directive.\n\nMr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl, AXA's Chief Executive O/ff icer does not benefit from the collective defined benefits pension scheme described above.\n\nThe Chief Executive O/ff icer of the Company. Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl, as well as all other employees of AXA Group entities in France, participate in a mandatory and collective supplementary pension scheme with defined contributions (collective insurance contract -/uni00A0 contrat d'assurance de Groupe as defined in Article/uni00A0L.141-1 of the French Insurance Code). This AXA pension fund was implemented in 2011/uni00A0and benefits to the employees of AXA Group entities in France falling within the scope of the Collective Agreement of December/uni00A018, 2009. The individual employer contribution rate is set at 0.75% of the total gross compensation, which is not capped (the contribution base is the same as the one used for contributions related to the Social Security General Scheme). Contributions are subject to 9.7% social charges (9.2% for CSG and 0.5% for CRDS).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## Retirement performance shares\n\nSince December/uni00A02016, AXA has implemented a retirement performance shares plan which benefits to all executive employees (directeurs) of AXA Group entities in France including for the Chief Executive O/ff icer, Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl.\n\nIt provides beneficiaries with portable pension benefits until retirement in line with Directive 2014/50/UE/of the European Parliament and of the Council of April/uni00A016, 2014,/uni00A0on minimum requirements for enhancing worker mobility between Member States by improving the acquisition and preservation of supplementary pension rights.\n\nThese performance shares are subject to/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0an acquisition period of three/uni00A0years, and (ii)/uni00A0an obligation to hold the shares until retirement, provided that the beneficiaries may sell all or part of their shares for diversification purposes (following the three-year acquisition period), as long as the sale proceeds are invested in a long-term savings plan until the beneficiary's retirement.\n\nThe definitive acquisition of these performance shares is subject to/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0the beneficiary's presence in the AXA Group on December/uni00A031 of the/uni00A0year during which the grant is decided, and (ii)/uni00A0the achievement of a performance condition related to the average AXA Group Solvency/uni00A0II ratio calculated during the performance period.\n\nFor all beneficiaries, to benefit from the totality of performance shares initially granted, the average AXA Group Solvency/uni00A0II ratio calculated during the performance period must be greater than or equal to 170%. However, if the average ratio is 150%, only half of the shares initially granted will be acquired. No shares will be acquired if the average ratio is below 150%. No minimum number of shares is guaranteed.\n\nBetween these performance levels, the number of shares definitely acquired is calculated, on a linear basis depending on the achieved performance.\n\nIn the event that no dividend would be proposed for payment (outside regulatory constraint) by the Board of Directors to the Company shareholders for any of the fiscal/uni00A0years of the performance period, the number of shares definitively acquired shall be automatically divided by two.\n\nThe Board of Directors also decided that no more than 10% of the total number of shares granted during any fiscal/uni00A0year should be granted to AXA's executive o/ff icers, to avoid an excessive concentration of retirement performance shares granted to the executive o/ff icers.\n\nOn December/uni00A014, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a grant of retirement performance shares. Accordingly, 627,864/uni00A0retirement performance shares were granted to 503 o/ff icers, which represent 0.026% of the outstanding share capital on the date of the grant, of which 14,276/uni00A0retirement performance shares were granted to AXA's Chief Executive O/ff icer representing 2.3% of the total grant.\n\nAll retirement performance shares granted are subject to the performance conditions described above and calculated over a three-year period beginning on January/uni00A01, 2021, and ending on December/uni00A031, 2023.",

In this context, the Board of Directors was concerned that the decision of Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl to renounce his employment contract in accordance with the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code would jeopardize the continuity of his accrued and future social benefits.\n\nAs a result, on August/uni00A02, 2016, the Board of Directors took the following decisions:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Board of Directors authorized that, following the termination of his employment contract, Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl would continue to have social benefits (Health insurance, Life insurance, Disability insurance,/uni00A0etc.) on terms equivalent to those of all other Group senior employees of the AXA Group in France;\n- /uni25A0 the Board of Directors authorized a contractual severance benefit for Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl designed to replicate the benefits to which he would have been entitled as AXA employee under the 1993/uni00A0collective agreement covering director-level employees of the insurance sector, but with the addition of performance conditions in accordance with the Afep-Medef recommendations. A severance benefit would be applicable, except in the case of gross or willful misconduct, solely in the event of dismissal or non-renewal further to the Board of Directors' decision. The payment of the severance benefit would be subject to the three following performance conditions as determined by the Board of Directors during its August/uni00A02, 2016, meeting:/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0achievement, for at least 2 of the 3/uni00A0preceding\n\nfiscal/uni00A0years, of the objectives set for the beneficiary's variable compensation and corresponding to the payment of at least 60% of his variable compensation target, (ii) evolution of the AXA share price at least equal to the stock reference index of the insurance sector (SXIP) (in percentage) over a 3-year period preceding the termination of the term of o/ff ice, and (iii)/uni00A0the average consolidated adjusted ROE over the 3/uni00A0preceding/uni00A0years higher than or equal to 5%.\n\nThe amount of severance benefit to be paid to the beneficiary would be adjusted in accordance with the level of achievement against these performance conditions: 100% of the severance benefit will be paid if at least two of the three performance conditions are met; 40% of the severance benefit will be paid if only one performance condition is met; and no severance benefit shall be paid if none of the performance conditions are met. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if only two of the three performance conditions are met, the amount of severance benefit will be reduced by 50% if performance condition/uni00A0(i) above is not met or if AXA's consolidated net income for the preceding fiscal/uni00A0year is negative.\n\nNo severance benefit will be paid if the beneficiary is entitled to a pension scheme within the 6/uni00A0months following his termination.\n\nThe initial amount of the severance benefit is equal to 12/uni00A0months of the average compensation (fixed and variable) paid during the 24-month period preceding termination. One month should then be added to the initial amount of the severance benefit for each additional/uni00A0year of future service up to a maximum cap of 24/uni00A0months.\n\nThese commitments were approved by AXA' Shareholders' Meeting of April/uni00A025, 2018. They took e/ff ect upon Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl's e/ff  ective renunciation of his employment contract on September/uni00A01, 2016/uni00A0and will continue as such for the duration of his mandate and under any potential renewed mandates.\n\nI\n\nI",

This Committee is also empowered to undertake or commission specific reviews by external experts when deemed appropriate. Such reviews allow the Committee to benefit from a technical expertise and independent insights in comparing AXA's compensation practices with general market practice.\n\n## COMPENSATION POLICY FOR THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\n## Guiding principles of axa's compensation policy\n\nAXA's compensation policy is designed to support the Company's long-term business strategy and to align the interests of its management with those of its shareholders and all other stakeholders by/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0establishing a close relation between performance and compensation over the short, medium and long term, (ii)/uni00A0ensuring that the Group can o/ff er competitive compensation that is consistent with the various markets in which it operates while avoiding potential conflicts of interests that may lead to undue risk/uni00A0taking for short-term gain, and (iii)/uni00A0ensuring compliance of the Company's practices with all applicable regulatory requirements.\n\nAXA's compensation policy aims to, among others:\n\n- /uni25A0 attract, develop and motivate unique skills and best talents;\n- /uni25A0 incentivize superior performance;\n- /uni25A0 align compensation levels with the Company's results.\n\n## Structure and criteria for determination of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Chief Executive O/ff icer's compensation\n\nIn this context, the compensation policy for the Chief Executive O/ff icer is based on a pay-for-performance approach which/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0requires the achievement of challenging financial and operational targets that are defined and aligned with the Group's strategy, (ii)/uni00A0promotes long-term sustainable performance while incorporating risk adjustment measures in performance metrics, and (iii)/uni00A0determines the e/ff  ective amount of the actual individual compensation on the basis of both financial and non-financial results.\n\nThus, the 'at-risk' portion of the Chief Executive O/ff icer's total compensation (variable cash compensation and share-based compensation) represents a significant component of his compensation structure, with a view to aligning his compensation more directly with the operational strategy of the Group and the interests of the shareholders.\n\nThe di/ff erent components of the Chief Executive O/ff icer's total compensation are presented in detail herea/f\\_t er:\n\n## FIXED ANNUAL COMPENSATION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER ( UNTIL APRIL/uni00A028, 2022)\n\nThe determination of the amount of the Chief Executive O/ff icer's fixed compensation is based on an in-depth analysis of market practices as well as applicable national and international regulations. It also takes into consideration various other factors such as experience, skills, as well as criticality and scarcity of such skills, and the Group's fairness principles or the individual's compensation history.\n\nThe Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation &/uni00A0Governance Committee, decided to maintain unchanged, until April/uni00A028, 2022, which is the date of the Shareholders' Meeting called to decide on the renewal of Thomas Buberl as director, the amount of the Chief Executive O/ff icer's fixed annual compensation, at \u20ac1.45/uni00A0million. This fixed annual compensation will be adjusted on a pro rata temporis basis.\n\nI\n\nI",

No minimum payment is guaranteed to the Chief Executive O/ff icer.\n\nIn order to determine the Chief Executive O/ff icer's target annual variable compensation, the Board of Directors sought to establish a balanced structure between the fixed part and the variable part of his cash compensation.\n\nThus, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation &/uni00A0Governance Committee decided to maintain unchanged, until April/uni00A028, 2022, which is the date of the Shareholders' Meeting called to decide on the renewal of Thomas Buberl as director, the Chief Executive O/ff icer's target annual variable compensation, at \u20ac1.45/uni00A0million, i.e. 100% of the amount of his annual fixed compensation. This variable annual compensation will be adjusted on a pro rata temporis basis.\n\nThe Chief Executive O/ff icer's total e/ff ective variable compensation will not exceed 130% (compared to 150% beforehand) of his variable compensation target, i.e. 130% of his annual fixed compensation.\n\nThe evaluation of the Chief Executive O/ff icer's individual performance with respect to the 2022/uni00A0fiscal/uni00A0year will be based on the following two components, each of them capped at a 130% achievement rate:\n\n- /uni25A0 T he Group's performance, evaluated on the basis of/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0underlying earnings per share, (ii)/uni00A0cash remittance, (iii)/uni00A0sustainability indicator (reduction in Group carbon footprint in General Account assets) and (iv)/uni00A0Net Promoter Score (customer recommendation index). The relative weight of each indicator will, respectively, be 45%, 25%, 15% and 15%. Each of the indicators will be capped at a 130% achievement rate;\n\nThe evolution of the choice and weight of the financial and extra-financial indicators of the Group performance is part of a global review of the measurement of this performance with the objectives of a greater simplification and a closer alignment with the Group's strategic orientations, while taking into account regulatory constraints, including a growing weight of extra-financial elements.\n\nThe financial and extra-financial indicators chosen to measure the Group performance are directly linked to the Group's strategic orientations. They reflect objectives for growth, capital management, sustainability and customer proximity. Some of these indicators (underlying earnings per share and cash remittance) are the same than the indicators related to the share-based compensation, underlining the intention  to align part of the performance criteria of the short and long term compensation with the objectives of the strategic plan and to measure them on di/ff erent time scales by submitting them to di/ff erent acquisition schedules.\n\n- /uni25A0 I ndividual performance, assessed on the basis of various indicators and qualitative and quantifiable objectives determined by the Board of Directors in a target letter drawn up at the beginning of the/uni00A0year, as well as on the basis of demonstrated leadership abilities by the Chief Executive O/ff icer. The target letter includes detailed objectives with regards to the Group's progress in the implementation of its strategic plan as well as other performance indicators and objectives designed to assess the level of achievement of global strategic initiatives or relating to certain geographic areas, as well as progress on investments that are expected to contribute to the development of the Group's operations ( e.g. execute strategic business priorities, design of post 'Driving Progress 2023' strategic plan, people leadership, personal development\u2026).\n\nEach of these two components will be evaluated separately so that the Chief Executive O/ff icer's overall variable pay-out reflects his performance against two distinct components assessed independently.\n\nWith respect to the 2022/uni00A0fiscal/uni00A0year, the determination of the actual amount of variable compensation to be paid to the Chief Executive O/ff icer will therefore be based on the addition of two components: the Group performance for 70% and the individual performance for 30%.\n\nIn order to ensure that AXA remains aligned with current market practice and regulations, both in France and abroad, within the financial industry, the Board of Directors has decided to continue to use a deferral mechanism with respect to the Chief Executive O/ff icer's annual variable compensation.\n\nUnder this mechanism, the payment of  30% of his annual e/ff ective variable compensation will be deferred over a 3-year period (compared to 2-year previously) paid out in 3/uni00A0tranches and will remain subject to performance condition. The deferred amount e/ff  ectively paid out will vary accordingly depending on the AXA share price performance over the deferral period, i.e. 3-year, within the limit of a cap at 130% of the deferred amount (compared to 120% previously) but without floor (compared to a 80% deferred amountfloor previously). Besides, no deferred variable compensation would be paid in the event/uni00A0(i) that the Group's underlying earnings are negative for the/uni00A0year ending immediately prior to the/uni00A0year of scheduled payout or (ii) of resignation or dismissal, for gross or willful misconduct prior to the payout date.\n\nShould a significant change a/ff ecting the calculation of the Group's economic parameters emerge (significant patrimonial transaction approved by the Board of Directors, change in accounting standards\u2026), the Board will be able to calculate the parameters mutatis mutandis , i.e. without taking into account extraordinary external elements.\n\nThe Board of Directors also reserves the right to exercise its discretionary power regarding the determination of the Chief Executive O/ff  icer's compensation pursuant to legal provisions and in accordance with Articles/uni00A0L.22-10-8/uni00A0and L.22-10-34 of the French Commercial Code, should any particular circumstance arise and justify an exceptional adjustment, either upwards (within the limit of 130% of the target variable compensation) or downwards, of one or several of the criteria composing the Chief Executive O/ff icer's compensation, to ensure that the application of the abovementioned criteria fairly reflect the Chief Executive O/ff icer's performance as well as that of the Group.\n\nI\n\nI",

However, the value of the performance shares granted to the Chief Executive O/ff icer as determined in accordance with the IFRS/uni00A0standards may not in any event exceed half of his total compensation.\n\nThe Board of Directors has also decided that the number of performance shares allocated to the Company's corporate o/ff icers may not exceed 10% of the total number of performance shares granted to all beneficiaries within the Group.\n\nThe performance shares granted to the Chief Executive O/ff icer are entirely subject to demanding internal and external performance conditions (the details of which are presented in Section/uni00A03.2 of this Annual Report), which are assessed over a period of three/uni00A0years (followed by a two-year holding period), and do not guarantee a minimum grant or gain. Moreover, the performance shares plan rules provide that in the event the Chief Executive O/ff icer leaves his position/uni00A0 (1) at any time before the end of the performance period, any performance shares initially granted are irremediably lost, unless otherwise decided by the Board of Directors in a motivated decision disclosed at the time of the o/ff icer's departure (in such case, all or part of the performance shares could be maintained and the vesting calendar and performance conditions of the performance shares set at the grant date would remain unchanged).\n\nGiven the principles presented above, the Board of Directors, upon proposal of its Compensation &/uni00A0Governance Committee  has decided that the total value of the performance shares to be granted to the Chief Executive O/ff icer during 2022, shall not exceed 150% of the amount of his annual variable compensation target.\n\n## EXCEPTIONAL COMPENSATION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\nThe Board of Directors does not contemplate granting any exceptional compensation to the Chief Executive O/ff icer.\n\n## CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S DIRECTORS' FEES\n\nThe Chief Executive O/ff icer, who also is a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, is not entitled to payment of any directors' fees from the Company.\n\n## BENEFITS IN KIND GRANTED TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\nThe only benefit in kind granted to the Chief Executive O/ff icer is the use of a company car.\n\n## ELEMENTS OF COMPENSATION RELATING TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S RETIREMENT\n\nThe Chief Executive O/ff icer does not participate in any pension schemes with defined benefits.\n\nAs all other executives of AXA Group entities in France, he participates in the retirement performance shares plan, under which grants are made on an annual basis.\n\nThe performance shares granted under such plan are subject to/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0an acquisition period of three/uni00A0years, and (ii)/uni00A0an undertaking not to sell the performance shares before the date on which the beneficiary retires, subject to the option o/ff ered to the beneficiaries, for diversification purposes, to sell their shares (a/f\\_t er the end of the acquisition period of three/uni00A0years) as long as the proceeds of such sale are invested in a long-term savings plan until the beneficiary retires.\n\nDefinitive acquisition of the performance shares is subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition (the details of which are set out in Section/uni00A03.2 of this Annual Report), linked to the average AXA Group Solvency/uni00A0II ratio calculated over the performance period. No minimum grant or gain is guaranteed to the Chief Executive O/ff icer under this scheme.\n\nThe Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation &/uni00A0Governance Committee, has decided that the total value of the retirement performance shares to be granted to the Chief Executive O/ff icer during 2022/uni00A0shall not exceed 15% of his annual fixed and cash variable compensation.\n\n## REGULATED COMMITMENTS MADE TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\nThe commitments made to the benefit of the Chief Executive O/ff icer regarding social benefits and unemployment benefits are presented in more detail in this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI",

In this regard, the Board of Directors considered numerous parameters, including:\n\n- /uni25A0 T he development of the Group's profile: The significant transformation of the Group's profile since the appointment of Mr./uni00A0Buberl (reduction of exposure to financial market volatility, refocusing on technical risks), notably following the acquisition and integration of the XL group in 2018, making AXA the global leader in the Commercial Property &/uni00A0Casualty sector and the associated increase in complexity as well as the increase in the responsibilities of the Chief Executive O/ff icer;\n- /uni25A0 O perational performance and value creation: The clear and ambitious strategy implemented by Mr./uni00A0Buberl has resulted in strong operational performance since 2016/uni00A0in a challenging economic environment:/uni00A0(i) return on equity increased from 12.9% in 2015/uni00A0to 14.7% in 2021, with a solvency ratio of 217% as of December/uni00A031, 2021, well above the target level of 190%, (ii) gross revenues grew 1.6% per/uni00A0year on average between 2015/uni00A0and 2021, (iii) AXA' underlying earnings per share and dividend per share went up respectively 4.3% and 5.8%/uni00A0 (1) per/uni00A0year over the same period and (iv) AXA share price increased by 49% between September/uni00A01, 2016/uni00A0and February/uni00A01, 2022;\n- /uni25A0 Mr./uni00A0Buberl's profile, experience and expertise: A European executive (having held executive positions in Germany, Switzerland and France), with abilities and accomplishments during his tenure as Group CEO recognized across Europe and beyond;\n- /uni25A0 A nalysis of the compensation practices of comparable companies: The study carried out by an independent external consultant (Willis Towers Watson) on compensation practices for similar positions within various CAC40  companies as well as AXA's main European and international competitors/uni00A0 (2) , revealed that Mr./uni00A0Buberl's current total target compensation is lower (by approximately 25%)/uni00A0 (3) than that of the c hief e xecutive o /ff icers of AXA's three main European competitors (Allianz, Generali and Zurich Insurance). This study also revealed that the annual target variable compensation and the share-based compensation of AXA's Chief Executive O/ff icer are/uni00A0(i) below the median of the CAC12/uni00A0companies, (ii) at the lower end of AXA's three main European competitors (Allianz, Generali and Zurich Insurance), and (iii) below the  bottom quartile of the main international companies in the insurance sector. It therefore highlighted the lack of competitiveness of Mr./uni00A0Buberl's current compensation compared to his main peers; and\n- /uni25A0 Feedback from institutional investors on pay structure: who have expressed a preference for a greater proportion of long-term, atrisk, shared-based components, as well as more extra-financial criteria (also in line with regulations).\n\n- (2) This study included:/uni00A0\n- -    a panel of the 12/uni00A0main European companies in the insurance sector (Generali, Zurich Insurance, Prudential Plc, Allianz, Swiss Re, Munich Re, Aviva, Swiss Life, Standard Life Aberdeen, Aegon, NN G roup, Mapfre) with a particular focus on the three main continental European companies (Allianz, Generali and Zurich Insurance),\n- -    a panel of the 7/uni00A0main international (non-European) companies in the insurance sector (Ameriprise Financial Inc., American International G roup Inc., Chubb Ltd, Metlife Inc., Prudential Financial Inc., Manulife Financial Corporation, AIA) that are also active in the markets in which AXA operates, and\n- -  the pr actices of 12/uni00A0CAC40  companies that are comparable to AXA in terms of market capitalization, revenues, sector, number of employees and/or geographic coverage (L'Or\u00e9al, Sanofi, LVMH, Air Liquide, Schneider Electric, TotalEnergies , Vinci, Airbus, Danone, BNP Paribas, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and Engie) -/uni00A0(CAC12)), were also studied.\n\nThe composition of these panels may change in order to account for changes in the structure or activity of the g roup or the companies that comprise it.\n\n- (3) The gap in relation to the current average total target compensation is 24%, including 16% for annual fixed compensation, 11% for annual target variable compensation and 35% for share-based compensation.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3",

Through this change, the Board of Directors sought to/uni00A0(i) give significant importance to share-based compensation, which will represent almost 50% of the Chief Executive O/ff icer's total compensation, and (ii) strengthen the at-risk portion of the Chief Executive O/ff icer's total compensation (variable cash-based compensation and share-based compensation) so that it represents the vast majority (approximately 75%) of his total compensation. The Board's objective is thus to align the Chief Executive O/ff icer's compensation more directly with the Group's longterm performance and the interests of shareholders.\n\nFinally, the Board  of Directors decided that, in accordance with the Company's past practice, this new compensation package should remain unchanged for the duration of the Chief Executive O/ff icer's next term as a director ( i.e. until April/uni00A02026/uni00A0 (6) ). The Board therefore paid particular attention to establishing a new compensation package that is balanced, aligned with the interests of shareholders and that can remain su/ff iciently competitive throughout this period.\n\nOther components of the Chief Executive O/ff icer's compensation described hereabove remain unchanged.\n\n## Appointment of a new Chief Executive O/ff icer a/f\\_t  er the Shareholders' Meeting to /uni00A0be/uni00A0held/uni00A0on/uni00A0April/uni00A028, 2022\n\nFor purposes of this policy only, and in accordance with applicable regulations, the Board of Directors has also considered the hypothetical appointment of a new Chief Executive O/ff icer following the Shareholders' Meeting to be held on April/uni00A028, 2022.\n\nUnder such circumstances, the compensation structure applicable to a new Chief Executive O/ff icer would comply with this policy and the Board of Directors would perform a comprehensive review of the situation of the relevant executive, provided that:\n\n- /uni25A0 the amount and criteria of his compensation would be determined in accordance with existing practices within the Company by reference to compensation practices for similar functions in a sample of CAC40  companies and in the main European companies in the financial sector; and\n- /uni25A0 the experience, skills and individual compensation history of the executive would also be taken into account.\n\n- (4) As from the Shareholders' Meeting of April/uni00A028, 2022. The first grant following the 2022/uni00A0Shareholders' Meeting is not expected to take place until March/uni00A02023.\n- (5) The proposed changes to the Chief Executive O/ff icer's compensation, in terms of structure and amount, will enable to:\n- -/uni00A0   position his fixed annual compensation/uni00A0(i) slightly below the average level of the fixed compensation of the executives of the three main European companies in the insurance sector (some of whose terms of o/ff ice will be renewed in 2022), (ii) above the median of the 12/uni00A0main European companies in the insurance sector, and (iii) in the high range of the main international companies in the insurance sector and the CAC12;\n- -/uni00A0/uni00A0      position his total target compensation/uni00A0(i) at the same level as that of the executives of the three main European companies in the insurance sector, (ii) in the high range of the 12/uni00A0main European companies in the insurance sector and of the CAC12, and (iii) below the bottom quartile of international insurance companies, and\n- -/uni00A0 /uni00A0     pay a significant portion of his total compensation in the form of shares and/or indexed to share performance compared to his peers in the European insurance sector and the CAC12.\n- (6) Corresponding to an annual increase of his fixed compensation of 1.3% over the 2016-2026/uni00A0period.\n\nI\n\nI",

Indeed, directors who hold directorships in subsidiaries may, where appropriate, provide the Board with useful insights and a precise and practical vision of the strategy, operational activities, processes and teams of the concerned subsidiaries, and more generally, of the Group's business and organization. Directors who also serve on the Boards of Group subsidiaries, however, are required to abstain from participating in the debates and decisions of the AXA Board which could a/ff ect the interests of the entity in which they hold a directorship to prevent any conflict of interest or potential independence issues.",

The assessment procedure has been implemented within AXA since that date.\n\nThis procedure, which is reviewed by the Board of Directors annually, provides for the Group Legal Department to be informed prior to the conclusion, amendment, renewal, extension or\n\ntermination of any agreement falling within the scope of Article L.225-38 of the French Commercial Code, regardless of the ordinary nature of the transaction or the arm's length basis of the agreement. This information enables the Group Legal Department to carry out a prior review of the agreement in order to determine whether it should be subject to the 'regulated' agreements procedure provided for under Articles L.225-38/uni00A0 et seq. of the French Commercial Code or whether it is exempt from such procedure. To this end, the Group Legal Department may seek the advice of the AXA Group's other relevant departments and of the Company's Statutory Auditors.\n\nIn addition, the Group Legal Department annually assesses whether ordinary agreements concluded at arm's length terms and conditions continue to meet the conditions for such qualification, in cooperation with AXA Group's relevant departments and the Company's Statutory Auditors where necessary. If the Group Legal Department considers that an agreement initially qualified as ordinary and concluded at arm's length terms and conditions constitutes a 'regulated' agreement, the Board of Directors decides on the qualification of the said agreement and on the actions to be taken on it according to the qualification adopted.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3",

It/uni00A0 includes an extra-financial performance statement that AXA publishes in accordance with the provisions of the EU Directive 2014/95/uni00A0related to extra-financial reporting/uni00A0 (1) and French law/uni00A0 (2) . This statement includes the AXA Group's business model and information on its main extra-financial risks ('sustainability risks') related to environmental, employer responsibility, society, human rights, tax evasion and corruption matters. For more information on the Group's risks exposure, please refer to Section/uni00A05.1/uni00A0'Risk factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\nFurther detailed information on the AXA Group's sustainabilityrelated policies and practices is also available in the 'Integrated Report', 'Climate/TCFD Report', in the online 'Group Human Capital Report'/uni00A0 (3) and on the AXA Group's website (www.axa. com), in the sustainability Section.\n\n## AXA's purpose entails sustainable value creation\n\nOur sustainability strategy is a key driver of employee engagement, customer trust and brand image. Sustainability is viewed as both a risk and opportunity for the management: it enables AXA to reduce certain operational costs and risks (social and environmental), while providing market opportunities in emerging business segments or driving innovation. Also, sustainability is an increasingly regulated area: in 2021, AXA notably began the implementation of the new European Union Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and Taxonomy regulation (refer to Section/uni00A04.3, paragraphs 'Climate, biodiversity and ESG-related 'outreach' and engagement' and 'EU Taxonomy Regulation' of this Annual Report).\n\nAXA is also committed to being a responsible employer, striving to keep employee engagement at the heart of its strategy, and as inspired by its values, to create a workplace that fosters diversity and equal opportunity for all, promotes engagement, encourages professional development, and supports employee well-being.\n\nSince 2020, our sustainability strategy has also been impacted by the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic crisis: remote work for almost all our employees, AXA's commitment to protect jobs, investments in scientific research, mobilization of sta/ff  to support medical frontline helpers, development of telemedicine services contributing to alleviate emergency medical services. AXA was also involved in supporting the economy and the subsequent green recovery with substantial investments.\n\nStimulated by the crisis to reaffirm its societal values, AXA formulated its purpose to encompass its role in the economy and commitments as a responsible company serving society. Through a collaborative process with external representatives from civil society and a large consultation and involvement from all employees, the proposed purpose was submitted to the Board of Directors of the Group and launched during the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, in June/uni00A02020.\n\nAXA's purpose 'Act for human progress by protecting what matters' entails sustainable value creation with the aim to protect the environment and society in an inclusive manner. The essence of its insurance profession -/uni00A0pooling risks -/uni00A0makes AXA a critical link in mutual support and social ties. The Group understanding of risks enables all its stakeholders to anticipate the future and become more resilient. AXA enables individuals and communities to move forward by protecting their basic needs: environmental protection, access to healthcare, prosperity, and quality of life. We strive to take decisions and commitments based on objective scientific data while looking at things in an inclusive manner.\n\nFor more information on AXA's business model, please refer to the Section 'Certain preliminary information about this Annual Report', sub-Section 'Sustainable value creation'.\n\nI\n\nI",

Considering both the level of maturity reached and anticipating the acceleration of ESG topics in all the Group's activities, the Management Committee has decided to dedicate a pillar of its strategy, entitled 'Sustain our Climate leadership position', aligned with our purpose -/uni00A0please refer to Section 'Certain preliminary information about this Annual Report', sub-Section 'Strategic orientations' of this Annual Report. This means that all lines of business are now concerned by this priority. AXA uses various levers related to its expertise and activities to achieve its objectives in this context: investment, insurance, its partnerships and its philanthropic activities, as well as its international footprint.\n\nThe framework of AXA Sustainability Strategy has been updated accordingly. It is now focused around 2/uni00A0priorities: climate change and inclusive protection. Thus, AXA Sustainability Strategy aims to fulfill two main goals: act as a leading force against climate change and expand our health and protection businesses as an inclusive insurer.\n\nTo make this new strategic cycle and our purpose concrete for all its stakeholders, AXA has implemented a set of indicators to measure and track its progress in every aspect of its activities: 'AXA for Progress Index'. Launched in April/uni00A02021/uni00A0during the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, this Index is a set of seven commitments, translated into targets and shared across the Group to further embed sustainable development in our activities: as an investor, as an insurer and as an exemplary company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSpecific working groups have been set up with key stakeholders at local entities and Group level to define the action plans to achieve our commitments for 2023/uni00A0and beyond as some issues require a more long-term view. AXA is currently setting objectives\n\nfor green insurance and Inclusive Protection products. The results of the seven commitments within the Index will be published on an annual basis.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

AXA's sustainable business strategy and initiatives are also presented at least once a/uni00A0year to the Company's social partners.\n\nDialogue with NGOs is also regular through meetings or responses to requests ( e.g. questionnaires).

The implemented approach is still based on collaborative work between Risk Management and Corporate Responsibility teams, as well as other involved departments/uni00A0 (1) . Risk factors for each area related to sustainability (employer responsibility, respect for human rights, environment, society impact and business behavior) are identified, based on sustainability risks studied in prior/uni00A0years and in the 2021/uni00A0Future Risks survey, which outlines major prospective emerging risks for\n\nThese risks are internally assessed by an expert panel. The assessment is conducted, using the Group Operational risks guidelines to rate potential frequency and severity. Impacts of each risk on stakeholders' interests and expectations have been considered. In the first instance, those risks are assessed by Risk experts, identified based on their knowledge of specific sustainability risks. Then, cross-sectoral experts assess the relevance of those ratings during the first stage. Those internal experts are identified based on their transversal knowledge of the non-financial risk universe.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nsociety at large (see Section/uni00A05.8, paragraph 'Emerging risks' of this Annual Report and www.axa.com/en/magazine/2021-futurerisks-report).

These sites are part of an extrapolation process. In 2021, environmental indicators were collected for 94,885/uni00A0FTEs working on AXA sites (unless otherwise indicated) and were then extrapolated, continent by continent, to cover all 114,749/uni00A0FTEs (all types of contracts -/uni00A0average annual personnel) working at AXA Group in 2021.\n\n## Scope of societal indicators\n\nOur  Community  Investment  Survey,  as  described  in Section/uni00A04.4/uni00A0'Inclusive Insurer' of this Annual Report, covers 99% of AXA's FTEs in 2021.\n\n## PERIOD\n\nThe indicators cover the period from January/uni00A01, to December/uni00A031,/uni00A02021, unless mentioned otherwise. To facilitate collection and processing, some data may be collected early in the/uni00A0year. The data for any remaining/uni00A0months (maximum 6/uni00A0months) is then estimated in accordance with the Group's defined methodology.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## DATA REPORTING\n\n## Social data reporting\n\nThe social data provided in Section/uni00A04.2/uni00A0'Employer responsibility' of this Annual Report are collected through a reporting process defined by procedures associated with a list of indicators shared with all entities of the AXA Group. This process is updated and communicated to each entity on a/uni00A0yearly basis. Social data are provided by local correspondents into an IT tool dedicated to the social data reporting process. Consistency checks and quality controls are carried out before and during the data collection process, as well as evaluations by a third-party body on some legal entities and overall process. A validation process of this reporting is also performed locally. There is no estimation or extrapolation made on data provided. Regarding data published in ratios and percentages, numerator and denominator are realigned for each calculation to exclude entities with empty data points.\n\n## Environmental data reporting\n\nEnvironmental data has been collected since 2002, through a dedicated reporting tool filled out by the network of more than 300/uni00A0environmental managers from AXA sites with more than 50/uni00A0FTEs and data centers owned by AXA. The reporting procedure includes guidelines for reporting and controlling, and calculation rules. AXA monitors its environmental footprint reduction towards its targets. The reporting procedure is updated annually, and contributors are trained each/uni00A0year. For each site, contributors specify whether the data has been measured or estimated based on the calculation rules defined in the Group's reporting procedures. In 2021, environmental data was collected for 83% of total FTEs, and the remaining 17% has been extrapolated. Reported data is validated locally by the entity CFOs.

With the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, AXA successfully transitioned to full remote working at scale for all employees. This was thanks to tried-and-tested experience, the previous/uni00A0years' investments in technology and the strong engagement of its teams. To build up a working culture that maximizes its potential and empowers AXA employees while improving their wellbeing, AXA adopted in January/uni00A02021/uni00A0a global Smart Working program combining remote and in-o/ff ice work across all entities.\n\nTeams in the AXA Group are empowered to define the best combination of remote and in-o/ff ice work that maximizes its team's productivity, creativity and individual wellbeing. Smart working allows all employees to work an average of two days per week from home.\n\nTo foster cultural change and execute AXA's vision to empower its people, a robust change management plan was put into place.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\nIn 2021, AXA designed and launched the AXA Managers Academy with the first module focused on developing leadership and rolemodelling in a new hybrid working culture. By helping managers adopt the cultural mindset shi/f\\_t  and embrace their role as internal influencers, the AXA Managers Academy was at its core designed to equip managers to be e/ff ective leaders throughout the transition. To date, over 4,500/uni00A0managers across 18/uni00A0entities have benefitted from this social and collaborative learning experience that will continue to be rolled out in 2022.\n\n## SMART WORKING: GLOBAL PROGRAM WITH CUSTOMISATION AT ENTITY AND/uni202FTEAM LEVEL\n\nAXA's Smart Working policy enables every AXA entity to customise the approach to its local market specificities while committing to the same basic principles. At team level, smart working is implemented through team agreements. Every team decides how to best balance remote and o/ff ice work, to ensure the customer and team's interests are met.\n\n## Accelerating AXA progress on inclusion and diversity\n\n## IMPLEMENTING THE AXA INCLUSION/uni202FSURVEY\n\nFurthering inclusion and diversity at AXA will always be a top priority. 2021/uni00A0marked a major step forward with the launch of AXA's first Inclusion Survey for all Group employees. As inclusion is at the heart of AXA's strategy, this has been set up to be a/uni00A0yearly survey to measure employees' perception of inclusion and diversity. On a voluntary and confidential basis, the survey gives employees the opportunity to identify with one or more of the AXA Inclusion &/uni00A0Diversity pillars: gender, age, origins, LGBT+, disability and mental\n\nwellbeing. Much care was taken to ensure that every question respects and reflects the nuances and cultural sensitivities of each country in which the survey was conducted.\n\nAXA is proud to report that the survey had a 56% response rate and that although all questions were optional, 97% of respondents answered every question. 86% of respondents said they feel included, and AXA global inclusion net promoter score (iNPS)/uni00A0 (1) reached 37. 16,000/uni00A0individual comments were also made. Supported by AXA's updated Inclusion &/uni00A0Diversity policy, the results of the survey provide the foundation for local and global action plans.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

To ensure every employee is paid equitably based on objective, justifiable and professional criteria and that no discrimination is made on factors irrelevant to one's professional duties, the Group Remuneration Policy and AXA Group Standards signed by every CEO have been accordingly amended.\n\nBack in 2019, AXA set 2023/uni00A0as the target/uni00A0year to close all pay gaps across all geographies. At the end of 2021, both women\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand men in AXA GLN are paid higher than the market, based on the benchmark data provided by Willis Tower Watson for each GLN role. Also, significant progress had been made in closing unjustified pay gaps for the rest of the AXA employee workforce. As part of AXA's commitment to removing all unjustified pay gaps, entities are annually monitoring and addressing the situation with dedicated budgets to reach full pay equity by 2023. All relevant processes (recruitment and promotions) are being reinforced to ensure further gaps are not created in the future.\n\n## I Championing employees' health and wellbeing\n\n## IMPLEMENTATION OF AXA 'HEALTHY YOU' PROGRAM WITH ADDITIONAL SERVICES\n\nIn November/uni00A02020, AXA launched a global 'Healthy You' program to improve employees' health and wellbeing. In 2021, this program was extended to include additional care and support services with the objective of fully implementing these by the end of 2023. AXA Group partnered with employee representatives to roll out the program and signed a Charter with its European Works Council.\n\nAcross AXA, the 'Healthy You' program provides a complete in-person medical check-up every four/uni00A0years for all employees aged 40/uni00A0and above and a digital check-up for all employees every two/uni00A0years. In September, the first global digital check-up campaign was launched and 33,000/uni00A0employees in 49/uni00A0countries participated. Global physical health risks have been identified and AXA is now working on an action plan to address these at Group and entity levels.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nTo promote prevention, every employee now benefits from on-site annual flu vaccinations and participation in 'Health days' organized to foster awareness and better prevent healthrelated risks. AXA also provides employees with access to medical teleconsultation services bringing doctors closer to patients. To further support employees a/ff ected by critical illness, going forward AXA will o/ff er a second medical opinion service to ensure employees receive the best treatment. In the event of cancer, AXA will provide financial support with a minimum coverage of 75% of medical expenses as well as a psychological assistance service across all geographies. Employees will also find all the information they need in one single place: from benefits and services to their entitlements in their country.",

To become the most inspiring and inclusive employer, increase employee advocacy, and attract top talent, it was essential to convey how AXA is there for its employees and to define what is special about working for AXA. While many organizations rushed to reimagine their employer branding post-COVID-19, AXA was already working on the new promise prior to the pandemic, in line with 'Driving Progress 2023'.\n\nThe promise, 'Realize your potential to drive progress', and its supporting pillars, 'Grow your potential', 'Shape the way you work', 'Thrive within a diverse community', and 'Move the world forward', sprung from internal and external focus groups talking about everyday life across AXA. Together, these helps bring together the wide range of initiatives and policies available to all employees and to provide a framework to propel the transformation of the employee experience across the organization.

The 'learning for all' ethos remains central to the AXA approach, where every employee has access to learning opportunities in a continuous and self-directed manner, thus empowering all to upskill at scale and speed. For example, LinkedIn Learning, which is available in seven languages with video modules on 16,000/uni00A0topics, has been available since 2020/uni00A0to all AXA employees. Over 56,000/uni00A0employees activated their account and over 42,000/uni00A0began at least one module in 2021. The adoption of LinkedIn Learning by AXA's entities resulted in an increase of 2.7% in the total number of training days from 2020/uni00A0to 2021, that is 335,268.7/uni00A0days in 2020/uni00A0 versus 344,195.3/uni00A0days in 2021. LinkedIn Learning enabling employees to continuously upskill is further enhanced with specific local on-site programs. On average, across the Group, an employee dedicates 3/uni00A0days a/uni00A0year to development and training.\n\n## TRAINING ALL AXA EMPLOYEES ON CLIMATE AND INTEGRATING ESG CRITERIA IN AXA COMPENSATION FRAMEWORKS\n\nAs part of its sustainability agenda, AXA has committed that all its employees will complete climate training by the end of 2022. As part of AXA Learning Week in October/uni00A02021, AXA launched the\n\nI\n\nI\n\nAXA Climate Academy, a learning program designed to heighten the awareness and understanding of the science behind climate change, why climate is a growing concern for companies and customers, the main types of climate change risks, and its impact all along the value chain for insurance and investments. It also focuses on how employees can contribute to reducing the Company's carbon footprint through professional and personal practices and behaviours. During the 2021/uni00A0AXA Learning Week over 11,400/uni00A0AXA employees joined remotely or in person the global live event 'Real Talk: How climate change has reshaped our insurance business' broadcast on LinkedIn. More than 14,400/uni00A0AXA employees were certified at the end of 2021, meaning that they completed all the learning path included in the Climate Academy training.\n\nAs part of its 'AXA for Progress Index' mentioned in Section/uni00A04.1/uni00A0'AXA's sustainability strategy' of this Annual Report and as announced, at the 2021/uni00A0General Meeting of Shareholders, AXA made some commitments. In addition to its carbon neutrality commitments, AXA has decided to integrate ESG criteria into compensation. By 2023, 30% of achievements will be linked to ESG criteria in all entities with a profit-sharing scheme. The criteria being recommended relates to carbon neutrality and climate change awareness and is quantified by the percentage of employees successfully completing ESG training. Entities are to define their own criteria in function of their profile and local priorities. In 2021, AXA France, GIE AXA, AXA Investment Managers and AXA Partners/uni00A0SAS incorporated criteria linked to climate training in their profit-sharing agreement. AXA France and AXA IM additionally included criteria for carbon emissions reduction.",

The three main risks falling within employer responsibility are monitored through key indicators and targets. 2021's results demonstrate the positive impact of HR's e/ff orts in mitigating these risks.\n\n## /uni25A0 Fostering a safe environment\n\nThis risk relates to potential breaches to employees' health and safety including workers' compensation and emerging risks a/ff  ecting employees. The risk is mitigated thanks to:\n\n- \u00b7 AXA's investment in the 'Healthy You' program and prevention policy. The sickness absenteeism rate is stable compared to 2020/uni00A0and lower than in 2019/uni00A0(from 3.3% in 2019/uni00A0and 2.8% in 2020/uni00A0to 3.0% in 2021),\n- \u00b7 the fact that AXA has in many entities doctors support with occupational health,\n- \u00b7 the significant increase in employee engagement over the/uni00A0years, reaching its highest eNPS score of 36/uni00A0in 2021,\n- \u00b7 AXA Pulse Survey allowing AXA to measure employees wellbeing and connection with dedicated questions,\n- \u00b7 the fact that AXA has open and constant social dialogue across entities on those topics.\n\n## /uni25A0 Strengthening inclusion and diversity\n\nRisk within this area is defined as di/ff iculties encountered in deploying AXA's anti-discrimination policy, especially with regard to gender diversity, equal pay, and the employment of people with disabilities. Mitigation is measured through:\n\n- \u00b7 objective setting to foster diversity: inclusion and diversity are top priorities for leaders as part of their annual objectives. AXA is committed to gender parity at GLN level by 2023,\n- \u00b7 AXA's Inclusion Survey: a/f\\_t er a successful pilot, this survey will be implemented annually to monitor employees' feedback and refine action plans at entity and Group levels,\n- \u00b7 a commitment to fair pay: across the organization, a significant progress has been made in closing unjustified pay gaps and at the end of 2021, both women and men in AXA GLN are paid higher than the market. As part of AXA's commitment to removing all unjustified pay gaps, entities annually monitor and address the situation with dedicated budgets to strive towards full pay equity across all geographies by 2023,\n- \u00b7 creating an environment free from harassment. In 2021, AXA took an important step by publishing an AXA Group Policy on Harassment. This policy, supported by AXA leaders and adopted across the Group's entities and geographies, provides a set of principles and behaviours that guide the Group and its employees in their everyday conduct.\n\n## /uni25A0 Supporting career development and employee mobility\n\nManagers and HR devoting time to recognize and nurture employee development and to motivate and retain talent while, in parallel, improving internal mobility across the Group.\n\nMitigation is measured through:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group's investment in learning represented more than \u20ac77.5/uni00A0million in 2021. This investment supports AXA's commitment to developing and training all its people at least once a/uni00A0year which has been achieved for the past 3/uni00A0years. On average, across the Group, an employee dedicates 3/uni00A0days a/uni00A0year to development and training,\n- \u00b7 AXA continues being attentive to career development and internal mobility across the Group. In 2021, internal mobility between and within entities stood at 8.3%, higher than in 2020,\n- \u00b7 internal mobility continues with an average tenure of employees between 10/uni00A0and 12/uni00A0years, the same rate as previous/uni00A0years, despite the pandemic.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

This Section covers all three dimensions and provides a broader view on the ESG integration process across the activities of the AXA Group.\n\nIn 2021, the impacts of AXA as an investor and as an insurer on climate change are identified as two of the main sustainability risks as described in Section/uni00A04.1/uni00A0'AXA Sustainability strategy/uni202F-/uni00A0Sustainability risk assessment'. AXA has developed several policies and defined indicators to track its progress in reducing negative impacts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\nAXA  follows  the  guidance  of  the  voluntary  disclosure recommendations of the 'Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures' (TCFD)/uni00A0 (1) , which focus exclusively on climate factors and the mandatory disclosure requirements set out in the French decree implementing Article/uni00A029 of Law No./uni00A02019-1147 of November/uni00A08, 2019 regarding Energy and Climate or any of its implementing measures, which focuses more broadly on ESG. This is why the text below extends beyond purely environmental factors. Furthermore, this text is an overview of AXA's more detailed annual 'Climate/TCFD Report'/uni00A0 (2) , to be published on www.axa. com in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## AXA's position on climate change and biodiversity\n\nInsurers are well positioned to mitigate climate-related risks. They have claims loss data, as well as models and tools to analyze and conduct forward-looking approaches. Their core business involves disseminating knowledge about new risks and creating adequate insurance products and investment policies. Finally, through their significant investments, they send the right signals to the investment community and to the specific companies they invest in.\n\nThe COP21/uni00A0Paris Agreement sets out a global framework to reach 'net-zero' carbon emissions by 2050/uni00A0in order to limit global warming to well below +2\u00b0C and pursue e/ff orts to limit it to +1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels during this century.\n\nAs part of the strategic plan 'Driving Progress 2023' (please refer to Section 'Certain preliminary information about this Annual Report', sub-Section 'Strategic orientations' of this Annual Report), AXA's climate strategy, which includes biodiversity as an extension of its climate e/ff orts, features the following developments:\n\n- /uni25A0 the development of a 'warming potential' concept for its investments, aligned with a +1.5\u00b0C trajectory by 2050. This long-term target is complemented, since December/uni00A02020, by an intermediate -20% investment-related carbon footprint target between 2019/uni00A0and 2025/uni00A0(part of the 'AXA for Progress Index');\n- /uni25A0 a green investment target of \u20ac24/uni00A0billion by 2023/uni00A0and increased in 2021/uni00A0to \u20ac26/uni00A0billion, to make use of new opportunities in this field (part of the 'AXA for Progress Index');\n\nI\n\nI",

To this end, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ)/uni00A0 (1) was launched in April/uni00A02021, ahead of COP26. This global coalition of leading financial institutions brings together 'net-zero' finance initiatives in the UN-backed 'Race to Zero' committed to accelerating the decarbonization of the economy. As of November/uni00A02021, GFANZ membership includes more than 450/uni00A0financial firms, including AXA, from 45/uni00A0countries, responsible for assets of over US$130/uni00A0trillion of private capital committed to transforming the economy for 'net-zero'/uni00A0 (2) .\n\nIn addition, AXA leverages its full expertise as an investor and as an insurer to accelerate the transition to a 'net-zero' global economy, as a founding member of the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA -/uni00A0please refer to Section 'Investments -/uni00A0Climaterelated portfolio alignment' below)/uni00A0 (3) , as Chair of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA -/uni00A0please refer to Section 'Insurance' below) since February/uni00A02021, and a signatory of the 'Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative' (NZAMI)/uni00A0 (4) .\n\n## Climate risk: the question of double materiality\n\nIt is now widely accepted within financial markets that the potential impacts of climate change on a company can be material and therefore require disclosure. Conversely, a company can have a material impact on climate change. This is the concept of double materiality. The impact of climate change on AXA and AXA's impact on climate change are identified as main sustainability risks in 2021/uni00A0as described in the Section/uni00A04.1/uni00A0'AXA Sustainability strategy/uni202F-/uni00A0Sustainability risk assessment' of this Annual Report.\n\nClimate change may have a negative impact on AXA's assets and investment activities as well as on AXA's liabilities and insurance activities. Assessing the risks related to climate change is a priority for AXA as part of its internal Risk Management framework. It supports and enriches AXA's overall understanding of climaterelated risks and enables the development of climate scenario analyses.\n\nIndeed, Risk Management frameworks require being adapted to climate risk specificities. Insofar as climate change risks arise over medium to very long-term periods, their trajectories and impacts\n\nare particularly uncertain. Moreover, changes in climate will generate structural changes with broad e/ff ects on the economic and financial activities that are not fully reflected in historical data. In this respect, scenario analysis and stress testing based on di/ff erent trajectories of future climate, macro-economic and financial conditions might be relevant tools to conduct forwardlooking assessment of potential vulnerabilities and opportunities related to climate change risks.\n\nWhile it still raises many challenges, the development of climate scenario analyses and stress testing has been accelerating, particularly through the 'pilot climate exercise' launched in June/uni00A02020/uni00A0by the ACPR/uni00A0 (5) . AXA has actively contributed to this exploratory exercise and sees the use of climate scenario analysis as an opportunity to further understand the long-term implications of climate change on its investment portfolios and insurance business. Through this cooperation with supervisory authorities and industry peers, AXA aims to improve the methodological framework to better address climate change risks.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

In particular, Property &/uni00A0Casualty (P&C) physical risks have been assessed through modular approaches (from simple to sophisticated modeling) allowing to encompass the three drivers of natural risks (changes in hazard, exposure, and vulnerability) and assess worldwide potential impacts ( i.e. evolution of Modelled Average Annual Losses (AAL) of forward-looking scenarios in a range of uncertainty (pessimistic versus optimistic views).\n\nBased on representative risks of the Group (flooding in Europe, hurricanes in the U.S.A., urban atmospheric pollution and vectorborne diseases in France, climate-related financial risks), the estimated impacts using ACPR and AXA's ORSA scenarios are relatively limited:\n\n- /uni25A0 investments: low impact of financial market scenarios given the low exposure to carbon-intensive sectors of AXA's portfolio (General Account assets) and considering the first results from the ACPR pilot stress tests;\n- /uni25A0 Property &/uni00A0Casualty (P&C) business: due to AXA's worldwide footprint of exposures creating a high natural diversification, evolution of AXA P&C natural catastrophes ('NatCat') claims remain mainly driven by changes in AXA's future underwriting strategy (demographical evolution, wealth growth) rather than the hazard increase by itself;\n- /uni25A0 Health &/uni00A0Protection: ACPR's climate pilot  exercise showed that the main impact stems notably from higher mortality due to the deterioration of air quality. Based on AXA's ORSA urban pollution scenario, the increase of death guarantees related claims between 2020/uni00A0and 2050/uni00A0are deemed very moderate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## Investments\n\n## DEFINITIONS AND GOVERNANCE\n\nAXA defines Responsible Investment (RI) as the integration of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations into investment processes, including ownership practices. AXA's objective is to align investments with AXA's Sustainability agenda of protecting people over the long term and creating stronger and more sustainable societies. This agenda is in line with its interests as a global insurer and investor.\n\nAXA's conviction is that ESG integration may impact long-term investment performance by o/ff ering an enhanced understanding of risk drivers. This conviction is derived from academic research and empirical market data. Within ESG, climate change deserves special attention. AXA actively pursues measures to manage climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nAXA has already started exploring the potential impacts of climate change on its investments by leveraging a model developed by Carbon Delta MSCI (applicable only to corporate assets, and not to sovereign debt) where risks and opportunities are combined and translated into a 'Climate Value-at-Risk' indicator ( nota bene: the term used in the 2020/uni00A0Annual Report was 'Cost of Climate' -/uni00A0please refer to AXA's annual 'Climate/TCFD Report' and to the Section 'Investments' below ).\n\nBeyond this approach, AXA seeks to prevent or mitigate its adverse impacts on climate change as an investor and as an insurer , namely by:\n\n- /uni25A0 applying its analytical framework to identify its potential impacts on climate and incorporating ESG (including those related to climate) into its business processes as well as into its investment strategy;\n- /uni25A0 committing to align its investments and underwriting activities with the COP21/uni00A0Paris Agreement, to limit the 'warming potential' of +1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels by 2050;\n- /uni25A0 implementing policies in its investments and underwriting activities for sectors that are particularly sensitive from an ESG perspective (including on climate);\n- /uni25A0 developing green investments and transition financing;\n- /uni25A0 offering customers insurance solutions that promote environmentally friendly behavior;\n- /uni25A0 developing active stewardship.\n\nThese policies and initiatives are described in the Sections 'Investments' and 'Insurance' below.\n\nAXA has developed a comprehensive RI strategy covering the Group's General Account assets, including its Unit-Linked investments, where relevant. The implementation of this strategy is overseen by a specific RI governance. AXA's Group-level Responsible Investment Committee (RIC) is chaired by the Group Chief Investment O/ff icer, and includes representatives from AXA's Asset Management entity, Sustainability, Risk Management and Communication teams. The RIC reports to the Group Investment Committee, chaired by the Group Chief Financial O/ff icer, and sensitive and/or strategic climate finance-related decisions debated in the RIC are ultimately approved by the RISSC (please refer to Section/uni00A04.1/uni00A0'AXA Sustainability Strategy -/uni00A0Sustainability governance &/uni00A0Stakeholder dialogue' of this Annual Report). AXA's RI policy is supported by the RI Center of Expertise, a transversal working group from AXA's local investment teams interacting with the Sustainability network.",

        "page_content": "## RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT STRATEGY\n\nAXA's Responsible Investment strategy is embodied in its Group Responsible Investment policy (published on the Group's website: www.axa.com/en/about-us/responsible-investment). The policy's six pillars are as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 ESG integration: AXA integrates ESG analysis into investment processes, using KPIs and qualitative research across most assets;\n- /uni25A0 climate-related investment portfolio alignment with COP21/uni00A0Paris Agreement objectives: Carbon metrics are integrated into investment decisions. AXA continues to develop metrics for measuring the climate-related impact of its investments, in particular the contribution of its investments to the objective of the COP21/uni00A0Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below +2\u00b0C;\n- /uni25A0 exclusions and sensitive ESG investments: sector-based restrictions apply to sectors or companies that face acute social, human rights, ethical or environmental challenges. These sector restrictions are published on AXA Group's website (www.axa.com/en/about-us/responsible-investment) and currently include: controversial weapons; coal mining and coal-based power generation; oil &/uni00A0gas; ecosystem conversion and deforestation; food commodity derivatives; and tobacco;\n- /uni25A0 a green investment target and transition financing: to increase the allocation of green assets across various asset classes and to support companies shi/f\\_t ing towards less carbonintensive business models;\n- /uni25A0 impact investing: investments that create intentional, positive, measurable, and sustainable impacts on society (both social and environmental issues) while simultaneously delivering financial market returns;\n- /uni25A0 active stewardship: through voting and engagement on a range of ESG or sustainability issues.\n\nThe AXA Group as well as its in-house Asset Management entity AXA Investment Managers and its multi-asset manager Architas are signatories of the UN-backed principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI).\n\n## ESG integration\n\nAXA integrates the analysis of ESG criteria (including those related to climate) into investment processes and steers the ESG performance of its investments. In 2021, AXA strengthened its ESG scoring methodology. Previously, AXA combined data from three providers. AXA has now adopted a single-provider ESG scoring model which is coupled with an overlay of AXA Investment\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## 4.3/uni00A0CLIMATE CHANGE AND ESG INTEGRATION\n\nManager's own analysis. Entitled Q/two.sups, this new enhanced qualitative and quantitative approach o/ff ers increased coverage as well as fine-tuned fundamental analysis. AXA's ESG framework provides scores per asset class, KPIs (such as the carbon footprint) and qualitative research across most of its assets. ESG integration is coordinated centrally, with active input from Asset Management teams (portfolio managers, fund managers and analysts) that include ESG metrics in their investment analysis across asset classes and regions. This includes ESG 'minimum standards' based on ESG scores and controversies to review and potentially exclude underperforming issuers from AXA's portfolios. This framework covers AXA's General Account assets (sovereign and corporate bonds, equity, real assets (direct property, infrastructure debt and equity, and commercial real estate loans)):\n\n- /uni25A0 for corporate issuers (equity and debt): the ESG assessment emphasizes impact and materiality. It draws on fundamental principles, such as the United Nations Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines, the International Labour Organisation conventions, and other international principles and conventions that guide companies' activities in the field of sustainable development and social responsibility;\n- /uni25A0 for sovereign issuers: AXA's ESG scoring uses public data sources such as the World Bank, the OECD, and the UN ( e.g. environment, social and political risks), and the criteria are adapted to the development levels of countries;\n- /uni25A0 for real assets (direct property, commercial real estate loans and infrastructure debt and equity): AXA's analysis framework is based on proprietary questionnaires covering criteria such as energy e/ff iciency, environmental certificates, and accessibility.\n\nIn addition, ESG considerations as well as the transparency of the issuers are integrated in the internal credit risk analysis.\n\nFinally, 'carbon footprinting', which is applied to AXA's equities, corporate fixed income and sovereign debt assets, complements the ESG metrics. See also further climate-related KPI development in the following section.\n\n## Climate-related inv estment portfolio alignment\n\nAs  described  in  the  Section/uni00A0 4.1/uni00A0 'AXA  Sustainability strategy/uni202F-/uni00A0Sustainability risk assessment' of this Annual Report, AXA has identified the impact of climate change on AXA's investments and the impact of AXA as an investor on climate change as two main sustainability risks. Climate change risks are usually understood to comprise these two main risk drivers/uni00A0 (1) /uni00A0 (2) impacting companies' valuation and profitability:\n\n- /uni25A0 'transition risks': transitioning to a lower-carbon economy may entail extensive policy, legal, technology, and market changes to address mitigation and adaptation requirements\n\n4",

Depending on the nature, speed, and focus of these changes, transition risks may pose varying levels of financial and reputational risk to organizations. The 'transition risk' can be measured in financial risk terms (in euros) or purely 'climate impact' terms (in temperature rise);\n\n- /uni25A0 'physical risks': resulting from climate change, those risks can be event-driven (acute) or longer term shi/f\\_t s (chronic) in climate patterns. Physical risks may have financial implications for organizations, such as direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption. Organizations' financial performance may also be a/ff ected by changes in water availability, sourcing, and quality; food security; and extreme temperature changes a/ff ecting organizations' premises, operations, supply chain, transport needs, and employee safety.\n\nTo manage these risks, AXA is progressively evolving its investment portfolios by integrating carbon metrics into its internal decisionmaking processes. While various metrics exist, such as the 'warming potential' and carbon footprint described below, more convergence is currently needed. AXA's contribution to supporting methodology convergence is developed in AXA's annual 'Climate/TCFD Report'.\n\n## CLIMATE VALUE-AT-RISK: CLIMATE RISK ON AXA'S CORPORATE CREDIT INVESTMENTS\n\nIn 2021, AXA leveraged a model developed by Carbon Delta MSCI for its corporate assets only, based on:\n\n- /uni25A0 'transition risks' (or 'regulation') risks: the low carbon transition, both via market and regulated evolutions, may significantly impact business models. This will likely create economic losses in the form of 'regulation costs' for those who fail to adequately adapt. 'Transition risks' for each company represent how much a reduction of their CO2/uni00A0emissions by 2030/uni00A0(the NDC/uni00A0 (1) horizon) will cost them, relying notably on their sector/activities and on the countries where they operate. It is expressed as a proportion of revenues negatively a/ff ected by this cost;\n- /uni25A0 'physical risks': for each company, the costs of potential future extreme weather events (five 'chronic' hazards -/uni00A0extreme heat, extreme cold, heavy precipitation, heavy snowfall, wind\n\ngust -/uni00A0and three 'acute' hazards -/uni00A0coastal flooding, fluvial flooding, tropical cyclones) by 2030/uni00A0 (2) is assessed ( via asset damages and business interruption), relying on their activities and location, and combined with expected vulnerability factors. This is also expressed as a proportion of revenues negatively a/ff  ected by this 'cost';\n\n- /uni25A0 'green revenues': for each company, the revenues future green technologies developments by 2030/uni00A0 (2) will generate for the Company are assessed, using company-level patent databases to estimate future revenue flows from green and low carbon technologies. While certainly not the only factor to be considered to estimate future 'green revenues', a statistically relevant correlation has been established between 'green patents' and 'green revenues'. This third KPI is expressed as a proportion of revenues that are 'green'.\n\nThe combination of the aforementioned items translates into a 'Climate Value-at-Risk' indicator/uni00A0 (3) . According to this methodology, the loss of turnover for companies AXA invests in, notably due to regulation costs and extreme weather events losses, represents an aggregated cost of 7.4% of AXA's market value investments at end of 2020, which can be described as a 'Climate Valueat-Risk'. These losses have increased since the previous/uni00A0year as the methodology, similarly to the 'warming potential', now includes Scope/uni00A03 emissions/uni00A0 (4) . Although currently AXA does not leverage this complex and evolving KPI in its day-to-day investment decisions, this metric provides insight on the possible climate-related financial risks that may be incurred by investors should its underlying assumptions suddenly occur (for additional information, please refer to AXA's annual 'Climate/TCFD Report' for more information).\n\n## 'PHYSICAL RISKS': CLIMATE IMPACTS ON AXA'S REAL ASSETS PORTFOLIO\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned 'Climate Value-at-risk' for its corporate credit investment portfolio, AXA has a significant amount of claims-related data to conduct a 'physical risks' analysis on its real estate portfolio. AXA's Investments and Group Risk Management teams collaborate to evaluate the financial impact of floods, windstorms and hail on buildings assets.\n\nI\n\nI",

        "page_content": "AXA's 'physical risks' assessment for real estate uses 'NatCat' models -/uni00A0generally only used to assess the impact of natural catastrophes on insured exposure -/uni00A0combining stochastic events (windstorms, floods, hail) and a geolocalized portfolio of real assets. Specific 'destruction rates', which factor location, building/ infrastructure type and construction materials are then used to determine potential damage rates and derive a loss for every building/infrastructure. According to in-house risk modelling, the financial impacts of climate-related 'physical risks' on these assets appears limited.\n\nMoreover, for corporate bonds and equities, the costs of 'physical risks' have been assessed by modelling the expected financial impacts of extreme weather events on companies' physical assets. The 'physical risks' cost estimates factor in vulnerability to business interruption risk and asset damage, based on the exposure of facility locations to extreme weather events.\n\n## 'WARMING POTENTIAL': IMPACT OF AXA'S INVESTMENTS ON CLIMATE\n\nIn 2021, AXA continued its investigation of the concept of an 'investment temperature' to develop its knowledge of the impact of AXA's investments on climate change (climate impact). This approach labelled 'warming potential' in Carbon Delta MSCI's methodology, captures the climate-related aspects of a company's activities, including its direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, technology developments, and 'green revenue' opportunities. This is derived from the carbon intensity alignment of each company relative to the sectoral carbon intensity target needed to reach the global climate target of the COP21/uni00A0Paris Agreement. This produces a 'warming potential'/uni00A0indicator per company and sector, and ultimately for AXA's investments.\n\nTCFD-related modelling shows that AXA's investments (corporates and sovereigns) had a +2.7\u00b0C 'warming potential' at the end of 2020/uni00A0 (1) . This is below the benchmark of +3.21\u00b0C but nonetheless shows that investors are operating in a carbon-intensive economy that is not aligned with the COP21/uni00A0Paris Agreement. A vast energy transition e/ff ort is required. All companies must evolve, and we believe it is incumbent on investors to identify and support relevant transition strategies.\n\n## CARBON FOOTPRINT\n\nSince 2016, AXA strives to translate international climate objectives derived from the COP21/uni00A0Paris Agreement into quantitative investment targets. These e/ff orts are reflected in its engagement within the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA).\n\nI\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## 4.3/uni00A0CLIMATE CHANGE AND ESG INTEGRATION\n\nSince 2019, AXA is part of the NZAOA, a coalition of institutional investors (insurers, pension funds,/uni00A0etc.), convened under the auspices of the UN Principles for Responsible Investment, and launched during the September/uni00A02019/uni00A0UN Climate Summit. Its members collectively commit to transition their investment portfolios to 'net-zero' greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with united investor action to align portfolios with a +1.5\u00b0C scenario.\n\nA carbon footprinting approach was chosen by NZAOA members as emissions reporting methodologies are currently considered more robust, and data availability is higher. As part of its participation in the NZAOA, AXA commits to publish intermediate targets every five/uni00A0years to track progress towards 'net-zero' by 2050.\n\nIn December/uni00A02020, AXA announced its 'intermediate target', a 20% reduction in the carbon footprint of AXA's General Account assets between 2019/uni00A0and 2025/uni00A0( e.g. aggregated 20% reduction across corporate debt &/uni00A0equity excl. emerging market issuers and entities; and real estate assets where possible), using the NZAOA 2025/uni00A0Target Setting Protocol. Per this protocol:\n\n- /uni25A0 carbon intensity has been identified as a useful tool for the decision-making process towards decarbonizing investment portfolios and for monitoring progress of carbon emissions;\n- /uni25A0 the Enterprise Value (EV) approach is recommended to companies invested in equity portfolios and corporate bonds, enabling allocation of emissions to the relevant parts of their balance sheet.\n\nThis explains why the carbon footprint target set by AXA is measured and tracked with a carbon intensity-based metric, expressed in t.eq.CO2/EV \u20acmillion (normalized per Enterprise Value). In 2021, AXA has worked on including financial issuers in data to be aligned with the scope defined by the NZAOA members. According to this reporting methodology, the carbon footprint of AXA's investment portfolio (General Account assets) decreased by 5.4% between 2019/uni00A0and 2020/uni00A0(coming down from 69.84/uni00A0tCO2/ EV \u20acm in 2019/uni00A0to 66.06/uni00A0tCO2/EV \u20acm in 2020).\n\nThis target is part of the 'AXA for Progress Index' and is presented in further detail in the annual 'Climate/TCFD Report'.\n\n## Exclusions and sensitive ESG investments\n\nCertain activities and products are deemed to be inconsistent with AXA's climate strategy and broader sustainability goals. In this context, AXA has developed over time specific 'sector guidelines' that seek to address those issues and entities are required to annually certify their compliance therewith. These guidelines are applicable to investments and underwriting activities (please refer to Section 'Insurance' below).\n\nI\n\n4",

The remaining exposure to applicable policies in AXA's portfolio amounted to less than \u20ac400/uni00A0million at the end of 2021. These figures will evolve with the entry into force in 2022 of the following policies: oil &/uni00A0gas (please refer to Section 'Climate-related exclusions: coal and oil &/uni00A0gas' below), ecosystem conversion and deforestation, Natural World Heritage Sites (applicable to underwriting activities only -/uni00A0please refer to Section 'Biodiversity' below).\n\n## CLIMATE-RELATED EXCLUSIONS: COAL AND OIL &/uni00A0GAS\n\nFrom the start, AXA adopted a balanced approach to contribute to the transition towards a more sustainable and less carbonintensive economy. Carbon emissions require significant curbing in order to reduce the risk of climate change, which may place business constraints on carbon-intensive industries, leaving some assets 'stranded', which in turn may lead to reduced valuations. Current valuation models may not account for such risks adequately.\n\n## Coal\n\nCoal is by far the most carbon-intensive form of energy and as such coal-based power generation is seen as the industry the most at risk in terms of such 'asset stranding'.\n\nAXA acted early in May/uni00A02015/uni00A0with a pioneering coal divestment, later strengthened in 2017/uni00A0with underwriting restrictions, and extended these to its new entity AXA XL in 2018. In November/uni00A02019, this approach was amplified and complemented with a long-term perspective/uni00A0 (1) .\n\nAXA bans investments, for General Accounts and in Unit-Linked assets in fully controlled mandates, in the following companies:\n\n- /uni25A0 power generation companies with coal share of power production (energy mix) over 30% and/or coal 'expansion plans' producing more than 300/uni00A0MW and/or over 10/uni00A0GW of coal-based power installed capacity;\n- /uni25A0 mining companies with coal share of revenues over 30% and/ or with annual coal production over 20/uni00A0million tons and/or developing new coal mines;\n- /uni25A0 certain coal industry partners, defined as manufacturers ( e.g. equipment suppliers) and infrastructure players ( e.g. port terminals, dedicated railways) developing significant new coal assets.\n\nIn addition, AXA is committed to a long-term 'exit' strategy reducing exposure to the thermal coal industry to zero by 2030/uni00A0in the European Union and OECD countries, and by 2040/uni00A0in the rest of the world, as suggested by the main climate scenarios (such as the IEA 'Beyond +2\u00b0C' scenario). This approach is applied both to its investments and underwriting activities (please refer to Section 'Insurance' below).\n\nThe database used since 2017/uni00A0is the 'Global Coal Exit List' (GCEL)/uni00A0 (2) .\n\n## Oil &/uni00A0gas\n\nSince 2017, AXA has divested from oil sands-related businesses (defined as companies deriving more than 20% of their revenue from oil sands, including pipeline operators).\n\nIn 2021, AXA revised its Oil and Gas policy/uni00A0 (3) driven by two principles:\n\n- /uni25A0 AXA believes it is critical to accelerate the transition of the energy sector towards a more sustainable model, consistent with 'net-zero' trajectories. This transition can only happen by enabling Oil and Gas companies to implement ambitious transition plans. AXA's role, as a financial and underwriting player, is to focus its support to the Oil and Gas companies with the most far-reaching and credible transition plans;\n\nI\n\nI",

        "page_content": "- /uni25A0 despite significant differences between investment and underwriting when it comes to decarbonizing its activities, AXA will continue to strive for progressive alignments between its decisions as an asset owner and as an underwriter.\n\nAs an asset owner, AXA has stopped investing in new upstream oil greenfield exploration projects unless they are carried out by companies with the most far-reaching and credible transition plans. AXA excludes all new direct investments in listed equities and corporate bonds in developed markets in Oil and Gas companies operating in upstream and/or oilfield services and/ or downstream subsectors, as well as midstream players. AXA selects integrated Oil and Gas companies for investments based on a restrictive selection process. Less than 5% of the approximately 650/uni00A0companies identified in the 'Global Oil and Gas Exit List' by NGO Urgewald/uni00A0 (1) meet AXA's criteria.\n\nFurthermore,  AXA  reduces  its  investment  exposure  to unconventional exploration and production, as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 Arctic: AXA extends the scope of its  investment restrictions to the Arctic Region (in alignment with the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP)). Only companies with Norwegian operations in the AMAP Region will be maintained, given their high environmental standards and lower operational carbon footprint. AXA will exclude new direct investments in companies deriving more than 10% of their production from the AMAP Region or producing more than 5% of the worldwide volume of AMAP-based Oil &/uni00A0Gas;\n- /uni25A0 oil sands: on top of the existing restrictions in place, AXA will adopt a more stringent policy by ceasing direct investments in companies producing more than 5% of the worldwide volume of oil sands;\n- /uni25A0 fracking/shale Oil and Gas: AXA will no longer directly invest in companies deriving more than 30% of their production from fracking/shale Oil and Gas;\n\nThe main database used is the 'Global Oil &/uni00A0Gas Exit List' (GOGEL)/uni00A0 (2) released in 2021.\n\n## A green investment target and/uni00A0transition/uni00A0financing\n\n## GREEN INVESTMENTS\n\nAXA strives to support the transition to a low-carbon economy by supporting companies shi/f\\_t ing towards less carbon-intensive business models and by increasing the allocation of 'green' assets across various asset classes. To support its green investment strategy, AXA has developed an internal framework to define 'green' investments based on external labels, certifications and environmental standards as appropriate. Green investments are defined as: green bonds, infrastructure debt &/uni00A0equity, impact investments, real estate, and commercial real estate loans. AXA's green investment strategy is further developed in AXA's annual 'Climate/TCFD Report'. In addition to 'temperature' targets and divestments, green investments encourage various sectors to strengthen their climate strategy.\n\nIn November/uni00A02019, AXA committed to invest \u20ac24/uni00A0billion in green investments by 2023. In 2021, this target was increased to \u20ac26/uni00A0billion following a \u20ac1/uni00A0billion Green Bond issuance by AXA/uni00A0SA/uni00A0 (3) in April and a \u20ac1/uni00A0billion commitment to intensify its investments in green and low-carbon energies/uni00A0 (4) in October. In December/uni00A02021, AXA's green investments reached \u20ac22.6/uni00A0billion (\u20ac16.1/uni00A0billion end of 2020).\n\n## TRANSITION BONDS\n\nGreen or climate bonds are a recent but successful instrument designed to support projects with climate or environmental added value. However, it is also important to support carbonintensive players that are actively decarbonizing but have not yet reached the 'greenness' that makes these e/ff orts eligible to green bonds. This is why, since 2019, AXA Investment Managers (AXA IM) has worked to develop the concept of 'transition bonds'. In November/uni00A02019, AXA announced the launch of a first \u20ac100/uni00A0million 'transition bond' in partnership with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB/uni00A0 (5) . In 2020, AXA announced a second transition bond of \u20ac100/uni00A0million in partnership with BPCE/uni00A0 (6) . The proceeds will be used to finance Natixis' assets, being project and/or corporate loans from sectors with high emissions reduction potential as well as their contribution to a low carbon economy. The details of this project are available online. Throughout 2020, AXA IM acted as co-chair of the Climate Transition Finance Working Group of the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) which published the Climate Transition Finance Handbook, the first global e/ff ort to frame the concept of transition finance.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

AXA's impact investing strategy is designed to align with this traditional definition of impact investing. This approach is aligned with the Operating Principles for Impact Management sponsored by the International Finance Corporation. AXA IM is a founding signatory to these Principles and a Member of the Advisory Board. Since 2013, AXA has committed \u20ac922/uni00A0million to impact investing, with the value of the invested amount standing at \u20ac418/uni00A0million at September/uni00A030, 2021. In 2021, AXA approved a new 'Natural capital' target (please refer to Section 'Biodiversity' below). AXA also launched a new Fund dedicated to Health and Inclusion (please refer to Section/uni00A04.4/uni00A0'Inclusive insurer').\n\n## Active stewardship\n\nAs a shareholder and bondholder, AXA has the possibility to engage with the management of companies in which it invests in order to help catalyze positive change on certain issues (such as climate change, health, governance, market practices,/uni00A0etc.). These engagement activities are carried out either directly by the Group or by AXA Investment Managers (AXA IM) on behalf of the AXA Group and third-party clients. Climate change is one of the most material themes for which AXA conducts engagement. AXA's key climate engagement objectives and indicators are detailed in AXA's annual 'Climate/TCFD Report'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## Insurance\n\n## GOVERNANCE\n\nInsurance-related ESG risks and opportunities also benefit from a specific governance, notably the Group Underwriting Committee (GUC), which defines underwriting restrictions. Similarly to investments, sensitive and/or strategic climaterelated decisions debated in the GUC are ultimately approved by the RISSC (please refer to Section/uni00A04.1, 'AXA Sustainability strategy -/uni00A0Sustainability governance &/uni00A0Stakeholder dialogue' of this Annual Report). In addition, a dedicated team within Group Risk Management analyzes Emerging Risks which o/f\\_t en relate to long term ESG issues, and monitor their potential impact (please refer to Section/uni00A05.8/uni00A0'Other material risks -/uni00A0Emerging risks' of this Annual Report). The Group Emerging Risk Committee issues recommendations to adapt its business o/ff er and underwriting policies.\n\nAXA is a signatory of the UN-backed principles for Sustainable Insurance (UN PSI).\n\nOn behalf of the Group, AXA IM holds constructive and challenging discussions directly with investee companies, and as part of a coalition of investors, engaging with companies in key sectors. In the specific case of coal, AXA notably encourages the transition through active shareholder engagement, as an investor, and client communication, as an insurer, with the concerned companies in order to encourage them to develop and disclose an exit or closure plan.\n\nIn 2021, AXA IM reinforced its stewardship policy with a focus on climate laggards/uni00A0 (1) . From 2022, AXA IM will engage with a selection of companies which do not have n et-z  ero commitments, or have quantified emissions reduction targets deemed to be not credible or demanding enough. This more forceful engagement policy, with a 'three strikes and you're out' principle, aims at applying su/ff icient pressure to e/ff ect timely change, and is applied on behalf of third party clients. Clear objectives are defined for each of those companies, tailored to their activities, and communicated to their management. AXA IM will regularly engage with those companies to steer them to achieve progress on those objectives, using escalation techniques when necessary ( e.g. voting against management). If the objectives have not been achieved a/f\\_t er three/uni00A0years, AXA IM will divest.\n\nVoting at General Meetings is performed in favor of environmental, climate-related, social and governance issues including sustainability disclosures.\n\nFor more information, please refer to AXA IM's annual Active Ownership and Stewardship report/uni00A0 (2) .\n\n## CLIMATE-RELATED INSURANCE PORTFOLIO/uni202FALIGNMENT\n\nIn December/uni00A02020, for the fi/f\\_t h anniversary of the COP21/uni00A0Paris Agreement, AXA called for a significant new development in its underwriting business. AXA actively supports coalitions that bring collective solutions to issues that require industry-wide cooperation. This is why AXA publicly supported the creation of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA) to collectively extend its investment commitment to 'net-zero' to its insurance business.\n\nChaired by AXA since February/uni00A02021, the NZIA revealed its commitments at the G20/uni00A0in July/uni00A02021, with the main commitment to transition insurance and reinsurance underwriting portfolios to 'net-zero' greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Since its launch, the NZIA has been building on the work that the eight founding members have already begun as investors through their membership to the NZAOA (Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance -/uni00A0please refer to Section 'Investments -/uni00A0Climate-related portfolio\n\nI\n\nI",

The NZIA launched a working group in September/uni00A02021/uni00A0in collaboration with the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) to develop the first global standard to measure and disclose insured emissions. This is a true challenge as the methodologies and metrics are less developed in the insurance space than for investments. The upcoming months will serve to build the target-setting protocol by January/uni00A02023/uni00A0so that AXA can test various metrics to set its intermediate target, towards the end goal of transitioning its underwriting portfolio to be 'net-zero' by 2050. By the end of 2021, the A lliance has grown to 13/uni00A0members.\n\n## UNDERWRITING RESTRICTIONS\n\nBeyond commitments in coalitions, AXA strives to incorporate ESG criteria (including those related to climate) in its underwriting activities, in consistency with its investment strategy. Over time, AXA has developed specific 'sector guidelines' that entities are required to annually certify their compliance therewith. These guidelines are applicable to investments and underwriting activities (please refer to Section 'Investments' above). A business referral process is in place to monitor the implementation of these guidelines. The details of these policies are published on AXA Group's website.\n\nSince 2017, the underwriting restrictions ban Property and Construction covers for: coal mines, coal plants, oil sands extraction sites and related transportation (pipelines) and drilling in the Arctic Region/uni00A0 (1) . In November/uni00A02019, AXA had already strengthened these restrictions by adding the coal-related restrictions at client-level, mirroring divestment criteria (please refer to Section 'Climaterelated exclusions: coal and oil &/uni00A0gas' above).\n\nIn 2021, AXA revised its Oil &/uni00A0Gas policy/uni00A0 (2) . AXA will cease underwriting new upstream oil greenfield exploration projects unless they are carried out by companies with the most farreaching and credible transition plans. AXA's selection of these companies with credible transition plans will be finalized by the end of 2022. Once completed, the cessation of new contracts of new upstream oil greenfield exploration projects will come into force with a 12-month grace period ending on January/uni00A01, 2024.\n\nIn addition, AXA will significantly reduce its insurance exposure to unconventional exploration and production from its business from 2022, as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 Arctic: AXA extends the scope of its Arctic underwriting restrictions beyond the polar circle and the 70\u00b0N zone in alignment with the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme  (AMAP). Only  Norwegian operations in the AMAP\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## 4.3/uni00A0CLIMATE CHANGE AND ESG INTEGRATION\n\nRegion will be maintained, given their high environmental standards and lower operational carbon footprint. AXA will strengthen the thresholds applicable to insurance activities in this particularly fragile region, excluding new underwriting coverage for Oil and Gas extraction activities carried out in the AMAP Region by companies deriving more than 10% of their production from the AMAP Region or producing more than 5% of the worldwide volume of AMAP-based Oil &/uni00A0Gas. Exemptions may be granted if the projects are carried out by Oil and Gas companies with the most far-reaching and credible transition plans;\n\n- /uni25A0 oil sands: on top of the existing restrictions in place, AXA will adopt a more stringent policy by extending current restrictions to all lines of business for underwriting activities;\n- /uni25A0 fracking/shale Oil and Gas: AXA will no longer provide any insurance coverage to activities of companies, deriving more than 30% of their production from fracking/shale Oil and Gas.\n\nThe main database used is the 'Global Oil &/uni00A0Gas Exit List' (GOGEL)/uni00A0 (3) released in 2021.\n\n## GREEN PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS\n\nIn addition to the underwriting restrictions described above, the Group seeks to minimize its impact on climate change by o/ff  ering insurance solutions that promote environmentally friendly behavior:\n\n- /uni25A0 AXA XL underwriters have significant expertise and capacity for insuring clients in the energy industry, with a strong focus on renewable energy;\n- /uni25A0 some local entities also develop motor and car fleet insurance policies encouraging low CO2/uni00A0emission vehicles, Home insurance policies encouraging energy e/ff iciency, renewable power installations, and environmentally friendly claims strategies. For instance, in case of a car accident, AXA France promotes the use of second-hand parts instead of new ones, and AXA Switzerland encourages repairing damaged parts ('microrepair') rather than replacing them with new ones;\n- /uni25A0 AXA Climate o/ff ers parametric insurance products which, for example, accompany the recovery of agricultural crops a/f\\_t er climate-related natural disasters (notably drought or flooding) and can help improve the capacity of the insured to become more resilient. Please refer to Section/uni00A04.4/uni00A0'Inclusive insurer' of this Annual Report, and to AXA's annual 'Climate/TCFD Report'.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

This framework will be complemented by the definition of a 'green premiums' target (applicable to its Commercial lines, SMEs and Retail P&C business) to measure progress, as well as promote product innovation. It is expected to be launched in Q2/uni00A02022.\n\nIn 2020, AXA's entities have generated \u20ac1.1/uni00A0billion of revenues on Green Business o/ff ers.\n\nAlso refer to Sections 'Biodiversity' on innovative 'nature-based solutions' and 4.4/uni00A0'Inclusive insurer' of this Annual Report, to complement the view on ESG insurance products, and AXA's annual 'Climate/TCFD Report'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## Biodiversit y\n\nLimiting the loss of ecosystems is a priority to maintain economic stability and to mitigate climate change. Biodiversity loss endangers 'ecosystem services', which threatens both society and businesses that depend on them, and in turn investors and insurers that rely on a well-functioning economy. Addressing biodiversity-related risks and opportunities is a natural extension of AXA's climate e/ff orts. Indeed, climate change also severely compounds the destruction of ecosystems around the world, adding pressures related to drought, ocean acidification, and more intense natural catastrophes. As a result, the main identified nature-related risk is the impact of AXA's activities on biodiversity.\n\nImpacts on biodiversity can adversely a/ff ect the integrity of a geographic area, either directly or indirectly, by substantially changing its ecological features, structures, and functions across its whole area, and over the long term, so that habitat, its population levels, and the particular species part of the habitat cannot be sustained/uni00A0 (4) . Biodiversity has been identified as a main ESG risk in 2021/uni00A0as explained in the Section/uni00A04.1/uni00A0'AXA sustainability strategy/uni202F-/uni00A0Sustainability risk assessment' of this Annual Report.\n\n## SFDR: CLIMATE AND ESG INTEGRATION IN/uni202FSAVINGS\n\nSince March/uni00A02021/uni00A0and the entry into force of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)/uni00A0 (1) , the European in-scope companies of the Group ( e.g. life insurance companies, insurance intermediaries, asset managers) must publish on their websites and in product precontractual client documentation, information on how they take into account Sustainability Risks/uni00A0 (2) and Principal Adverse Impacts/uni00A0 (3) in their investment decision-making processes and/or their investment advisory processes.\n\nIn this context, AXA provides end clients with information on AXA's green investments and carbon emission reduction targets.\n\nAll in all, hundreds of savings, retirement and protection products have been impacted by the SFDR. For example, AXA France Vie has reinforced the transparency of its approach to Sustainability Risks for over 50/uni00A0financial products.\n\nThe entity and product disclosures will be supplemented with the implementation of the Delegated Regulations of the SFDR and of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nIn 2021, AXA has made significant progress in reducing exposure to nature-negative activities, and driving nature-positive solutions, to mitigate the frequency and severity of its impacts on biodiversity. AXA's sustainability strategy currently includes the following developments.\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION -/uni00A0UNDERSTANDING AXA'S IMPACT ON BIODIVERSITY\n\nWhile biodiversity loss and its main drivers are well documented, the quantification of business impacts on biodiversity is still a quite new field, and the risks incurred by companies are to be precisely defined./uni00A0This is why AXA is working with peers to accelerate the quantification of risks and impacts related to biodiversity.\n\nFollowing the release of the AXA-WWF 'Into the Wild' report, during the G7/uni00A0in 2019, the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial\n\nI\n\nI",

This provider has developed its own metric -/uni00A0the Corporate Biodiversity Footprint (CBF) -/uni00A0based on the concept of MSA (Mean Species Abundance), to calculate the degradation of ecosystems caused by business activities across AXA's investment portfolio. Iceberg Datalab is delivering data on a sectoral basis. In 2021, coverage included all high- and mediumstake sectors, with agri-food, electricity, oil &/uni00A0gas, real estate, and mining &/uni00A0metals. This will allow AXA to identify the most biodiversityintensive activities and issuers within a sector or within a universe. In March/uni00A02021, the Article/uni00A029 of the French Law on Energy and Climate extended reporting requirements to biodiversity. For more information, please refer to the annual 'Climate/TCFD Report'.\n\n## GROUP POLICIES &/uni00A0INITIATIVES/uni202F-/uni00A0REDUCING AXA'S IMPACT/uni202FON/uni202FBIODIVERSITY\n\nAXA did not wait for a precise quantification of its impact on biodiversity to start reducing it.  The Group released a series of initiatives, aimed at protecting ecosystems, investing in natural capital and impact funds, focusing on forests and oceans, the two main carbon sinks.\n\n## A new Forest policy in 2021\n\nIn October/uni00A02021, AXA announced a new policy on Ecosystem protection, Deforestation and Natural World Heritage Sites. It seeks to address risks related to deforestation and protected areas of key biodiversity value, and to halt support for firms negatively impacting ecosystems that house critical biodiversity. Curbing deforestation conserves water resources, prevents flooding, controls soil erosion, and preserves habitats, in addition to preserving key carbon sinks. In 2013, AXA had divested from 'unsustainable' Palm Oil producers and banned illegal logging from its underwriting.  AXA's new policy builds on previous work to address other levers of deforestation, resulting in a more comprehensive approach/uni00A0 (2) .\n\nOn the investment side, as an asset owner, AXA bans companies in three cases:\n\n- /uni25A0 palm oil producers who have not achieved 'sustainable palm oil' production certifications and/or have significant unresolved land rights conflicts/uni00A0 (3) and/or conducting illegal logging (predates the policy released in October/uni00A02021/uni00A0and remains in place);\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## 4.3/uni00A0CLIMATE CHANGE AND ESG INTEGRATION\n\n- /uni25A0 companies in any sector facing 'high' and 'severe' controversies related to Land use and biodiversity/uni00A0 (4) ;\n- /uni25A0 companies producing palm oil, soy, cattle and timber that face 'significant' Land use and biodiversity controversies and that have a 'critical' impact on deforestation/uni00A0 (5) .\n\nAXA will engage, as a shareholder, individually where needed, and via coalitions wherever possible, with a selection of companies of the following type: palm oil, soy, cattle, and timber producers; traders and buyers of those commodities; and other companies on an ad hoc basis. A particular attention will be paid regarding controversies, production, and procurement practices.\n\nOn insurance underwriting, AXA focuses more on the activities at risk of causing deforestation. AXA restricts Commercial Lines Property and Construction Insurance Underwriting in four cases:\n\n- /uni25A0 illegal logging (pre-dates the policy released in October/uni00A02021/uni00A0and remains in place);\n- /uni25A0 companies that are excluded by the investment policy screening are to be referred to the Group Risk Management and the critical activity will likely be banned from Construction and Property covers;\n- /uni25A0 businesses that operate in 'high-risk countries'/uni00A0 (6) and commodities (palm oil, beef, soy, timber) and facing high or severe deforestation controversies/uni00A0 (7) are also to be referred to the Group Risk Management with a view to restrict the critical activity;\n- /uni25A0 traders of soy, beef, palm oil and timber operating in 'high-risk countries' and facing high or severe deforestation controversies are also to be referred to the Group Risk Management and the critical activity will likely be banned from marine cargo covers.\n\nIn line with the UNPSI-UNESCO classification, AXA also commits to protect World Heritage Sites by ensuring it does not support, through Property and Construction insurance underwriting, businesses in sensitive sectors that are developing activities incompatible with ecosystem preservation in these vital sites.\n\nAXA reinforced its Energy policy (please refer to Sections 'Investment' and 'Insurance'), released in October/uni00A02021, by aligning its climate and biodiversity ambitions. Unconventional oil is a large driver of ecosystem degradation. Oil sands extraction can present heightened spill risk, excessive water use, polluted wastewater, and deforestation. Exposure to the Arctic Region can degrade critical ecosystems, and fracking requires extensive use of water, and chemicals, which can contaminate groundwater and a/ff  ect the health of residents and ecosystems. In order to reduce the biodiversity impact of investments in and underwriting of energy activities, AXA will align its definition of the Arctic Region with the Arctic Monitoring & Assessment Programme (AMAP) , based on the respect of critical ecosystems.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

This figure is broken down into two di/ff erent approaches: \u20ac1/uni00A0billion to support forestry management projects in developed markets and \u20ac500/uni00A0million to support natured-based solutions through initiatives such as a/ff orestation, restoration and avoided deforestation, largely in emerging markets, where the outcome of the initiative can o/f\\_t en be measured through the production of carbon credits.\n\nTo better select projects for internal and external clients to o/ff set CO2/uni00A0emissions, AXA Investment Managers acquired ClimateSeed, an innovative marketplace connecting businesses seeking carbon credits with project developers o/ff ering carbon o/ff setting projects. ClimateSeed's portfolio includes 36/uni00A0projects in 24/uni00A0countries totaling an aggregated capacity of over four/uni00A0million verified carbon credits.\n\n## An AXA XL program to protect Oceans\n\nAnother way of conserving biodiversity is to mitigate risk of loss through innovative insurance mechanisms. With a particular focus on aquatic and coastal ecosystems -/uni00A0also essential reservoirs of biodiversity -/uni00A0in 2021, AXA XL launched its Coastal Risk Index, an innovative tool that maps current and future flood hazard\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\nresulting from climate change and integrates for the first time the protective benefits of coastal ecosystems into insurance risk models. Alongside this announcement, AXA XL also put in place additional safeguards to support the detection of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing by requiring International Maritime Organization (IMO) numbers for all fishing vessels and refrigerated cargo vessels that it insures and adding further explicit checks on IUU fishing to its Marine Underwriting Rules and Guidelines. Through AXA Climate, AXA XL is already providing risk capacity for coral protection against tropical cyclones at four sites along the Mesoamerican reef in Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras./uni00A0Research is underway to expand this solution to mangroves and identify new sites to protect.\n\nThe AXA Research Fund reiterated its investment of \u20ac1/uni00A0million for research into coastal livelihoods with the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO as part of the UN Decade for Ocean Science and Sustainable Development. The Fund is also partnering with the IPBES, to support the production of two reports over two/uni00A0years: The Nexus Assessment, which examines the links between biodiversity, climate and food, and the Transformative Change Assessment, which investigates the profound causes of biodiversity loss.\n\n## Climate, biodiversity and ESG-related 'outreach' and/uni00A0engagement\n\nIn addition to the GFANZ, NZIA and NZAOA described previously, AXA supports various initiatives related to climate, biodiversity and ESG. These include the following:\n\n- /uni25A0 TCFD: AXA co-presided the global industry-led Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) upon its launch in December/uni00A02015. The TCFD was set up by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and chaired by Michael Bloomberg and Mark Carney (former Governor of the Bank of England, now UN Special Envoy for Climate Action). The TCFD provides guidance on how to disclose climate change risk and opportunities. In 2019, the FSB approved AXA's renewed membership of the TCFD, notably with an ambition to investigate the relevance of 'investment temperature' metrics;\n- /uni25A0 TNFD: the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) was o/ff icially launched in June/uni00A02021/uni00A0 (1) . AXA is one of 34/uni00A0members, comprising both financial institutions and corporates, that will develop an industry standard for identifying and mitigating impacts, dependencies, and risks related to nature. A beta framework is set for release in March/uni00A02022, a/f\\_t er which will take place a testing and improvement phase until mid-2023, in consultation with key knowledge partners. AXA is more specifically contributing to the landscape analysis of standards and metrics, to identify the best existing approaches.

It is supported by the United Nations and the World Bank, gathering members from the public sector, multilateral organizations, NGOs and civil society.\n\nIn 2021, the IDF undertook many new initiatives, with the cooperation of AXA and many other industry teams and organizations. Notably for the Tripartite Agreement signed in 2019 with the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), for which an IDF project team is designing an insurance program for up to 50,000 public schools in Peru. Another project being funded by the Tripartite Agreement is in Mexico, designing a program that will enable insurance protection for the most vulnerable small holder farmers. Other similar projects are being developed for the Colombian city of Medellin, Ghana and Nigeria.

This paves the way for the establishment of the IDF's Global Risk Modelling Alliance, a public-private technical assistance program, which will provide more and better access to the risk data and analytics that is crucial to building resilience in these countries. BMZ has committed \u20ac11 million to finance this critical work. Also in November 2021, in Glasgow, the Global Resilience Index Initiative (GRII) was launched: it is a multi-partner IDF initiative for reference data on climate and natural hazard risks to inform and mobilise investment, needed to meet the Paris goals on climate resilience, across all sectors and geographies;\n\nThe Group has also signed a three-year partnership with the WWF France. Please refer to the 'Biodiversity' paragraph above.\n\nAXA supports many Investor and Insurance-led coalitions over the/uni00A0years in the fields of ESG, RI and CR: UN PRI, UN PSI (notably supporting its 'Pilot project' to adapt the TCFD guidelines to the insurance business), UN Global Compact, CDP, ORSE, EpE, Finance for Tomorrow.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy introduces the concepts of eligibility and alignment:\n\n- /uni25A0 An economic activity is said to be eligible if it is identified in the delegated acts as having a high potential to contribute to at least one of the environmental objectives, irrespective of whether the activity meets the technical criteria set out in those delegated acts;\n- /uni25A0 The second of these concepts is alignment, which confirms the significant contribution of this eligible economic activity to at least one of the environmental objectives on the basis of technical criteria specified through a delegated regulation.\n\nArticle/uni00A08.1 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation applies from January/uni00A01, 2022, with respect to the environmental objectives set forth in Articles/uni00A09/uni00A0(a) and/uni00A0(b) of the Taxonomy Regulation ( i.e. ,/uni00A0(i) climate change mitigation and (ii) climate change adaptation).\n\nThe reporting obligations under the other four environmental objectives set out in Articles/uni00A09(c) to/uni00A0(f) ( i.e. sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems) will come into force on January/uni00A01, 2023.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

In this regard, AXA has identified three Taxonomy-eligible lines of Non-Life insurance business:/uni00A0(i) Motor insurance (other than third party liability insurance), (ii) Marine, Aviation and Transport insurance and (iii) F ire and O ther Property Damage insurance.\n\nIn these lines of business, insurance products generally include coverage of risks related to climate-related perils. While certain products may not cover such perils, it has been assumed for the first/uni00A0year of reporting that the total amount of net premiums written by these three lines of business would be recognized as eligible to the Taxonomy. The reported amounts are net of reinsurance.\n\nProducts in other N on-L ife lines of business may consist in underwriting of climate-related perils, but, as such coverage may not be systematic and further assessment is needed, no further eligibility to the Taxonomy was recognized at this stage on other Non-Life insurance activities.\n\nFinally, it is important to note that the eligibility to EU Taxonomy does not indicate whether, or to what extent, the Non-Life insurance activities contribute substantially to climate-change mitigation or adaptation.\n\n## PROPORTION OF INVESTMENTS EXPOSED TO TAXONOMY-ELIGIBLE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES ('INVESTMENT RATIO')\n\nThe following Investment Ratio represents the weighted average value of/uni00A0(a) invested assets directed at funding, or associated with, Taxonomy-eligible economic activities relative to/uni00A0(b) the value of total invested assets included for the purpose of the calculation of the Investment Ratio (the 'Covered Assets').\n\nThe Covered Assets are the total on-balance sheet invested assets minus those assets that are excluded from the calculation of the Investment Ratio. This means that the Covered Assets are all invested assets in the balance-sheet, excluding exposures to central banks, supranational issuers and central governments, as set out in Article/uni00A07.1 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139.\n\nI\n\nI",

The impact of AXA's internal operations on climate change is identified as one of the main ESG risks in 2021/uni00A0as explained in Section/uni00A04.1/uni00A0'AXA Sustainability strategy -/uni00A0Sustainability risk assessment' of this Annual Report. AXA's own operations may have a negative impact on climate through its GHG emissions from heating and cooling, IT equipment and data centers, car fleet and business travel. To reduce its impact and make sure it actively reduces its CO2/uni00A0emissions, AXA has been setting up an environmental management system for the entire Group. The environmental reporting, done every/uni00A0year, enables to track the progress made against a set of targets that are regularly updated to reflect the Group's ambition. Entities are coordinated and led with assigned targets but also regular training, best-practice sharing calls and guidelines. The results of this policy are displayed in detail in the following section with the CO2/uni00A0emissions from energy, car fleet, business travel and IT (Scope/uni00A03).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## PERFORMANCE TARGETS 2019-2025\n\nAXA continues to work on the deployment of its action plan to achieve its objectives by 2025. With this new cycle, AXA aims at reducing the footprint of its operations on all the 'Scopes' of its greenhouse gas emissions/uni00A0 (1) :\n\n- /uni25A0 Scope/uni00A01: emissions related to fuel combustion on AXA's sites (gas, heating oil\u2026) as well by vehicle fleet;\n- /uni25A0 Scope/uni00A02: emissions from purchased energy (mainly electricity consumed in AXA buildings);\n- /uni25A0 Scope/uni00A03: emissions from business travel and IT activities.\n\nThese objectives are based on the approach promoted by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which AXA joined in 2015. More specifically, AXA has chosen the 'Sectoral Approach to Decarbonization' to define its 2019-2025/uni00A0objectives, aimed at achieving the goals of the Paris agreements. AXA has submitted to the SBTi a target of -31% for Scope/uni00A01 and 2/uni00A0perimeters. These targets have been set  for each entity of AXA to help them steer their emissions at the local level. Moreover, internal operations-related carbon footprint reduction is now a criterion in the Long-Term Incentive (LTI), for profit-sharing attribution and entities'  CEO target letters -/uni00A0please refer to Section/uni00A03.2/uni00A0'Executive compensation and share ownership' and Section/uni00A04.2/uni00A0'Employer Responsibility' of this Annual Report.",

The calculation of CO2/uni00A0emissions related to primary energy consumption for buildings is done using ADEME emission factors or those communicated by the supplier for renewable energies such as biogas. For car fleet\n\nemissions, an emission factor per kilometer is applied based on the vehicle's emission range. To consider regulatory changes and new WLTP standards/uni00A0 (1) ('Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure'), vehicles acquired or leased from 2020/uni00A0onwards are classified according to the WLTP standard.\n\nScope/uni00A01 CO2/uni00A0emissions amounted to 23,362/uni00A0t eq CO2/uni00A0in 2021, a decrease by 11% compared to 2020. AXA's 2021/uni00A0target was 34,458/uni00A0t eq CO2/uni00A0(target is -25% between 2019/uni00A0and 2025). This result was mainly due to a decrease in heating due to the COVID-19 crisis, but also to the replacement of natural gas with biogas for AXA France. The use of the vehicle fleet was also down in 2021/uni00A0compared to 2020/uni00A0with a 5% decrease in CO2/uni00A0emissions.\n\n## SCOPE/uni00A02 CO2/uni00A0EMISSIONS\n\nCO2eq emissions related to electricity consumption are calculated based on consumption in kilowatt-hour (kWh). If the primary source of electricity is known, ADEME emission factors are used. Otherwise, we either use the emission factor provided by the electricity suppliers (market-based) or the average emission factor for electricity in the country also called location-based (sourcing ADEME or the European Environment Agency for European countries).\n\nFor other secondary energies (heating and cooling networks) we use the emission factors provided by ADEME or directly by the supplier if it is produced from a primary renewable source.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

AXA's 2021/uni00A0target was 54,459/uni00A0t eq CO2/uni00A0(target is -35% between 2019/uni00A0and 2025). This decrease was mainly due to lower consumption resulting from the reduced use of buildings due to the COVID-19 situation that continued into 2021/uni00A0and the switch to green power at some sites.\n\n## SCOPE/uni00A03 CO2/uni00A0EMISSIONS\n\nAXA's Scope/uni00A03 emissions include CO2/uni00A0emissions related to business travel, consumption of digital equipment (computers, fixed and cell phones, storage tools, cloud storage servers) and employee commuting. However, the target set by AXA on Scope/uni00A03 for the period 2019-2025/uni00A0includes only business travel.\n\nAXA's Scope/uni00A03 business travel emissions were 3,866/uni00A0t eq CO2/uni00A0in 2021, a decrease of 78% compared to 2020. The target for AXA was 84,870/uni00A0t eq CO2/uni00A0for 2021, excluding COVID-19 e/ff ect (target is -18% between 2019/uni00A0and 2025). The COVID-19 crisis was the main driver of this significant decline in 2021. New remote working habits were adopted, and travels banned due to the sanitary situation. The emission factors are those of ADEME and of the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural A/ff airs (DEFRA).\n\nI\n\nI\n\nAXA also measures the carbon emissions related to its employee commuting, even though such indirect emissions may be outside of the scope of the Group's responsibilities. In 2021, results are based on responses collected from 30/uni00A0entities and extrapolated to the whole Group. It is estimated that AXA employees commuted a total of 775.5/uni00A0million of kilometers, out of which 47% travelled by public transport, 5% by company cars, and 36% by personal vehicles and the rest by foot or bicycle. Scope/uni00A03 employee commuting emissions are estimated at 78,846/uni00A0t eq CO2/uni00A0in 2021, a decrease of 36% versus 2019. Employee commuting-related CO2/uni00A0emissions per FTE decreased by 32% compared to 2019/uni00A0(representing 0.69/uni00A0tons eq. CO2/uni00A0per FTE in 2021). This decrease in emissions was linked to a decrease of commuting due to hybrid work mode scheme put in place in most AXA entities -/uni00A0refer to Section/uni00A04.2/uni00A0'Employer Responsibility'.\n\nIT Scope/uni00A03 emissions (equipment manufacturing and services) amount to 25,720/uni00A0t eq CO2/uni00A0in 2021. Scope/uni00A03 related to AXA's IT impacts is part of a broader program aiming at steering the impact of AXA's digital activities (refer to paragraph 'Environmental impact related to the use of digital equipment').\n\nTotal AXA's Scope/uni00A03 emissions (business travel, commuting and digital equipment and services) amounted to 108,432/uni00A0t eq CO2/uni00A0in 2021.",

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) highlighted in bold. AXA sites with fewer than 50/uni00A0FTEs are not included in data collection  but are part of extrapolation process.\n\n## Analysis per consumption items\n\n2021/uni00A0was marked by an increase in hybrid working schemes within all AXA entities, resulting from a combination of smart working implementation and COVID-19 measures. This shi/f\\_t  had an impact on all our consumption indicators.\n\n## ENERGY CONSUMPTION\n\nAXA's energy consumption includes the total energy consumed by its corporate sites (heating, cooling, daily operations electricity) and data centers during the reporting/uni00A0year. In 2021, total energy mix consisted of electricity (72%), gas (10%), carbon neutral/ renewable steam (8%), steam (4%), chilled water (3%), biogas (2%) and heating oil (1%).\n\nAXA's total energy consumption is 233,927/uni00A0MWh for 2021, a decrease of 10% compared to 2020. This consumption was lower than the 2021/uni00A0target of 294,957/uni00A0MWh for this/uni00A0year (AXA target is -10% between 2019/uni00A0and 2025).\n\nIn 2021, the COVID-19 crisis continued to reduce buildings' usage with a lower occupancy rate, even though they have been maintained to heat and cool for minimum accessibility. However, 2021/uni00A0achievements also resulted from continued e/ff orts to save energy at our sites. In 2021, 74/uni00A0AXA sites out of the 222 o/ff ice sites (33% versus 31% in 2020) included in the environmental reporting received an environmental certificate under building certification programs such as BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology), LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), HQE (High Quality Environmental Standard),/uni00A0etc.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nAlongside building certification, entities are also implementing energy saving actions in their buildings to reduce their GHG emissions. On the one hand, most entities are better managing their heating/cooling system by implementing a centralized air conditioning system, lowering the heating/cooling when needed and including threshold for minimum and maximum temperature. On the other hand, they are also investing in more energy e/ff icient equipment such as low energy lighting with LED and double gazing to reduce heat loss as well as light motion sensors to save electricity and to only use lights when needed.\n\nIn 2021, 64% of the electricity consumed by AXA was coming from renewable energy sources (hydro, wind, solar, geothermal, biomass) which show an increase of 12% compared to 2020/uni00A0(57%). AXA's 'RE100' objective is to reach 100% by 2025/uni00A0and 7/uni00A0entities have already achieved 100% renewable electricity in 2021.\n\n## BUSINESS TRAVEL\n\nBusiness travel measured in kilometers decreased by 68% between 2020/uni00A0and 2021, from 88.3/uni00A0million km in 2020/uni00A0to 28.1/uni00A0million km in 2021, mainly impacted by the COVID-19 context (as explained in 'Scope/uni00A03 Business travel' above). Some entities such as AXA XL and AXA Climate have initiated a carbon pricing on business travels.\n\nSome entities such as AXA Germany o/ff set all their air and train business travel emissions. On the one hand, for their business travel by train, AXA Germany has a compensation partnership with Deutsche Bahn for long-distance travel since 2013/uni00A0and short-distance travel as well since 2019. On the other hand, for their business travel by plane, AXA Germany initiated in 2021/uni00A0a partnership with Lu/f\\_t hansa to compensate all flight emissions since 2020. AXA Germany is the first corporate partner who joined their corporate program 'Compensaid/uni00A0 (1) ' . Compensaid is one of the first providers to o/ff er sustainable CO2/uni00A0neutralization for all flights by using 'Sustainable Aviation Fuel' (SAF, synthetic kerosene) and reforestation.\n\n## VEHICLE FLEET\n\nAXA's fleet is made up of commercial and corporate vehicles. The standards for calculating vehicle emissions are evolving with the deployment of the WLTP standards. Vehicles acquired or leased from 2020/uni00A0onwards are classified according to these new standards.\n\nIn 2021, the total distance traveled by the Group's vehicle fleet was 142/uni00A0million of km, down 3% from 2020.\n\nAXA entities are striving to reduce the impact of the car fleet. Some entities are increasing the e/ff iciency of their vehicle fleet by o/ff ering a wide range of low-emission/electric vehicles.\n\nAs a result, in 2021, 25.2% of the kilometers traveled by AXA's vehicle fleet were covered by hybrid and electric cars, compared to 23.6% in 2020, an increase of nearly 7%.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## PAPER\n\nAXA's paper usage concerns o/ff ice paper (measured per employee) and marketing and distribution paper (brochures,/uni00A0etc., measured per client). AXA's total paper consumption was 61.8/uni00A0kg/FTE in 2021/uni00A0 versus 47.7/uni00A0kg/FTE in 2020, i.e., an increase of 30%. 2021/uni00A0target was 57.6/uni00A0kg/FTE (AXA target is -20% between 2019/uni00A0and 2025/uni00A0target). This result comes from:\n\n- /uni25A0 AXA's o/ff ice paper consumption per FTE was 4.8/uni00A0kg/FTE in 2021/uni00A0 versus 9.2/uni00A0kg /FTE in 2020, a decrease of 48%. Many entities have implemented a printing policy that includes reducing the number of printers and installing a badge system to collect all printed documents;\n- /uni25A0 AXA's consumption of marketing and distribution paper per client is 0.07/uni00A0kg/client in 2021/uni00A0 versus 0.04/uni00A0kg/client in 2020, an increase by 64%. This increase is mainly related to higher sales activity across the Group and to an improvement in the consumption measurement of marketing and distribution paper in Japan.\n\nAXA also strives to increase the volume of paper from recycled sources or sustainably managed forests. In 2021, 64% of o/ff ice paper was procured from recycled sources compared to 48% in 2020. At the same time, 65% of marketing and distribution paper was received from recycled sources in 2021/uni00A0compared to 80% in 2020. This decrease is explained by a lower traceability of origin.\n\n## WATER CONSUMPTION\n\nAXA's water consumption was 3.23/uni00A0m 3 /FTE a decrease of/uni00A033% compared to 2020. The target for 2021/uni00A0was 6.8/uni00A0m 3 /FTE (target is -10% between 2019/uni00A0and 2025). This reduction in water consumption reflects better water management initiatives (double flush toilets, automatic shut-o/ff  of taps, aerators on water taps, leak detection,/uni00A0etc.) by the entities and the buildings' lower occupancy rate in the context of a continuing COVID-19 crisis.\n\n## WASTE MANAGEMENT\n\nAXA contributes to waste reduction and sorting for recycling.\n\nThe quantity of unsorted waste was 18.8/uni00A0kg/FTE in 2021/uni00A0decreasing by 18% compared to 2020, mainly due to COVID-19, waste reduction initiatives, and the development of selective sorting in the entities. The target for 2021/uni00A0was 37/uni00A0kg/FTE (reduction target is -10% between 2019/uni00A0and 2025).\n\nThe total amount of waste generated by AXA was 4,289/uni00A0tons in 2021/uni00A0 versus 5,430/uni00A0tons in 2020, a decrease of 21%/uni00A0and a constant recycling rate (sorted waste/total waste) of 50% as in 2020.\n\nIn order to better tackle their waste management, AXA sites are installing sorting garbage cans on each floor and having recycling awareness campaigns for employees throughout the/uni00A0year in order to foster engagement from their employees.",

However, digitalization has a growing environmental impact, from using energy to first build the tools, including the usage of raw materials, and to then exchange and store the data. Therefore AXA, with its dedicated entity AXA Group Operations, launched in 2020/uni00A0a Digital Sustainability program and published a first measure of its Digital equipment's and services CO2/uni00A0footprint. In 2021, the program has been pushed further to:\n\n- /uni25A0 integrate more purchased services like Google Cloud Platforms, Orange, and Microso/f\\_t  O365, in addition to Amazon, Microso/f\\_t Azure and Salesforce, and update 2019/2020/uni00A0data accordingly;\n- /uni25A0 drive the transformation in the major entities with the nomination of a 'Digital Sustainability Leader', the execution of a Digital Sustainability maturity assessment to identify best practices and areas of improvement relying on entity level footprint;\n- /uni25A0 secure the contribution to the -20% reduction of AXA's CO2/uni00A0emissions (Energy, car fleet and business travel, and IT equipment and services).\n\nThe digital sustainability action plans focus on:\n\n- /uni25A0 improving the Group processes such as adapting architecture patterns (application development data management practices), monitoring AXA's activities (data volumes, network tra/ff ic, electricity consumption\u2026), securing timely cloud migration and decommissioning and assessing potential CO2/uni00A0impact of new projects;\n- /uni25A0 embarking IT suppliers (transparency, from volume-based to service-based, Total Environmental Cost of Ownership (TECO) through a Digital Sustainability Manifesto and metrics;\n- /uni25A0 expanding equipment lifetime and minimizing the number of devices per employee;\n- /uni25A0 developing climate change awareness among employees leveraging AXA Climate Academy (refer to Section/uni00A04.2/uni00A0'Employer Responsibility' of this Annual Report) ;\n- /uni25A0 developing outreach and partnerships: Cigref, French government ' Mission Num\u00e9rique des grands groupes/chantier num\u00e9rique et environment ' , Boavizta, The Shi/f\\_t  Project, The Open Group \u00ae .\n\nI\n\nI\n\nAXA's digital footprint was 31,226/uni00A0t eq CO2/uni00A0in 2021/uni00A0market-based with a slight 2% decrease compared to 2020/uni00A0and stable compared to 2019, while the measure was more precise in 2021/uni00A0with more accurate desktop inventory and more complete with a wider scope of purchased services. This footprint divides into four main categories:\n\n- /uni25A0 31,910/uni00A0MWh corresponding to 1, 882/uni00A0t eq CO2/uni00A0market-based/uni00A0 (1 ) related to the electricity consumption of the servers directly used and operated by AXA Group Operations in its data centers. This category is a subset of Scope/uni00A02 electricity of AXA (please refer to paragraph 'Scope/uni00A02 CO2/uni00A0emissions' above for calculation methods). A 3% decrease was observed on electricity consumption 2020/2021/uni00A0due to the transfer of services from AXA data centers to the cloud. Electricity purchasing has also shi/f\\_t ed to less CO2/uni00A0intensive sources like hydraulic, driving a 24% decrease in the market-based footprint;\n- /uni25A0 9,939/uni00A0MWh corresponding to 3,624/uni00A0t eq CO2/uni00A0location-based/uni00A0 (1 ) linked to the electricity consumption of the terminals used by employees and service providers involved in AXA operations (computers, monitors, cell phones, tablets). The calculation method is based on internal inventories and manufacturers' data. The measurement includes a subset of Scope/uni00A02 (for consumption in AXA buildings) as well as a Scope/uni00A03 part in the case of remote work. The proportion of consumption inside and outside AXA's premises has not yet been determined. A 3% decrease is observed on electricity consumption 2020/2021/uni00A0due to a significant replacement of desktop workstations by laptops that are less energy intensive;\n- /uni25A0 16,931/uni00A0t eq CO2/uni00A0related to the manufacturing of digital equipment that have been purchased by AXA. The calculation method is based on inventories, manufacturers, and public data as well as equipment average lifespan (Scope/uni00A03 emissions). A 4% increase was observed mainly due to more accurate inventory on desktops;\n- /uni25A0 8,789/uni00A0t eq CO2/uni00A0in connection with AXA's purchases of services like cloud computing (Scope/uni00A03 emissions). Volumes of purchased digital services were globally increasing and tracking their environmental impact remains a challenge and requires di/ff erent methodology to cover the scope monitored here. Maturity of our providers on this topic is still low and should evolve quickly toward a tracking of both electricity consumption, CO2/uni00A0location based, and market based, including emissions due to manufacturing of equipment's' and digital waste to allow accurate tracking of environmental impact and avoid any misinterpretation. In the current measure, we observed a 6% increase of CO2/uni00A0market based due to consumption increase between 2019/uni00A0and 2021/uni00A0and a 4% decrease between 2020/uni00A0and 2021/uni00A0that will have to be confirmed.",

Insurance is a major catalyst for economic development and progress in society. The pooling of risks, which is at the heart of insurance, creates a system of mutual support and reinforces a sense of community. AXA aims at extending  the scope of insurance by enabling populations who have traditionally been less wellprotected to access insurance innovatively, through the following initiatives:\n\n- /uni25A0 developing a new 'inclusive protection' program, in line with AXA's strategic plan;\n- /uni25A0 being actively engaged in financial inclusion with AXA Emerging Customers;\n- /uni25A0 providing insurance solutions and opportunities for women with the 'Women in Insurance' initiative;\n- /uni25A0 proposing parametric insurance solutions to protect vulnerable populations from the e/ff ects of climate change, along with AXA Climate;\n- /uni25A0 ensuring access to health and disease prevention, in the context of the pandemic and beyond, through dedicated products and services;\n- /uni25A0 integrating ESG criteria in the product range through dedicated product labels such as ' Assurance citoyenne ' ('Citizen insurance').\n\n## INCLUSIVE PROTECTION\n\nAs an inclusive insurer, the main risk is the inability or di/ff iculty to provide insurance services to the society at large, including underserved communities, while positively impacting society and fighting against poverty and inequalities, notably related to gender (refer to Section/uni00A04.1/uni00A0'AXA Sustainability Strategy -/uni00A0Sustainability Risk Assessment' of this Annual Report). Social inclusion and the 'insurance for all' are strong principles of the Company, notably a/f\\_t  er a global pandemic that worsen the protection gaps and put more vulnerable people at risk than before.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, AXA has developed in 2021/uni00A0an Inclusive Protection program  to deploy, with AXA's entities around the world, o/ff ers (insurance coverage or service) to better protect the underserved population. A key pillar of this program  is AXA's capacity to address clients and beneficiaries ' inherent characteristics such as financial situation, age, gender, sexual orientation, health, geographical location or insurance awareness, that can result in significant protection gaps. As such, AXA is taking a wider approach on inclusive protection that is both locally relevant and considers customers' evolving needs.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nAXA defines an inclusive protection o/ff er as a product ( e.g., design or customized) or a related service that addresses a vulnerability to meet the needs of the underserved population, to bridge a protection gap. Vulnerabilities can be caused by 1) structural or 2) occupational situations:\n\n- /uni25A0 structural vulnerabilities: monetary/revenues, territorial disparities, gender and age, chronic diseases, lack of access to health and protection;\n- /uni25A0 occupational vulnerabilities: micro-entrepreneurs, gig economy workers and migrant workers.\n\nWithin this context, a framework has been developed with AXA entities in 2021/uni00A0with the objective of robustly defining the vulnerabilities to be addressed, leveraging existing initiatives and expanding them within the Group: solutions developed by AXA Emerging Customers, AXA Climate, 'Women in Insurance', as well as developing inclusive o/ff ers for people excluded due to income, status, health, or gender. This Inclusive Protection program is transversal to tackle key vulnerabilities in mature and emerging markets, covering both individual clients as well as businesses, in all business lines.\n\nIn 2021, AXA already gathered a total of 10.6/uni00A0million customers in its new Inclusive protection Program. This figure includes the scope of AXA Emerging customers (9.5/uni00A0milion) and AXA Climate, 'Women in Insurance' and local inclusive o/ff ers.\n\n## EMERGING CUSTOMERS AND INITIATIVES TO FOSTER MORE RESILIENCE\n\nThrough the development of its Emerging Customers' insurance solutions across the world, AXA addresses financial exclusion by enabling vulnerable segments of the population, including selfemployed workers, micro, small and medium enterprises, migrant workers, blue-collar workers, women, and smallholder farmers to access insurance products and services that accompany them in their economic progression and provide a safety net that prevents them from falling into poverty. This approach requires the design of proposals that are accessible, a/ff ordable, and relevant to the reality of these otherwise unserved customers. The product and services from the entity AXA Emerging Customers are designed leveraging technology and involve co-creation with customers as well as distribution partners, including mobile network operators, banks, and microfinance institutions, FMCG companies, and remittance companies.\n\nIn 2021, AXA Emerging Customers protected nearly 9.5/uni00A0million customers. Business activities spanned more than 15/uni00A0markets in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe. These results represent a circa +60% growth versus the pro-forma 2020/uni00A0results of 5.9/uni00A0million customers -/uni00A0not considering the portfolio from Bharti AXA General Insurance following AXA's disposal of its stake in the Company in 2021/uni00A0(22.3/uni00A0million total AXA Emerging Customers clients reported in 2020).\n\nAs described in Section 'Inclusive Protection'  below, AXA Emerging Customers figures are also consolidated within the new I nclusive P rotection  program.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nAchievements include the geographic expansion in 2021/uni00A0into new markets, including Brazil, Turkey, Colombia and France. The focus of the/uni00A0year was on protecting segments that were hard hit by the COVID-19 crisis, including independent workers, migrant workers, and micro, small and medium enterprises through insurance and other related services. Some examples of this include coverage to microfinance borrowers to Egypt, Indonesia, Colombia, and Mexico, and protection for independent workers in Turkey, France and Mexico.\n\nA project incubated in the Business for Inclusive Growth (B4IG) coalition, coordinated by AXA Emerging Customers, AXA Climate and L'Or\u00e9al was launched in 2021. Insurance Net for Smallholders (INES) aims to provide a comprehensive risk protection package (Health insurance, Parametric Climate insurance coverage and value-added services) to smallholder farmers/pickers and their families as part of L'Or\u00e9al Solidarity Sourcing programs. In 2021, two pilots were launched in Burkina Faso with L'Or\u00e9al's suppliers notably OLVEA and AXA's local partner  Sonar for shea butter (21,000/uni00A0women) and India with Solvay for guar (2,000/uni00A0farmers and their families).\n\n## WOMEN AND INSURANCE\n\nWomen, particularly in emerging countries, are less well-insured than men, despite being a powerful force in the economy. Back in 2014, AXA published a report, 'SheForShield', which looked at women's attitudes towards insurance, as well as their needs and expectations. Since then, AXA has implemented the 'Women in Insurance' initiative aimed at increasing women's access to insurance products.\n\nThe three/uni00A0main focus areas for women are when they are: clients, entrepreneurs and in AXA's distribution force. AXA has developed a dual approach: in mature markets, AXA will empower women to be financially independent, and in emerging markets, the objective is to empower women to 'live better lives'.\n\nSince 2016, the 'Women in Insurance' initiative has been spread in many AXA entities to locally address this holistic strategy around addressing women. As an insurer, we have two key priorities:\n\n- /uni25A0 empowering women entrepreneurs to take risks and seize opportunities, with customized products and services that help them develop their business, while allowing them to take better care of themselves and their family;\n- /uni25A0 improving access to healthcare solutions/uni00A0that take into account women's specific health and prevention needs and/uni00A0also supporting women in science.\n\nBy adapting current products to better include women, or designing specific products to answer their needs, the initiative gathers in 2020, 25/uni00A0products in 17/uni00A0entities.",

        "page_content": "Every/uni00A0year since 2018, AXA has been a strategic partner of the 'Global Women's Forum', with the objective to disseminate AXA's expertise and influence on the best practices, solutions, and projects. Through this organization, AXA published, since 2020, a first Gender Equity barometer to highlight the disparity between perception and reality on gender-related topics in G7/uni00A0countries. Leading the 'Women4Health Daring Circle', AXA is striving towards giving women equal access to health and exploring unique and paramount ways to enhance their health status and their quality of life by shaping a new inclusive health system in the post-COVID-19 world.\n\nSince 2019, through the AXA Research Fund, AXA dedicated \u20ac1/uni00A0million to research to better understand and prevent health and entrepreneurial barriers for women and funded 8/uni00A0health researchers around women's specific health diseases.\n\nBetween 2020/uni00A0and 2021, AXA teamed up with the research firm Ipsos to survey 8,000/uni00A0women from di/ff erent social backgrounds in eight countries. As a result, three reports have been published, addressing the impacts of COVID-19 crisis on women. The first report examined the e/ff ect on women's incomes, job security and employment to understand the economic impact of the crisis. The second report looked at women's health, and the e/ff ect of the crisis on their physical and mental wellbeing as well as their approach to healthcare. The third one talked about how women's use of digital has increased during the pandemic and the digital impact on women's lives -/uni00A0both on risks and opportunities.\n\n## PARAMETRIC INSURANCE\n\nAXA Climate is a committed climate insurer that accompanies its clients in their sustainability transition journey. AXA Climate's entire o/ff er is built on best-in-class climate expertise, fully leveraging satellite technology. AXA Climate's mission is to reinvent the insurance business to support those engaged in sustainable transitions. To serve this mission, AXA Climate has developed a comprehensive set of business lines around climate change: from parametric insurance against climate risk, operational alerting, climate consultancy for industries, public sector, agriculture, and financial services, and to training to enhance skills and engage all employees in making the sustainable transition a success.\n\nBy drawing on the latest advances in technology and data science to protect vulnerable communities from the e/ff ects of climate change, AXA Climate provides parametric insurance solutions based on satellite and weather data that triggers quick and automatic payouts within a few days a/f\\_t er a natural catastrophe or extreme weather event has struck.\n\nWith around 300/uni00A0BtoB public and private sector clients worldwide, AXA Climate provides immediate protection to communities facing climate risks to prevent them from falling into poverty.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAXA Climate works closely with governments and international organizations to develop public-private partnerships in emerging markets. Public-private partnerships represent over half of the portfolio. AXA Climate's public clients include all major international sovereign risk pools which provide governments protection against natural disaster risks including tropical cyclone, earthquake, excess rainfall, and drought. AXA Climate also works with governments in the agriculture sector to protect farmers against yield losses due to multiple climate risks. As an example, AXA Climate supports the National Agriculture insurance scheme in India which allows more than 43/uni00A0million farmers to benefit from Agriculture insurance.\n\nMoreover, AXA Climate also works with the public sector on Agriculture insurance projects at smaller scale in Pakistan, Vietnam, Taiwan, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Zambia, Ethiopia, and Mozambique where it protects over half a/uni00A0million farmers.\n\nCorporate clients of AXA Climate include also leading industrialists in Europe, Asia and the Americas, agriculture cooperatives, forestry organizations both in Europe and Latin America, and renewable energy companies.\n\n## ACCESS TO HEALTH AND DISEASE PREVENTION\n\nIn 2021, as part as the second/uni00A0year of the COVID-19 pandemic, mental, physical and relational health impacts are starting to emerge. That is why AXA launched a 'Pulse Health Survey' examining the impact of COVID-19 on people's health and wellbeing. This survey, that was carried out in February-March/uni00A02021, jointly with the research firm Ipsos covered 14/uni00A0countries and territories in Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), Africa (Morocco and Nigeria), Asia (China, Hong Kong, and Japan) and the Americas (Mexico and the United States). A total 14,000/uni00A0respondents were interviewed. As a result, one report has been published called 'Shockwave: long term health e/ff ect of COVID-19'/uni00A0 (1) , examining the pandemic's impacts on financial, physical, and mental health status of the population.\n\nThis study showed that nearly two-thirds of the population has had problems getting treatment in the first/uni00A0year of pandemic. To tackle this issue, AXA has launched many business-related initiatives throughout the Group with products and services' adaptations to better ease health access to our customers. As part of the COVID-19 diagnostics, China, Thailand, and Philippines have developed symptom checkers, combined with technology. Extensions of services have been developed to address vulnerable population, such as women, with dedicated services for health prevention, cancer diagnostic and treatment in Italy and Mexico.\n\nI\n\n4",

Three new clinics are launched in 2021/uni00A0in central Cairo and its suburbs, for a total of five clinics launched since 2020.\n\nAt the end of 2021, AXA has committed $300/uni00A0million to finance a Global Health investment strategy managed by AXA Investment Managers. This purpose-driven private equity approach will invest in products and services designed to facilitate access to high volume healthcare solutions which target reaching underserved populations in emerging and mature markets.\n\n## INTEGRATING SOCIETAL ISSUES IN/uni00A0THE/uni202FPRODUCT RANGE\n\nIn France, demand for responsible products from clients continues to grow. Consequently, back in 2015, AXA France created the Assurance citoyenne ('Citizen insurance') label, which guarantees\n\nthat all new insurance contracts o/ff er benefits to clients as well as positively impact society. In 2019, this initiative was adapted and deployed on AXA's Savings contracts under the \u00c9pargne citoyenne ('Citizen Savings') label. These two labels are based on an assessment toolkit built in collaboration with a panel of external stakeholders and audited by an independent third party. Our engagements are communicated through the label's four pillars, which are the following: 'Trust' ( e.g. simple contracts for readability and transparency), 'Prevention' ( e.g. preventive services or financial education to minimize the risks our clients are facing for themselves, their goods and their savings), 'Environment' ( e.g. , investment decisions based on the environmental impact, environmental services or o/ff ers for Damages insurance), and 'Fairness' ( e.g., product accessibility for populations usually excluded from insurance mechanisms, investments in companies which create recruiting opportunities and protect human rights). In 2021, AXA France built all new o/ff ers around these engagements and distributed in total 83/uni00A0di/ff  erent labelled products. Since 2015, 8.4/uni00A0million labelled contracts have been sold.\n\n## INCLUSIVE ECONOMY AND SOCIAL RELATED OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT\n\n## Tobacco Free Pledge\n\nIn 2020, AXA's strong commitments, initiated in 2016, to divest from (\u20ac1.8/uni00A0billion) and to end insurance covers for the Tobacco industry, have been o/ff icially certified through the 'Tobacco Free Pledge' label. This label attests AXA's constant engagement in the fight against tobacco that generates more than 8/uni00A0million deaths per/uni00A0year, standing out as one of the leading causes of death in the world. AXA believes that supporting an industry which is the main cause of long-term non-communicable diseases, including cancer, heart disease and chronic respiratory illnesses, is not compatible with its role as one of the world's largest health insurers.\n\n## Business for Inclusive Growth (B4IG )\n\nFor the third/uni00A0year in the row, AXA continues to be strongly involved in the 'Business for Inclusive Growth' coalition. This OECD-led coalition of private companies contributes to fighting social inequalities by working closely with policymakers to advance inclusion at both the global and local levels. The initiative was launched at the 2019/uni00A0G7/uni00A0Summit whose theme was 'fighting inequalities of all types'. Since then, a 3-year-program, monitored through a Board of CEOs, has been implemented, covering the G7, the OECD and African countries. Its main deliverables being:\n\n- /uni25A0 a founding pledge signed in AXA's head o/ff ice on promoting equality of opportunities, eliminating gender disparities, reducing spatial inequalities;\n- /uni25A0 dedicated working groups gathering OECD experts, academia focused on developing inclusive projects;\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- /uni25A0 an international incubator hosted at the OECD with the objective of building inclusive business with real social and economic impacts.\n\nIn 2021, the coalition has actively continued its task and expanded the scope of its action. AXA is part of the following working groups: a/ff ordable products and services, fair transition, inclusive workplace, and ethnicity.\n\nTo be noted, in France, AXA is also a member of the 'inclusive economy coalition', launched in 2018/uni00A0by CEOs of 33/uni00A0major French companies, including AXA, to act in favor of a more inclusive economy. This collective commitment is one of the private sector's responses to the social vulnerabilities, which can be observed in France, on three key themes: employment (apprenticeship, inclusion, and training), more accessible products and services, and inclusive purchasing.",

The policies detailed herewith are put in place to limit this risk. Thanks to the AXA Community investment Survey, the share of activities aligned with the Sustainability Strategy can be monitored. In 2021/uni00A078% of the \u20ac31.9/uni00A0million cash donations done by AXA (including the AXA Research Fund) in the world and 78% of the 45,163/uni00A0volunteering acts performed by AXA employees were done in support to climate or inclusive protection causes versus 87.9% of cash donations and 93% of the volunteering acts in 2020. 2020/uni00A0was however an exceptional/uni00A0year due to additional supports to fight the COVID-19 crisis. Targets are currently being set for these indicators.\n\n## PHILANTHROPY\n\nAs a responsible corporate citizen, AXA strives to play a positive role in society, building a culture that promotes employee volunteering to support the communities in which AXA operates.\n\nIn 2021, AXA pursued the deployment of its philanthropic initiatives, within the new strategic cycle, aligned with the two Sustainability pillars (climate change, inclusive protection) through its Corporate Philanthropy Committee governance body.\n\n## Climate and the environment\n\nAXA's global partnership with WWF that was signed in 2019, has been pursued in 2020/uni00A0and 2021/uni00A0to address climate and biodiversity issues. Through this three-year program, WWF supports AXA in its e/ff orts to ensure that natural capital is better considered in all AXA's activities (please refer to Section/uni00A04.3/uni00A0'Climate Change and ESG Integration'  of this Annual Report).  In addition, the philanthropy component of this program contributes directly to the preservation of ecosystems in Mexico and New Caledonia. In New Caledonia, 3/uni00A0local associations dedicated to the monitoring and evaluation of Coral Reefs health status were supported. In Mexico, the 'Reforestation in the Copalita Watershed' project enabled the production of 30,000/uni00A0sprouts of local species for reforestation, 30/uni00A0hectares of local trees were planted and 50/uni00A0people from local communities trained to agroecology. Many AXA entities concluded partnerships to impact positively the environment and fight against climate change ( e.g., AXA Switzerland, AXA Mexico, AXA France,/uni00A0etc.).\n\n## Inclusive Protection\n\nStarting in 2020, AXA partnered for 3/uni00A0years with UNICEF on a program to respond to the global issue of overweight and obesity, working on early childhood eating habits in the Philippines and Brazil. To reach children aged from 0/uni00A0to 5, UNICEF acts on their immediate environment, namely mothers and the health and\n\neducation professionals around them. Training, communication, and advocacy activities with authorities have been implemented by local UNICEF teams despite the COVID-19 crisis. In 2021, the program enabled to achieve the following:\n\n- /uni25A0 in Brazil, 208,527/uni00A0people received messages to improve their nutrition and that of their children/babies. 7,126/uni00A0pregnant women in four maternity hospitals received information and materials ( e.g., booklets) on breastfeeding and healthy eating for children. 7,604/uni00A0community health workers and teachers were trained on breastfeeding and healthy feeding for children under 5/uni00A0years of age. This knowledge indirectly benefits 456,240/uni00A0children. 237/uni00A0adolescents (parents/pregnant teens) were trained on healthy eating for themselves and their children;\n- /uni25A0 in the Philippines, four studies were conducted and shared with national authorities to feed into the development of the national policy on obesity and overweight, and the food packaging labeling policy, 334,636/uni00A0caregivers and parents received information on breastfeeding, hygiene, and appropriate complementary feeding for young children through local radio stations and online platforms. 2,169/uni00A0health care workers were trained on healthy nutrition for mothers, children, and infants; to support parents and develop their knowledge on balanced nutrition. 8,944/uni00A0pregnant women and 80,264/uni00A0children aged 0-59/uni00A0months received nutritional follow-up.\n\nIn 2021, AXA reinforced its commitment to fight COVID-19 alongside UNICEF to support the COVAX program. This initiative aims at delivering more than 2/uni00A0billion COVID-19 vaccines in 98/uni00A0low- and middle-income countries. AXA donated \u20ac1.5/uni00A0million to UNICEF which will enable to deliver 2/uni00A0doses of vaccine for 457,270/uni00A0people. This includes multiple activities, including planning and coordination, vaccine transport in-countries, training health sta/ff , community engagement, getting cold chain equipment in place and providing health workers with personal protective equipment.\n\nAligned with its values of protecting and passing on heritage, AXA has been engaged in significant world heritage conservation actions. Since spring 2021, AXA has been supporting the renovation and refurbishing of the Arc de Triomphe. Since 2019, support has been o/ff ered for the renovation of Madame du Barry's apartment at Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles. The work should be completed in 2022. AXA has been also supporting the reconstruction of for NotreDame de Paris a/f\\_t er the fire in 2019.\n\nAXA entities, such as AXA France, AXA Spain, and AXA Mexico, are also involved in philanthropy actions, promoting access to heritage and culture for all.\n\n## AXA RESEARCH FUND\n\nThe AXA Research Fund (AXARF), AXA's scientific philanthropy initiative, is committed to supporting science for societal progress. The Fund supports top-tier research projects and engages in dissemination e/ff orts based on science to better inform decisionmaking.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The selection of research projects is overseen by an independent Scientific Board and based on excellence and innovation.\n\nIn 2021, in the area of Climate and Environment, the AXA Chair on Wildfires and Climate at the Technical University of Crete (Greece) was selected for funding for a total of \u20ac1/uni00A0million over 5/uni00A0years. For the first/uni00A0year in 2021, in line with the Climate priority of the strategic plan 'Driving Progress 2023', the AXA Research fund organized the AXA Awards for Climate Science. The four supported researchers (\u20ac50,000/uni00A0each) are respectively working on advancing the understanding of climate evolution, informing the predictability of occurrence and impact of extreme weather events and climate justice. The AXA Research Fund also concluded a partnership with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to support 6/uni00A0PhD students working on climate science in countries in the Global South for a total amount of \u20ac200,000.\n\nIn the area of Health, the AXA Chair on Non-Communicable Diseases Epidemiology at the University of Cape Town (South Africa) was selected for a total of \u20ac1/uni00A0million over 5/uni00A0years. 10/uni00A0fellowships for young researchers working in the area of Harmful substances (\u20ac1.250/uni00A0million) were granted.\n\nBased on its strong research network, the AXARF carried out visible dissemination e/ff orts through continued media exposure of supported researchers. To better inform decision making, the publication 'Building cyber resilience' was released in fall 2021. It brings together perspectives from academics, business, and organizations on the changing dynamics of the cyber landscape, with a view towards the mitigation of the associated risks. Through AXARF webinars, publications, and articles with partners such as The Conversation, researchers from all fields were able to shed more light on issues such as climate change, mental health, women in business, explainable AI for healthcare, cyber security, and biodiversity conservation.\n\n## EMPLOYEE VOLUNTEERING\n\nAXA Hearts in Action is the international volunteering program for AXA employees. In this framework, employees carry out activities on themes aligned with the 2/uni00A0pillars of our sustainability strategy: Climate and Inclusive Protection. Since 2020, an international sponsorship Committee has been set up to anchor the program even more strongly in the entities.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis had, again in 2021, a significant impact on employee volunteering (fewer people on site, restrictions on the organization of face-to-face group events). However, AXA entities showed creativity and employees remained mobilized and donated their time to help the patients, healthcare workers and the most disadvantaged people through virtual operations. In 2021,\n\nI\n\nI\n\nclose to 19,000/uni00A0employees (estimated -/uni00A023,355/uni00A0in 2020) donated their time and skills. Contributing entities in 2021/uni00A0represent 99% of AXA average FTEs.\n\nIn 2021, AXA employees carried out a wide variety of activities (2,532/uni00A0in total) and performed 45,163/uni00A0volunteering acts ( versus 35,700/uni00A0in 2020). This raise in volunteering acts underlines the growing engagement of volunteers. Through the AXA Hearts in Action program, the Group seeks to promote all forms of employee engagement, particularly skills-based philanthropy. In 2021, AXA France continued to develop the 'AXA Comp\u00e9tence Solidaire' program: 140/uni00A0employees volunteered in partner associations ( versus 147/uni00A0in 2020).\n\nAXA employees volunteered for 268, 480/uni00A0hours during and outside working time ( versus 228,000/uni00A0hours in 2020), in support of solidarity projects.\n\nA large majority of volunteering hours are performed during working time, 167,238/uni00A0hours for 'AXA Comp\u00e9tence Solidaire' and 41, 813/uni00A0hours for the other activities for a total of 209,051/uni00A0hours ( versus 200,000/uni00A0in 2020).\n\nIn total, the salaries paid for the hours spent on volunteering missions during working hours represent the equivalent of a donation of \u20ac7.3/uni00A0million ( versus \u20ac6.9/uni00A0million in 2020).\n\nThis adds to the management overheads engaged to support the AXA Hearts in Action's activities in all entities for a total of \u20ac6.3/uni00A0million in 2021/uni00A0( versus \u20ac23.2/uni00A0million in 2020). In-kind donations are also provided to non-profits or NGOs for a total estimated amount of \u20ac1.1/uni00A0million in 2021/uni00A0( versus \u20ac3.2/uni00A0million in 2020) coming in addition to the Group \u20ac31.9/uni00A0million cash donation including AXA Research Fund and AXA Hearts in action.\n\nAXA Tianping (China)  also made a one-time in-kind donation in 2021/uni00A0by providing medical coverage to groups of vulnerable elderly people in the southern mountainous areas and Shandong province. The estimated value of this in-kind donation was \u20ac118.4/uni00A0million.\n\nCommunity investments represent the vast majority, 84%, of the AXA citizenship investments (volunteering hours, cash donations, in-kind donations), 14% are invested in charitable donations and 2% f for commercial initiatives ( versus respectively 60%, 38% and 2% i in 2020).\n\nFor more than 10/uni00A0years, AXA has been organizing the AXA Week for Good to highlight the community investment of its employees. During the 2021/uni00A0edition of the AXA Week for Good, 459/uni00A0activities were coordinated and a total of 11,055/uni00A0unique volunteers were mobilized across the Group. The Global Challenge organized by several entities and consisting in collecting trash in nature was carried out by approximately 3,500/uni00A0volunteers within the Group who collected 9,632/uni00A0trash bags in total.\n\nIn November/uni00A0 2021, AXA Hearts in Action celebrated its 30 th /uni00A0anniversary. At AXA France and in French entities, 862/uni00A0actions were organized throughout the/uni00A0year, including 97/uni00A0directly related to the 30 th /uni00A0anniversary, and 13,045/uni00A0volunteering acts were carried out.",

This commitment is designed to ensure compliance with laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where AXA operates, to earn the continued trust of our clients, shareholders, employees, and business partners, but also frequently extends beyond legal obligations on a range of topics about which AXA has strong convictions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## I Business ethics\n\n## COMPLIANCE &/uni00A0ETHICS CODE\n\nAXA's Group Compliance &/uni00A0Ethics Code seeks to establish Groupwide rules and guidelines to ensure that AXA Group companies and employees have a common understanding of the compliance and ethical standards the Group requires. The Code covers a variety of matters, including specific rules concerning conflicts of interest, anti-bribery and corruption, insider trading, management of confidential information,/uni00A0etc. The Code is available on the Group's website (www.axa.com/en/newsroom/publications/ compliance-ethics-guide). In 2019, AXA launched an updated version of the AXA Group Compliance &/uni00A0Ethics Code. The updated Code includes some subjects that have become increasingly important in recent/uni00A0years; these include Health &/uni00A0Safety at work, Protection and Responsible use of Customer Data, Engagement with Social Media, Prevention of Discrimination and Harassment, and Fair and Professional Treatment of customers. The content and style of the Code has also been revised to make it more accessible and easier to reference.\n\n## ANTI-BRIBERY &/uni00A0FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION\n\nTo prevent the risk of bribery and corruption, AXA Group has introduced a Group Anti-Bribery &/uni00A0Corruption Policy (ABC Policy) that establishes minimum standards for ABC that must be implemented by AXA entities. This policy has been regularly updated to take account of new regulations and most notably the French law known as 'Sapin/uni00A0II' n\u00b02016-1691 of December/uni00A09, 2016, on transparency and the fight against corruption in modern economic life. A Group Anti-Bribery o/ff icer oversees the global ABC program at Group level and controls its implementation across entities. AXA entities have designated local Anti-Bribery o/ff icers to implement their ABC programs in accordance with AXA's Standards.\n\nThe policies presented below cover the business behavior risks. The indicators associated with these 'Business Behavior' risks are explained in the following paragraphs.\n\nAXA Standards certification by entities' CEOs includes a Section on the framework 'anti-bribery and fight against corruption'. AXA's objective is to achieve a consistent anti-bribery and fight against corruption program across the Group's entities, including necessary requirements answering to International Standards (including Sapin/uni00A0II Law), and preventing corruption risks. Every/uni00A0year since 2018, 100% of CEOs within the scope of the AXA Standards certification process have certified their level of compliance with the anti-bribery &/uni00A0corruption part (in line with the 100% target).\n\n## BUSINESS CONDUCT\n\nThe Group's insurance, Asset Management and banking operations are subject to an increasing number of legislative and regulatory initiatives -/uni00A0in the European Union ( e.g., Insurance Distribution Directive, MiFID/uni00A0II, PRIIPs) but also in many other parts of the world -/uni00A0designed to increase customer protection in the financial services sector. AXA has taken significant actions to comply with these requirements in each of its businesses where such measures are in place and globally to spread and implement a customer protection culture across the Group. Moreover, AXA demonstrates strong commitment in its Compliance &/uni00A0Ethics Code binding for all its worldwide employees and subsidiaries to treat its customers fairly and professionally, by encouraging transparency or being honest and accountable when promoting products and services.\n\nAmong the most recent initiatives, a set of recommendations on key customer protection topics have been shared with a view of reinforcing uniformity of practices within the Group. The main objective is to continuously improve customer's consideration wherever they may be. These recommendations represent a support for the entities to apprehend subjects such as vulnerable customers, customer information, digitalization, and complaints handling. They guide each entity in implementing responsible practices based on transparency, honesty, and fairness for the customer.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThe compliance program of customer protection reviews in place for some/uni00A0years has continued. It consists of reviewing how the entities locally manage the customer protection topics and the processes in place, especially regarding customer information, sales practices, or salesforce training. These reviews, initially focused on most of the European entities, will be progressively extended to other entities on a risk-based approach.\n\nAnother key element concerns the well-established product governance process (Product Approval Process, 'PAP') in place to oversee the design, approval, and review of the products. The PAP is applicable to all entities of the AXA Group and focuses on the customer dimension, ensuring the product is built starting from the customers' needs and expectations, with a definition of the target market and selection of adequate distribution channels. This formal process also considers that all new products entering the scope of application of the PAP respect the principles of 'value for customer'. Every/uni00A0year since 2018, 100% of CEOs have certified on the compliance level of the Group entities in scope of the AXA Standards certification process (in line with the 100% target),\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\nwhich engaged them to conduct a PAP and all Life &/uni00A0Savings, Health and Property &/uni00A0Casualty products have been subject to the AXA's Product Approval Process.\n\nAXA's intention is to o/ff er its customers easy-to-understand products that meet their needs and expectations, a commitment that has been reinforced in 2021, notably with the update of the compliance check list to be carried out during any new product development. This step, which is part of the PAP governance process, already described below, aims to ensure that the products o/ff  ered meet customers' expectations, for example by analyzing that the products' characteristics are communicated to distributors beforehand in order to guarantee good customer information, or that training on products is regularly followed.\n\nIn addition, compliance risks, specifically business conduct risks, are assessed on an annual basis. The results and any necessary mitigation actions are developed and shared with senior management. Internal Control processes have been developed to ensure controls are e/ff ective and cover entities' own operations and those of proprietary sales channels.\n\n## Responsible data use and data privacy\n\nIn line with AXA's sustainability risk assessment, the Group has put in place various initiatives to promote the use of data to address societal challenges, as well as to ensure client data is protected, via a robust security strategy.\n\n## DATA PRIVACY\n\nAXA was the first insurance group to adopt privacy-related Binding Corporate Rules, approved by European data protection authorities, and constituting an internationally approved data privacy contractual framework for the treatment of customer, employee, and other stakeholder personal data. Entities that have joined Binding Corporate Rules represent 99% of AXA's revenues in 2021/uni00A0(also 99% in 2020/uni00A0and 79% in 2019, which is explained by the impact of AXA XL, whose integration into Binding Corporate Rules was not completed in 2019), in line with the 99% target. These rules and AXA's Data Privacy Declaration, whereby the Group undertakes not to sell personal data of its customers, are available on the AXA Group's website (https://www.axa.com/en/ about-us/cyber-data-privacy#tab=our-commitments).\n\nThe AXA Group implemented the General Data Protection Regulation and had in this respect delivered thirty projects\n\nI\n\nI\n\ndedicated to data privacy, involving over three hundred people in entities located in sixteen countries. The Group is also implementing similar regulations recently adopted in countries outside the European Union.\n\n## A SECURITY STRATEGY DESIGNED TO/uni00A0GUARANTEE THE PROTECTION OF DATA\n\nWith the massive digitization of society, cyber risk is considered today one of the top risks that citizens and companies must face.\n\nTo respond to this threat, and as a responsible insurer, AXA has developed a risk-based security strategy that strengthens our business resilience, transforming security from a necessity to an advantage for our entities. Security is managed holistically by the corporate function, Group Security. It gathers the 3/uni00A0security key disciplines: Information Security/Cyber Security, Operational Resilience and Physical Security &/uni00A0Safety.\n\nThis converged organization to manage security comes with an ambitious commitment to maintain AXA's most mature entities within the first quartile of the most secure companies in the financial industry.

In 2021, AXA implemented its new security strategy aimed at ensuring that the Group's most mature entities remain in the top quartile of most secure entities in our industry, while broadening scope execution to all the Group's other entities. This security strategy, called the 'One Security Strategy', uses a risk-based approach that ensures that we continuously consider and adapt to the evolution of risks and threats.\n\nThis robust security maturity level is also reached by the strong mobilization of AXA's employees that are considered as AXA's first line of defense against cyberattacks. Yearly security (including physical security, health &/uni00A0safety, operational resilience &/uni00A0information security), data protection and cybersecurity trainings are deployed across group. Thus, in 2021, 100% of salaried and non-salaried employees have been trained and certified.\n\n## RESPONSIBLE USAGE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n\nIn terms of governance, in 2021, AXA set up a Responsible Artificial Intelligence Committee that aims to cover the issues of applying trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the Group.

This cooperation helps build sustainable e/ff orts on implementing new internal and operational guidelines covering the responsible usage of machine learning and AI.\n\nWithin the French association Impact AI, AXA is leading the Impact AI's Responsible AI Committee in charge of analyzing the perception of AI and the development of a 'trusted AI', producing white papers on the topic, along with other members (industrial partners, consulting, and tech companies).\n\nIn addition, AXA leads research on Responsible AI principles. Both fundamental and applied research on Responsible AI principles (fairness, explainability, robustness) are developed to investigate technical solutions useful across the di/ff erent segments of the insurance value chain. These e/ff orts are testimony to AXA's business transformation regarding the development and adoption of AI solutions in line with the Group responsible data and AI policy.\n\n4",

These common measures do not prevent, nor restrict AXA from voluntarily taking additional actions in relation to such matters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## Identification and evaluation of risks to human rights and the environment\n\nTo ensure that each potential risk identified is covered by a Group policy, AXA conducted an assessment of how the AXA Group's activities and operations may potentially impact the environment and each of the human rights.\n\nThe work carried out by AXA to establish its mapping of sustainability risks, as well as the main non-financial risks identified by the Group is presented in Section/uni00A04.1/uni00A0'AXA Sustainability strategy -/uni00A0Sustainability Risk Assessment' of this Annual Report.\n\n## HUMAN RIGHTS\n\nThe AXA Group considers that its activities and internal operations could have potential direct and indirect impacts on the human rights of its employees, customers and suppliers, as well as potential indirect impacts on the human rights of other persons through the Group's relations with corporate customers or investments in companies, which are active in sectors and/or countries with increased risks of human rights violations.\n\nThe AXA Group regularly, and at least every three/uni00A0years, conducts a human rights risk assessment which aims to identify the most relevant risks to human rights that the AXA Group should consider in conducting its business (acting both as an insurer and as an investor) and its internal operations. The most recent study was carried out in 2020, with the help of an independent firm. It identified risks in areas such as the right to free movement, equality before the law and non-discrimination (with respect to minorities), freedom from all forms of forced or compulsory labour, right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion, opinion, information and expression and the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining. This assessment ('AXA 2020/uni00A0Report Human Rights Risk Assessment') which includes the mapping of the risks identified and the measures taken to limit their impact, is available on the AXA Group's website (www.axa.com/en/about-us/ our-commitment-to-human- rights).

As an insurance company, AXA's direct environmental footprint is essentially related to the operation of o/ff ices and IT materials, business travels, water, electricity, paper consumption and other staple consumer products and generation of waste. The global environment footprint of the AXA Group is thus largely based on its indirect environmental footprint, including its investments and underwriting activities, as indicated herea/f\\_t er.\n\nAXA's direct environmental reporting and management processes focus on energy, water and paper consumption, as well as related CO2/uni00A0emissions. AXA's direct environmental reporting process, which is verified by an independent third-party, allows AXA to/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0evaluate its impact on the environment every/uni00A0year and (ii)/uni00A0identify the risks stemming from its internal operations for the environment.

In particular, AXA implemented an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risk assessment process for its suppliers, that are identified using an internal risk categorization grid. This assessment is carried out based on procurement categories in light of five criteria:\n\n- /uni25A0 e nvironmental;\n- /uni25A0 s ocial;\n- /uni25A0 impact on products and services;\n- /uni25A0 suppliers' supply chain; and\n- /uni25A0 business integrity.\n\nEach/uni00A0year, suppliers in the procurement categories with the highest levels of ESG risk are invited to share their EcoVadis scores.\n\n## As an insurer and as an investor\n\nThe AXA Group seeks to prevent or mitigate adverse impacts on the environment that arise from its investment and underwriting activities by applying its analytical framework to identify potential indirect impacts on the environment and incorporating ESG criteria into its business processes as well as into its investment strategy, as presented in the Section 'Protection of human rights and environment' that follows.\n\n## Protection of Human Rights and Environment\n\n## PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY\n\nAXA's human rights policy, available on the AXA Group's website (www.axa.com/en/about-us/our-commitment-to-humanrights), aims at preventing the violation of human rights in relation to the Group's activities and internal operations and reflects AXA's commitment to international general and sectorspecific standards.

Such guidelines define the exclusion, among the Group's insurance activities, of certain socially or environmentally sensitive sectors or practices (which can be directly or indirectly related to human rights) and with increased risks, such as controversial weapons industries. Insurance restrictions are detailed in Section/uni00A04.3/uni00A0'Climate Change and ESG integration -Insurance -/uni00A0Underwriting Restrictions' of this Annual Report.\n\nAXA further seeks to support its customers' rights while preventing or mitigating adverse human rights impacts that may arise from the provision of insurance products and services to corporate customers, in particular by:\n\n- /uni25A0 ensuring fair treatment of all customers;\n- /uni25A0 o/ff  ering products designed to meet the needs and expectations of its customers;\n- /uni25A0 designing products and services to meet the needs of vulnerable populations, in order to reduce coverage disparities, close a protection gap and empower insured people to achieve positive outcomes with regard to health and safety. As an example, the 'Women in Insurance' initiative, presented in Section/uni00A04.4/uni00A0'Inclusive Insurer -/uni00A0Business-r elated s ocietal c hallenges -/uni00A0Women and Insurance' of this Annual Report, aims to increase women's access to insurance products and services.

Some of AXA's carbon emissions reduction targets for 2019-2025/uni00A0are based on an approach promoted by the 'Science Based Targets' initiative. Please refer to Section/uni00A04.3/uni00A0'Climate Change and ESG Integration -/uni00A0Own operations' impact on climate change' of this Annual Report for further details on AXA policies for the reduction of carbon emissions.\n\nCertain buildings occupied by AXA benefit from environmental certificates such as BREEAM, LEED and HQE.

These sector specific policies cover human rights and environmental concerns ( e.g., oil &/uni00A0gas) and are subject to an annual certification process carried out by entities of the Group;\n- /uni25A0 committing to align its investments and its underwriting activities with the Paris Agreement, to reach a 'warming potential' of +1.5\u00b0C by 2050.\n\nAXA also supports initiatives related to climate change and environmental protection, as detailed in Section/uni00A04.3/uni00A0'Climate Change and ESG Integration -/uni00A0Climate, Biodiversity and ESGrelated 'o utreach' and/uni00A0e ngagement' of this Annual Report. In addition, as stated above for the protection of human rights (please refer to the paragraph 'Protection of Human Rights and Environment -/uni00A0Protection of Human Rights and Human Rights policy  -/uni00A0Integration  of h uman r ights into i nvestments' in this Section), AXA has implemented a Responsible Investment Policy and an analytical framework to identify potential indirect environmental impacts. The ESG assessment is used to give a score to the companies in which AXA has invested, or contemplates making an investment. The list of criteria and sectoral weighting matrix that apply to the various ESG sub-criteria are regularly reviewed for a better grasp of the most significant issues for each sector. AXA applies a minimum threshold below which companies are excluded from its contemplated investments. This assessment is updated by AXA every six months.\n\nThe Group's Responsible Investment Policy is available on the AXA Group's website (www.axa.com/en/about-us/responsibleinvestment).\n\nPlease refer to Section/uni00A04.3/uni00A0'Climate change and ESG Integration' of this Annual Report for further details on AXA's strategy, policy, targets and results with respect to environmental protection.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

Alerts can be submitted within the relevant entity or sent directly to the Group using a dedicated email address (speak-up@axa.com) allowing alerts from all geographical areas where the Group conducts business, without restrictions and irrespective of the stakeholders.\n\nThe AXA Group examines all alerts received with the objective of ensuring an adequate response (intervention by adequate actors, deployment of immediate corrective actions and/or precautionary measures, investigations/uni00A0etc.). Alerts are handled in accordance with a strict, independent process that includes key stakeholders in the vigilance plan where relevant. The identity of the author of such alert is treated in a confidential manner and cannot be disclosed without his/her consent (except to judicial authorities).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\nAXA has expressly stated that there will be no act of retaliation against anyone who reports actual or suspected misconduct in good faith, or who participated in establishing the facts confirming a misconduct by providing evidence.\n\nFurthermore, all AXA Group companies are required to define internal regulations and other policies governing whistleblowing pursuant to local laws and regulations. In 2019, a global communication campaign named 'Speak-up', was launched to refresh employee awareness of both the local and Group alert procedures. The purpose of the campaign was to strengthen, increase consistency of, and simplify the process across the Group. Various media were used to broadcast this campaign, thus increasing its impact and making it available to all, including through newsletters, screen savers, videos, training, formal presentation,/uni00A0etc.\n\n## Follow-up and report on the e/ff ective implementation of the vigilance plan\n\nIn 2021, the AXA Group ensured the e/ff ective implementation of all policies and procedures described in the vigilance plan through the involvement of/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0central teams from the Sustainability, Procurement, Legal, Compliance, Risk Management and Human Resources Departments and (ii)/uni00A0a network of local correspondents.\n\n## REPORTING PROCESS\n\nIn 2021, the Group continued its e/ff orts to raise awareness on the vigilance plan amongst its entities. Awareness sessions were organized in order to remind entities of the duty of care (devoir de vigilance) regulation, as well as the penalties applicable in the event of non-compliance with legal obligations. Correspondents of the Procurement network attended these sessions in 2021.\n\nIn addition, AXA relies on a reporting process for Group entities which is based on pre-existing procedures and monitoring tools and, in particular, on an internal review conducted by the\n\nI\n\nI\n\nSustainability Department. Each/uni00A0year, the principal operating entities are asked to conduct an internal risk assessment to identify any gaps with the vigilance plan.\n\nFollowing the assessment conducted in 2021, gaps were identified and the relevant entities shall implement remedial action plans, including the following:\n\n- /uni25A0 the inclusion of the corporate responsibility clause that was reviewed by the Group at the end of 2019/uni00A0in procurement contracts;\n- /uni25A0 the strengthening of supplier monitoring in high ESG risk categories through EcoVadis;\n- /uni25A0 the raising of human rights awareness among employees, such as the inclusion of people with temporary or permanent disabilities; and\n- /uni25A0 the adjustment of local alert procedures to cover matters related to human rights and the environment.",

        "page_content": "## RESPONSIBLE PURCHASING BUSINESS\n\nTranslating AXA's Sustainability strategy and commitments into its management of suppliers is a continuous activity for AXA. This alignment means that AXA integrates sustainability considerations to select and monitor its suppliers. This approach is articulated around two axes:\n\n- /uni25A0 R esponsible people &/uni00A0processes: all the AXA Group professionals working in a procurement department must sign the Group's Code of Professional Conduct but also a dedicated and reinforced Code of Ethics, which promotes fairness and neutrality, confidentiality and transparency of sourcing decisions. The professionals are also trained to the AXA Sustainability strategy and the AXA Responsible Procurement policy through awareness sessions given by the network of Responsible Procurement identified in our various entities.\n\n## /uni25A0 R esponsible  vendors:\n\n- \u00b7 A n ESG criteria' grid was shared during the first half of 2021/uni00A0across the Procurement teams and integrated into the Group's calls for tenders. Criteria may vary according to the category of purchases. As an example, they may involve the EcoVadis rating, the carbon emissions of suppliers' products and services, and their responsible procurement policy. Since January/uni00A02022, the number of tenders including ESG criteria is tracked by the Procurement teams.\n- \u00b7 AXA requires from its vendors to include a 'corporate responsibility clause', which is mandatory in its contracts. It includes, in particular, complying with the principles of the ILO (prohibiting the use of child/forced labour, promoting employee health &/uni00A0safety and freedom of expression, and nondiscrimination). 96.8% of the procurement contracts entered or renewed in 2021/uni00A0included this corporate responsibility clause ( versus 96.6% in 2020).\n- \u00b7 AXA implemented an assessment of the extra-financial risks of its suppliers, identified thanks to an internal Risk Matrix by procurement category (please refer to section 'Vigilance Plan -/uni00A0Identification and Evaluation of Risks to Human Rights and the Environment -/uni00A0Environment -/uni00A0As a Responsible Business Partner' above ). 72.5% of the vendors evaluated in 2021/uni00A0shared a Bronze or higher EcoVadis scoring ( versus 67.2% in 2020).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 A ware of the carbon emissions' impact from its activities, the Group is working to implement best practices to be in line with its objective to reduce carbon emissions by 20% by 2025. AXA has therefore implemented locally new sustainable ways of buying, e.g. greening of car fleets, purchases of green energy on o/ff ices and data centres, deployment of new measures for IT purchases ( e.g. , by asking 10 of its key providers to communicate their services and products' carbon footprint link to AXA's purchases). All these best practices applied locally are shared by the Responsible Procurement community in order to promote a wider deployment.\n\nDetailed information on AXA's Responsible Procurement policy and AXA standards regarding procurement is provided in AXA's Group Procurement Guidelines. The document is used for supplier selection and management purposes.\n\nSince 2018, AXA uses a dedicated Vendor Risk program to reinforce its operational control and Risk Management of third parties. Please refer to Section/uni00A05.7/uni00A0'Operational Risk' of this Annual Report for further information on this program.\n\nThe AXA Group is pursuing its commitment in implementing these same principles and received a 'Platinum' score in its latest EcoVadis evaluation.\n\n## INVOLVEMENT OF AXA STAKEHOLDERS\n\nIn line with its strong culture of dialogue, AXA has regular discussions with its various stakeholders at di/ff erent levels. Please refer to Section/uni00A04.1/uni00A0'AXA Sustainability Strategy -/uni00A0Sustainability Governance &/uni00A0Stakeholder Dialogue' of this Annual Report for further details about the stakeholder dialogue initiated by AXA.\n\nIn order to maintain e/ff ective communication between employees and management as well as a constructive social dialogue, the vigilance plan was presented on several occasions to employee representatives. Through discussions with the Group's French employee representatives and more particularly with the Social Committee of the French Group's Works Council, certain provisions of the vigilance plan have been placed at the core of the employeremployee dialogue.\n\nThe AXA Group strives to strengthen the communication of its vigilance plan to all of it stakeholders, in particular by making it available on AXA's website (www.axa.com/en/about-us/ourcommitment-to-human-rights).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

Any of these risks could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline materially or our actual results to di/ff er materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.\n\nThis section presents the significant risks specific to the Group to which we believe it is exposed as of the filing date of this Annual Report with the AMF. The risks described below are not the only risks the Group faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, not specific to the Group or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely a/ff ect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. These include but are not limited to persisting material uncertainties relating to the COVID-19 crisis, which may adversely impact the Group during 2022/uni00A0and future periods. Risks relating to the COVID-19 crisis are presented herein based on currently available information and are subject to a constantly evolving context. Finally, we may change our perception of the impact of one or more risks on the Group at any time, particularly in the event of one or more new internal and/or external developments.\n\nThe Company's r isk m anagement processes, procedures and controls are described in Section/uni00A05.2/uni00A0'Internal control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report, which should be read in conjunction with this Section/uni00A05.1. While M anagement devotes very substantial resources to r isk m anagement on an ongoing basis, the Group's r isk m anagement activities, like all control systems, are subject to inherent limitations and cannot provide absolute assurance or render the Group immune in any respect from the risks described in this Part/uni00A05/uni00A0or the losses that may be incurred in connection with these risks.\n\nWhere the risks described in this Section/uni00A05.1/uni00A0have given rise to quantifiable and material financial impacts and/or material contingent liabilities, those financial impacts and/or contingent liabilities are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements,\n\nI\n\nI\n\nin accordance with applicable accounting principles. You should also refer to Section/uni00A05.3/uni00A0 et seq . of this Annual Report for quantitative information on the material risks to which the Group is exposed. For the avoidance of doubt, references to 'insurance', 'reinsurance', 'Property &/uni00A0Casualty' and 'Life &/uni00A0Savings' in this Section also refer to 'Health' activities as appropriate.\n\nIn presenting the risks set forth in this Section/uni00A05.1, M anagement has identified the primary categories of risk and the most material risks in a manner that corresponds to management's current view as to the materiality of such risk factors for the AXA Group, based on the perceived likelihood of the occurrence of such risks and the expected magnitude of their negative impact. As more fully described below, such categories include marketrelated risks, credit- and liquidity-related risks, insurance and reinsurance pricing and underwriting-related risks, operational risks, regulatory-related risks and risks related to the ownership of the Company's shares. Further, there can be no assurance that M anagement's assessment of the relative importance of such risk factors may not change over time, whether to reflect new information, events, circumstances or otherwise.\n\nAs discussed in Section/uni00A02.1/uni00A0 'Operating highlights' of this Annual Report, AXA/uni00A0SA intends to transform into the Group's internal reinsurer while remaining the holding company of the Group (the 'Internal Reinsurance Transformation'). AXA/uni00A0SA has therefore applied to obtain a reinsurance license from the ACPR. The Internal Reinsurance Transformation is subject to the prior approval of AXA/uni00A0SA's shareholders, expected to be sought at the Shareholders' Meeting on April/uni00A028, 2022, in connection with the necessary changes to AXA/uni00A0SA's b ylaws. Upon receipt of the reinsurance license, AXA/uni00A0SA would become a licensed reinsurance company subject to the applicable ACPR regulations governing reinsurance entities and activities, and would enter into annually renewable 25% quota share reinsurance treaties with certain of AXA's European Property &/uni00A0Casualty carriers. As part of the Internal Reinsurance Transformation, AXA Global Re, the Group's existing internal reinsurance entity, would also be merged with and into AXA/uni00A0SA, with AXA/uni00A0SA as the surviving entity.",

For additional information on the sensitivity of our Solvency/uni00A0II ratio to capital market conditions, please refer to the AXA Group's SFCR, available on AXA's website (www.axa.com)/uni00A0 (1) .\n\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing governmental measures implemented to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and address the resulting health crisis caused significant disruption to economies around the world, resulting in a severe global recession and significant volatility in financial markets. In 2021, volatility in financial markets remained significant, despite a rebound of the economic conditions, due to the mutations of the/uni00A0SARS-CoV-2/uni00A0virus (the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic) and the emergence of CoV-2/uni00A0variants of concern.\n\nA wide variety of other factors have adversely affected, and could negatively impact in the future, economic growth prospects and contribute to high levels of volatility in financial markets. These factors include, among others, concerns over a persistent slowdown or reversal in economic growth and levels of consumer confidence generally; current market conditions, including asset valuations and volatility, that may lead to an abrupt and significant repricing in financial markets; the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies (in particular the US Dollar) against the Euro; the availability and cost of credit; the stability and solvency of certain financial institutions and other companies, including related systemic credit risk concerns; rising trade tensions, 'trade wars', and other governmental measures, either enacted or being contemplated relating to tari/ff  s or international trade agreements and policies; continuing concerns over certain sovereign debt issuers; inflation or deflation in certain markets; central bank intervention in the financial markets, through quantitative easing or similar programs (such as the European Central Bank's \u20ac1,850/uni00A0billion Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program) or the winding-down or cessation of such programs; disruptions in the global supply chain; changes in reference rates, including reforms to and potential changes a/ff ecting LIBOR, EURIBOR, and other indices;\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\nvolatile energy costs; adverse geopolitical events (including acts of terrorism or military conflicts) and rising geopolitical tensions in various regions, including Russia, Ukraine, Latin America, Libya, Syria, Iraq, North Korea or Afghanistan; the imposition, or significant enhancement, of international sanctions against certain countries (in particular, Russia) and connected entities, and recent or future developments, such as the 2022/uni00A0presidential and legislative elections in France.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis began in 2020, but its consequences and impacts are ongoing. The related governmental measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 and to address the resulting crisis have increased the probability and magnitude of marketrelated risks posed by the aforementioned factors. In 2020, the spread of COVID-19 led governmental authorities around the world to impose quarantines and lockdown measures, business restrictions, travel limitations and other social-distancing measures of varying scope, and led to major disruptions in global trade and supply chains more broadly, which significantly reduced economic activity. These measures have been progressively eased following the availability of the first COVID-19 vaccines, which notably first became available in France in January/uni00A02021. While the COVID-19 crisis has had and will most likely continue to have an adverse effect on financial markets and global economic conditions, significant uncertainties as to the duration and extent of the pandemic make its overall impact di/ff icult to predict, both at local and global levels. The extent to which the economic consequences of the COVID-19 crisis will continue to a/ff ect the Group's results of operations and financial condition will depend on a number of factors, including the suitability and e/ff  ectiveness of mitigating and support measures introduced, in particular, by governments ( e.g., government-guaranteed loan facility programs, tax deferrals, facilitated recourse to part-time working) and central banks, as well as the timing and e/ff icacy of COVID-related vaccination programs.\n\nIn addition, specific concerns regarding the Eurozone, including the financial condition of certain EU sovereign debt issuers, uncertainty regarding membership in the European Union, relationships between European institutions and certain Member States, potential structural reforms or other changes made to the Euro, the Eurozone or the European Union, have resulted in significant disruptions in financial markets in recent/uni00A0years and could have similar e/ff ects in the future. In particular, the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union in accordance with Article/uni00A050 of the Treaty on European Union ('Brexit'), which became e/ff ective on January/uni00A01, 2021, and the resulting negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union to reach a withdrawal agreement, which entered into force on January/uni00A031, 2020, have materially\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

The ongoing negotiations around access to financial markets and cross-border financial services, among other things, could have unpredictable e/ff ects on financial markets and/or adversely impact firms providing cross-border financial services. There can be no assurance that Brexit and its related consequences will not have an adverse e/ff ect on the Group's business and financial condition.\n\nThese factors and others have had and will likely continue to have an adverse e/ff ect on our revenues and results of operations, in part because we have a large investment portfolio. Our investment income is an important part of our profitability, and our sales of insurance and Asset Management products (as well as the level of product surrenders and lapses) are dependent upon financial markets performance, customer behavior and confidence as well as other related factors. Our ability to make a profit on insurance and investment products, for example, depends in part on the returns on investments supporting our obligations under those products, and the value of specific investments may fluctuate substantially depending on the foregoing conditions. In addition, certain types of insurance and investment products that we o/ff er expose us to risks associated with fluctuations in financial markets, including certain types of interest-sensitive or variable products such as guaranteed annuities or variable annuities, which have crediting or other guaranteed rates or guaranteed minimum benefits not necessarily related to prevailing market interest rates or investment returns on underlying assets. Although we use hedging techniques to help mitigate our exposure under certain of these guarantees, not all risks can be e/ff ectively hedged against and volatility in the financial markets, combined with unanticipated policyholder behavior and uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 crisis, may increase our cost of risk and/or negatively a/ff ect our ability to hedge against certain of these risks, which may in turn adversely a/ff  ect our profitability.\n\nMore generally, to the extent the economic environment in the jurisdictions in which we do business may become characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for our financial and insurance products could be adversely a/ff ected. In addition, in such circumstances, we may experience an elevated incidence of lapses or surrenders on certain types of policies or funds, lower surrender rates than anticipated on other types of products, and our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. As an insurance undertaking, the Group is exposed to inflation risk, which could have a negative impact on our cost base overall and, particularly in our Property &/uni00A0Casualty business, on our claims experience, reserves and our profitability (based on the lag in repricing). In addition, governments, supervisors, regulators and courts may\n\nI\n\nI\n\nadopt policyholder-favorable stances to ensure the a/ff ordability of coverage for policyholders, which may negatively impact our financial condition. The probability and magnitude of these risks increased due to the sharp contraction in global economic activity caused by the COVID-19 crisis. These developments could accordingly have a material adverse e/ff ect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Changes in interest rates and credit spreads may adversely a/ff  ect our business, results of operations, solvency and financial condition\n\nOur exposure to interest-rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may negatively a/ff ect the value of our assets (particularly fixed-income investments) and our ability to realize gains or avoid losses from the sale of those assets, all of which also ultimately a/ff ect earnings. In particular, negative interest rates and low levels of interest rates generally, such as those experienced in recent/uni00A0years, have impacted and may continue to negatively impact our net interest income and the profitability of our Life &/uni00A0Savings business, especially as the impact of the COVID-19 crisis and related governmental measures, has generally resulted in extending this downward trend in interest rates, through United States, European Union and other central bank actions.\n\nIn-force l ife insurance and annuity products may become comparatively more attractive to customers in a declining interest-rate environment, resulting in an increase in our liabilities (in particular in relation to flexible-premium products), assetliability duration mismatches (as more policies and contracts remain in-force from/uni00A0year-to-year) and an increase in provisions for guarantees included in l ife insurance and annuity products.\n\nAccordingly, during a period of declining interest rates or a prolonged period of low interest rates, our profitability may su/ff er as the result of a decrease in the spread between interest rates credited to insurance policyholders and annuity contract owners and the rates we are able to earn on our fixed-income investment portfolio. In addition, certain regulatory capital and reserve requirements are based on formulas and models that consider interest rates, such as the Group's Internal Model, and an extended period of low interest rates may increase the regulatory capital we are required to hold and the amount of assets we must maintain to support our reserves, while decreasing the amount of our Eligible Own Funds (EOF), which could have an adverse impact on our Solvency/uni00A0II ratio.\n\nConversely, in periods of increasing interest rates, the estimated fair value of certain of our fixed-income investments may decrease, which could negatively impact our Solvency/uni00A0II ratio and net income; surrenders of life i nsurance policies and fixed annuity contracts may accelerate, as policyholders seek higher",

        "page_content": "returns, which may cause us to accelerate amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs or to liquidate fixed maturity investments in order to obtain liquidity to satisfy such obligations, which may result in realized investment losses. Similarly, our fee income may decrease due to a decline in the value of our asset managers' fixed-income assets under management and u nitl inked reserves, which could result in lower management fees and have an adverse impact on Asset Management net inflows. In addition, we may be required, as an issuer of securities, to pay higher interest rates on debt securities, debt and bank facilities, which may increase our interest expenses.\n\nFor a description of the sensitivity of our EOF to changes in interest rates, please refer to Section/uni00A06.6/uni00A0-/uni00A0Note/uni00A04.2/uni00A0'Market risks (including sensitivity analysis)' of this Annual Report. For additional information on the sensitivity of our Solvency/uni00A0II ratio to financial shocks on interest rates, please refer to the AXA Group's SFCR, available on AXA's website (www.axa.com)/uni00A0 (1) .\n\nOur exposure to changes in credit spreads primarily relates to the impact of such changes on market prices and cash flow variability. A widening of credit spreads will generally reduce the value of fixed-income securities we hold (including credit derivatives where we assume credit exposure) and increase our investment income associated with purchases of new fixed-income securities in our investment portfolios; and, as an issuer of fixed-income securities, we may face increased interest expenses. Conversely, credit spread tightening will generally increase the value of fixed-income securities we hold and reduce our investment income associated with new purchases of fixedincome securities in our investment portfolios. For additional information on the sensitivity of our Solvency/uni00A0II ratio to financial shocks on corporate bond spreads, please refer to the AXA Group's SFCR, available on AXA's website (www.axa.com)/uni00A0 (1) .\n\nAlthough we take measures, including hedging through derivative instruments, to manage the economic risks of investing in a changing interest-rate environment, we may not be able to mitigate the interest rate risk of our assets relative to our liabilities. Accordingly, ongoing volatility in interest rates and credit spreads, individually or in tandem with other factors, could have a material adverse e/ff ect on our solvency position, and on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows through realized losses, impairments, and changes in unrealized gains and loss positions.\n\n## Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly a/ff  ect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and solvency\n\nDue to the geographical diversity of our business and notably the fact that significant subsidiaries of the Group are located in the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Japan and Hong Kong, we are exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations since a significant portion of our shareholdings and investments, revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than Euro, while our Consolidated Financial Statements are established in Euro. Likewise, the part of our debt and other obligations (including certain reinsurance treaties and retrocession agreements to which we are a party) denominated in currencies other than Euro is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nEquity of Group entities is expressed primarily in Euro, US Dollar, British Pound Sterling, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen and Hong Kong Dollar. Fluctuations in the exchange rates used to convert foreign currencies into Euro, and in particular, fluctuations in US Dollar against the Euro, have had, and may have in the future, a negative impact on the S hareholders' equity Group share and Underlying earnings Group share. We have not implemented a policy of fully hedging the changes in the value of the equity of our subsidiaries with equity denominated in foreign currencies. For more information about the impact of the fluctuations in the exchange rates of US Dollar, British Pound Sterling, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen and Hong Kong Dollar into Euro, please refer to Section/uni00A05.3/uni00A0'Market Risks' of this Annual Report.\n\nSimilarly, fluctuations in exchange rates may have an impact on the Group's net income as a result of the translation of foreign currency transactions, the settlement of foreign currency balances and discrepancies between foreign currency liabilities and assets. In this case, and in order to reduce the impact of such discrepancies, the Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge against foreign exchange risk for the most sensitive currencies, particularly during periods of significant market volatility. For more information about the main hedging positions of AXA/uni00A0SA with respect to foreign currencies, please refer to Section/uni00A05.3/uni00A0'Market Risks' of this Annual Report.\n\nWhile we seek to manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations through hedging, fluctuations in exchange rates may have a significant impact on our Euro-denominated results of operations, cash flows, gearing ratio, shareholders' equity and solvency. In addition, the currency hedges we use to manage foreign exchange rate risk may in themselves impact our cash and liquidity position.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

Increases in inflation could also have an impact on the creditworthiness of bond issuers and could result in an increase in credit spreads (please refer to the paragraph above 'Changes in interest rates and credit spreads could have a material adverse e/ff ect on our business, results of operations, solvency and financial condition'). All of these factors could lead to a decline in the value of the bonds we hold, which could have an adverse e/ff ect on the profitability of our investment portfolio and on our revenues. Depending on the relevant macroeconomic context, increases in inflation could also have a negative impact on risk premiums and share prices, which could result in a decline in the market value of the Group's equity portfolio.\n\nInflation in the costs of claims, labor costs, cost of energy and raw materials, medical costs, construction costs and tort issues and/ or inflation due to disruptions in the global supply chain impact the Property &/uni00A0Casualty industry. The impact of inflation on claim costs could be more pronounced for certain of our claims that are indexed to inflation and those Property &/uni00A0Casualty lines of business that are considered 'long tail', such as general liability, Workers' Compensation and professional Liability, and other specialty lines of our AXA XL business, as they require a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given accident/uni00A0year. In addition, lags in re-pricing in our Property &/uni00A0Casualty business, when combined with inflation, could reduce our profitability. Inflation driven in the short term by supply chain disruptions and shortages a/ff ecting raw materials and goods may negatively impact the results of our operations, especially for our short-tail lines of business. Changes in the level of inflation could also result in an increased level of uncertainty in our estimation of claims reserves, particularly for long tail lines of business, which could have a significant adverse e/ff ect on our solvency, results, financial position or cash flows.\n\nA significant decline in the market value of the Group's asset portfolio and an increase in the costs of claims could also lead to a decrease in the Group's shareholders' equity.\n\nWhile inflation risk increased in 2021, in particular in the United States and to a lesser extent in Europe, we are also exposed to\n\nI\n\nI\n\ndeflation risk, which materialized in the Eurozone in recent/uni00A0years and, in particular, during the fourth quarter of 2020. Deflation may erode collateral values and diminish the quality of certain investment assets, and may negatively impact customer behavior or otherwise negatively affect our business and results of operations.\n\n## Adverse business and market conditions, as well as accounting rules, may impact the/uni00A0recoverability of goodwill, amortization of intangibles and/or reduce deferred tax assets and deferred policyholders' participation assets, which could materially a/ff ect our results of operations and/uni00A0financial position\n\nBusiness and market conditions as well as accounting rules may impact the amount of goodwill we carry in our consolidated balance sheet, our pattern of Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC), Value of Business In-Force (VBI) and other intangible assets amortization, and the value of our deferred tax assets and deferred participation assets. The value of certain of our businesses is significantly impacted by such factors as the state of the financial markets, particularly equity markets, and ongoing operating performance.\n\n## Adverse experience relative to the/uni00A0methodologies, estimations and assumptions used by M anagement in valuing investments and determining allowances and impairments may materially adversely a/ff ect our results of operations\n\nCertain of our invested assets, for which there is no active trading market or other observable market data, are valued using models and methodologies that involve estimates, assumptions and significant M anagement judgment. During periods of market disruption, a larger portion of our investment assets may be valued using these models and methodologies as a result of less frequent trading or less observable market data with respect to certain asset classes that were previously actively traded in liquid markets. There can be no assurance that our valuations on the basis of these models and methodologies represent, for example, the price for which a security may ultimately be sold or sold at any specific point in time. In addition, the valuations of certain assets may be adversely a/ff ected by external factors and developments that were not systematically taken into account in earlier models and methodologies, such as climate-related transition risks, which may cause the market and prices for certain investments with a high carbon footprint (also known as 'stranded assets'), to decrease over time.

The choice of models, methodologies and/ or assumptions may have a material impact on the estimated fair value amounts and could have a material adverse e/ff ect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe determination of the amount of allowances and impairments that we recognize with respect to the invested assets we hold varies by investment type, and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. In considering impairments, M  anagement considers a wide range of factors, including those described in Section/uni00A06.6/uni00A0-/uni00A0Note/uni00A01.8.2/uni00A0'Financial instruments classification' of this Annual Report, and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the investment assets and the prospects for near-term recovery. For certain asset classes, particularly debt instruments, M anag ement's evaluation involves a variety of assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer of the instrument and its future earnings potential. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in allowances and impairments as such evaluations are revised. There can be no assurance, however, that M anagement has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken and allowances reflected in our financial statements, especially in light of uncertainties surrounding the impacts of systemic risks, such as those relating to the COVID-19 crisis, and the need for and timing of any additional impairments and/or allowances may have a material adverse e/ff ect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY-RELATED RISKS\n\n## Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly a/ff  ect our ability to meet liquidity needs, our access to capital and increase our cost of capital\n\nIn recent/uni00A0years, the capital and credit markets have at times experienced high levels of volatility and disruption which, during certain periods, have significantly limited the availability of additional liquidity in the markets and credit capacity for most issuers, including the AXA Group. For more information about the contractual maturities of debt instruments held by the Group, please refer to Section/uni00A06.6/uni00A0-/uni00A0Note/uni00A09.5/uni00A0'Contractual maturities of debt instruments and loans and exposure to interest rate risk' of this Annual Report.\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\nWe need liquidity to pay our operating expenses (including claims and surrenders), dividends and interests on our debts and to refinance certain maturing debts and other liabilities. In addition, we need liquidity in connection with derivatives transactions to which we are party which require us to transfer cash collateral and/or subject us to margin calls in certain circumstances. The availability of additional financing to supplement internal liquidity resources will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long-term or short-term financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn. While M anagement has put in place a liquidity r isk m anagement framework that includes active monitoring of the Group's liquidity position and contingency plans for accessing liquidity, liquidity constraints over a prolonged period may have a material adverse e/ff ect on our business, results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\n\n## Downgrades in our insurer and reinsurer financial strength and credit ratings could adversely impact our competitive position and damage our relationships with creditors or trading counterparties\n\nInsurer (and reinsurer) financial strength and credit ratings are important factors used by the market and customers in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies and in assessing our claims-paying ability. Rating agencies review their ratings and rating criteria and methodologies on a recurring basis, and they may change or withdraw their ratings at any time, based on relevant factors that may not be entirely within our control and/or a/ff ect the insurance and reinsurance industry generally. In particular, several credit rating agencies have recently indicated that the global economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 crisis had led to a risk of a ratings downgrade for the insurance and the reinsurance sector. Consequently, our current ratings may not be maintained in the future and no undue reliance should be placed on such ratings, which should not be considered as recommendations to purchase, sell or hold any securities we have issued.\n\nA downgrade or the potential for a downgrade in our ratings could have an adverse e/ff ect on us, including/uni00A0(i) damaging our competitive position, (ii) negatively impacting our ability to underwrite new insurance policies, (iii) increasing the levels of surrenders and termination rates of our in-force policies, (iv) increasing our reinsurance costs, (v) triggering termination\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

Such third parties include private sector and government (or governmentbacked) issuers whose securities we hold in our investment portfolios  (including  mortgage-backed,  asset-backed, government bonds and other types of securities), borrowers under mortgages and other loans that we extend, reinsurers and capital market counterparties to which we have ceded (directly or indirectly) our insurance risks, customers, ceding companies, service providers, partners, trading counterparties, counterparties under swap and other derivative contracts, and other counterparties including brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, hedge funds, other investment funds, clearing agents and market exchanges. We may also have exposures to such counterparties under insurance policies that we have written, including in respect of D&O, surety and similar coverages. Moreover, we are exposed to counterparty risk with respect to certain policies we write that provide coverage to our policyholders for their credit risk exposures to third parties.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nUnder our reinsurance and retrocessional arrangements (including similar protection afforded through risk transfer transactions to capital markets), other insurers, reinsurers or capital market counterparties assume a portion of the losses and related expenses under policies we issue, although we remain liable as the direct insurer or reinsurer on all risks reinsured. While we evaluate periodically the financial condition of our reinsurers, retrocessionaires and capital market counterparties to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer/ retrocessionaire/capital market counterparty insolvencies, such counterparties may become financially unsound by the time their financial obligations to us become due and force us to recapture the reinsured or retroceded business. In some cases counterparty risk is mitigated by collateral to support the third party's financial obligations to us. However, there may be impediments to or delays in our accessing the collateral, and the collateral may not be su/ff icient to fully protect us in the event of a counterparty default. For information on the ratings of our reinsurers, please refer to Section/uni00A05.4/uni00A0'Credit risk-Risk control and risk mitigation -/uni00A0Receivables from reinsurers: rating processes and factors' of this Annual Report.\n\nOur exposure to our counterparties may also be adversely impacted by the negative consequences of the COVID-19 crisis on the financial condition of such counterparties. In particular, moratorium measures have been implemented by governmental authorities in certain jurisdictions, which have limited the ability of creditors to enforce debts and, combined with governmental support measures (such as state-guaranteed loan facilities), may delay the opening of insolvency proceedings with respect to certain debtors. In the event that these moratorium and support measures were to be terminated, there may be a significant increase in defaults or debt restructuring, which may in turn have an adverse impact on the Group's counterparties, and the Group's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThere can be no assurance that defaults by the foregoing or other counterparties would not materially and adversely a/ff ect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",

We make assumptions about these factors in estimating our risk exposures, determining the pricing of our products, establishing our technical provisions and employee benefits reserves and reporting capital levels and business results. These assumptions are based on various modeling techniques ( e.g. , scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting), using both proprietary and third-party models, data analytics and related analyses. Model outputs and related analyses are subject to various assumptions, uncertainties, model errors and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis (including availability, use, accuracy and relevance of historical, internal and industry data) and incorporate numerous assumptions and forecasts about market conditions (such as interest rates, inflation and currency exchange rates), capital requirements, loss frequency and severity, and policyholder behavior. The use of such models can also be affected by operational risks, including input, data and human error. Adverse experience relative to such assumptions, in particular in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, use of and reliance on inaccurate or incomplete models, or inherent product defects may result in an increase in the pricing of our insurance products or the need for us to strengthen our product reserves, which may in turn have an adverse e/ff ect on our results of operations and financial condition, or lead to litigation.\n\nIn our Property &/uni00A0Casualty business, we establish reserves for claims (reported and unreported) and claims expenses in accordance with industry practices, as well as accounting, actuarial and regulatory requirements. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration\n\nof claims will cost based on our assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, actuarial experience on past events, legal liability and other factors. In particular, the amount of reserves net of reinsurance is also determined based on assumptions as to the availability of reinsurance/retrocession coverage and the applicability of such coverage to potential losses, including, for example, with respect to our ability to aggregate those losses in accordance with the relevant policy terms. Prolonged inflation could drive up our claims costs and have a material impact on our reserves and solvency. While we continually review the adequacy of our claims reserves, because the establishment of claims reserves is an inherently uncertain and complex process involving numerous estimates, including the impacts of any regulatory and legislative changes, court interpretations, medical condition of claimants, emerging trends and theories of liability, including with respect to environmental, medical and products liability exposures, and changes in economic conditions (including inflation changes and discount rates used for evaluation of settlements), there can be no assurance that ultimate losses will not materially exceed our claims reserves and have a material adverse e/ff ect on our results of operations. The impact of certain of these factors, such as social inflation, particularly in the United States (increased litigation, expanded theories of liability, higher jury awards and settlement expectations), as well as mass tort claims related to exposure to harmful products or substances ( e.g., asbestos, opioids, talc, glyphosate, lead paint), on our estimation of claims reserves and ultimate costs for claims is di/ff icult to assess and could be material. Our estimation may also be more di/ff icult during times of adverse economic conditions due to unexpected changes in behavior of claimants and policyholders, including an increase in fraudulent reporting of exposures and/or losses, reduced maintenance of insured properties or increased frequency of small claims.\n\nIn our Life &/uni00A0Savings business, our earnings depend significantly upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we use in setting the prices for our products and establishing the liabilities for obligations for technical provisions and claims. In certain cases, product features such as minimum guarantees or options to swap between underlying funds in certain savings products may with time result in higher realized losses than anticipated in initial assumptions. In particular, assessing the impact of minimum guarantees which are contained within certain of our Life &/uni00A0 Savings products and the adequacy test performed on the\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

While we use both our own experience and industry data to develop products and to estimate future policy benefits, including information used in pricing the insurance products and establishing the related actuarial liabilities, there can be no assurance that actual experience will match these estimates and that systemic risks, such as those relating to the COVID-19 crisis, would not result in loss experience inconsistent with our pricing and reserve assumptions. Furthermore, while our New Business Value ('NBV') and European Embedded Value ('EEV') calculations are done on a market consistent basis, changes in assumptions used in calculating these measures may have a material adverse e/ff  ect on the level of our NBV and/or EEV. For example, our NBV is sensitive to interest rate movements and, consequently, an adverse evolution of interest rates relative to our assumptions may have a significant impact on our NBV and a corresponding impact on the trading price of our securities.\n\n## The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters, including those resulting from/uni00A0changing weather patterns, diseases and climatic conditions, and systemic risks, could adversely a/ff  ect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows\n\nCatastrophic events are inherently unpredictable. Our exposure to natural and man-made disasters depends on various factors and is often more pronounced in certain geographic areas, including major urban centers, with a high concentration of customers, employees and/or insured property and assets.\n\nAXA XL, our Commercial Property &/uni00A0Casualty insurance and reinsurance and specialty risk division has operations in North and Latin America, Europe, Lloyd's and Asia-Pacific, which are significantly exposed to natural and man-made catastrophes. While we seek to manage AXA XL's exposure through underwriting actions and/or ceded reinsurance/retrocession coverage, there can be no assurance that the occurrence of catastrophic events will not have a material adverse impact on AXA XL's and our operations, results, financial condition, cash flows or solvency position.\n\nCatastrophic events, whether natural or man-made, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, hailstorms, earthquakes,\n\nI\n\nI\n\nvolcanic eruptions, freezes, floods, explosions, wildfires, pandemic and infectious diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), terrorist attacks, ransomware and other disruptive forms of cyber-attacks, systemic cyber failures, military actions, and power grid and other core infrastructure ( e.g. telephony or Internet infrastructures) failures, as well as any new significant systemic risks (such as those relating to cyber security), could result in substantial volatility in or adversely a/ff ect our operations, results, financial condition, cash flows or solvency position, including as a result of claims occurring at higher levels or materially earlier than anticipated; losses resulting from disruptions in our operations or failures of our counterparties to perform; or declines in value of our investment portfolio. We monitor the evolution of these risks closely and generally seek to manage our exposure to them through individual risk selection, modelling and monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulation, purchase of third-party reinsurance and risk transfer transactions to capital markets. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to adequately anticipate such evolution, as a single catastrophic event, an accumulation of losses resulting from several events or an unusual frequency of smaller losses in a particular period may a/ff ect multiple geographic areas and lines of business, and the frequency or severity of catastrophic events could exceed our estimates. Accounting principles and rules preventing insurers and reinsurers to reserve for catastrophic events until they occur may also augment the impact of such events.\n\nThe occurrence of catastrophic events may also result in an increase of our reinsurance/retrocession for own account and limit or prevent us from obtaining adequate types and amounts of reinsurance/retrocession (or entering into adequate risk transfer transactions to capital markets) for certain risks or regions. Furthermore, we may be unable to obtain appropriate reinsurance/retrocession coverage with respect to exposures to certain systemic risks, which may result in an increase of our net exposures to such risks or require us to decrease our relevant underwriting commitments. While we seek to reduce our exposure to catastrophic events, through diversification and incremental reinsurance, we have experienced and could in the future experience material losses from these types of risks, which may exceed our reinsurance and retrocessional protection (or similar protection a/ff orded through risk transfer transactions to capital markets) or such protection may otherwise be inadequate to protect us against losses or uncollectible reinsurance when due.",

The physical risks and consequences of climate change might significantly impact our business, including with respect to risk perception, pricing and modelling assumptions, the need for new insurance products, the amount and quantum of claims and the value of our investments. Risks arising as a result of the cross-sectoral structural changes stemming from the transition towards a low-carbon economy, including changes in climate policy, regulation, technology or market sentiment, could impact our insurance products, underwriting and the value of our investments. Finally, the liability risks arising from both the physical and transition risks of climate change are increasing and could lead to increased claims and defence costs and materially adversely a/ff ect our business, financial condition and reputation.\n\nOver the past several/uni00A0years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions, including as a result of climate change, have added to the unpredictability of natural disasters and to the frequency and severity thereof and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. In particular, the consequences of climate change might significantly impact the insurance and reinsurance industry, including with respect to risk perception, pricing and modelling assumptions, and the need for new insurance products, all of which may create unforeseen risks and costs not currently known to us.\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 crisis illustrates the significant systemic risk posed by pandemics and other systemic risks, as well as the governmental measures implemented to address the crisis they cause. In addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives implemented, and court decisions rendered, following major catastrophes may adversely impact our results, financial condition, cash flows or solvency position, in particular where they seek to expand the intended scope of coverage for catastrophe-related claims beyond policy terms, including through policyholder-friendly or otherwise broad interpretation of policy wording or retroactive extension of policy coverage.\n\nAXA continues to closely monitor the Group's exposure to the COVID-19 crisis (including its various mutated variants) and its wide-ranging consequences, including on/uni00A0(i) the extent of claims litigation and insurance coverage impacted (in particular in Property &/uni00A0Casualty business lines); (ii) the impact of potential renewed localized or more generalized lockdown measures, travel limitations and business restrictions on the Group's operations and activities; (iii) regulatory, litigation-related or legislative developments aimed at expanding the intended scope of coverages beyond policy terms, exclusions and other conditions; (iv) financial market volatility, changes in asset prices and overall financial conditions (including interest rates and corporate spreads), and consequential impacts on our investment portfolio; and (v) macroeconomic conditions and the flow of people, goods and services.

Changes in customer expectations for appropriate premium levels, the frequency or severity of claims or other loss events, including losses incurred by our ceding insurers and reinsurers, the hardening of the reinsurance market or other factors a/ff ecting the Property &/uni00A0Casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses may have an adverse e/ff ect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Our r isk m anagement programs may be/uni00A0inadequate to protect us against the full extent of the exposure or losses we seek to mitigate and may leave us exposed to/uni00A0unidentified, unanticipated or incorrectly quantified risks that could result in significant losses\n\nWe employ a range of r isk m anagement strategies, including reinsurance for own account and capital markets solutions (such as catastrophe bonds), in order to avoid or limit losses and liabilities. The failure of any of our r isk m anagement strategies or our inability to review or adapt our r isk m anagement strategies could result in significant losses and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nWith respect to reinsurance, the ongoing COVID-19 crisis is an illustration of the uncertainty surrounding the availability of reinsurance/retrocession coverage for losses relating to significant systemic risks.

Furthermore, we may be unable to renew our reinsurance arrangements on terms similar to those applicable prior to the COVID-19 crisis outbreak or obtain appropriate new reinsurance coverages with respect to certain exposures under our policies, including COVID-19 crisisrelated exposures. The inability to find and obtain reinsurance coverage could result in significant losses.\n\nFurthermore, we use derivatives (including equity futures, treasury bond futures, interest rate swaps and swaptions and equity options) to hedge certain, but not all, risks under guarantees provided to our clients or stemming from our assets. In particular, to hedge a significant widening of credit spreads, we use credit swaptions to notably mitigate our exposure to a high deterioration of the credit quality of our asset portfolio. In certain cases, however, we may not be able to apply these techniques to e/ff ectively hedge our risks as intended or expected or may choose not to hedge certain risks because the derivative markets in question may not be of su/ff icient size or liquidity, the cost of hedging may be too expensive (as a result of adverse market conditions or otherwise), the nature of the risk itself may limit our ability to e/ff ectively hedge or for other reasons. This may result in higher realized losses and unanticipated cash needs to collateralize or settle transactions. Hedging counterparties may also fail to perform their obligations, resulting in unhedged exposures and losses on positions that are not collateralized.\n\nFurthermore, the operation of our hedging program is based on models involving numerous estimates and management judgments, including, among others, volatility and interest rates, and correlation among various market movements. These models or their underlying estimates and assumptions could prove inadequate for certain market environments, especially when financial markets experience high volatility, for instance as a result of unprecedented shocks like the COVID-19 crisis and related governmental actions, such as the lockdown measures implemented in various jurisdictions. Our hedging program may change over time and there can be no assurance that actual experience will not di/ff er materially from our assumptions, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\n## Inadequate or failed processes, controls or systems, human factors or external events may adversely a/ff  ect our profitability, reputation or operational e/ff ectiveness\n\nOperational risk is inherent in our business and can manifest itself in various ways, including business interruption, poor vendor performance or default (including under significant outsourcing arrangements), systems malfunctions or failures, software and/or hardware obsolescence, computer viruses, ransomware and other disruptive forms of cyber-attacks and/ or other unauthorized access to our websites and/or systems, misappropriation of sensitive information, corruption of data or operational disruption, regulatory breaches, human errors, defective products, external fraud, natural or man-made disasters and terrorist attacks. We are also exposed to risks arising from potential failures in, or non-compliance with, Group and entity policies concerning such matters as internal controls and procedures and financial reporting policies, as well as from employee misconduct or negligence and fraud. While we take measures to manage such risk, operational risk is part of the business environment in which we operate and we may incur losses from time to time due to these types of risks, as well as impairments to our liquidity, disruption of our businesses, deterioration of our solvency position, legal claims, regulatory sanctions or damage to our reputation. The risk of operational failure or termination of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions could have similar adverse e/ff ects.\n\nOur business is highly dependent on the e/ff ective operation of our information technology, telecommunications, electronic data and other operational systems. We rely on these systems to perform necessary business functions, including providing insurance quotes, processing applications and claims, providing information and support to customers and distributors, administering complex products, conducting actuarial analyses and keeping financial records. We also use computer systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize significant amounts of sensitive customer, employee and company data and information, including proprietary and confidential information.

In recent/uni00A0years, this has led to an increased regulatory focus on risks of security breaches stemming from the growing reliance of the financial sector on information and communication technology. For further information on the regulatory frameworks, please refer to 'Information and Communication Technology (ICT)' in Section/uni00A07.3/uni00A0'General Information -/uni00A0Regulation and Supervision -/uni00A0Other significant legislative and regulatory frameworks' of this Annual Report.\n\nDespite the Group's implementation of a variety of security measures, the Group's data, systems and technologies, as well as the services we provide or rely on (including mobile and cloud services), have been and may in the future be subject to unauthorized intrusions, such as physical or electronic break-\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\nins, ransomware and other disruptive forms of cyber-attacks, unauthorized tampering or other security breaches. Like other global financial institutions and companies, the Group has, from time to time, experienced threats to or compromises of its data, systems and technologies, including phishing, unauthorized access, malware or ransomware attacks, systems failures and disruptions which have required notification to applicable regulators and clients but have not resulted in material consequences for the Group. Exposure to these threats has widened due to a growing reliance on digital infrastructure, including from extended remote working arrangements put in place across the Group in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. For example, a smart working strategy that combines remote working and o/ff ice presence was adopted in 2021/uni00A0by AXA's main entities employing over 70% of the AXA Group's employees and is expected to be implemented globally by all of the Group's entities by 2023. Management has put in place internal controls and procedures designed to protect client data as well as the Group's assets from hacking or other types of unauthorized intrusions into the Group's computer systems, technologies and networks. There is no absolute guarantee, however, that these controls and procedures will be sufficient, properly implemented or e/ff ective, and prevent all attempted intrusions into the Group's systems, technologies and networks. Any such intrusion could result in operational disruption, financial losses, unauthorized access to, tampering or loss of sensitive personal data and/or proprietary information. Unauthorized intrusions and compromises that have taken place, and any attempted intrusions in the future, could also lead to regulatory actions, proceedings or sanctions against us. In addition, due to our reliance on certain infrastructures and interconnectivity with third-party providers, exchanges, clearing houses, financial institutions and other third parties, we could also be adversely impacted by any successful cyber-attack or other security event a/ff  ecting any of them.\n\nCyber-attacks and other interruptions or disruptions of our data transmissions, systems and technologies, or those of our third-party providers (including third-party providers deemed critical to our principal activities), or a failure to maintain the availability, integrity or confidentiality of sensitive data residing on such systems or technologies, or transmitted through these networks, could potentially result in financial loss, impairment to our liquidity, a disruption of our businesses, a deterioration of our solvency position, legal claims, regulatory sanctions or damage to our reputation, any of which could materially adversely a/ff ect our results of operations or financial condition.\n\nFor additional information on the risks relating to the protection of personal data, please refer to the paragraph below 'The evolving and complex regulatory environment surrounding data protection and transfer worldwide could increase our costs and adversely impact our business'.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

This strategic plan is being implemented through a number of major initiatives, including in our Health and Protection business lines and across our Commercial Property &/uni00A0Casualty business lines, all of which are further described under the caption 'Strategic Orientations' on pages/uni00A06 and 7  and in Section/uni00A02.6/uni00A0'Outlook' of this Annual Report. All of these actions have been designed to deliver sustained earnings growth, driven by all our geographies, and a clear path to dividend growth, supported by enhanced cash generation, a strong balance sheet and disciplined capital management. Furthermore, as announced in our 'Driving Progress 2023' strategic plan, we intend to reduce the carbon footprint of our General Account assets ( i.e. corporate fixed-income; listed equities; real estate assets) by 20% by 2025. This new nonfinancial target complements the Group's commitment to contain the 'warming potential' of its investment portfolio to below 1.5\u00b0C by 2050/uni00A0and its objective to reach \u20ac26/uni00A0billion in green investments by 2023. For more information about our 'Driving Progress 2023' strategic plan and AXA's sustainability strategy, please refer to Section/uni00A04.1/uni00A0'AXA's Sustainability strategy' of this Annual Report. There can be no assurance, however, that any or all of our strategic initiatives will be successful, or that the process of achieving their implementation will not cause material disruption to our business operations, management, personnel, brand and reputation, especially while there remain significant uncertainties and unknown risks relating to the evolution of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nThe 'Driving Progress 2023' strategic plan is based on a number of assumptions, covering, inter alia, the macroeconomic environment and the development of the Group's activities. These assumptions are based on various modeling techniques and forecasts regarding several factors ( e.g. interest rates, inflation, capital requirements, claims expenses, gross domestic product). As a result, the financial targets we intend to achieve as part of our 2020-2023/uni00A0strategic plan may be negatively a/ff ected by an adverse experience relative to such assumptions. Any failure to achieve such financial targets could materially impact our results of operations, share price and competitive position.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## We may pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions to expand, complement or reorganize our business, which could adversely a/ff  ect our business, future profitability and growth\n\nExternal growth transactions involve risks that could adversely a/ff ect our operating results, including the substantial amount of M anagement time that may be diverted from operations to carry out such transactions and related integration e/ff orts. Such transactions could also result in new debt or equity issuances, financing arrangements, and the incurrence of additional costs, contingent or unforeseen liabilities or risks and impairment and amortization expenses relating to goodwill and other intangible assets, and failure to mitigate the risks and uncertainties arising from such transactions through due diligence and indemnification provisions, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth.\n\nFurthermore, we may be exposed from time to time to certain risks relating to the integration of newly acquired companies. Such risks include difficulty or delay in integrating such companies, their IT, operations, employees and areas of expertise in an e/ff icient and e/ff ective manner, which may result in the loss of certain key employees and/or customers of the acquired companies, and reliance on a transaction counterparty for transition services for an extended period of time, which may result in additional expenses and delay the integration or realization of the desired benefit of the transaction (and there can be no assurance that the transaction party will provide such transition services in a manner that is acceptable to us). As a result, we may not be able to e/ff ectively integrate acquired companies and achieve all of the expected strategic objectives, anticipated synergies, expected cost savings, impact on solvency capital requirements (including contributions to the Group's Solvency/uni00A0II ratio, if any), innovation, operational efficiencies and business development from acquisitions within the forecast periods or at all, or we may be required to spend additional time and money on integration, any of which could adversely a/ff ect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth. In the case of adverse developments relating to an acquired company, modifications to our expected strategy with respect to such company, or more generally our overall strategy, might have to be considered. In particular, we may be subject to, or engage in, litigation in connection with or as a result of acquisitions, which could have an adverse e/ff ect on our results of operations.\n\nWe  have  carried  out  and  may  carry  out  in  the  future divestitures, reorganizations of existing businesses and internal reorganizations which may have adverse e/ff ects on our business,",

For example, in connection with the Internal Reinsurance Transformation, AXA/uni00A0SA has applied to obtain a reinsurance license from the ACPR and would, upon receipt thereof, become a licensed reinsurance company subject to the applicable ACPR regulations governing reinsurance entities and activities, and would enter into annually renewable 25% quota share reinsurance treaties with certain of AXA's European Property &/uni00A0Casualty carriers. As part of the Internal Reinsurance Transformation, AXA Global Re, the Group's existing internal reinsurance entity, would be merged with and into AXA/uni00A0SA, with AXA/uni00A0SA as the surviving entity. As a result, the reinsurance activity currently carried out by AXA Global Re would be carried out by AXA/uni00A0SA and AXA/uni00A0SA would become the main operational internal reinsurer of the Group. For more information, please refer to Section/uni00A02.1/uni00A0'Operating highlights' this Annual Report. Such divestitures and reorganizations, which may take the form of share or asset sales or merger, as well as reinsurance transactions, may not be carried out within the expected timeframe or at all, due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals or other reasons; the anticipated profit and/or positive effect on our overall risk profile, our Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) and Solvency/uni00A0II ratio, or local solvency and capital adequacy requirements, from any such transactions may not be realized; or we may incur a loss on such transactions. Divestments of equity participations we hold may also be exposed to volatility and other market-related risks, which could impact the carrying value of our remaining stake in such companies, including related goodwill, and adversely a/ff ect our results of operations. All of such factors may be exacerbated by the uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 crisis, particularly with respect to the timing of any required regulatory or other approvals. For additional information on the impact of divestitures, acquisitions and other transactions on goodwill, please refer to Section/uni00A06.6/uni00A0-/uni00A0Note/uni00A05/uni00A0'Goodwill' of this Annual Report.\n\nFrom time to time, we may also consider acquisitions of or investments in other companies, including through joint ventures. Any such acquisition or investment may be subject to approvals from regulatory authorities in certain countries, including as a result of foreign investment regulations and controls, which may lead to the transfer of certain assets or branches of activity and/or commitments or restrictions a/ff ecting the conduct of our business.\n\nWe may also be exposed to liabilities and risks that were not known or assessed correctly at the time of the transaction and/or need to address capital, regulatory, compliance, tax or accounting issues that arise a/f\\_t er transactions have closed, which may not be covered by, or exceed the amounts of, any indemnities provided to us by the sellers or that we provided to acquires, and could adversely a/ff ect our business and results of operations.\n\n## We conduct businesses in highly competitive environments with evolving trends that could adversely impact our results of operations and/uni00A0financial condition\n\nOur competitors include mutual fund companies, a sset m anagement  firms,  private  equity  firms,  hedge  funds, commercial and investment banks, and other insurance or reinsurance companies, many of which are regulated di/ff erently from us and offer alternative products or more competitive pricing than we do.\n\nThe insurance and reinsurance industry faces disruptive competitive challenges from the emergence of new actors, such as financial technology companies, or fintech, and insurance technology companies, or insurtech, which generally benefit from less extensive regulatory requirements (including less strict capital requirements) as well as from data synergies or technological innovation. In addition, development of alternative distribution channels for certain types of insurance, reinsurance and securities products, including through the Internet, may result in increasing competition as well as pressure on margins for certain types of products. Continued consolidation of the insurance and reinsurance sector may also result in increased competition.\n\nThese competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of our products and services, particularly as competitors seek to win market share, and may harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.\n\n## The failure to respond e/ff  ectively to various emerging technological changes may a/ff ect our business and profitability\n\nAn ongoing challenge we face is the e/ff ective adaptation to a constantly changing technological landscape. If we are not e/ff  ective in anticipating the impact on our business of changing technologies, such as driverless cars, drones, connected devices, artificial intelligence or robot-advisors, our ability to successfully operate our business may be impaired. Technologies that facilitate ride- or home-sharing could disrupt the demand for our products from current customers, create coverage issues or impact the frequency or severity of losses. These changes could also a/ff ect our ability to accurately price our products and might significantly a/ff ect our margins in certain lines of business. For example, the advent of driverless cars, connected devices and usage-based insurance could materially alter the way that automobile, health or other p ersonal lines insurance is marketed, priced and underwritten. In addition, the market for coverage for so-called 'cyber risks', including ransomware and other cyberrelated risk, or similar emerging threats is a rapidly evolving one, and any failure by us to provide innovative products relative to our competitors or new entrants in the market, or to price those products e/ff ectively and competitively, may result in a competitive disadvantage.\n\nIn addition, the rapid increase in the nature, volume and availability of data in recent/uni00A0years, whether resulting from connected customers, so-called 'big data', 'blockchain', cloud computing, increased mobile Internet access, personalization\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

While data-driven changes in the industry are at an early stage and difficult to predict, they could adversely impact our business going forward, including through the expense and e/ff ort that we will need to incur in order to ensure that our employees, systems and processes are able to e/ff iciently adapt to and manage such changes as they arise.\n\nFurthermore, if we are unable to e/ff ectively use and update or replace our key technology systems as they become obsolete or as emerging technology renders them competitively ine/ff icient, or if we fail to develop the talent and skills of our human resources to meet the new technological challenges, and to attract and assimilate new talents into our Group consistent with our business goals, our business, prospects, competitive position and financial condition could be adversely a/ff ected.\n\n## We operate through arrangements with third parties, including delegation of underwriting and claims authority, which exposes us to operational and regulatory risks and could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition\n\nWe have entered into contractual outsourcing arrangements with third-party service providers for a wide variety of services required in connection with the day-to-day operation of our insurance, reinsurance and Asset Management businesses (including policy administration, claims-related services, securities pricing and other services) and our product distribution. Such arrangements expose us to operational and regulatory risks incurred by these third parties, including employee misconduct or negligence, fraud, internal control failure, contract error, disruption to distribution arrangements, ransomware and other forms of\n\nI\n\nI\n\ncyber-attacks, failures in processing policies and handling claims, and non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, any of which may be more likely to materialize in the context of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nIn addition, part of our insurance and reinsurance businesses is underwritten by third parties under contractual arrangements, which typically authorize such third parties to bind us to new policies and to renew policies, within the terms of our licenses and subject to various contractual obligations and restrictions. If these third parties do not abide by the terms of our licenses, amend material terms of the policies without our approval, or otherwise breach their contractual obligations to us, we could be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions or other similar restrictions for breach of outsourcing/licensing requirements and be liable under the policies issued by breaching third parties. Furthermore, we may be exposed to additional exposure to such risks, in particular due to legislative measures or judicial decisions related to the COVID-19 crisis, such as those imposing customer-friendly interpretation of policy wording, which may apply to policies that were bound on our behalf by certain of these third parties.\n\nFurthermore, as with other reinsurers, in our reinsurance business we do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under our reinsurance treaties and we largely rely on original underwriting decisions made by ceding companies. As a result, if ceding companies did not adequately evaluate the risks insured, the premiums ceded to us may not compensate us for the risks we reinsure and the losses we may incur, which may adversely a/ff ect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe carry out certain of our operations through joint ventures and other partnership arrangements with third parties that we do not control. These arrangements expose us, in particular, to the failure of any of our partners to meets its contractual obligations or to comply with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThere can be no assurance that any of our contractual arrangements with third parties will not expose us to operational, financial and reputational risk, which could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

On September/uni00A022, 2021, the European Commission published its proposed directive amending Directive 2009/138/EC (the 'Solvency/uni00A0II Directive') and explained its overall intentions on the most important aspects of the forthcoming level 2/uni00A0amendments (in particular with respect to risk margin). For more information about the proposed directive amending the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive, please refer to Section/uni00A07.3/uni00A0'General Information -/uni00A0Regulation and Supervision -/uni00A0Regulatory Capital and Solvency Requirements -/uni00A0Solvency/uni00A0II review' of this Annual Report and the paragraph below 'The Group and our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision, adverse judicial decisions and emerging social and reputational trends in the various jurisdictions in which we operate'.

For additional information on our dividend policy and previous dividend payments, please refer to Section/uni00A01.1/uni00A0'Key Figures -/uni00A0Dividends and Dividend Policy' and Section/uni00A07.3/uni00A0'General Information -/uni00A0Bylaws -/uni00A0Rights, Preferences and Restrictions Attached to the Shares' of this Annual Report.\n\nCustomer Protection Matters. Our insurance, reinsurance, a sset m anagement and banking operations are subject to an increasing number of legislative and regulatory initiatives designed to increase consumer protection in the sector of financial services, in particular by enhancing disclosure and transparency requirements, as well as conduct of business and product governance rules, which have also resulted in stricter scrutiny by competent authorities. In the European Union, these initiatives, including Directive (EU) 2016/97/uni00A0on insurance distribution (as amended, 'IDD'), Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments (as amended, 'MiFID II') and Regulation (EU)\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\n1286/2014/uni00A0on key information documents for packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (as amended, the 'PRIIPs Regulation'), and similar initiatives are under review (or in the course of implementation) in other jurisdictions in which the Group operates. These initiatives, as well as future or revised guidance issued by regulatory authorities (such as the European Securities and Markets Authority ('ESMA'), EIOPA, the AMF and the Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA')) and other emerging social and reputational trends, may increase our legal and compliance costs, limit or restrict our ability to do business or expose us to civil, criminal or regulatory actions, proceedings or sanctions, all of which may adversely impact our brand or reputation. For further information, please refer to 'Evolution of the regulatory and litigation environment' in Section/uni00A07.3/uni00A0'General Information -/uni00A0Regulation and Supervision -/uni00A0Other significant legislative and regulatory frameworks' of this Annual Report.\n\nAML and Other Compliance Matters . In recent/uni00A0years there has also been a significant increase in legislative and regulatory initiatives and enforcement actions in the areas of financial crime compliance, including a nti-m oney l aundering ('AML'), international trade sanctions and anti-bribery laws and regulations ( e.g. the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act of 2010, French Law No./uni00A02016-1691 of December/uni00A09, 2016/uni00A0(also known as 'Sapin II')), which have resulted in the need for enhanced control on transactions. As a result, the financial crime compliance programs of financial institutions remain a major focus for regulatory and law enforcement authorities, while regulatory measures in this area continue to be further amended, expanded and strengthened. For instance, in France, Orders No./uni00A02020-1342 of November/uni00A04, 2020, and No./uni00A02020-115 of February/uni00A012, 2020, imposed enhanced requirements on French financial institutions, including the reinforcement of internal procedures to implement asset-freezing measures, and prevent and detect acts of corruption and influence-peddling committed in France and abroad. Furthermore, in certain jurisdictions the relevant AML, anti-corruption and sanctions rules may be enforced on an extraterritorial basis, which could expose our operations to additional or conflicting requirements. In addition, increased cooperation among authorities globally may, in the event we become subject to enforcement proceedings, or are otherwise found to be non-compliant in this area, result in more severe sanctions or monetary penalties.\n\nBenchmark Reforms. Reforms to interest rate, equity, foreign exchange rate and other types of indices (also known as 'benchmarks') have been recently enacted, and regulatory authorities have also proposed further reforms to and potential changes affecting benchmarks. Several interbank market benchmarks have been designated as critical benchmarks, including LIBOR, EURIBOR and EONIA under applicable local benchmark regulations, and their related benchmark methodologies have been made subject to review.

In this context, Regulation (EU) 2021/168/uni00A0was adopted on February/uni00A010, 2021, and allows the European Commission to impose a statutory replacement for certain critical benchmarks, whose cessation might result in significant disruption to the EU financial markets' operations. For more information about Regulation (EU) 2021/168/uni00A0and benchmark regulations generally, please refer to 'Reform and potential changes to reference rates and indices (benchmarks)' in Section/uni00A07.3/uni00A0'General Information/uni00A0- Regulation and Supervision/uni00A0- Other significant legislative and regulatory frameworks' of this Annual Report.\n\nBecause these reforms are a/ff ecting the whole financial sector, the transition to the new benchmarks creates industry-wide risks, to which the Group is therefore exposed. AXA is conducting a Group-wide project to manage this transition and the impacts of future benchmark changes, which could have implications for our capital models, r isk m anagement e/ff orts, investment strategies and product design, among others. Implementation of these and any future regulations, amendments to existing regulations, or future or revised guidance issued by regulatory authorities (such as the ESMA, EIOPA, the AMF and the FCA) can be expected to increase our costs in relation to operations, information systems, legal and compliance, and may also limit or restrict our ability to do business or expose us to civil, criminal or regulatory actions, proceedings or sanctions, which may adversely impact our brand or reputation.\n\nClimate Change Initiatives. Regulatory initiatives, including at French, European Union and international levels, regarding climate change may affect our operations and those of our counterparties, and potentially impact the cash flow patterns of our investments and/or a/ff ect their respective economic values, as certain companies struggle to adapt to these regulations. These may include:/uni00A0(i) new investment requirements; (ii) new disclosure requirements, such as,/uni00A0(a) at the French level, Article/uni00A029 of Law No./uni00A02019-1147/uni00A0dated November/uni00A08, 2019, on energy and climate (the 'Energy-Climate Law' or 'ECL') and/uni00A0(b) in the European Union, Regulation (EU) 2020/852/uni00A0(the 'Taxonomy Regulation') and related Commission Delegated Regulations and the proposed Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) published on April/uni00A021, 2021; (iii) new requirements relating to the inclusion of environmental, social and governance considerations into insurance and a sset m anagement products and advice such as those contained in European Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/1257/uni00A0regarding the integration of sustainability considerations into the prudential, distribution, investment  and  advisory  framework  for  insurance  and reinsurance undertakings, insurance distributors, asset managers\n\nI\n\nI\n\nand investment firms; or (iv) new climate change stress testing requirements, such as the recent climate stress test exercise conducted by the ACPR, the first results of which were published in May/uni00A02021. These and similar regulatory requirements, as well as any further regulations regarding the transition to a lower-carbon economy, climate change or our energy-related investments, could increase our legal and compliance costs and adversely a/ff ect our business or the value of our investments. For further information on climate and sustainable finance-related regulatory initiatives, please refer to 'Climate and sustainable finance-related regulatory initiatives' in Section/uni00A07.3/uni00A0'General Information Regulation and Supervision -/uni00A0Other significant legislative and regulatory frameworks' and on investmentrelated climate risk analysis, please refer to Section/uni00A04.3/uni00A0'Climate Change and ESG Integration -/uni00A0Investments' of this Annual Report.\n\nChanges to IFRS. Changes to IFRS, as developed by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), could significantly impact insurers and other financial institutions, including AXA, that prepare their consolidated financial statements  in  accordance  with  IFRS.  In  particular,  the simultaneous implementation of IFRS/uni00A017/uni00A0-/uni00A0Insurance Contracts and IFRS/uni00A09/uni00A0-/uni00A0Financial Instruments, which will become e/ff ective for annual periods beginning on or after January/uni00A01, 2023, following the adoption of IFRS/uni00A017/uni00A0by the European Union on November/uni00A019, 2021, is in progress within the Group. These changes may significantly affect the accounting treatment of insurance liabilities and financial assets and M anagement is currently assessing the impact of their adoption, notably with regards to the consistency over time of the metrics used for the assessment of the financial targets set as part of the 'Driving Progress 2023' strategic plan. For further information on these two standards, please refer to 'Evolution of Accounting Standards' in Section/uni00A07.3/uni00A0'General Information -/uni00A0Regulation and Supervision -/uni00A0Other significant legislative and regulatory frameworks' of this Annual Report. The above-mentioned and any other changes to IFRS/uni00A0that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse e/ff ect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nCOVID-19  Crisis-Related  Judicial  Decisions. In  several jurisdictions, notably France, various US states and the United Kingdom, courts have rendered decisions in favor of policyholders' interests, including by adopting a policyholderfriendly interpretation of certain business interruption policy provisions. Other judicial decisions may be rendered or legislative proposals enacted to the effect of implementing premium deferrals or refunds, customer-friendly interpretation of policy wording and/or retroactive extension of policy coverage, or restricting our ability to cancel or non-renew insurance policies or collect premiums thereunder in accordance with their terms. This may require the Group to cover losses resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, even though such losses were not",

As a result, we may be exposed to higher than expected losses, especially if such losses are not covered by our reinsurance arrangements, and be required in turn to increase our reserves to take into account potential higher loss payments. In addition, we may be required to materially amend certain of our existing policy wordings or otherwise change our underwriting and pricing policies and practices to take account of changing judicial and regulatory developments with respect to the coverage of the COVID-19 crisis. There can be no assurance that any of the foregoing developments will not have an adverse e/ff ect on the Group's financial condition and results of operations or adversely impact our brand or reputation.\n\nLloyd's Regulations for Underwriting Syndicates and Related Risks. Following the acquisition of XL group in 2018, we have been managing, through Catlin Underwriting Agencies Limited, Syndicate 2003, one of the largest underwriting syndicates at Lloyd's and, as a result of which, are exposed to a variety of Lloyd's-related regulatory risks. For instance, the Council of Lloyd's has wide discretionary powers to regulate members of Lloyd's, and may vary the method by which the capital solvency ratio is calculated, or impose additional or special levies on members. In addition, if Lloyd's fails to satisfy the FCA's and the Prudential Regulation Authority's annual solvency test in any given/uni00A0year, Syndicate 2003/uni00A0could be required to cease or reduce underwriting through Lloyd's. A downgrading of the Lloyd's market could also impair Syndicate 2003's ability to trade in certain classes of business at current levels. In connection with Brexit, the Lloyd's model for writing business in the European Union through Lloyd's newly established Belgian underwriting subsidiary, Lloyd's Insurance Company/uni00A0SA, is under review by local supervisory authorities, which may have an impact on Syndicate 2003's ability to write EU business. As a Lloyd's syndicate providing coverage to US policyholders and covering US risks, we could also be required by US. regulators to increase the level of funding required as minimum deposits for the protection of US policyholders. Any Lloyd's-related risks could have an adverse e/ff ect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe expect the scope and extent of applicable laws and regulations, as well as regulatory oversight, to continue to increase over the coming/uni00A0years. While M anagement proactively manages legal and regulatory risks and has adopted policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we do business, we cannot predict with any certainty the potential effects that a change in applicable laws or regulations, their interpretation or enforcement (or of the potential e/ff ects of any\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\nnew regulation or legislation in the future), or any determination we make regarding compliance with conflicting regulations, may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any failure by us to remain in compliance with regulations applicable to us could result in fines, penalties, injunctions or other similar restrictions, any of which could negatively impact our earnings and reputation. For a description of the regulations and supervision framework applicable to the Group, please refer to Section/uni00A07.3/uni00A0'General Information -/uni00A0Regulation and Supervision' of this Annual Report.\n\nWe may also be adversely a/ff ected by a change in applicable laws or regulations, their interpretation or enforcement impacting, or regulatory decisions, authorizations or approvals relating to, third parties with which we do business. For instance, certain of our letter of credit facilities for cedants are e/ff ective only if the banks issuing the letters of credit are on the list of banks approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the 'NAIC'). If some or all of the issuing banks under our credit facilities cease to be NAIC approved and we are unable to replace them with NAIC approved banks, our letter of credit facility capacity could be significantly diminished, especially in situations of adverse capital and credit market conditions where the cost of replacement facilities may be significantly increased or prohibitive. Please refer to the paragraph above 'Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly a/ff ect our ability to meet liquidity needs, our access to capital and increase our cost of capital'.\n\n## As a global business, we are exposed to various local political, regulatory, business and financial risks and challenges\n\nAs a global business we are exposed to a wide variety of local political, regulatory, business and financial risks and challenges, which may a/ff ect the demand for our products and services, the value of our investment portfolios, the levels of capital and surplus that we are required to hold, the credit quality of our counterparties and the way we are able to do business in particular countries and markets.\n\nThese risks include, for example, political, social or economic instability in the countries in which we operate, including the risk of nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital controls, restrictions on foreign trade and investment (such as changes to authorized levels of foreign ownership, which may a/ff  ect our ability to conduct business in certain countries through joint ventures), the imposition, or significant enhancement, of international sanctions against certain countries and connected entities (which may a/ff ect our ability to exercise our rights of ownership and conduct business through joint ventures in the relevant countries as well as our ability to do business with\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

These risks also include the risk of governments, supervisors, regulators and courts in the countries in which we operate adopting policyholder-favorable stances such as the mandatory provision of certain types of coverage, restrictions on cancellation or non-renewal of policies, extension of coverage (such as by extension of scope and/or period), and the imposition of pricing constraints/obligations to ensure the a/ff  ordability of coverage for policyholders, in each case resulting in a deviation from the original terms and conditions of those policies (including potentially retroactively) and a deviation in the economic balance of these insurance policies as initially agreed with the relevant policyholders. There can be no assurance that any of the foregoing developments will not have an adverse e/ff ect on the Group's financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## We have been and may become in the future subject to lawsuits, regulatory investigations and/or other proceedings (including activism related to environmental, social and governance matters and  other societal  and reputational trends) which may a/ff ect our business, brand, reputation, relations with regulators and/or results of operations\n\nWe have been named as defendants in numerous lawsuits (both class actions and individual lawsuits) and involved in various regulatory investigations and examinations, and other actions arising in the various jurisdictions where we and our subsidiaries do business. Please refer to Section/uni00A06.6/uni00A0-/uni00A0Note/uni00A031/uni00A0'Litigation' of this Annual Report. We may be involved in similar proceedings in the future.\n\nCertain of these lawsuits and investigations seek significant or unspecified amounts of damages, including punitive damages, and certain of the regulatory authorities involved in these proceedings have substantial powers over the conduct and operations of our business. The introduction of a class action system in France in 2014/uni00A0and similar developments in certain other European jurisdictions, as well as the recent adoption of Directive (EU) 2020/1828/uni00A0dated November/uni00A025, 2020, on representative actions for the protection of the collective\n\nI\n\nI\n\ninterests of consumers at the EU level, have increased and are likely to continue to increase litigation, risks and costs. Similarly in the United States there is an increasing trend towards large damage awards in the consumer class action context, and such trend can be expected to continue in the future. Furthermore, the increasing number of legislative and regulatory requirements as well as social and reputational trends leading to the strengthening of consumer protection in the financial sector may expose us to additional civil, criminal or regulatory actions, investigations, proceedings or sanctions. For additional information, please refer to Section/uni00A07.3/uni00A0'General Information -/uni00A0Regulation and Supervision' of this Annual Report.\n\nIn recent/uni00A0years activism by shareholders, activist funds, nongovernmental and other organizations, including with respect to e nvironmental, s ocial and g overnance (ESG) and consumer protection  related  matters,  have  been  directed  against numerous public companies. Responding can be costly and time consuming and may adversely a/ff ect our business by, among other things, diverting the attention of our Board of Directors, senior management and employees away from the execution of business strategies. ESG-focused initiatives, in particular, raise substantial reputation risk for targeted companies. These potential actions could also negatively a/ff ect our share price and brand.\n\nIn  addition,  in  the  context  of  the  COVID-19  crisis,  the consequences and impacts of which are ongoing, holders of Property &/uni00A0Casualty insurance policies have been increasingly seeking coverage for losses resulting from the COVID-19 crisis. Many lawsuits have been introduced against insurers, such as the AXA Group, in multiple jurisdictions, particularly in respect of business interruption claims, and the number of claims and related judicial proceedings has continued to rise as various governmental lockdown measures and other impacts of the COVID-19 crisis have continued. In certain of these cases, defendant insurers, including AXA Group entities, have asserted that these losses were not covered under the terms of the relevant policies. However, policyholders have and may continue to assert di/ff erent theories of coverage, and insurers, including the AXA Group, may incur additional expense due to the pendency of a large number of individual lawsuits. We may also be involved in proceedings with our reinsurers regarding coverage of COVID-19 crisis-related losses or related matters, which might have an adverse impact on our legal costs and the amount of reinsurance recoverables available to us.\n\nDue to the nature of certain of these types of proceedings, we cannot estimate the potential losses or predict with any certainty the potential impact thereof on our business, brand, reputation, relations with regulators and/or results of operations.",

Regulations in this area are quickly evolving in the European Union and in other jurisdictions, which could adversely a/ff ect our business if we fail to adapt our rules, internal controls and strategy to the emerging regulatory environment.\n\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679/uni00A0dated April/uni00A027, 2016, on the protection and movement of personal data (as amended, the 'GDPR') entered into force on May/uni00A025, 2018. GDPR significantly modified the EU data protection framework and, in particular, imposed new restrictions on data usage/processing (including profiling), disclosure to customers and a stronger enforcement regime, under which competent data protection authorities are able to fine companies that do not comply with EU rules up to 4% of their global annual turnover. Similar data protection regulations to GDPR have entered into force in many other jurisdictions, including China, Brazil, Algeria, Egypt, Switzerland and Thailand. While we have adopted and regularly review a global Data Privacy Organization/Governance policy designed to manage risks related to data protection, there can be no assurance that our existing or planned data protection rules, including our privacy-related Group Binding Corporate Rules, and governance organization will not need to be updated or replaced to comply with new laws and regulations and regulatory guidance applicable in the European Union or other jurisdictions where we operate or may operate in the future.\n\nThere is a risk that data collected by the Group and its thirdparty service providers is not processed in accordance with notifications made to, or obligations imposed by, data subjects, regulators or other counterparties, or in compliance with applicable data-privacy laws. The Group's IT and other systems may also in future be exposed to hacking and unauthorized intrusions, such as physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized tampering  or  security  breaches  or  other  intentional  or unintentional acts by parties acting from within or outside the Group, which could result in sensitive data (including customer and employee data) being stolen, lost or misused. In the context of the COVID-19 crisis, the consequences and impacts of which are ongoing, these threats are more likely to materialize due\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\nto extended remote working arrangements, the accelerated digitalization of our operations and, more generally, the social and business community disruption caused by the pandemic. Negligence or failure to implement and follow internal Group policies, in particular regarding encryption of data, or to fail to perform adequate internal data collection/processing controls, may also facilitate hacking and other intrusions and result in breaches of GDPR and other applicable laws.\n\nAny failure to comply with applicable data protection laws, and data the/f\\_t , loss or misuse, a/ff ecting any Group entity or a third-party service provider, could result in significant regulatory sanctions, penalties, injunctions or other similar restrictions, damage to our reputation, need to compensate customers, customer litigation (including class actions and individual lawsuits), and consequently have a material adverse e/ff ect on our business, results of operations and prospects.\n\nFollowing the European Union Court of Justice's decision in 2015/uni00A0to invalidate the European Commission's Safe Harbor, which had allowed, under certain conditions, the transfer of personal information from EU companies to US companies, transatlantic data flows continued using other mechanisms such as standard contractual clauses between companies and binding corporate rules for transfers within multinational corporate groups. From July/uni00A02016, a new safe harbor had been created, known as the 'EUUS Privacy Shield', but a/f\\_t er four/uni00A0years this was also invalidated by the European Union Court of Justice (on July/uni00A016, 2020), which required that supplementary measures be considered for data transfers to any non-EU jurisdiction that is not considered by EU authorities as having implemented adequate protections (such as the United States). As banks, insurance and reinsurance companies were generally not eligible to register and participate in the EU-US Privacy Shield, the AXA Group had continued to rely on standard contractual clauses when transferring data to non-AXA non-EU companies, and binding corporate rules when transferring personal data between companies within the AXA Group. While we currently believe that we can continue using such mechanisms to transfer data to the United States and to other non-EU jurisdictions and add supplementary measures as required, there is no guarantee that such mechanisms will not be subject to future challenge or to stricter scrutiny by the competent authorities, or that further changes in applicable regulations will not potentially increase our legal and compliance costs, or result in regulatory sanctions or damage to our brand or reputation.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

Risk Management independence and comprehensiveness:\n- Chief Risk O/ff icers are independent from operations (first line of defense) and Internal Audit Department (third line of defense). The Risk Management Department, together with the Compliance and Internal Control Departments, constitute the second line of defense, whose objective is to develop, coordinate and monitor a consistent risk framework across the Group;\n- 2. C ommon risk appetite framework: Chief Risk O/ff icers are responsible for ensuring that senior management reviews and approves the risks to which the relevant entity or business unit is exposed, understands the consequences of an adverse development in such risks and have action plans that can be implemented in case of unfavorable developments;\n- 3. S ystematic second opinion on key processes: Chief Risk Officers provide a systematic and independent second opinion on product approval process, reserves, reinsurance, investments and ALM and challenge on operational risks and strategic plan;\n- 4. E xtensive use of Internal Model based on a robust economic capital metric: the Internal Model is intended to offer a concrete and powerful tool to control and measure exposure to most risks, in line with the Solvency/uni00A0II framework. The Internal Model is designed as a consistent and comprehensive Risk Management tool, which also forms an important element in the capital management and planning process;\n- 5. P roactive Risk Management: Chief Risk Officers are responsible for early detection of risks. This is ensured through challenge of and constant dialogue with the relevant business and supported by the AXA Group's emerging Risks Management framework.\n\nGRM oversees the operating entities' adherence to the ERM, supported by the local Risk Management teams. It coordinates Risk Management for the Group, steers the local Risk Management Departments and strives to develop a risk culture throughout the Group.\n\nThe reinsurance structure in charge of Property &/uni00A0Casualty and Life &/uni00A0Savings, Health &/uni00A0Protection reinsurance (AXA Global Re) reports to the Group Deputy Chief Executive O/ff icer, in charge of Finance, Risk Management, Strategy, ceded Reinsurance and Operations. Its main mandate is to contribute to the protection of the Group through the centralization of the Group's purchase of reinsurance. For additional information on the reinsurance strategy, please see Section/uni00A05.6/uni00A0'Insurance Risks' of this Annual Report/uni00A0 (1) .\n\n## Group Compliance function\n\nThe Group Compliance function is responsible for advising Executive Management and the Board of Directors on applicable compliance laws, regulations and administrative provisions, and on the impact of regulatory change on AXA Group's operations. The Group Compliance function provides expertise, advice and support to AXA entities to assess significant compliance matters, analyzes the major compliance risks and contributes to designing solutions to mitigate the risks to which the Group is exposed. The Group Compliance function manages a wide range of compliance related matters including/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0financial crime (which includes antibribery and corruption, anti-money laundering programs and international sanctions/embargo compliance), (ii)/uni00A0data privacy, (iii) business conduct, (iv)/uni00A0compliance &/uni00A0ethics, (v)/uni00A0the monitoring of other major compliance and regulatory risks, and (vi)/uni00A0regular reporting of significant compliance and regulatory matters to Executive Management, the Board of Directors and regulators.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

Adherence to the Standards and Policies ( e.g. Compliance Governance,  Anti-Money  Laundering,  Sanctions,  AntiBribery/uni00A0etc.) is mandatory.\n\nThe  Group  Compliance  function  undertakes  an  annual Compliance Risk Assessment exercise via which entities are required to identify the most significant compliance risks to which they are exposed. Based on this assessment an Annual Compliance Plan is developed for the following/uni00A0year. Using the same methodology and to comply with the French extraterritorial law (Sapin/uni00A0II), a separate Anti-Bribery and Corruption Risk Assessment has also been implemented across AXA entities. This risk assessment enables entities to identify in a more granular manner risks related to bribery.\n\nThe Group Compliance function has implemented a number of monitoring processes. For example, the Compliance In-Depth Review (CIDR) which is an ongoing program of structured onsite Compliance reviews conducted by the Group Compliance Department to AXA Group Companies worldwide. The main purpose of these reviews is to measure adherence to the Group Standards and Policies, to define improvement action plans, to provide experienced advice, including on compliance technical aspects, and to rate the entity's maturity level against other Group companies. This program was introduced in 2009/uni00A0using a risk-based approach. In 2021, travel restrictions imposed following the COVID-19 crisis had meant that it had not been possible to conduct as many on-sight CIDRs  but provided the opportunity to develop remote reviews as well as additional oversight to temporarily replace these on-sight reviews.\n\nOn a regular basis, the Group Compliance function reports to the Group Audit Risk &/uni00A0Compliance Committee, the Audit Committee, and the Board of Directors (as required) on significant compliance matters. These include major regulatory changes that have compliance implications, results of the Compliance Risk Assessment, and any other significant issues that require escalation.\n\n## Group internal control function\n\nTo further strengthen its control environment, the AXA Group established in 2017/uni00A0a centralized internal control function within the second line of defense independent from business operations. Group Head of Internal Control is reporting to the Group Head of Operational Risk and Internal Control. The Group Internal Control Department is responsible for the development of a standardized methodology and framework for internal control and for oversight of its implementation in the AXA Group's\n\nI\n\nI\n\nsubsidiaries. For more information on the internal control at local level, please refer to the paragraph 'Risk Management and internal control at local level' below.\n\nThe Internal Control framework of the AXA Group:\n\n- /uni25A0 is based on the principle of proportionality and takes into account the nature, scale and complexity of the entities' operations;\n- /uni25A0 is aligned with the COSO 'Internal Control -/uni00A0Integrated Framework' of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission;\n- /uni25A0 is an integral part of the Risk Management thus providing the Executive Management with a view of the risk and control environment;\n- /uni25A0 is underpinned by the Group Internal Control Standard and Group Solvency/uni00A0II Internal Control Policy, first approved by the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors of AXA/uni00A0SA in December/uni00A02017;\n- /uni25A0 encompasses Internal Financial Control, implemented since 2010/uni00A0to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (ICOFR), and extended to Solvency/uni00A0II in 2014/uni00A0to contribute to the Internal Model validation process. For more information on Internal Financial Control, please refer to the paragraphs 'Financial reporting, disclosure, controls and procedures' and 'Internal Model validation' below.\n\nOn a regular basis, the Group internal control reports to the Group Operational, Information, Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee.\n\n## Third line of defense: Group Internal Audit function\n\nThe Group's Internal Audit function provides the Group Audit Committee and the Group's Management Committee with independent and objective assurance on the e/ff ectiveness of the overall control environment across the Group.\n\nThe Global Head of Internal Audit reports to the Chair of the AXA Group Audit Committee and to the Group Deputy Chief Executive O/ff icer and General Secretary.\n\nAll Internal Audit teams across the Group report to the Global Head of Internal Audit whilst also having a direct and unfettered reporting line to their local Audit Committee Chair and an administrative reporting line within their local management structure.\n\nThe Group's Internal Audit function exists to help the Board and Executive Management protect the assets, reputation and sustainability of the organization by providing an independent and objective assurance activity designed to add value and improve the organization's operations. It helps the organization meet its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to challenge Executive Management and evaluate the e/ff ectiveness of Risk Management, control and governance processes.",

The plan is formally reviewed and its performance formally monitored by the Group Audit Committee.\n\nOver the audit cycle, all applicable audit universe components for each entity are expected to be audited. Any exceptions identified are notified to the Audit Committee.\n\nA report is issued at the conclusion of each audit assignment to the relevant senior management. The results of the audits and resolution status of internal audit issues are presented to the relevant Audit Committee and Executive Management Committee on a regular basis.\n\n## Risk Management, Internal Control and Actuarial function at local level\n\nGovernance: the Group Governance Standards require, among other things, the Boards of AXA's main subsidiaries to establish an Audit Committee. The Audit Committees have a critical role in reviewing financial results and other financial information prepared by the management of these subsidiaries, financial reporting and control processes, critical accounting policies, specific accounting issues, key risks and systems of internal control, fraud and similar issues.\n\nIn addition, the Group has established Standards that apply to AXA/uni00A0SA and entities (including Joint ventures) where AXA has the majority of the voting rights, or has a minority interest but exercises control through other means such as management. They are mandatory for all Group entities within scope unless otherwise indicated. The Standards focus on critical requirements and form part of the overall Risk Management framework which allow the Group to have a clear understanding of risks, both locally and Group-wide.\n\nChief Executive O/ff icers are required to certify annually to the Group Chief Executive O/ff icer that to the best of their knowledge their entities comply with the Standards. Entity Boards must be formally informed of the Annual Certifications, together with any material breaches, areas of non-compliance and corresponding mitigation plans in order to monitor progress of remedial actions.\n\nRisk Management: Risk Management is a local responsibility, in accordance with GRM standards and guidelines. The roles and responsibilities of local Risk Management teams are validated jointly by the Executive Committees of local entities and the Group Chief Risk O/ff icer to ensure the alignment of central and local interests.\n\nThe minimum missions required for local Risk Management teams are:\n\n- /uni25A0 coordinating the second line of defense locally (which covers among others Compliance, Internal Control, Security) through a specific system of governance framework;\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.2/uni00A0INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n- /uni25A0 ensuring that the risk appetite is implemented with respect to all risks consistently with the Group's risk appetite, with enhanced reporting, risk limits and decision processes;\n- /uni25A0 providing a second opinion on key processes, such as the definition of characteristics for new products before launch, reserves, ALM studies &/uni00A0asset allocation and reinsurance strategies;\n- /uni25A0 with respect to the Internal Model, Risk Management checking the adequacy of the local risk profile, and implementing, testing and validating the Internal Model.\n\nLocal Chief Risk O/ff icers head the local Risk Management teams within each operational entity, and report both to their local Chief Executive O/ff icer and to the Group Chief Risk O/ff icer. They are independent from operations and Internal Audit Departments. Local Chief Risk O/ff icers regularly report to the local Board of Directors (or to a sub-Committee) on Risk Management matters.\n\nTheir teams are responsible for controlling and managing risks within Group policies and limits, and for validating investment or underwriting decisions through local Risk Committees. The Group Chief Risk O/ff icer chairs the Chief Risk O/ff icers' meeting composed of the Chief Risk O/ff icers of AXA's main subsidiaries, that meets on a quarterly basis and have monthly calls.\n\nInternal control: Internal control is a local responsibility in accordance with internal control Standard and Policy. Entities are expected to:\n\n- /uni25A0 define and document their controls and control procedures covering all important risks and processes (First line responsibility);\n- /uni25A0 regularly verify and challenge the e/ff ectiveness of the control environment (Second line responsibility);\n- /uni25A0 implement a comprehensive monitoring and reporting on internal control deficiencies at a senior level of the organization to ensure that these are rectified in an adequate and timely manner.\n\nLocal Heads of internal control (or equivalent) are independent from operations and report preferably to their local Chief Risk O/ff icer. Local Heads of internal control (or equivalent) regularly report to the local Executive Committee (or to a sub-Committee) on internal control matters.\n\nCompliance: the local Compliance functions are expected to undertake an annual Compliance Risk Assessment to identify the major compliance risks to which the business is exposed. Based on the Compliance Risk Assessment, an Annual Compliance Plan must be developed at the end of each/uni00A0year for the following/uni00A0year. The local Compliance function must directly report on a regular basis to local senior management and the local Audit Committee (or equivalent body), on significant compliance matters, including key compliance risks, major regulatory changes that have compliance implications, the Annual Compliance Plan,\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

Their role is, in the same way as for the Group Actuarial f unction, defined in accordance with Article/uni00A048 of the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive.\n\nLocal Actuarial function holders produce an Actuarial report submitted to the administrative, management or supervisory body, at least annually. The Actuarial report identifies any deficiencies and gives recommendations as to how such deficiencies should be remediated.\n\nLocal Actuarial function holders alert the local Executive Committee/Board of Directors and Group Actuarial function holder on any major deficiency on their area of responsibility.\n\nThe Group Actuarial function holder chairs the Chief Actuaries meeting composed of the local Actuarial function holders, that meets on a regular basis.\n\n## FINANCIAL REPORTING, DISCLOSURE, CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\n## Scope of responsibilities\n\nThe PBRC Department within the Group Finance Department is responsible for consolidation, management reporting, as well as actuarial indicators and Solvency/uni00A0II Own Funds. These missions are performed for regular closings, forecasts and strategic plan exercises. PBRC works with local PBR units within the Finance Departments of Group subsidiaries.\n\nThe local PBR units are responsible for producing their respective contribution to the Group Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nPBRC's role encompasses the following principal activities:\n\n- /uni25A0 development of both accounting and reporting standards;\n- /uni25A0 managing process instructions with the subsidiaries for the various exercises;\n- /uni25A0 managing the Group's financial consolidation and reporting systems;\n- /uni25A0 producing  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and analyzing key performance indicators;\n- /uni25A0 developing and using management control tools;\n- /uni25A0 managing and consolidating the European Embedded Value processes, related actuarial indicators and the Solvency/uni00A0II Own Funds;\n\n- /uni25A0 coordinating the production of the Group's Annual Reports filed with the AMF;\n- /uni25A0 coordinating the production of reports filed with the ACPR related to Solvency/uni00A0II;\n- /uni25A0 liaising with the Statutory Auditors and contributing to Audit Committee meetings as required; and\n- /uni25A0 fostering convergence of accounting and financial reporting processes, systems and organizations for insurance activities in Europe.\n\nPBRC has defined and implemented a set of policies and procedures to ensure that the consolidation process leading to the consolidated financial statements is timely and accurate. This consolidation process is based on the following:\n\n## Definition of standards and use of a/uni00A0centralized information system\n\nGroup accounting standards, which are consistent with accounting and regulatory principles, are set forth in the 'AXA Group Accounting Manual' and updated regularly by PBRC experts. These guidelines are submitted to AXA's Statutory Auditors for review before being made available to AXA's subsidiaries.\n\nThe Group's consolidation and reporting processes are based on a central information system 'Magnitude'. This tool is managed and updated by a dedicated team. This system is also used to deliver the management reporting information and the Solvency/uni00A0II Own Funds. The process through which this management reporting information and the Solvency/uni00A0II Own Funds are produced and validated is the same as the one used to prepare consolidated financial information.\n\n## Operating control mechanisms\n\nAt entity level, AXA's subsidiaries are responsible for recording and controlling accounting and financial data that comply with the AXA Group Accounting Manual and reflect consolidation rules under IFRS/uni00A0accounting standards. In this respect, the Chief Financial O/ff icer of each entity signs o/ff  on the accuracy of their respective contribution to the consolidated figures reported through 'Magnitude' and their compliance with both the AXA Group Accounting Manual and instructions in all frameworks produced (IFRS, European Embedded Value, actuarial indicators and Solvency/uni00A0II Own Funds) within the internal financial control program.\n\nAt PBRC level, accounting, financial and economic information reported by entities are analyzed by teams that liaise with subsidiaries on a full-time basis. In particular, these teams analyze the compliance with the AXA Group Accounting Manual and Group actuarial standards.",

        "page_content": "## Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (ICOFR)\n\nThe AXA Group's ICOFR is a process designed under the supervision of the Group Chief Financial O/ff icer and the Group Chief Risk O/ff icer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn that context, and based on the Group Internal Control Standard, the Group has implemented a comprehensive program managed by Group Risk Management, entitled Internal Financial Control (IFC), to ensure that the Group Chief Executive O/ff icer has a reasonable basis to conclude that AXA Group's ICOFR is e/ff  ective as of the end of each financial/uni00A0year.\n\nThe IFC program is based on the Group's IFC Standard, which is an internal control and governance standard based on the 'Internal Control -/uni00A0Integrated Framework' issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). It is designed to ensure consistency and quality in AXA Group's financial reporting and provide an overall framework for the annual IFC program precising the scope of application and governance.\n\nThe entities in IFC scope are required to document their significant processes and key controls, as well as the rationale of how the associated risk of material misstatement due to error or fraud can be reduced to an acceptable level. This is performed under the supervision of the Chief Financial O/ff icer, sponsor of the IFC program. The independent Internal Financial Control function, anchored within Risk Management for most entities, is in charge of testing the design and operational e/ff ectiveness of those key controls, and ensuring that identified control deficiencies are remediated.\n\nAt each/uni00A0 year-end, the in-scope entities must perform an evaluation of their ICOFR as part of an internal certification process, involving formal sign-o/ff  by process owners and with a formal management report from the entity's Chief Financial O/ff icer and Chief Risk O/ff icer stating their conclusion as to the e/ff  ectiveness of the entity's ICOFR.\n\n## Disclosure controls and procedures\n\nThe Group has implemented a formal internal review and sign-o/ff process pursuant to which all Management Committee members, Chief Financial O/ff icers and certain other senior executives are required to certify various matters covered in AXA's Universal Registration Document.\n\nThis process is based on the following four pillars:\n\n- 1. Chief Financial Officer Sign-Off Certificates, which are required to be submitted by all local Chief Financial O/ff icers to PBRC, together with the required subsidiary financial reporting and consolidation information;\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.2/uni00A0INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n- 2. IFC Management reports are required to be submitted by the Chief Financial O/ff icer or another senior executive of every in-scope entity, as part of the IFC program dedicated to ICOFR;\n- 3. Disclosure Controls &/uni00A0Procedures certificates, which are required to be submitted by AXA's Management Committee members, Chief Financial O/ff icers and certain other senior executives pursuant to which each of these executives is required to review the Group's Universal Registration Document and formally certify/uni00A0 (i) the accuracy and completeness of the information in the Annual Report with respect to the companies under his/her responsibility, and (ii) the e/ff ectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and ICOFR at companies under his/her responsibility (with specific disclosure of any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses). In addition, as part of this 'sub-certification' process, these executives are required to review and comment on a number of cross-sectional disclosures in the Universal Registration Document relating to risk and other matters;\n- 4. Chief Financial Officer Sign-Off certificates on the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: PBRC provides Chief Financial O/ff icers with the contribution of the entities under their responsibility to the Consolidated Financial Statements in order to facilitate their certification on the accuracy and completeness of the information in the Universal Registration Document of the Group.\n\nFor further information, please refer to Appendix I 'Management's annual evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting' of this Annual Report.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThe Group has established a comprehensive system of internal control procedures and mechanisms that M anagement believes appropriate and adapted to its business and the global scale of its operations.\n\nHowever, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and cannot provide absolute certainty or guarantee against the materialization of risks and control failures. Even systems determined to be effective by the M anagement may not prevent or detect all human errors, all system malfunctions, all fraud or all misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

At Group level, the Group Chief Risk O/ff icer is responsible for developing the ORSA policy, implementing the ORSA process and coordinating the ORSA reporting.\n\nThe ORSA policy defines minimum standards for assessing and reporting own risks and Solvency to be applied across the Group. Adherence to this policy is expected to be promoted and monitored by all entity heads of Risk Management Department (Chief Risk O/ff icers).\n\nThe Group ORSA report is reviewed annually by the Solvency/uni00A0II Committee and then presented, first, to the ARCC and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and finally to the Board of Directors, which approves the conclusions of the Group ORSA report and authorizes its filing with the ACPR.\n\nBeyond the annual ORSA report, a quarterly assessment is performed to update the Group's risk profile against Risk Appetite limits and adapt management actions accordingly. This information is reported to the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors and to the ARCC which regularly reviews all material audit, risk and compliance issues faced by the Group.\n\n## PURPOSE AND CONTENT\n\nORSA encompasses processes to identify, assess, monitor, manage and report the short to medium term risks to which the Group is exposed and to ensure the adequacy of the level of own funds within the Group Solvency targets, taking into account the Group's risk profile, as well as approved risk appetite limits and business strategy. As an important component of the Risk Management system, it is intended to give a comprehensive and complete vision of the risks embedded in the businesses of the Group on a continuous basis.\n\nORSA mainly encompasses Risk Management and financial activities, which are organized around  the following processes:\n\n- /uni25A0 Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) &/uni00A0Eligible Own Funds (EOF) quarterly calculation;\n- /uni25A0 liquidity risk reporting;\n- /uni25A0 strategic planning and financial projections;\n- /uni25A0 risk appetite process;\n- /uni25A0 stress and scenario testing analysis and monitoring; and\n- /uni25A0 reputation, regulatory, emerging and strategic risk assessment and review.\n\nThe ORSA report provides an assessment on:\n\n- /uni25A0 the overall Solvency needs through the measurement of quantifiable risks considering risk mitigation actions implemented in current economic context and approved business strategy detailed in the 'Driving Progress 2023' strategic plan and within approved risk appetite limits. Stress scenario analyses are performed to ensure adequacy of the economic capital assessed. This is supported by the Enterprise Risk Management system, including the identification, monitoring and management of non-quantifiable risks;\n- /uni25A0 the compliance, on a continuous basis, with/uni00A0(i) regulatory capital requirements, through the assessment of the ability to meet capital requirements using the approved Internal Model, in compliance with the Solvency/uni00A0II regulatory standard, as well as (ii) requirements regarding technical provisions. Stress scenario analyses are performed to ensure adequacy of the economic capital assessed. Also, the extensive use of the Internal Model outputs for key decision-making processes provides a feedback loop for improving the modelling according to the evolution of the risk profile;\n- /uni25A0 the significance with which the risk profile of the AXA Group deviates from the assumptions underlying the SCR calculated on the basis of the Internal Model. Extensive validation tests are performed to assess the relevance of the Internal Model and the model error. Limitations of the Internal Model and evolution plan resulting from the validation activities are presented.\n\nI\n\nI",

The internal model of the Group (the 'Internal Model') is used in its Risk Management systems and decision-making processes. The ACPR has approved the use by the Group of its Internal Model to calculate its SCR since Solvency/uni00A0II is in force. The Internal Model encompasses the use of AXA Group's economic capital model on all material entities, including entities that were part of the XL G roup AXA acquired in 2018/uni00A0('XL entities').\n\nAXA continues to review regularly the scope, underlying methodologies and assumptions of the Internal Model and will adjust its SCR accordingly. In addition, AXA's Internal Model has been and may be revised from time to time in accordance with applicable regulations. However, any major change to the Internal Model would be subject to the prior approval of the ACPR, which may require adjustments to the level of SCR. In addition, the Group monitors EIOPA's work program which, through its objectives, is also expected to continue to carry out consistency reviews of European insurers' internal models. Such review may lead to further regulatory changes to increase convergence and to strengthen oversight of cross-border groups, as well as changes to internal models and Solvency/uni00A0II capital requirements.\n\nThe Group's main goal in using its Internal Model as opposed to the Solvency/uni00A0II standard formula is to better reflect the Group's risk profile in its SCR. This is reflected through several objectives:\n\n- /uni25A0 taking into account local specificities -/uni00A0the Group is a global company, and caters to a wide range of insurance markets with a variety of products o/ff ered targeting certain demographics and with di/ff ering risk exposures. It is therefore appropriate, to the extent possible, to calibrate stresses specific for these risk profiles and to allow for the benefits of diversification of risks which arise as a result of being spread over these markets;\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.2/uni00A0INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n- /uni25A0 addressing shortcomings inherent to the standard formula -/uni00A0 based on its expertise, the Group can improve on the approach of the standard formula (which is naturally constrained by its general scope and which does not cover all measurable risks) and have models more appropriate to the scope of the Group; and\n- /uni25A0 allowing for better evolution of the model over time -/uni00A0as the Group's experience increases, business expands to new markets and product innovations create di/ff erent risks to consider, the flexibility of an internal model allows the specificities of these developments to be reflected.\n\nThe Internal Model is based on a common definition of risks used consistently throughout the Group. It aims to ensure that the Company risk mapping is comprehensive and is followed in a consistent way across the Company and that e/ff icient procedures and reporting are in place so that roles and responsibilities are allocated to identify, measure, monitor, manage and report key risks.\n\nThe Group risk grid/uni00A0 (2) aims to identify all material risks applicable to the Company's insurance businesses. The Internal Model is intended to capture all material risks to which the Group is exposed from the risk assessment performed at sub-risk level to the overall aggregation of risk categories.\n\nThe underlying methodologies and assumptions used in the economic capital model are regularly reviewed to ensure that they accurately reflect the AXA Group's risk profile and new methods are developed and integrated regularly (in accordance with the Internal Model change policy).\n\nThe SCR, calculated on the basis of the Internal Model, represents the value at risk of G roup EOF at the 99.5 th /uni00A0percentile over a oneyear horizon. In other words, the Solvency Capital Requirement is the capital needed to sustain an extreme shock likely to occur with a 0.5% probability ( i.e. a 1/uni00A0in 200/uni00A0years event). It aims at including all material quantifiable risks (market, credit, insurance and operational) and reflecting the Group's diversified profile.\n\nIn addition to the risks that impact the SCR through the Internal Model calculation, the Group also monitors its liquidity risk, reputation risk, strategic risk and regulatory risks as well as emerging threats.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

The Solvency/uni00A0II Committee is supported by risk technical working groups reviewing changes proposed to the Internal Model and\n\npresenting conclusions of these diligences to the Solvency/uni00A0II Committee. The Solvency/uni00A0II Committee also reviews the Internal Model validation and model change processes, and liaises with local governance. It also reviews the conclusions of the regular validation activities.\n\n## INTERNAL MODEL VALIDATION\n\nThe Group has implemented and documented a validation process of its Internal Model to monitor its performance and continued adequacy. This process and associated governance are documented in the Group validation policy, endorsed by the ARCC.\n\nThe  Group  validation  policy  is  supplemented  by  local validation policies specifying the local validation activities and responsibilities.\n\nValidation does not only apply to the quantitative aspects of the model (input data, theory &/uni00A0methodology, parameters &/uni00A0 assumptions,  data,  results)  but  also  encompasses the qualitative aspects of the model: expert judgment, documentation, model governance, use test, systems/IT.\n\nRisk Management performs regular integrated validation activities, described in the Internal Model validation policy, mostly organized around:\n\n- /uni25A0 validation of the model structure, modelling choices, parameters and assumptions; and\n- /uni25A0 validation of the Solvency Capital Requirement calculation and results.\n\nThese tasks are performed mostly within the Risk Management Departments in charge of the model, through controls and validation activities using validation tools such as sensitivity tests, back testing, scenario testing, and stability analysis and any other relevant activity.\n\nThese validation procedures are complemented by independent challenge and validation of assumptions, key parameters and results through Committees (including assumptions Committees, calibration Committees and clearance Committees) intended to provide an adequate level of expertise and seniority.\n\nIn  particular,  Group  Risk  Management  teams  provide independent testing of the local model choices, local parameters, assumptions or calibration as well as local results.\n\nApart from this fully integrated validation, sanctioned by the Group Chief Risk O/ff icer's review and sign-o/ff , a comprehensive independent review process has been defined and implemented to provide adequate comfort to AXA Group Management and Board of Directors that the model and its outputs meet a 'fit for purpose' standard.\n\nI\n\nI",

IMR controls are performed on a 3-year rolling basis, independently from closing agenda.\n\nBoth IMR and IFC are fully independent from the development, the governance and the processing of the Internal Model.\n\nAt the end of the annual validation process, the Board of Directors is provided with a report summarizing the conclusions of the internal review by Risk Management and the conclusion of the independent review by IMR and IFC as well as a review by an independent third party.\n\n## Governance of investment strategy and Asset &/uni00A0Liability Management (ALM)\n\nThe AXA Group, as an insurance group, follows an investment strategy mainly driven by Asset &/uni00A0Liability Management (ALM). The overall objectives of all investment decisions made within the Group are to meet its obligations and commitments to policyholders, to protect the solvency of the Group's entities, and to generate superior return over time.\n\n## GROUP AND LOCAL GUIDANCE ON/uni00A0INVESTMENTS\n\nThe Group Chief Investment O/ff icer (Group CIO) heads the Groupwide community of local insurance companies CIOs, the central Investment &/uni00A0ALM Department and reports to the Group Chief Financial O/ff icer. His role includes aligning AXA's investment strategy with the broader strategy of the Group, fostering closer cooperation amongst local entities, enhancing investment expertise and methodology, and steering investment decisions.\n\nLocal investment &/uni00A0ALM activities are steered by local CIOs. Local CIOs manage local portfolios, aiming at an optimized riskreturn ratio, maintain reporting lines to the Group, and manage close relationships with asset managers and local stakeholders. Moreover, they are responsible for the investment performance and for implementing and executing a sound Asset Liability Management.\n\n## GROUP AND LOCAL GOVERNANCE BODIES\n\nIn order to e/ff iciently coordinate local and global investment processes, decisions within the Group's investment community are taken by two main governance bodies:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Group Investment Committee, which is chaired by the Group Chief Financial Officer. This Committee defines the Group's investment strategy, steers tactical asset allocation, evaluates new investment opportunities and monitors the Group's investment performance; and\n- /uni25A0 the Group Financial Risk Committee is co-chaired by the Group Chief Financial O/ff icer and the Group Chief Risk O/ff icer. The Group Chief Investment O/ff icer is also member of this Committee (please refer to the paragraph 'Audit Risk and Compliance Committee' above).\n\nAt the entity level, each insurance company has a local Investment and ALM Committee whose terms of reference are approved by the local Executive Committees.\n\nThese Committees are responsible for, inter alia , defining the entity's Strategic Asset Allocation, approving and monitoring investments, meeting local compliance obligations and reviewing the participation in investment proposals syndicated by the Group, as well as local investment proposals.\n\n## ALM STUDIES AND STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION\n\nALM aims to match assets with the liabilities generated by the sale of insurance policies. The objective is to define the optimal asset allocation so that all liabilities can be met with the highest degree of confidence while maximizing the expected investment return.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.2/uni00A0INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nALM studies are performed by the Investment &/uni00A0ALM Department with the support of internal asset managers when appropriate and a second opinion is provided by the Risk Management Department. They use methodologies and modelling tools that develop deterministic and stochastic scenarios, embedding policyholders' behavior considerations for the liabilities, financial market evolution for the assets and taking into account existing interaction between the two. This process aims at maximizing expected returns given a defined level of risk. Furthermore, a series of additional constraints are taken into account, such as Solvency/uni00A0II economic capital model considerations, earnings stability, protection of the solvency margin, preservation of liquidity, as well as local and consolidated capital adequacy and requirement.\n\nALM constraints are also taken into account when new insurance products are being designed as part of the product approval process (see Section/uni00A05.6/uni00A0'Insurance risks -/uni00A0Product approval' of this Annual Report).\n\nAt the entity level, the strategic asset allocation issued from the ALM study must be reviewed by local Risk Management, and verified against predefined risk appetite limits, before being approved by the local Investment and ALM Committee.\n\n## INVESTMENT APPROVAL PROCESS\n\nInvestment opportunities, like non-standard investments, new strategies or new structures, are subject to an Investment Approval Process (IAP) in line with the third pillar of the Group Risk Management principles which provides for a systematic second opinion on key processes. The IAP ensures key characteristics of the investment are analyzed, such as risk and return expectations, experience and expertise of the investment management teams, as well as accounting, tax, legal and reputational issues.\n\nThe IAP is completed at Group level for any significant investment, depending on the investment size and the number of entities participating in it. The successful completion of an IAP is done a/f\\_t er the production of a second independent opinion by Group Risk Management. The IAP is used and completed at local level to cover local regulatory characteristics (including tax and statutory accounting).\n\nLocal IAP is also run for investments in new asset classes for local entities under the same principles.\n\n## GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK FOR DERIVATIVES\n\nProducts involving hedging programs based on derivative instruments are designed and executed with the support of dedicated teams at AXA Investment Managers and AXA/uni00A0SA. In a similar way, this set-up ensures that all entities benefit from technical expertise, legal protection and good execution of such transactions within the following governance framework for derivatives.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nDerivative strategies are reviewed by local Investment and ALM Committees. In addition, there is a segregation of duties between those responsible for making investment decisions, executing transactions, processing trades and instructing the custodian. This segregation of duties aims in particular at avoiding conflicts of interest.\n\nThe market risks arising from derivatives are regularly monitored taking into account the Group's various constraints (such as risk appetite and Internal Model).\n\nSuch monitoring is designed to ensure market risks, arising from cash or derivative instruments, are properly controlled and remain within approved limits.\n\nLegal risk is addressed by defining a standardized master agreement. The Group's business units may trade derivatives only if they are covered by legal documentation which complies with the requirements set out in the Group standards. Any change to certain mandatory provisions defined in the Group standards must be approved by GRM.\n\nAdditionally, there is a centralized counterparty risk policy. GRM has established rules on authorized counterparties, minimum requirements regarding collateral and counterparty exposure limits.\n\nThe operational risk related to derivatives is measured and managed in the context of the Group's global operational risk framework. Furthermore, execution and management of derivatives are centralized within dedicated teams, reducing the AXA Group's operational risk.\n\nValuation Risk is also addressed through the use of dedicated teams, within the Group's asset managers and banks. They independently counter-valuate the derivatives positions so as to achieve appropriate accounting, payment and collateral management. They also challenge the prices proposed by counterparties in the event that the applicable AXA entity wishes to initiate, terminate or restructure derivatives. Such capacity in pricing requires strong expertise, which relies on rigorous market analysis and the ability to follow the most up-to-date market developments for new derivatives instruments.\n\n## INVESTMENT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT\n\nFor a large proportion of its assets, the Group utilizes the services of asset managers to invest in the market:\n\n- /uni25A0 local AXA companies assign the day-to-day management of their asset portfolios primarily to AXA's Asset Management subsidiaries, i.e. AXA Investment Managers and Architas. Local CIOs continuously monitor, analyze, and challenge asset managers' performances; and\n- /uni25A0 in order to benefit from a more asset-specific and/or geographical expertise, the Group may also decide to invest through external asset managers. In such event, thorough due diligence analyses are performed by the Investment and the Risk Management communities and a continuous monitoring is implemented at both Group and Local levels.",

Only information referred to in Note/uni00A04/uni00A0is covered by the report of the Statutory Auditors on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nInformation in this Section should be read in conjunction with the paragraph 'Market-related risks' in Section/uni00A05.1/uni00A0'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\nAXA Group is exposed to financial market risks through its core business of financial protection ( i.e. insurance) and through the financing of its activities as part of its equity and debt management.\n\nThe market risks to which Property &/uni00A0Casualty (P&C), Life &/uni00A0Savings (L&S) and Health portfolios are exposed arise from a variety of factors including:\n\n- /uni25A0 a decline in market returns may cause us to accelerate amortization of deferred acquisition costs, value of business in-force and other intangibles;\n- /uni25A0 a decline in returns on assets (linked to a sustained fall in yields on fixed income investments or to lower equity markets) could reduce investment margins on General Account products or fees on Unit-Linked contracts and impact the performance of asset managers;\n- /uni25A0 a change in yields on fixed-income investments (linked to changes in interest rates or in credit spreads) a/ff ects the market value of investments and liabilities and could impact adversely the Group's solvency position, and increase policyholder's surrenders due to competitive pressures;\n- /uni25A0 a decline in asset market value (relating, for example, to equity, real estate, or alternatives,/uni00A0etc.) could adversely impact the Group's solvency position, as well as available surplus;\n- /uni25A0 a change in foreign-exchange rates would have limited impact for the operating units since foreign-currency commitments are matched to a large extent by assets in the same currency or covered by hedges, but it could affect the earnings contribution in euros;\n- /uni25A0 furthermore, Health and Property &/uni00A0Casualty activities are subject to inflation which may increase the compensation payable to policyholders, so that the actual payments may exceed the associated reserves set aside. This risk can be significant for long-tail businesses but is managed through regular pricing adjustments or specific protections against peaks of inflation.\n\nThe Group policies implemented to manage these risks are tailored to each product type and the risks relating to it.\n\nThe main market risks to which the AXA Group is exposed are the following:\n\n- /uni25A0 interest-rate risk, spread risk and equity risk related to the operating activities of Group subsidiaries;\n- /uni25A0 exchange-rate risk related to the operating activities of Group subsidiaries; and\n- /uni25A0 risks relating to the management of holding companies' exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and debt.\n\nAXA Group's exposure to market risks is covered by AXA Group's Solvency Capital Requirement metric, as detailed in the paragraph 'Internal Model' in Section/uni00A05.2/uni00A0'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report and is taken into account in AXA's Liquidity Risk Management framework (please refer to Section/uni00A05.5/uni00A0'Liquidity Risk' of this Annual Report).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

This approach aims to allow a swift reaction in an accurate and targeted manner to changes in financial markets, political and economic environments in which the Group operates.\n\nA wide variety of Risk Management techniques are used to control and mitigate the market risks to which the Group is exposed. These techniques, used primarily in all operating subsidiaries, include:\n\n- /uni25A0 local risk appetite governance and processes, including functional limits on market risks defined locally and approved by the local Board or Executive Committee;\n- /uni25A0 Asset &/uni00A0Liability Management (ALM), i.e. defining an optimal strategic asset allocation with respect to the liabilities' structure in order to reduce the risk to a desired level;\n- /uni25A0 a  disciplined  investment  process,  requiring  for  any sophisticated investment a formal thorough analysis by the Investment Department, and a second opinion by Risk Management;\n- /uni25A0 hedging of financial risks when they exceed the tolerance levels set by the Group. Operational management of derivatives is based on stringent rules and is mainly performed by AXA/uni00A0SA for the holding company activities and AXA Investment Managers for operating units;\n- /uni25A0 a regular monitoring of the financial risks on the Group Solvency/uni00A0II ratio; and\n- /uni25A0 reinsurance which also o/ff ers solutions to mitigate certain financial risks.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nAs regards the market risks relating to the management of holding companies' foreign exchange and interest rates exposure, the following Risk Management measures have been defined and implemented.\n\nFor the purpose of optimizing the financial management and control of financial risks linked to AXA/uni00A0SA and its sub-holding companies, the Group Corporate Finance and Treasury Department has defined a methodology to monitor and assess financial risks.\n\nThe policy on the management of holding companies' interest rate risk aims at monitoring and limiting the potential mediumterm variation in interest expenses and consequently at partially protecting future levels of interest expenses against movements in interest rates. Regarding foreign exchange risk, the implemented policy's objective is to limit variations in net foreign currency-denominated assets resulting from movements in exchange rates. The purpose of the policy is therefore to protect partially the value of AXA's net foreign-currency investments in its subsidiaries to the extent of the following/uni00A0year's foreseeable dividends and more generally the exposure of AXA/uni00A0SA's liquidity to FX movements.\n\nAXA regularly monitors its exchange rate hedging strategy and will continue to review its e/ff ectiveness and the potential need to adapt it taking into account impacts on earnings, value, solvency, gearing ratio and liquidity.\n\nThe Group Corporate Finance and Treasury Department is in charge of producing reporting data that consolidate interest rate, foreign exchange and liquidity risk exposures, as well as the interest expenses of AXA/uni00A0SA and its sub-holdings. This reporting also includes medium-term forecasts.\n\nSynthetic reports, including information about hedging strategies, are sent to and reviewed by the Finance Committee of AXA's Board of Directors five times a/uni00A0year.",

These analyses quantify the potential impact on the Group of positive and adverse changes in financial markets.\n\nAXA Group analyzes sensitivities to movements in interest rates and equity markets looking at two di/ff erent measures:\n\n- /uni25A0 sensitivities of the Group Eligible Own Funds (EOF), as described below;\n- /uni25A0 sensitivities of Group Solvency/uni00A0II ratio (please refer to Section/uni00A05.2/uni00A0'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report/uni00A0 (1) .\n\nEligible Own Funds represent the amount of economic capital available to absorb losses under stress events. The EOF are the surplus of assets over liabilities derived from the Solvency/uni00A0II balance sheet.\n\nAXA Group Risk Management is monitoring EOF sensitivities and the EOF is derived from IFRS/uni00A0shareholders' equity.\n\nThe following table presents the reconciliation between IFRS/uni00A0shareholders' equity to group EOF:\n\n| Reconciliation IFRS/uni00A0shareholders' equity (a)  EOF  (in Euro/uni00A0billion)   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| IFRS/uni00A0shareholders' equity (a)                                                 | 71.1   |\n| Net URCG not included in shareholders' equity                                        | 6.5    |\n| Elimination TSS/TSDI                                                                 | (6.7)  |\n| Elimination Intangibles                                                              | (31.3) |\n| o/w Goodwill                                                                         | (17.1) |\n| o/w DAC                                                                              | (10.5) |\n| o/w VBI                                                                              | (0.7)  |\n| o/w Others                                                                           | (3.1)  |\n| IFRS/uni00A0tangible net asset value (a)                                             | 39.6   |\n| Dividends to be paid (b)                                                             | (4.4)  |\n| Technical provision adjustments                                                      | 10.4   |\n| o/w Risk Margin                                                                      | (11.0) |\n| o/w BEL                                                                              | 21.4   |\n| Other adjustments                                                                    | (1.4)  |\n| Unrestricted TIER 1                                                                  | 44.2   |\n| Restricted Tier 1/uni00A0+ Tier 2                                                    | 17.3   |\n| Tier 3                                                                               | 0.5    |\n| Group Eligible Own Funds (c)                                                         | 62.0   |\n\n- (a)  Group share.\n- (b)  Dividends to be paid in/uni00A0year N+1/uni00A0and provisions for share buy-back.\n- (c) Including minority interests.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

This aggregate however reflects the IFRS/uni00A0accounting value of liabilities and not their economic value which is better reflected within Solvency/uni00A0II EOF.\n\nThe main elements of the reconciliation between the IFRS/uni00A0TNAV and the group EOF Unrestricted Tier 1/uni00A0are as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 deduction of \u20ac4.4/uni00A0billion of foreseeable dividends which consist of/uni00A0(i) the dividends to be paid to shareholders in 2022 of \u20ac3.6/uni00A0billion and (ii) the provision for the portion of the \u20ac1.7/uni00A0billion share buyback executed in 2022 of \u20ac0.8/uni00A0billion;\n- /uni25A0 addition of \u20ac10.4/uni00A0billion reflecting the Solvency/uni00A0II technical provision adjustments corresponding to the adjustment from IFRS/uni00A0reserves to best estimate liabilities (\u20ac+21.4/uni00A0billion) and the risk margin (\u20ac-11.0/uni00A0billion); and\n- /uni25A0 other adjustments between IFRS/uni00A0TNAV and group EOF Unrestricted Tier 1/uni00A0(\u20ac-1.4/uni00A0billion).\n\nGroup EOF are then the sum of Unrestricted Tier 1, Restricted Tier 1, Tier 2/uni00A0and Tier 3.\n\nInformation on the group EOF is disclosed in the 'Embedded Value &/uni00A0Solvency/uni00A0II Own Funds Report 2021' which is available on AXA Group website (www.axa.com).\n\nThe sensitivities of the EOF to changes in major economic assumptions were calculated as follows for the 2021/uni00A0values:\n\n- /uni25A0 upward shift of 50/uni00A0basis points in reference rates simulates a sudden shock to the initial conditions. This means changes to: 1) the current market values of fixed-interest assets, with related possible changes to projected capital gains/losses and/or fee revenues, 2) future reinvestment rates for all asset classes, and 3) discount rates. The change is applied to the reference interest rates, including the volatility adjuster where applied in the base case. Inflation rates, the volatility on interest rates and the Ultimate Forward Rates are not changed;\n- /uni25A0 downward shift of 50/uni00A0basis points in reference rates is the same as above but with a shi/f\\_t  downward;\n- /uni25A0 25% higher value of equity markets simulates a shock to the initial conditions for equities only. Listed equities and private equity values including the impact of equity hedges are shocked. This means changes to current market values of all these equities excluding hedge funds, with related possible changes to projected capital gains/losses and/or fee revenues;\n- /uni25A0 25% lower value of equity markets: same methodology as mentioned above assuming a decrease.\n\n| L&S EOF sensitivities   | 2021/uni00A0EOF (in Euro million)   | 2021/uni00A0EOF (in/uni00A0percentage)   |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Closing amount          | 44,744                              | 100%                                     |\n| Interest rates +50bps   | 1,752                               | 4%                                       |\n| Interest rates -50bps   | (2,787)                             | (6%)                                     |\n| Equity markets +25%     | 3,125                               | 7%                                       |\n| Equity markets -25%     | (3,343)                             | (7%)                                     |\n\n| P&C EOF sensitivities   | 2021/uni00A0EOF (in Euro million)   | 2021/uni00A0EOF (in percentage)   |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Closing amount          | 32,573                              | 100%                              |\n| Interest rates +50bps   | (62)                                | (0%)                              |\n| Interest rates -50bps   | 71                                  | 0%                                |\n| Equity markets +25%     | 1,354                               | 4%                                |\n| Equity markets -25%     | (1,270)                             | (4%)                              |\n\nI\n\nI",

However, this classical pattern is not followed everywhere, as for certain type of business with significantly low interest rate guarantees, the EOF behaves more like a portfolio of fixedincome assets.

Given the nature of its core business activities, AXA Group monitors three major types of counterparties, using methods suitable to each type:\n\n- /uni25A0 investment portfolios held by the Group's insurance operations (excluding assets backing separate-account products where\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe financial risk is borne by policyholders) as well as by banks and holding companies;\n\n- /uni25A0 receivables from reinsurers resulting from reinsurance ceded by the AXA Group; and\n- /uni25A0 credit and credit-sensitive exposures on third party obligors stemming  from  some  Group  insurance  and  assumed reinsurance businesses.\n\nAXA Group's exposure to credit risk is covered by AXA Group's Solvency Capital Requirement metric, as detailed in the paragraph 'Internal Model' in the Section/uni00A05.2/uni00A0'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report and is taken into account in AXA's liquidity Risk Management framework (please refer to Section/uni00A05.5/uni00A0'Liquidity risks' of this Annual Report).\n\n## I Risk control and risk mitigation\n\nFor more information on the AXA Group's risk controls and Risk Management processes, please refer to Section/uni00A05.2/uni00A0'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report.\n\nIn addition, AXA Group's investment strategy, which is mainly driven by Asset &/uni00A0Liability Management, aims to meet the Group's obligations and commitments to policyholders, and to protect the solvency of the Group and of its entities (please refer to paragraph 'Governance of investment strategy and Asset &/uni00A0 Liability Management (ALM)' in Section/uni00A05.2/uni00A0'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report).\n\nA specific set of limits take into account all AXA Group exposures on a given ultimate shareholder through debt securities, cash, equity, derivatives, reinsurance receivables, insurance and assumed reinsurance commitments. They aim at managing globally the default risk of a given counterparty.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## INVESTED ASSETS: A CENTRAL MONITORING OF COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE\n\nAXA Group concentration risk is monitored by di/ff erent analyses performed at Group level by issuer and ultimate shareholder, in addition to local procedures and by a set of Group and local issuer limits.\n\nThese limits aim at managing the default risk of a given issuer, depending on its rating and on the maturity and seniority of all bonds issued by the issuer and held by the AXA Group (corporate, Government agency and sub sovereign).\n\nOn sovereign exposures, specific limits have also been defined on government bonds and government-guaranteed bonds.\n\nCompliance with the limits is ensured by the Group through defined governance. The Group Credit Risk Committee handles, on a monthly basis, the issuer exposure breaches to the Group's limits and determines coordinated actions for excessive credit concentrations. A Group Credit Team reporting to the Group Chief Investment O/ff icer (Group CIO) provides credit analyses independently from Group asset managers, in addition to local CIO teams. The Group Financial Risk Committee is regularly kept informed of the main credit risks.",

The Group Security Committee meets monthly -/uni00A0and more frequently during renewal periods -/uni00A0and decides on any action to be taken with the aim of limiting AXA Group's exposure to the risk of default by any of its reinsurers.\n\nIn addition, the Group summarizes and analyzes its exposure to all reinsurers by factoring in all positions with reinsurers (claims, premiums, reserves, deposits, pledges and security deposits).\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe Group's top 50/uni00A0reinsurers accounted for 72% of reinsurers' share of insurance and investment contract liabilities in 2021/uni00A0( versus 61% in 2020).\n\nThe breakdown of all reserves ceded to reinsurers by reinsurer rating as of December/uni00A031, 2021/uni00A0(\u20ac40.5/uni00A0billion) was as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe 'Non-rated' caption relates to reserves ceded to reinsurance pools, reserves ceded to reinsurers with which the AXA Group does limited business (not in the top 50) and reinsurers not rated by the main rating agencies.\n\nAs at December/uni00A031, 2020, the breakdown of reserves ceded to reinsurers (\u20ac28.8/uni00A0billion) by reinsurer rating was: 34% in AA, 13% in A, 14% in BB and lower and 39% in Non-rated.\n\nThe increase in reserves ceded to reinsurers is mainly driven by new Loss Portfolio Transfers treaties in Hong Kong and at AXA XL, prior/uni00A0year long-tail lines and Natural Catastrophes.\n\n## CREDIT EXPOSURE STEMMING FROM INSURANCE AND ASSUMED REINSURANCE BUSINESSES\n\nThe AXA Group, following the acquisition of XL group, is also exposed to credit risk through various insurance and assumed reinsurance businesses that either:\n\n- /uni25A0 embed a credit component, such as Trade Credit Insurance, Political  Risk-Contract  Frustration,  Surety,  Mortgage Reinsurance; or",

Only information referred to in Note/uni00A04/uni00A0is covered by the report Statutory Auditors on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nInformation in this Section should be read in conjunction with the paragraph 'Pricing and underwriting-related risks' in Section/uni00A05.1/uni00A0'Risk factors' of this Annual Report.\n\nThe Group's insurance subsidiaries are primarily responsible for managing their insurance risks linked to underwriting, pricing and reserving. They are also responsible for taking appropriate actions in response to changes in insurance cycles and to the political and economic environments in which they operate.\n\nIn  the  context  of  its  Property  &/uni00A0 Casualty  (P&C)  and Protection &/uni00A0Health businesses operations as described in Section/uni00A01.3/uni00A0'Business overview' of this Annual Report, the AXA Group is exposed to the following main insurance risks, which include:\n\n- /uni25A0 premium risk resulting from fluctuations in the timing, frequency and severity of insured events, and relating to:\n- \u00b7 valuation of reserves for unexpired risks on existing contracts (insu/ff icient premium reserves),\n- \u00b7 mispricing of policies to be written (including renewals) during the period, and\n- \u00b7 expense payments;\n- /uni25A0 reserve risk resulting from fluctuations in the timing and amount of claim settlements and relating to the insu/ff iciency of claims reserves, which includes:\n- \u00b7 misestimating claims reserves (average payments), and\n- \u00b7 fluctuation of payments around their statistical average;\n- /uni25A0 catastrophe risks embedding both natural events such as climatic or meteorologic phenomena  (including windstorms, hurricanes, floods or hailstorms), tectonic ones (earthquakes, volcanoes) and man-made ones, such as nuclear, liability, cyber, conflagration, terrorist attacks.\n\nLife risks also include risks related to mortality, longevity, lapses, disability and pandemics among others. The main risks to which the Life business is exposed are longevity risk and lapse risk, which are both sensitive to changes in interest rates, and could be defined as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 longevity risk is the risk related to the overestimation of mortality rates for business contingent on longevity;\n- /uni25A0 lapse risk is the risk of experiencing lapses lower (or higher) than expected on a permanent basis for businesses adversely sensitive to a decrease (or an increase) in lapses.\n\nAXA Group's exposure to insurance risks is covered by the AXA Group's Solvency Capital Requirement metric, as detailed in the paragraph 'Internal Model' in Section/uni00A05.2/uni00A0'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report and is taken into account in AXA's liquidity Risk Management framework (please refer to Section/uni00A05.5/uni00A0'Liquidity risk' of this Annual Report).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

These  procedures  are  adapted  and implemented locally, and aim to foster product innovation across the Group while maintaining risks under control. The validation framework relies among others on the results of the Solvency Capital Requirement's assessments, based on the AXA Group's Internal Model, to ensure that new products undergo a thorough approval process before they are brought to market.\n\nIn Life &/uni00A0Savings, as well as Health, the Product Approval Process is managed at local level for all traditional products meeting Group's minimum requirements, which allows maintaining time-to-market product launches. For sophisticated products, local entities require Group's approval before launch to ensure all long-term commitments are monitored at Group level and benefit from the Group expertise on enhanced or specific guarantees.\n\nIn Property &/uni00A0Casualty, methods are adapted to the underwriting of risks, while maintaining the principle of local decision-making\n\nbased on a documented approval procedure and using the output of the internal model. The aim is twofold:\n\n- /uni25A0 for pre-launch business, the aim is to ensure that new risks underwritten by the Group have been scrutinized before proposing them to customers;\n- /uni25A0 for post-launch business, appropriate profitability and risk control are performed to verify that the business remains in line with the Group's risk framework.\n\nThis framework is part of the Group underwriting policy and ensures that no risks are taken outside the Group tolerances and that value is created by adequate risk pricing.\n\n## EXPOSURE ANALYSIS AND RISK ASSESSMENT\n\nAXA Group reviews regularly its exposure to ensure that the risks underwritten are diversified geographically and by lines of business in order to manage risk concentration, and to verify adequacy of reinsurance.\n\nFor Life &/uni00A0Savings, Health and Property &/uni00A0Casualty activities, AXA Group has developed and deployed common models and metrics to consistently measure risks throughout the Group (in particular via its economic capital framework as detailed in Section/uni00A0 5.2/uni00A0 'Internal Control and Risk Management' of the Annual Report. This enables the Group to verify that its exposure complies with consolidated risk appetite limits along the dimensions of earnings, Eligible Own Funds (EOF), solvency and liquidity. These tools also contribute substantially to monitoring the major risks (claims frequency deviation, claims severity, reinsurance, pricing consistency, natural and man-made catastrophes, biometric and behavior risks deviations).\n\nThis framework is included in the governance set out previously for product development control.\n\nIn the Life &/uni00A0Savings, Health businesses, these tools allow for mortality/longevity risks to be analyzed on a multi-country basis. The AXA Group regularly monitors its exposure to these risks (including mortality, longevity and morbidity) and uses the results of this work to optimize its product design and its reinsurance coverage. These exposure analyses are supported by expert risk models in Life &/uni00A0Savings.\n\nRegarding  the  Property  &/uni00A0 Casualty  exposures, ad  hoc concentration risk models (internal and external for natural catastrophe and for man-made catastrophe) are developed to ensure/uni00A0yearly natural catastrophe volatility, coming from events such as windstorm, earthquake, hurricane or typhoon, or catastrophe man-made events, such as cyber or liability ones, are not likely to a/ff ect the Group above the set tolerance levels.",

        "page_content": "Since 2015, the Group has strategically developed a strong in-house expertise of development and validation of natural catastrophe models to cope with their dynamic nature in the context of global climate change. This has been complemented by a reinforced and continuously enhanced expertise in the modelling of systemic events (without border in time and space) like Cyber.\n\n## CEDED REINSURANCE\n\nFor the Life &/uni00A0Savings, Health and Property &/uni00A0Casualty operations, reinsurance programs are set up as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 Group's operating entities reinsurance capacity are set in alignment with Group Standards and with their local risk appetite limits considering the risk assessment previously described;\n- /uni25A0 their risks are modeled through in-depth actuarial analyses conducted on each portfolio; specifically, for Property &/uni00A0 Casualty modelling, via the Group economic capital model, AXA uses several models both internal and external for assessing the risk associated with the main natural perils (storms, floods, earthquakes, etc. ).\n\n## Reinsurance strategy\n\nCentralization and harmonization of treaty reinsurance purchase is based on the same procedures for both the Life &/uni00A0Savings, Health businesses as for the Property &/uni00A0Casualty activities.\n\nIn order to build adjusted and optimized protection, the Group's operating entities are reinsured by AXA Global Re (AGRe) except for very specific cases notably for products developed in partnership with reinsurers in Life and Health and except for some AXA XL treaties (mainly quota share for specialties and for US portfolios) for which AXA XL contributes to placing directly part of its covers under AGRe's delegation and control.\n\nAGRe can place a variable part of the local treaties on the reinsurance market, for regulatory reasons for example. A portion of the risk exposure is retained and mitigated within AGRe through the internal Group covers (including through a pool mechanism for Property) and the remaining part is ceded to external reinsurers.\n\nAGRe is responsible for all Group external cessions. Since the acquisition of the XL group, AXA XL contributes to placing directly part of its covers under AGRe's delegation and control. 2022/uni00A0Group reinsurance protections ensure reaching risk appetite as in 2021/uni00A0and further limit the impacts of volatility (Nat Cat and man-made) induced by frequency of mid-size events.\n\nThese protections consist of major Group covers (CAT covering direct business and assumed reinsurance business from AXA XL,\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.6/uni00A0INSURANCE RISKS\n\nProperty Per Risk, International Liability, Marine, Cyber, Motor Third Party Liability and Life) and various AXA XL-dedicated covers which contribute to further decrease the net retention of AXA XL and limit its own volatility ( e.g. Aviation, US Liability, Political risks).\n\nThe structures of Group covers are designed to adequately protect the Group in compliance with the Group risk appetite framework. Specific proportional and non-proportional covers are arranged through either the traditional reinsurance market or capital markets (cat bonds and Insurance Linked Securities -/uni00A0ILS) both on an indemnity and industry loss index basis.\n\nAs opposed to the other Group covers where the Group retention is kept by AXA Global Re, in 2021, 95% of the Property Pool/uni00A0yearend financial result net of external reinsurance protections is retroceded back to local entities, through a pool mechanism managed by AGRe on behalf of those local entities.\n\nAXA also uses capital market solutions also known as InsuranceLinked Securities (ILS), such as catastrophe bonds, as part of the overall reinsurance strategy. The use of ILS may not provide the same level of protection as traditional reinsurance, and the protections provided may vary depending on the region in which the loss occurred, or the number of events that make up the loss. Like traditional reinsurance, the accessibility of the ILS market may be impacted by disruptions, volatility or uncertainty, such as those that may arise following a major catastrophic event. Also, to the extent that AXA uses ILS products providing reinsurance protections based on an industry loss index rather than on its actual incurred losses, such transactions could result in a larger or lower residual loss than anticipated.\n\nFinally, in addition to the analyses described above, AGRe regularly monitors its credit exposure and other AXA entities' credit exposures to reinsurers, to ensure that consolidated limits remain within Group risk tolerance (see Section/uni00A05.4/uni00A0'Credit Risk\n\n- -/uni00A0Receivables from reinsurers' of this Annual Report).\n\n## TECHNICAL RESERVES\n\nOperational entities specifically monitor their reserve risks. Claims reserves are estimated and booked on a file by file basis by the claims handlers. Additional reserves are also booked by the local entities.\n\nThe additional reserves' calculations are carried out locally by a two-independent-opinion process.\n\nActuaries in charge of assessing reserves use various statistical and actuarial methods. Their assumptions are made following discussions with claims managers, pricing actuaries, underwriters and other specialized departments.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

Its implementation is not limited to insurance activities. It encompasses all AXA entities, including insurance companies, banking activities, AXA IM and internal service providers consistent with AXA policy on operational Risk Management.\n\nBoth quantitative and qualitative requirements are defined:\n\n- /uni25A0 across the Group, the most critical operational risks of each entity and a set of stress scenarios are identified and assessed following a forward-looking and expert-opinion approach. These risk scenarios are then used to estimate the capital requirement needed to cover operational risks based on advanced models based on Solvency/uni00A0II principles. The operational Risk Management process is embedded into local governance through senior management validation to ensure that the risk assessment is adequate, appropriate and comprehensive but also to ensure that adequate corrective and pre-emptive actions are defined and implemented in respect of the main risks;\n- /uni25A0 in addition, a loss data collection process is in place within most companies of the Group in order to track and appropriately mitigate actual operational risk losses. This process is also used as a valuable source of information to back-test the assumptions taken in risk assessments.\n\nA key objective of the AXA Group's operational risk economic capital model is to understand and reduce losses resulting from operational failures and to define an appropriate risk response strategy for major operational risk scenarios. Entities and Group Operational Risk profiles are presented to local/Group Risk Committees for decisions and actions to be taken.\n\nIn 2021, the Group Operational Risk Profile is reasonably well spread out with all seven operational risk categories covered and the main risks being the following:\n\n- /uni25A0 transaction  capture,  execution  and  maintenance  risk is a top risk and relates to process error, failure, and/or misperformance;\n- /uni25A0 compliance risk due to increases in legislation and regulation remains a major concern and is under the close monitoring of Group Compliance;\n- /uni25A0 external fraud &/uni00A0system security risk continues also to be a top priority. AXA Group's exposure to cyber risk is still high with more and more new technology into AXA Group's products and services. Information on cyber risks should be read in conjunction with the paragraph 'Operational and businessrelated risks' in Section/uni00A05.1/uni00A0'Risk factors' of this Annual Report.\n\nAXA Group's exposure to operational risk is captured in the AXA Group's Solvency Capital Requirement as detailed in the paragraph 'Internal Model' in Section/uni00A05.2/uni00A0'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report.\n\nSpecific actions are identified at Group and local levels to mitigate these risks. Also, the implementation of the Internal Control framework will continue to contribute to better embed controls in activities and mitigate the risks.\n\nAs regards information risks, AXA has built an Information Risk Management (IRM) framework to enable information risk decisions to be made consistently across the organization and establish sustainable Risk Management capabilities that are integrated with the business.\n\nAXA relies on third-party providers for outsourcing of services at different stages of the value chain. Although relying on partners is a strategic advantage, onboarding a vendor into AXA's organization requires AXA to assess the risks it might bring, such as regulatory, compliance, IT security,/uni00A0etc.\n\nTo protect both business and customers, AXA has set up a dedicated Vendor Risk Framework program co-sponsored by Group Risk Management and Group Procurement. This program is supported by Group functions (Compliance, Data Privacy, Information Security, Operational Resilience, Legal, Reputation and Internal Control) and local stakeholders (Chief Risk O/ff icers, Chief Procurement Officers and Insurance Procurement Directors).\n\nThe Vendor Risk Framework defines a set of requirements for each relationship, with a risk-based approach, i.e. existing and potential new contracts. After identification of the criticality through pre-determined criteria, an appropriate level of due diligence, minimum requirements and oversight is implemented.\n\nFor more information on the AXA Group's risk controls and Risk Management processes, please refer to Section/uni00A05.2/uni00A0'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5.7/uni00A0OPERATIONAL RISK\n\n5",

The objectives of the Reputation Risk Management approach are in line with AXA's overall Enterprise Risk Management approach aiming to develop a reputation risk culture and risk intelligence.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nGiven the nature of strategic risks, there is no capital charge assessment but a strong strategic Risk Management framework to anticipate and mitigate these risks. Group Risk Management is involved at early stage in major strategic projects ( e.g. large M&A projects). The Group governance standards require among other things a Risk Management second opinion on key processes, including significant transactions and strategic plans. Furthermore, the ORSA report provides an assessment on the overall solvency needs which include the Solvency/uni00A0II ratio projection made until the strategic plan horizon and in stress scenarios as detailed in Section/uni00A05.2.2/uni00A0'Internal Control and Risk Management -/uni00A0Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA)' of this Annual Report.\n\nThree main objectives drive the Reputation Risk Management approach:\n\n- /uni25A0 proactively manage reputation risks, avoid or minimize negative issues impacting the reputation of AXA and build trust among all of AXA stakeholders;\n- /uni25A0 define  accountability  for  reputation  risks  across  the organization, at Group and local levels;\n- /uni25A0 implement a common reputation Risk Management framework throughout the organization.\n\nAXA Group monitors in near real-time potential and existing issues and receives periodic top reputation risk reports from local entities. Every two months, an informational report is submitted to the Group Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee. Regular dialogue with the Global Reputation Network allows for building awareness, identification and dissemination of key topics that could potentially impact the Group's reputation.\n\nThe implementation of the Reputation Risk Framework encompasses AXA Group's main activities including insurance, Asset Management, as well as internal service providers.",

Emerging risks are marked by a high degree of uncertainty, as some of them may never even emerge.\n\nGiven the nature of emerging risks, there is no capital charge assessment but the AXA Group has established processes to qualify emerging risks which could develop over time and become significant. The emerging risk framework encompasses a network of circa 100/uni00A0people within the AXA Group (mainly based in insurance, Asset Management and support function entities such as AXA Group Operations) which allows expertise to be shared within the business and risk communities and ensures adequate underwriting policies are defined.\n\nEmerging risks surveillance is organized through a detection process including watch on scientific publications, court decisions,/uni00A0etc. Risks are monitored and classified within a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## Regulatory risks\n\nFor further information on the regulatory environment in which AXA Group operates including regulatory risks, please refer to the paragraph 'Regulatory-related risks' in Section/uni00A05.1/uni00A0'Risk factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustainability risks SNFP\n\nI\n\nFor further information on the sustainability risks to which the AXA Group may be exposed, please refer to Section/uni00A04.1/uni00A0'AXA Sustainability strategy' of this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nrisk mapping constituted of five sub-groups (environmental, societal, regulatory &/uni00A0political, economic &/uni00A0financial, medical, and technological).

AXA operates both in Europe and worldwide. The list of the main entities included in the scope of AXA's Consolidated Financial Statements is provided in Note/uni00A02 of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAXA is listed on Euronext Paris Compartiment/uni00A0A.\n\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements including all Notes were set by the Board of Directors on March/uni00A015, 2022.\n\n## 1.2 GENERAL ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\nAXA's Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared as of December/uni00A031.\n\nThe  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  are  prepared in  compliance  with  IFRS  and  interpretations  of  the IFRS/uni00A0 Interpretations Committee that are endorsed by the European Union before the balance sheet date with a compulsory date of January/uni00A01, 2021. The Group does not use the 'carve out' option allowing not to apply all hedge accounting principles required by IAS/uni00A039.\n\n## IFRS REQUIREMENTS ADOPTED ON JANUARY/uni00A01, 2021\n\n## Amendments to IAS/uni00A0 39, IFRS/uni00A0 9, IFRS/uni00A0 7, IFRS/uni00A0 4 and IFRS/uni00A0 16 related to Phase/uni00A02 of the IBOR reform\n\nAmendments to IAS/uni00A039, IFRS/uni00A09, IFRS/uni00A07, IFRS/uni00A04 and IFRS/uni00A016 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase/uni00A02 were issued in August/uni00A02020 and endorsed by the European Union in January/uni00A02021.\n\nThe amendments provide a practical expedient for the situations where changes are made to contractual cash flows of financial assets and liabilities or leases, as a result of the transition from an IBOR benchmark rate to alternative benchmark rates, in the context of the ongoing risk-free rate reform. This practical expedient enables entities not to derecognise or adjust the carrying amounts of those assets and liabilities that are subject to a change with recognition of a corresponding modification gain or loss in profit or loss. In addition, the amendments provide several exceptions to the hedge accounting requirements so that entities will be able to update the designation of the hedging relationship in response to the replacement of the original benchmark rate and to continue with the hedging relationships a/f\\_t  er transition to the alternative benchmark rate.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe information about financial instruments indexed to IBOR interest rates at the end of the reporting period, disaggregated by significant interest rate benchmark, is disclosed in Note/uni00A01.10 below.\n\nThe application of the amendments has no material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements and is not expected to have any material impact in the future.\n\n## Amendment to IFRS/uni00A04 - Deferral of IFRS/uni00A09\n\nOn June/uni00A025, 2020, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued an amendment to IFRS/uni00A04 - Insurance contracts extending the temporary exemption in IFRS/uni00A04 from applying IFRS/uni00A09 until the e/ff ective date of the new insurance contracts standard, IFRS/uni00A017. The amendment, endorsed by the European Union on December/uni00A015, 2020, enables insurers eligible for this temporary exception to align the effective dates of IFRS/uni00A09 Financial instruments and IFRS/uni00A017 - Insurance contracts. Applying this amendment, AXA defers the implementation of IFRS/uni00A09 by two years, i.e. to the annual period starting from January/uni00A01, 2023.\n\n## STANDARDS AND AMENDMENTS PUBLISHED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE\n\n## IFRS/uni00A017 - Insurance contracts\n\nIFRS/uni00A017 - Insurance contracts, published on May/uni00A018, 2017, and amended on June/uni00A025, 2020, establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts and supersedes IFRS/uni00A04 - Insurance contracts. It was adopted by the European Union on November/uni00A019, 2021, with an exemption regarding the annual cohort requirement (see below) and will be applied for annual periods starting from January/uni00A01, 2023, with earlier application permitted.\n\nAs mentioned above, the current standard on insurance contracts, IFRS/uni00A04, has been amended accordingly, extending to 2023 the temporary exemption for qualifying insurers (see below) to apply IFRS/uni00A09.\n\nIFRS/uni00A017 applies to insurance contracts issued, to all reinsurance contracts and to investment contracts with discretionary participating features provided the entity also issues insurance contracts. It requires to separate the following components from insurance contracts: (i)/uni00A0embedded derivatives, if they meet certain specified criteria, (ii)/uni00A0distinct investment components, and (iii)/uni00A0distinct performance obligations to provide non-insurance goods and services. These components should be accounted for separately in accordance with the related standards.",

        "page_content": "The standard defines the level of aggregation to be used for measuring the insurance contract liabilities and the related profitability. Indeed, IFRS/uni00A017 requires to identify portfolios of insurance contracts, which comprise contracts that are subject to similar risks and are managed together. Afterwards, each portfolio of insurance contracts issued shall be divided into three groups:\n\n- /uni25A0 contracts that are onerous at initial recognition;\n- /uni25A0 contracts that at initial recognition have no significant possibility of becoming onerous subsequently;\n- /uni25A0 and the remaining contracts in the portfolio.\n\nMoreover, IFRS/uni00A017 as issued by the IASB introduces the 'annual cohort requirement' that prevents contracts issued more than one year apart from being included in the same group. However, the Standard as adopted by the European Union provides an optional exemption from applying this annual cohort requirement for the following contracts:\n\n- /uni25A0 groups of insurance contracts with direct participation features and groups of investment contracts with discretionary participation features, and with cash flows that a/ff ect or are a/ff  ected by cash flows to policyholders of other contracts;\n- /uni25A0 groups of insurance contracts that are managed across generations of contracts and that meet certain  conditions and have been approved by supervisory authorities for the application of the matching adjustment.\n\nThis exemption will be reviewed by the end of 2027, taking into account the outcome of the IASB's post-implementation review of IFRS/uni00A017.\n\nIFRS/uni00A0 17 requires a current measurement model, where the general model is based on the following 'building blocks':\n\n- /uni25A0 the fulfilment cash flows (FCF), which comprise:\n- \u00b7 probability-weighted estimates of future cash flows,\n- \u00b7 an adjustment to reflect the time value of money ( i.e. discounting) and the financial risks associated with those future cash flows,\n- \u00b7 and a risk adjustment for non-financial risk;\n- /uni25A0 the Contractual Service Margin (CSM).\n\nThe CSM represents the unearned profit for a group of insurance contracts and will be recognized as the entity provides services in the future. The CSM cannot be negative at inception; any net negative amount of the fulfilment cash flows at inception will be recorded in profit or loss immediately.\n\nAt the end of each subsequent reporting period the carrying amount of a group of insurance contracts is remeasured to be the sum of:\n\n- /uni25A0 the liability for remaining coverage, which comprises the FCF related to future services and the CSM of the group at that date; and\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n- /uni25A0 the liability for incurred claims, which is measured as the FCF related to past services allocated to the group at that date.\n\nThe CSM is adjusted subsequently for changes in cash flows related to future services. However, the CSM cannot be negative, so negative changes in future cash flows that are greater than the remaining CSM are recognized in profit or loss. Interest is also accreted on the CSM at rates locked in at initial recognition of a contract ( i.e. discount rate used at inception to determine the present value of the estimated cash flows). Moreover, the CSM will be released into profit or loss based on coverage units, reflecting the quantity of the benefits provided and the expected coverage duration of the remaining contracts in the group.\n\nThe Variable Fee Approach (VFA) is a mandatory model for measuring contracts with direct participation features (also referred to as 'direct participating contracts'). A contract has a direct participation feature if it meets all three requirements below:\n\n- /uni25A0 the contractual terms specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly identified pool of underlying items;\n- /uni25A0 the entity expects to pay to the policyholder an amount equal to a substantial share of the fair value returns on the underlying items;\n- /uni25A0 the entity expects a substantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder to vary with the change in fair value of the underlying items.\n\nThis assessment of whether the contract meets these criteria is made at inception of the contract and not revised subsequently, except in case of substantial modification of the contract.\n\nFor these contracts, the CSM is adjusted (i)/uni00A0for changes in the variable fee (entity's share in the change of value of underlying items that corresponds to the revenue of the insurer), (ii)/uni00A0for the time value of money, and (iii)/uni00A0for e/ff ect of changes in financial risks not arising from underlying items (such as options and guarantees).\n\nIn addition, a simplified Premium Allocation Approach (PAA) is permitted for the measurement of the liability for remaining coverage if it provides a measurement that is not materially di/ff  erent from the general model or if the coverage period is one year or less. With the PAA, the liability for remaining coverage corresponds to premiums received at initial recognition less acquisition costs and amounts already recognized as insurance revenue at the closing date. However, the general model remains applicable for the measurement of incurred claims.\n\nIn terms of presentation, the amounts recognized in the statements of financial performance have to be disaggregated into:\n\n- /uni25A0 an insurance service result, comprising insurance revenue (corresponding to the insurance service provided over the period) and insurance service expenses ( i.e. incurred claims and other incurred insurance service expense); and\n- /uni25A0 insurance finance income or expenses.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The amendment, which has not yet been endorsed by the European Union, improves requirements for the comparative information to be disclosed on initial application of the both Standards. It permits entities that first apply IFRS/uni00A017 and IFRS/uni00A09 at the same time to present comparative information about a financial asset as if the classification and measurement requirements of IFRS/uni00A09 had been applied to that financial asset before.\n\n## IFRS/uni00A09 - Financial instruments\n\nIFRS/uni00A0 9 - Financial instruments, published on July/uni00A024, 2014, replaces IAS/uni00A039. The new standard addresses the following items related to financial instruments:\n\n- /uni25A0 classification and measurement: IFRS/uni00A0 9 uses a single approach to determine whether a financial asset is measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss. A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if both (i)/uni00A0the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, and (ii)/uni00A0the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding ('SPPI'). If both (i)/uni00A0the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and for sale, and (ii)/uni00A0the contractual terms of cash flows are SPPI, the financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and realized gains or losses would be recycled through profit or loss upon sale. Assets not fitting either of these categories are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Additionally, at initial recognition, an entity can use the option to designate a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting\n\nI\n\nI\n\nmismatch. For equity instruments that are not held for trading, an entity can also make an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value of the instruments (including realized gains and losses), dividends being recognized in profit or loss. Additionally, for financial liabilities that are measured as at fair value through profit or loss, the amount of change in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability is recognized in other comprehensive income, unless the recognition of the e/ff ects of changes in the liability's credit risk in other comprehensive income would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss;\n\n- /uni25A0 impairment: the impairment model under IFRS/uni00A09 reflects expected credit losses, as opposed to incurred credit losses under IAS/uni00A039. Under the IFRS/uni00A09 approach, it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognized. Instead, an entity always accounts for expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition;\n- /uni25A0 hedge accounting: IFRS/uni00A09 introduces new requirements for hedge accounting that align hedge accounting more closely with Risk Management. Its requirements establish a more principles-based approach to the general hedge accounting model and apply to all hedge accounting with the exception of portfolio fair value hedges of interest rate risk (commonly referred to as 'fair value macro hedges'). For these, an entity may continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements currently in IAS/uni00A039. This exception was granted largely because the IASB is addressing macro hedge accounting as a separate project.\n\nThe implementation of IFRS/uni00A09 and the assessment of its potential impact on the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements, in combination with IFRS/uni00A017, are in progress.\n\nThe published e/ff ective date of IFRS/uni00A09 was January/uni00A01, 2018.\n\nHowever, amendments to IFRS/uni00A04 - Insurance contracts/uni00A0'Applying IFRS/uni00A09 - Financial instruments with IFRS/uni00A04 - Insurance contracts', published on September/uni00A012, 2016, and 'Extension of the temporary exemption from applying IFRS/uni00A09', published on June/uni00A025, 2020, have changed the existing IFRS/uni00A04 to allow entities issuing insurance contracts within the scope of IFRS/uni00A04 to mitigate certain e/ff  ects of applying IFRS/uni00A09 before the IASB's new insurance contract standard, IFRS/uni00A017, becomes e/ff ective. The amendments provide two alternative options:\n\n- (i) apply a temporary exemption from implementing IFRS/uni00A09 until the earlier of (i)/uni00A0the effective date of IFRS/uni00A017, or (ii)/uni00A0Annual Reporting periods beginning on or a/f\\_t er January/uni00A01, 2023, following the deferral of the e/ff ective application of IFRS/uni00A017 until the same date. Additional disclosures related to financial assets are required during the deferral period.",

It requires a degree of judgment in the application of the Group accounting principles described below. The main balance sheet captions concerned are goodwill (in particular impairment tests described in paragraph/uni00A01.7.1), intangible assets acquired in a business combination, the value of acquired business in force, Deferred Acquisition Costs and equivalent, certain assets accounted at fair value, deferred tax assets, liabilities relating to the insurance business, pension benefit obligations and balances related to share-based compensation. The principles set out below specify the measurement methods used for these items. These methods, along with key assumptions where required, are discussed in greater depth in the notes relating to the asset and liability items concerned where meaningful and useful.\n\nAs recommended by IAS/uni00A01, assets and liabilities are generally classified globally on the balance sheet in increasing order of liquidity, which is more relevant for financial institutions than a classification between current and non-current items. As a standard practice for insurance companies, expenses are classified by destination in the income statement.\n\nAll amounts in the consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated statement of income, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of cash flows, consolidated statement of changes in equity and in the Notes are expressed in Euro/uni00A0million.\n\n## 1.3 CONSOLIDATION\n\n## 1.3.1 Scope and basis of consolidation\n\nCompanies in which AXA exercises control are subsidiaries. They are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to AXA. Under IFRS/uni00A010, AXA controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to a/ff ect those returns through its power over the investee. Only substantive rights ( i.e. the holder must have the practicability to exercise them) and rights that are not protective shall be considered. AXA can have power with less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, in particular through:\n\n- /uni25A0 the proportion of ownership with regards to the other investors;\n- /uni25A0 potential voting rights;\n- /uni25A0 a contractual arrangement between the investor and other vote holders;\n- /uni25A0 rights arising from other contractual arrangements; or\n- /uni25A0 a combination of these indicators.\n\nI\n\nUnder IFRS/uni00A011, companies over which AXA exercises a joint controlling influence alongside one or more third parties are joint ventures and are accounted for under the equity method.\n\nCompanies in which AXA exercises significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Under IAS/uni00A028, significant influence is presumed when AXA directly or indirectly holds 20% or more of the voting rights. Significant influence can also be exercised through an agreement with other shareholders.\n\nUnder the equity method, AXA's share of equity investments' postacquisition profit or loss is recognized in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is stated under 'Other reserves'.\n\nInvestment funds and real estate companies are either fully consolidated or accounted for under the equity method, depending on which conditions of IFRS/uni00A010/IFRS/uni00A011/IAS/uni00A028 listed above they satisfy. Fees received by asset managers are also taken into account in the assessment of the exposure to variability of returns. For fully consolidated investment funds, minority interests are recognized at fair value and shown as liabilities in the balance sheet if the companies' instruments can be redeemed at any time by the holder at fair value. Investment funds accounted by equity method are shown under the balance sheet caption 'Financial investments'.\n\nSome companies in which AXA exercises control, a joint controlling influence or a significant influence are excluded from the scope of consolidation as they are not material with respect to the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements. These are mainly investment funds.\n\n## 1.3.2 Business combinations and subsequent changes in the Group ownership interest\n\nIn accordance with the option made available by IFRS/uni00A01/uni00A0First-time adoption of IFRS, business combinations prior to 2004 were not restated with respect to French accounting principles in force at the time.\n\n## VALUATION OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED OF NEWLY ACQUIRED SUBSIDIARIES AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\n\nUpon first consolidation, all assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities (unless they are not present obligations) of the acquired company are estimated at their fair value. However, in compliance with an exemption permitted by IFRS/uni00A04, liabilities related to life insurance contracts or investment contracts with discretionary participating features are maintained at the carrying value prior to the acquisition date to the extent that this measurement basis is consistent with AXA's accounting principles. The fair value of acquired business in force relating to life insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participating features is recognized as an asset corresponding to the present value of estimated future profits emerging on acquired business in force at the date of acquisition (also referred to as value of acquired\n\nI",

The present value of future profits takes into consideration the cost of capital and is estimated using actuarial assumptions based on projections made at purchase date but also using a discount rate that includes a risk premium.\n\nInvestment contracts with no discretionary participating features do not benefit from the exemption permitted by IFRS/uni00A04 such as described above, under which the fair value of acquired liabilities is booked through the recognition of an asset corresponding to the value of acquired business in force. Liabilities relating to investment contracts with no discretionary participating features are measured directly at fair value. In accordance with IAS/uni00A039, the fair value of these contracts cannot be less than surrender value when they contain a demand feature.\n\nOther identifiable intangible assets such as the value of customer relationships should be recognized. The value of customer relationships intangible represents the value of future cash flows expected from renewals and the cross-selling of new products to customers known and identified at the time of the acquisition. These projections include assumptions regarding claims, expenses and financial revenues, or they can be estimated on the basis of the New Business Value. In line with accounting practices in force before the adoption of IFRS, which may continue to be applied under IFRS/uni00A04, future premiums relating to acquired business may be recognized in the 'Value of acquired business in force' item.\n\nTo the extent that these other intangible assets can be estimated separately, they can also be measured by looking at the purchased marketing resources that will allow to generate these future cash flows. The nature of the intangible assets recognized is consistent with the valuation methods used when purchasing the acquired entity.\n\nIn the context of a business combination, only restructuring costs that can be measured reliably and which correspond to an existing liability of the acquired company prior to the acquisition date are included in restructuring provisions recognized in the acquired company's balance sheet at acquisition date.\n\nThe consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the Group, the liabilities incurred by the Group to former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group.\n\nPurchase consideration includes any contingent element (adjustment in the acquisition price conditional upon on one or more events). In the estimate of the contingent element, attention is paid to use assumptions that are consistent with the assumptions used for the valuation of intangible assets such as VBI. For business combinations that occurred before January/uni00A01, 2009, any contingent element was included in the cost of the combination to the extent the adjustment was probable and could be measured reliably. If the future events do not occur or the estimate needs to be revised, the cost of the business\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\ncombination continues to be adjusted accordingly, taking account of the impact in terms of additional goodwill and/or adjustments of the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities. For business combinations on or after January/uni00A01, 2009, any change to the estimate of the contingent element between the acquisition date and the amount actually subsequently paid is recognized in the income statement.\n\nDirect transaction costs related to a business combination are charged in the income statement when incurred.\n\nIn step acquisitions, any previous minority interest held by the Group is measured at fair value and the resulting adjustment is recognized through net income. Similarly, when an additional purchase changes the control from significant influence or joint control to control, any investment pre-existing in a former associate/joint venture is re-measured to its fair value with the gain or loss through net income (consequently also resulting in a new goodwill).\n\nAccording to a decision taken for each acquisition, any minority interest may be measured at fair value or at its proportionate interest in the acquiree's identifiable net assets.\n\n## GOODWILL\n\nGoodwill is measured as the excess of (i)/uni00A0the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any minority interest in the acquiree and in a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the Group's previously held equity interest in the acquiree over (ii)/uni00A0the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.\n\nGoodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity is recorded in the local currency of the acquired entity and is translated into Euro at the closing date.\n\nIf the cost of acquisition is less than the net of the acquisitiondate amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, the difference is directly recorded in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nAdjustments can be made to goodwill within twelve/uni00A0months of the acquisition date, if new information becomes available to complete the initial accounting. In this case, comparative information is presented as if the initial accounting had been completed from the acquisition date.\n\nIf, a/f\\_t  er the period of twelve/uni00A0months, a deferred tax asset, initially considered as not recoverable, finally meets the recognition criteria, the corresponding tax benefit is recorded in the consolidated statement of income without a corresponding adjustment in goodwill.\n\nGoodwill is allocated to cash generating units corresponding/uni00A0to (i)/uni00A0the companies acquired or portfolios of business acquired according to their expected profitability, and (ii)/uni00A0the entities already within the AXA Group that will benefit from the synergies of the combination with the activities acquired. This allocation of goodwill is used both for segment reporting and for impairment testing.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Furthermore, if an investment in the entity is retained by the Group, it is re-measured to its fair value and any gain or loss is also recognized in net income.\n\n## PUT OVER MINORITY INTERESTS\n\nWhen control over a subsidiary is acquired, a put option may be granted to minority shareholders. However, the recognition of the puttable instruments as a liability depends on the contractual obligations.\n\nWhen the contract involves an unconditional commitment exercisable by the option holder, it is recognized as a liability. Since the balancing entry to this liability is not specified by current IFRS, the Group's method is/uni00A0to (i)/uni00A0reclassify minority interests from equity to liability, (ii)/uni00A0re-measure this liability at the present value of the option price, and (iii)/uni00A0recognize the difference either as an increase in goodwill for puts existing before January/uni00A01, 2009, or as a decrease in equity (Group share) for a put granted a/f\\_t er January/uni00A01, 2009, to the extent there is no immediate transfer of risks and rewards. Similarly, subsequent changes in the liability are recorded against goodwill for puts existing before January/uni00A01, 2009, and against equity (Group share) for puts granted a/f\\_t er that date.\n\n## INTRA-GROUP TRANSACTIONS\n\nIntra-group transactions, including internal dividends, payables/ receivables and gains/losses on intra-group transactions are eliminated:\n\n- /uni25A0 in full for controlled subsidiaries; and\n- /uni25A0 to the extent of AXA's interest for entities consolidated by equity method.\n\nThe e/ff ect on net income of transactions between consolidated entities is always eliminated.

The income statement impact of the potential policyholders' participation resulting from this transaction is also eliminated, and a deferred policyholders' participation asset or liability is posted to the statement of financial position.\n\nIn addition, the transfer of consolidated shares, between two consolidated subsidiaries but held with different ownership percentages, should not impact the Group net income. The only exception would be any related tax and policyholders'\n\nI\n\nI\n\nparticipation recorded in connection to the transaction, which are maintained in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These transfers also have an impact on Group shareholders' equity (with a balancing entry recorded in minority interests). This impact is identified in the 'other' changes of the consolidated statement of shareholders' equity.\n\n## 1.4 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND/uni00A0TRANSACTIONS\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Euro/uni00A0million, the Euro being the Group's presentational currency.\n\nThe results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency ( i.e. the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates) di/ff erent from the Group presentational currency are translated as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 assets and liabilities of entities in a functional currency di/ff  erent from Euro are translated at the closing exchange rate;\n- /uni25A0 revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate over the period;\n- /uni25A0 all resulting foreign exchange di/ff erences are recognized as a separate component of equity (translation di/ff erences).\n\nAt the local entity level, foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at closing rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the income statement, except where hedge accounting is applied as explained in paragraph/uni00A01.10.\n\nAs mentioned in paragraph/uni00A01.3.2, goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity is recorded in the local currency of the acquired entity and is translated into Euro at the closing date.\n\nForeign exchange di/ff erences arising from the translation of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary, borrowings and other currency instruments qualifying for hedge accounting of such investment are recorded in shareholders' equity under translation di/ff erences and are recycled in the income statement as part of the realized gain or loss on disposal of the hedged net investment.\n\nForeign exchange di/ff erences arising from monetary financial investments available for sale are recognized as income or expense for the period in respect of the portion corresponding to amortized cost. The residual translation di/ff erences relating to fair value changes are recorded in shareholders' equity, like for non-monetary items such as equity securities.\n\nRegarding the cumulative amount of the exchange di/ff erences related to disposed business, the Group applies the step-by-step consolidation method (IFRIC/uni00A016).",

        "page_content": "## 1.5 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT\n\nThe Group applies the IFRS/uni00A013 fair value hierarchy as described below for all assets and liabilities where another IFRS requires or permits fair value measurement or disclosures about fair value measurement in the Notes. Principles below address mostly assets given the nature of the activities of the Group.\n\n## 1.5.1 Active market: quoted price\n\nFair values of assets and liabilities traded on active markets are determined using quoted market prices when available. An instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis between a willing seller and a willing buyer. For financial instruments traded in active markets, quotes received from external pricing services represent consensus prices, i.e. using similar models and inputs resulting in a very limited dispersion.\n\nThe fair value amounts of assets and liabilities for which fair value is determined in whole directly by reference to an active market are disclosed as level/uni00A01 in the Notes/uni00A0to the financial statements.\n\n## 1.5.2 Active versus inactive markets financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments are considered as being quoted in an active market when:\n\n- /uni25A0 quotes that represent consensus are regularly provided by external pricing services with limited dispersion; and\n- /uni25A0 prices are readily available.\n\nLiquidity may be defined as the possibility to sell or dispose of the asset in the ordinary course of business within a certain limited time period at approximately the price at which the investment is valued. Liquidity for debt instruments is assessed using a multi-criteria approach including the number of quotes available, the place of issuance and the evolution of the widening of bid ask spreads.\n\nA financial instrument is regarded as not quoted in an active market:\n\n- /uni25A0 if there is little observation of transaction prices as an inherent characteristic of the instrument;\n- /uni25A0 when there is a significant decline in the volume and level of trading activity;\n- /uni25A0 in case of significant illiquidity;\n- /uni25A0 if observable prices cannot be considered as representing fair value because of dislocated market conditions.\n\nI\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nCharacteristics of inactive markets can therefore be very di/ff erent in nature, inherent to the instrument or indicative of a change in the conditions prevailing in certain markets.\n\n## 1.5.3 Assets and liabilities not quoted in/uni00A0an/uni00A0active market\n\nFair values of assets and liabilities that are not traded in an active market are estimated using:\n\n- /uni25A0 external and independent pricing services; or\n- /uni25A0 valuation techniques.\n\nFair values of assets and liabilities that are not traded in active market mainly based on observable market data are disclosed as level/uni00A02 in the Notes/uni00A0to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFair values mainly not based on observable market data are disclosed as level/uni00A03 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n- /uni25A0 No active market: use of external pricing services\n\nExternal pricing services may be fund asset managers in the case of non-consolidated investments in funds or brokers. To the extent possible, the Group collects quotes from external pricing providers as inputs to measure fair value. Prices received may form tight clusters or dispersed quotes which may then lead to the use of valuation techniques. The dispersion of quotes received may be an indication of the large range of assumptions used by external pricing providers given the limited number of transactions to be observed or reflect the existence of distress transactions. In addition, given current market conditions since the financial crisis and the persistency of complete inactivity of some markets since then, many financial institutions closed their desks dedicated to structured assets deals and are no longer in a position to deliver meaningful quotes.\n\n- /uni25A0 No active market: use of valuation techniques\n\nThe objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants (a willing buyer and a willing seller) at the measurement date. Valuation techniques include:\n\n- \u00b7 market approach: the consideration of recent prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving substantially similar assets or liabilities,\n- \u00b7 income approach: use of discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, and other present value techniques to convert future amounts to a single current ( i.e. discounted) amount,\n- \u00b7 cost approach: the consideration of amounts that would currently be required to construct or replace the service capacity of an asset.\n\nI\n\n6",

They include recent arm's length transactions between knowledgeable willing parties on similar assets if available and representative of fair value and involve various assumptions regarding the underlying price, yield curve, correlations, volatility, default rates and other factors. Unlisted equity instruments valuation is based on cross checks using di/ff erent methodologies such as discounted cash flows techniques, price earning ratios multiples, adjusted net asset values, taking into account recent transactions on instruments which are substantially the same if concluded at arm's length between knowledgeable willing parties, if any. The use of valuation techniques and assumptions could produce di/ff erent estimates of fair value. However, valuations are determined using generally accepted models (discounted cash flows, Black/uni00A0& Scholes models,/uni00A0etc.) based on quoted market prices for similar instruments or underlyings (index, credit spread,/uni00A0etc.) whenever such directly observable data are available and valuations are adjusted for liquidity and credit risk.\n\nValuation techniques may be used when there is little observation of transaction prices as an inherent characteristic of the market, when quotes made available by external pricing providers are too dispersed or when market conditions are so dislocated that observed data cannot be used or need significant adjustments. Internal mark to model valuations are therefore normal market practices for certain assets and liabilities inherently scarcely traded or exceptional processes implemented due to specific market conditions.\n\n- /uni25A0 Use of valuation techniques in dislocated markets\n\nThe dislocation of certain markets may be evidenced by various factors. For example, a very large widening of bid ask spreads may be a helpful indicator in understanding whether market participants are willing to transact. The dislocation of markets may also be suspected in cases of wide dispersion in the prices (over time or among market participants), small number of transactions, closing down of primary and/or secondary markets, forced transactions motivated by needs of liquidity or other di/ff icult financial conditions with insu/ff icient time to market the assets to be sold, and large bulk sales to exit such markets at all costs that may involve side arrangements (such as sellers providing finance for a sale to a buyer). In such cases, the Group uses valuation techniques including observable data whenever possible and relevant, adjusted if needed to develop the best estimate of fair value, including adequate risk premiums or develops a valuation model based on unobservable data representing estimates of assumptions that willing market\n\nI\n\nI\n\nparticipants would use when prices are not current, relevant or available without undue costs and e/ff orts: in inactive markets, transactions may be inputs when measuring fair value, but would likely not be determinative and unobservable data may be more appropriate than observable inputs.\n\n## 1.6 SEGMENT REPORTING\n\nThe segmental analysis provided in AXA's Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements reflects six operating business segments. These segments are determined on the basis of geographies or transversally for entities operating in various jurisdictions, and include France, Europe, Asia, AXA XL, International and Transversal & Central Holdings.\n\n## 1.7 INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\n## 1.7.1 Goodwill and impairment of goodwill\n\nGoodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful life and is therefore not amortized but subject to a regular test for impairment. Impairment tests are performed at least annually. Impairment of goodwill is not reversible.\n\nAXA performs an/uni00A0impairment test of goodwill by cash generating unit, using valuation approaches that rely on parameters such as market indicators, market value of assets, market value of liabilities and future operating profits, derived on the basis of operational and economic assumptions in order to determine any significant adverse changes that might lead to the nonrecoverability of the goodwill. Compliant with IAS/uni00A036, within each cash generating unit, a comparison is made between net book value and the recoverable value (equal to the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). Value in use consists of the net assets and the value placed on expected future earnings from existing and new business. For Life & Savings segment, the value of future expected earnings is estimated on the basis of embedded value models or similar calculations for other activities. Fair value less costs to sell is determined in compliance with IFRS/uni00A013 fair value as described in paragraph/uni00A01.5.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized for a cash generating unit if, and only if, the recoverable amount of the unit or group of units is less than the carrying amount of the unit or group of units.",

        "page_content": "Fair value approach is based on risk neutral valuation techniques taking into account:\n\n- /uni25A0 the current shareholders' net asset value plus the future profitability of the business in force:\n- \u00b7 the current shareholders' net asset value is adjusted to take into account any di/ff erence between the basis of cash flows projections used in the value of business in force calculations and IFRS,\n- \u00b7 the profitability of business in force is determined using the embedded value methodology, which is an industrywide and specific valuation approach, consistent with the principle of discounted earnings, as the value of business in force is represented by the discounted value of future earnings from the in-force portfolios. The Group uses however both market consistent risk neutral approaches, aligned with fair-value calculations, and traditional discounted cash flows projections;\n- /uni25A0 the profitability of future new business:\n- \u00b7 the value of future new business is computed either on the basis of multiples of a standardized year of new business contribution (present value of projected future distributable profits generated from business written in a year) or on a projection of each of the expected annual future earnings when multiples are not appropriate. The determination of the future earnings arising from the new business relies upon the use of operational and economic assumptions, both of which are compliant with the requirements of the di/ff erent regulatory frameworks.\n\nThe recoverable value of the Life & Savings segment is first assessed on a risk free basis (basic test) and then on the basis of illustrative investment assumptions suitable for a traditional embedded value approach if the recoverable value determined for the basic test is lower than the carrying amount.\n\nThe value in use approach is built upon cash flow projections based on the business plans approved by AXA management covering up to five years and discounted using a risk adjusted rate. Cash flows beyond that period are extrapolated using a steady growth rate and a terminal value.\n\n## 1.7.2 Value of purchased life insurance business in force (VBI)\n\nThe value of purchased insurance contracts and investment contracts  with  discretionary  participating  features recognized in a business combination (see paragraph/uni00A01.3.2) is amortized as profits emerge over the life of the contracts' portfolio. In conjunction with the liability adequacy test (see paragraph/uni00A01.14.2), VBI is subject to annual recoverability testing based on actual experience and expected changes in the main assumptions.\n\n## 1.7.3 Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC) relating to insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participating features rights to future management fees, also known as Deferred Origination Costs (DOC) relating to investment contracts with no discretionary participating features\n\nThe incremental direct costs of acquiring a portfolio of insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participating  features,  primarily  related  to  the  selling, underwriting and initiating the insurance contracts in a portfolio, are deferred by recognizing an asset, Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC). In Property & Casualty segment, DAC are amortized over the terms of the policies, as premium is earned. For Life & Savings segment, the asset is amortized based on the estimated gross profits emerging over the life of the contracts. This asset is tested for recoverability and any amount above future estimated gross profits is expensed. DAC are also tested through the liability adequacy test (see paragraph/uni00A01.14.2).\n\nFor investment contracts with no discretionary participating features, a similar asset is recognized, i.e. rights to future management fees, also known as Deferred Origination Costs (DOC) (see Note/uni00A07) but limited to incremental costs directly attributable to the provision of investment management services. This asset is amortized by taking into account projections of fees collected over the life of the contracts. The amortization of DOC is reviewed at each closing date to reflect changes in assumptions and experience. This asset is also tested for recoverability.\n\nDAC and DOC are reported gross of unearned revenues and fees reserves. These unearned revenues and fees reserves are separately recognized as liabilities and are amortized over the contract term using the same amortization approach as the one used for DAC and DOC.\n\n## 1.7.4 Unearned Revenues Reserves\n\nRevenues received at contract inception to cover future services are deferred and recognized in the income statement using the same amortization pattern as the one used for Deferred Acquisition Costs.\n\n## 1.7.5 Other Intangible Assets\n\nOther intangible assets include so/f\\_t ware developed for internal use for which direct costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the assets' estimated useful lives.\n\nThey also include customer relationships intangibles as well as distribution agreements recognized as a result of business combinations. If these assets have a finite useful life, they are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated life. In all cases, they are subject to impairment tests, at each closing\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

In the event of a significant decline in value, an impairment is booked corresponding to the di/ff erence between the value on the balance sheet and the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## 1.8 INVESTMENTS FROM INSURANCE, BANKING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES\n\nInvestments include investment in real estate properties and financial instruments including equity instruments, debt instruments and loans.\n\n## 1.8.1 Investment in real estate properties\n\nInvestment in real estate properties (excluding investment in real estate properties totally or partially backing liabilities arising from contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders) is recognized at cost. The properties components are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, also considering their residual value if it may be reliably estimated.\n\nIn case of unrealized loss over 15%, an impairment is recognized for the di/ff erence between the net book value of the investment property and the fair value of the asset based on an independent valuation. Furthermore, at the level of each reporting entity, if the cumulated amount of unrealized losses under 15% (without o/ff  setting with unrealized gains) represents more than 10% of the cumulated net cost of real estate assets, additional impairment is booked on a line-by-line approach until the 10% threshold is reached.\n\nIf, in subsequent periods, the appraisal value rises to at least 15% more than the net carrying value, previously recorded impairment is reversed to the extent of the di/ff erence between (i)/uni00A0the net carrying value and (ii)/uni00A0the lower of the appraisal value and the depreciated cost (before impairment).\n\nInvestment in real estate properties that totally or partially backs liabilities arising from contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders is recognized at fair value with changes in fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## 1.8.2 Financial instruments classification\n\nDepending on the intention and ability to hold the invested assets, financial instruments are classified in the following categories:\n\n- /uni25A0 assets held to maturity, accounted for at amortized cost;\n- /uni25A0 assets held for trading and assets designated as at fair value with change in fair value through profit or loss;\n\nI\n\nI\n\n- /uni25A0 available for sale assets accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through shareholders' equity;\n- /uni25A0 loans and receivables (including some debt instruments not quoted in an active market) accounted for at amortized cost.\n\nAt inception, the option to designate financial investments and liabilities at fair value with change in fair value recognized through income statement is mainly used by the Group for the following financial instruments:\n\n- /uni25A0 financial investments when electing the fair value option allows the Group to solve accounting mismatch, and in particular:\n- \u00b7 assets backing liabilities arising from contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders,\n- \u00b7 assets included in hedging strategies set out by the Group for economical reasons but not eligible for hedge accounting as defined by IAS/uni00A039,\n- \u00b7 debt held by structured bond (primarily Collateralized Debt Obligations) funds controlled and consolidated by the Group;\n- /uni25A0 portfolios  of  managed  financial  investments  whose profitability is valued on a fair value basis: mainly securities held by consolidated investment funds, managed according to the Group Risk Management policy ('Satellite Investment Portfolio', see definition below).\n\nIn practice, assets held through consolidated investment funds are classified:\n\n- /uni25A0 either as assets of the 'Core Investment Portfolios' which include assets backing liabilities arising from insurance and investment contracts, managed according to AXA's Assets and Liabilities strategy; or\n- /uni25A0 as assets of the 'Satellite Investment Portfolios', reflecting the strategic asset allocation based on a dynamic asset management aimed at maximizing returns.\n\nUnderlying financial instruments held in the 'Core Investment Portfolios' are classified as available for sale with change in fair value through shareholders' equity unless involved in a qualifying hedge relationship or more broadly when electing the fair value option reduces accounting mismatch. As specified above, the financial instruments held in the 'Satellite Investment Portfolios' are accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through income statement.\n\nAssets  designated  as  available  for  sale,  trading  assets, investments designated as at fair value through profit or loss and all derivatives are measured at fair value, i.e. the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction. The Group applies the IFRS/uni00A013 fair value hierarchy.\n\nLoans which are not designated under the fair value option are accounted at amortized cost using the e/ff ective interest rate method.",

        "page_content": "## IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nAXA assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or a group of financial investments at (amortized) cost or designated as available for sale should be impaired. A financial asset or group of financial investments should be impaired when there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events and this event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the assets that can be reliably estimated.\n\nFor debt instruments classified as 'held to maturity' or 'available for sale', an impairment based respectively on future cash flows discounted using the initial e/ff ective interest rate or on fair value is recorded through the income statement if future cash flows may not be fully recoverable due to a credit event relating to the instrument issuer. A downgrade of an entity's credit rating is not, of itself, evidence of impairment. If the credit risk is eliminated or improves, the impairment may be reversed. The amount of the reversal is also recognized in the income statement.\n\nFor equity instruments classified as available for sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below its carrying value is considered as indication for potential impairment, such as equity instruments showing unrealized losses over a 6/uni00A0months period or more (prior to the closing date), or unrealized losses in excess of 20% of the net carrying value at the closing date. If such evidence exists for an available for sale financial asset, the cumulative loss - measured as the di/ff erence between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment on that financial asset already booked in the income statement - is removed from shareholders' equity and an impairment is recognized through the income statement. Equity instruments impairment recognized in the income statement cannot be reversed through the income statement until the asset is sold or derecognized.\n\nImpairment testing for loans available for sale is based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate (down to the loan's observable market price), or on the fair value of the collateral.\n\nFor financial investments accounted for at amortized cost, including loans and assets classified as 'held to maturity' or assets designated as 'Loans and receivables', the impairment test is first performed at the asset level. A more global test is then performed on groups of assets with similar risk profile.\n\nMethods for calculating the net book value of assets sold (average cost, first-in first-out,/uni00A0etc.) depend on local Assets and Liabilities Management (ALM) strategies as these strategies have been set up to take into account specific commitments to policyholders. These methods may di/ff er within the Group provided that they are used consistently at each entity level.\n\n## 1.8.3 Repurchase agreements and securities lending\n\nThe Group is party to repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions under which financial assets are sold to a counterparty, subject to a simultaneous agreement to repurchase these financial assets at a certain later date, at an agreed price. Since substantially all of the risks and rewards of the financial assets remain with the Group over the entire lifetime of the transaction, the Group does not derecognize the financial assets. The proceeds of the sale are reported separately. Interest expense from repurchase and security lending transactions is accrued over the duration of the agreements.\n\nAdditionally, the Group is party to total return swaps under which financial assets are sold to a counterparty with a corresponding agreement. Cash flows equal to those of the underlying assets will be remitted to the Group in exchange for specified payments taking into account any increase or decline in the fair value of the assets. This results in substantially all of the risks and rewards of the financial assets remaining with the Group. As such, the Group does not derecognize the financial assets.\n\nThe Group is also party to reverse repurchase agreements under which financial assets are purchased from a counterparty, subject to a simultaneous agreement to return these financial assets at a certain later date, at an agreed price. If substantially all of the risks and rewards of the securities remain with the counterparty over the entire lifetime of the agreement of the transaction, the securities concerned are not recognized as financial assets of the Group. The amounts of cash disbursed are recorded under financial investments, except for transactions arising from banking activities, which are recorded as separate assets. Interest income on reverse repurchase agreements is accrued over the duration of the agreements.\n\n## 1.9 ASSETS BACKING LIABILITIES ARISING FROM CONTRACTS WHERE THE FINANCIAL RISK IS BORNE BY/uni00A0POLICYHOLDERS\n\nAssets backing liabilities arising from insurance or investment contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders are presented in a separate aggregate of the balance sheet so that they are shown in a symmetrical manner to the corresponding liabilities. This presentation is considered more relevant for the users and consistent with the liquidity order recommended by IAS/uni00A01 for financial institutions, since the risks are borne by policyholders, whatever the type of assets backing liabilities (investment in real estate properties, debt instruments or equity instruments,/uni00A0etc.). Details of these assets are provided in the Notes.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Unrealized gains and losses are recognized in the statement of income unless they relate to a qualifying hedge relationship as described below. The Group designates certain derivatives as either: (i)/uni00A0hedging of the fair value of recognized assets or liabilities or of a firm commitment (fair value hedge), or (ii)/uni00A0hedging of highly probable expected future transactions (cash flow hedge), or (iii)/uni00A0hedging of net investments in foreign operations.\n\nThe Group documents, at inception, the hedge relationship, as well as its Risk Management hedging objectives and strategy. The Group also documents the hedge e/ff ectiveness, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, indicating the actual or expected e/ff iciency level of the derivatives used in hedging transactions in o/ff setting changes in the fair values or cash flows of hedged underlying items.\n\n## FAIR VALUE HEDGE\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as fair value hedge are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability. Therefore, the gain or loss relating to any ine/ff ective portion is directly recognized in the income statement.\n\n## CASH FLOW HEDGE\n\nThe e/ff ective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedge is recognized in shareholders' equity. The gain or loss relating to any ine/ff ective portion is recognized in the income statement. Cumulative gain or loss in shareholders' equity is recycled in the income statement when the hedged underlying item impacts the profit or loss for the period (for example when the hedged future transaction is recognized). When a hedging instrument reaches its maturity date or is sold, or when a hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, the cumulative gains or losses in shareholders' equity are released in profit or loss when the initially hedged future transaction ultimately impacts the income statement.\n\n## NET INVESTMENT HEDGE\n\nThe accounting of net investments in foreign operations hedge is similar to the accounting of cash flow hedge. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the e/ff ective portion of the hedge is recognized in shareholders' equity; the gain or loss relating to the ine/ff ective portion is recognized in the income statement. Cumulative gains and losses in shareholders' equity impact the income statement only on disposal of the foreign operations.\n\n## DERIVATIVES NOT QUALIFYING FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING\n\nChanges in the fair value of all other derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in the income statement. Given IAS/uni00A039 constraints, only a few hedges are eligible to hedge accounting provisions described above. However, most\n\nI\n\nI\n\nof the derivatives used by the Group are purchased with a view to hedge or for example to use such instruments as an alternative to gain exposure to certain asset classes through 'synthetic positions'. See Note/uni00A020.\n\nThe Group holds financial investments that also include embedded  derivatives.  Such  embedded  derivatives  are separately recorded and measured at fair value through profit or loss if the impact is deemed material.\n\nFor the statement of financial position, derivatives are presented alongside the underlying assets or liabilities for which they are used, regardless of whether these derivatives meet the criteria for hedge accounting.\n\nThe purpose and condition of the use of derivatives within the Group are detailed in Note/uni00A020.\n\n## IBOR REFORM\n\nStarting from December/uni00A031, 2019, AXA applies the amendments to IAS/uni00A039 and IFRS/uni00A07 - Temporary exceptions from applying specific hedge accounting requirements, related to Phase/uni00A01 of the IBOR reform , issued in September/uni00A02019 and endorsed by the European Union on January/uni00A015, 2020. These amendments provide  temporary  relief   from  applying  specific  hedge accounting requirements to hedging relationships directly affected by the IBOR reform and introduce corresponding disclosure requirements. The relief enables  the concerned hedging  relationships to continue despite the uncertainties with respect to the cash flows of both the hedged item and the hedging instrument arising from the transition from old interest rate benchmarks to new ones.\n\nThe amendments apply to the Group's hedging relationships directly impacted by the IBOR reform qualified as fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. Derivative instruments involved in aforementioned hedges are interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange derivatives like interest rate swaps, forward interest rate swaps, bond and foreign exchange forwards and cross currency swaps. Nominal amounts of derivative instruments a/ff ected by the IBOR reform and involved in an IAS/uni00A039 hedge accounting relationship are presented in Note/uni00A020.2.\n\nThe relief  provided by the Phase/uni00A01 amendments ceaes  when there is no longer uncertainty with respect to the cash flows of both the hedged item and the hedging instrument. Thus, the Group still applies  the Phase/uni00A01 amendments as of December/uni00A031, 2021 to hedging  relationships for which that uncertainty is not removed yet with the e/ff ective cessation of the old interest rate benchmarks.\n\nAmendments to IAS/uni00A039, IFRS/uni00A09, IFRS/uni00A07, IFRS/uni00A04 and IFRS/uni00A016 related to Phase/uni00A02 of the IBOR reform , issued in August/uni00A02020, endorsed by the European Union in January/uni00A02021 and e/ff ective starting from January/uni00A01, 2021, are described in Note/uni00A01.2 'General accounting principles' above.\n\nAXA initiated a group-wide project to actively manage the transition to new benchmark rates in 2019. The definition phase took place in 2020, followed by the implementation phase launched in the first half of 2021.",

The table does not include the Group's exposure to the EURIBOR index that is expected to  be maintained in the coming years.\n\n## 1.11  ASSETS/LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE AND ASSETS/LIABILITIES INCLUDING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nThese comprise assets, particularly buildings or operations, intended to be sold or discontinued within twelve/uni00A0months. Subsidiaries  held  for  sale  remain  within  the  scope  of consolidation until the date on which the Group loses e/ff ective control. The assets and activities (assets and liabilities) concerned are measured at the lower of net carrying value and fair value net of selling costs. They are presented in separate asset and liability items on the balance sheet. The liabilities of subsidiaries (excluding shareholders' equity) held for sale are entered separately on the liability side of the consolidated balance sheet, with no netting against assets.\n\nIn the event of a discontinuation of operations representing either a business line, a main and distinct geographical region or a subsidiary acquired solely with a view to reselling, their a/f\\_t er-tax contribution is stated on a separate line of the income statement. For comparison purposes, the same applies to the presentation of income statements relating to previous periods that are included in the financial statements. This separate line also includes the post-tax gain/loss recognized on the disposal of the discontinued operation at the date of loss of control.\n\n## 1.12  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n\nCash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits while cash equivalents are short-term, liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash and which are subject to low volatility.\n\n## 1.13  SHARE CAPITAL AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\n\n## 1.13.1 Share capital\n\nOrdinary shares are classified in shareholders' equity when there is no obligation to transfer cash or other assets to the holders.\n\nAdditional costs (net of tax) directly attributable to the issue of equity instruments are shown in shareholders' equity as a deduction to the proceeds.\n\n## 1.13.2 Undated subordinated debt\n\nUndated subordinated debt and any related interest charges are classified either in shareholders' equity (in the 'other reserves' aggregate) or as liabilities depending on contract clauses without taking into consideration the prospect of redemption under economic constraints ( e.g. step up clauses or shareholders' expectations).\n\n## 1.13.3 Compound financial instruments\n\nAny financial instrument issued by the Group with an equity component (for example certain options granted to convert the debt instrument into an equity instrument of the Company) and a liability component (a contractual obligation to deliver cash) is classified separately on the liability side of the balance sheet with the equity component reported in Group shareholders' equity (in the 'other reserves' aggregate) and the liability component reported in financing debt. Gains and losses relating to redemptions or refinancing of the equity component are recognized as changes to shareholders' equity.\n\n## 1.13.4 Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares and any directly related costs are recorded as a deduction to consolidated shareholders' equity. Where treasury shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in consolidated shareholders' equity, net of any directly related costs and tax e/ff ects.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n6",

Such contracts may also transfer financial risk from the policyholders to the insurer. Investment contracts are contracts that carry financial risk with no significant insurance risk.\n\nA number of insurance and investment contracts contain discretionary participating features. These features entitle the contract holder to receive additional benefits or bonuses on top of these standard benefits:\n\n- /uni25A0 they are likely to represent a significant portion of the overall contractual benefits;\n- /uni25A0 their amount or timing is contractually at the discretion of the Group; and\n- /uni25A0 they are contractually based on the performance of a group of contracts, the investment returns of a financial asset portfolio or the Company profits, a fund or another entity that issues the contract.\n\nIn some insurance or investment contracts, the financial risk is borne by policyholders. Such contracts are usually Unit-Linked contracts.\n\nThe Group classifies its insurance and investment contracts into six categories:\n\n- /uni25A0 liabilities arising from insurance contracts;\n- /uni25A0 liabilities arising from insurance contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders;\n- /uni25A0 liabilities arising from investment contracts with discretionary participating features;\n- /uni25A0 liabilities  arising  from  investment  contracts  with  no discretionary participating features;\n- /uni25A0 liabilities arising from investment contracts with discretionary participating features where the financial risk is borne by\n\nI\n\nI\n\npolicyholders; these relate to Unit-Linked contracts or multifunds contracts containing a non-Unit-Linked fund with discretionary participating features; and\n\n- /uni25A0 liabilities  arising  from  investment  contracts  with  no discretionary participating features where the financial risk is borne by policyholders.\n\n## 1.14.2 Insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participating features\n\nExcept where IAS/uni00A039 applies, according to IFRS/uni00A04, recognition and derecognition are based on the AXA accounting policies existing prior to IFRS and are described below, except for the elimination of equalization provisions, selective changes as permitted by IFRS/uni00A04 (see below) and the extension of shadow accounting.\n\nThe main characteristics of the accounting principles applied prior to IFRS and retained a/f\\_t er the conversion to IFRS are as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 reserves must be su/ff icient;\n- /uni25A0 life reserves cannot be discounted using a discount rate higher than prudently estimated expected assets yield;\n- /uni25A0 acquisition costs are deferred to the extent recoverable and amortized based on the estimated gross profits emerging over the life of the contracts;\n- /uni25A0 Property & Casualty claims reserves represent estimated ultimate costs. Post claims reserves are generally not discounted, except in limited cases (a detail of discounted reserves is shown in Note/uni00A014.10).\n\n## PRE-CLAIMS RESERVES\n\nUnearned premiums reserves of non-life insurance contracts represent the prorata portion of written premiums that relates to unexpired risks at the closing date.\n\nFor traditional life insurance contracts (that is, contracts with significant mortality or morbidity risk), the future policy benefits reserves are calculated on a prospective basis according to each country's regulation provided methods used are consistent with the Group's policies and using assumptions on investment yields, morbidity/mortality and expenses.\n\nChanges in reserves are booked if there are impacts caused by a change in the mortality table.\n\nFuture policy benefits reserves relating to investment contracts with discretionary participation features (previously called 'savings contracts' in AXA's accounting principles) that carry low mortality and morbidity risk are generally calculated using a prospective approach based on discount rates usually set at inception with reserves similar to the retrospective approach ( i.e. 'account balance' methodology).\n\nThe discount rates used by AXA are less than or equal to the expected future investment yields (assessed on prudent basis).\n\nPart of the policyholders participation reserve is included in future policy benefits reserves, according to contractual",

        "page_content": "clauses. Except when these guarantees are covered by a Risk Management program using derivative instruments (see next paragraph), guaranteed minimum benefits reserves relating to contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders (insurance contracts because they include such guarantees or investment contracts with discretionary participating features), are built over the life of the contract based on a prospective approach: the present value of future benefit obligations to be paid to policyholders in relation to these guarantees is estimated on the basis of reasonable scenarios. These scenarios are based on assumptions including investment returns, volatility, surrender and mortality rates. This present value of future benefit obligations is reserved as fees are collected over the life of the contracts.\n\nSome guaranteed benefits such as Guaranteed Minimum Death or Income Benefits (GMDB or GMIB), or certain guarantees on return proposed by reinsurance treaties, are covered by a Risk Management program using derivative instruments. In order to minimize the accounting mismatch between liabilities and hedging derivatives, AXA has chosen to use the option allowed under IFRS/uni00A04.24 to re-measure its provisions: this revaluation is carried out at each account closing based on guarantee level projections and considers interest rates and other market assumptions. The liabilities revaluation impact in the current period is recognized through income, symmetrically with the impact of the change in value of hedging derivatives. This change in accounting principles was adopted on the first time application of IFRS on January/uni00A01, 2004, for contract portfolios covered by the Risk Management program at that date. Any additional contract portfolios covered by the Risk Management program a/f\\_t er this date are valued on the same terms as those that applied on the date the program was first applied.\n\n## POST CLAIMS RESERVES\n\n## Claims reserves (life and non-life contracts)\n\nThe purpose of claims reserves is to cover the ultimate cost of settling an insurance claim. Claims reserves are generally not discounted, except in cases such as disability annuities.\n\nClaims reserves include the claims incurred and reported, claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) as well as claims handling costs. Claims reserves are based on historical claims data, current trends, actual payment patterns for all insurance business lines as well as expected changes in inflation, regulatory environment or anything else that could impact amounts to be paid.\n\n## Shadow accounting and Deferred policyholders Participation Asset (DPA) or Liability (DPL)\n\nIn compliance with the option in IFRS/uni00A04, shadow accounting is applied to insurance and investment contracts with discretionary\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nparticipating features. Shadow accounting includes adjustments to technical liabilities, policyholders participation, other obligations, Deferred Acquisition Costs and value of business in force to take into account unrealized gains or losses on insurance liabilities or assets in the same way as it is done for a realized gain or loss of invested assets.\n\nFor example, for contracts with discretionary participating features,  shadow  accounting  consists  in  recognizing policyholders participation in unrealized capital gains and losses. Thus, when an unrealized gain is recognized, a deferred participating liability (DPL) is recorded. In case of an unrealized loss, a deferred participating asset (DPA) should be recognized only in the extent that its recoverability as defined below is highly probable. Deferred participating liabilities and assets are calculated using an appropriate long-term participation rate based on a contractual, regulatory and constructive obligation to allocate a percentage of gains/losses to policyholders. Jurisdictions where participating business is significant are Switzerland (for group insurance policies), Germany and France where the minimum is set to 90%, 90% and 85% respectively, of a basis which may include not only financial income but also other components. Participating business is less prevalent in Japan.\n\nDPL is fully recognized in the liabilities. As a consequence, there is no component recognized as an equity component and AXA does not need to ensure the liability recognized for the whole contract is not less than the amount that would result from applying IAS/uni00A039 to the guaranteed element.\n\nWhen a net unrealized loss (unrealized change in fair value, impairment, expense related\u2026) is accounted, a deferred participating asset (DPA) may be recognized only to the extent that it is highly probable that it can be charged to policyholders, by entity, in the future. This could be the case if the DPA can be offset against future participation either directly through deduction of the DPL from future capital gains or the DPL netted against value of businesses in force or indirectly through deduction of future fees on premiums or margins.\n\nUnrealized gains and losses on assets classified as trading or designated at fair value through profit and loss, along with any other entry impacting the income statement and generating a timing difference, are accounted for through the income statement with a corresponding shadow entry adjustment also in the statement of income. The shadow accounting adjustments relating to unrealized gains and losses on assets available for sale (for which change in fair value is taken to shareholders' equity) are booked through shareholders' equity.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The Group then performs projections to compare the value of assets backing policyholders' contracts with expected payments to be made to policyholders.\n\n## Liability adequacy test\n\nIn addition, at each balance sheet date, liability adequacy tests are performed in each consolidated entity in order to ensure the adequacy of the contract liabilities net of related DAC and VBI assets and deferred policyholders' participation asset. To perform these tests, entities group contracts together according to how they have been acquired, are serviced and have their profitability measured. Entities use current best estimates of all future contractual cash flows as well as claims handling and administrative expenses, and take into account guarantees and investment yields relating to assets backing these contracts:\n\n- /uni25A0 such tests are based on the intention and capacity of entities to hold financial assets according to various sets of scenarios, excluding the value of new business;\n- /uni25A0 they include projections of future investments sales according to estimated surrender patterns; and\n- /uni25A0 they determine the extent to which resulting gains/losses may be allocated/charged to policyholders, i.e. profit sharing between policyholders and shareholders.\n\nThese tests therefore measure the capacity to charge estimated future losses to policyholders on the basis of the assessment of the holding horizon and potential realization of losses among unrealized losses existing at closing date.\n\nContract specific risks directly related to the contracts (insurance risk, asset return risk, inflation risk, persistency, adverse selection,/uni00A0etc.) are also considered.\n\nDepending on the type of business, the future investment cash flows and discounting may be based on a deterministic best estimate rate, with corresponding participation, or in the case of Guaranteed Minimum Benefits, stochastic scenarios. Testing is performed either by a comparison of the reserve booked net of related assets (DAC, VBI,/uni00A0etc.) directly with discounted cash flows, or by ensuring that the discounted profit net of participation from release of the technical provisions exceeds net related assets.\n\nAny identified deficiency is charged to the income statement, initially by respectively writing off DPA, DAC or VBI, and subsequently by establishing a LAT provision for losses arising from the liability adequacy test for any amount in excess of DPA, DAC and VBI. For non-life insurance contracts, an unexpired risk provision is recognized for contracts on which the premiums are expected to be insu/ff icient to cover expected future claims and claims expenses.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## Embedded derivatives in insurance and investment contracts with discretionary participating features\n\nEmbedded derivatives that meet the definition of an insurance contract or correspond to options to surrender insurance contracts for a set amount (or based on a fixed amount and an interest rate) are not separately measured. All other embedded derivatives are bifurcated and booked at fair value when material (with change in fair value recognized through income statement) if they are not considered as closely related to the host insurance contract and/or do not meet the definition of an insurance contract.\n\nEmbedded derivatives meeting the definition of an insurance contract are described in Note/uni00A014.10.\n\n## 1.14.3 Investment contracts with no discretionary participating features\n\nIn accordance with IAS/uni00A039, these contracts are accounted for using 'deposit accounting', which mainly results in not recognizing the cash flows corresponding to premiums, benefits and claims in the statement of income (see 'Revenue recognition' paragraph/uni00A0below). These cash flows shall rather be recognized as deposits and withdrawals.\n\nThis category includes mainly Unit-Linked contracts that do not meet the definition of insurance or investment contracts with discretionary participating features. For these Unit-Linked contracts, the liabilities are valued at current unit value, i.e. on the basis of the fair value of the financial investments backing those contracts at the balance sheet date together with rights to future management fees, also known as Deferred Origination Costs (DOC, described in paragraph/uni00A01.7.3).\n\n## UNEARNED FEES RESERVES\n\nFees received at inception of an investment contract with no discretionary participating features to cover future services are recognized as liabilities and accounted in the income statement based on the same amortization pattern as the one used for Deferred Origination Costs.\n\n## 1.15  REINSURANCE\n\nThe Group assumes and cedes reinsurance in the normal course of business. Assumed reinsurance refers to the Group's acceptance of certain insurance risks that other companies have underwritten. Ceded reinsurance refers to the transfer of insurance risk, along with the related premiums, to other reinsurers who will assume the risks. Indeed, in the normal course of business, the Group seeks to reduce the potential amount of loss arising from claims events by reinsuring certain levels of risk assumed in various areas of exposure with other insurers or reinsurers.\n\nWhen these contracts meet the insurance contracts classification requirements, transactions relating to reinsurance are accounted for in the balance sheet and income statement in a similar way",

        "page_content": "to direct business transactions in agreement with contractual clauses. Reinsurance premiums ceded are expensed (and any commissions recorded thereon are earned) on a monthly prorata basis over the period the reinsurance coverage is provided. Ceded unearned reinsurance premiums represent the portion of premiums ceded applicable to the unexpired term of policies in force. Reinstatement premiums ceded are recognized at the time a loss event occurs where coverage limits for the remaining life of the contract are reinstated under pre-defined contract terms and are fully expensed when recognized. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policy. Provisions are made for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance.\n\nIf a reinsurance asset is impaired, the Group reduces the carrying amount accordingly and recognizes that impairment loss in the income statement. A reinsurance asset is impaired if there is objective evidence, as a result of an event that occurred a/f\\_t er initial recognition of the reinsurance assets, that the Group may not receive all amounts due to it under the terms of the contract, and the event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that the Group will receive from the reinsurer.\n\nIf the Group determines that reinsurance contracts do not meet the insurance contracts definition and/or principally transfers financial risk, the agreement is recorded using the deposit method of accounting. Deposits received are included in payables and deposits made are included within receivables. As amounts are paid or received, consistent with the underlying contracts, the deposit assets or liabilities are adjusted as appropriate.\n\n## 1.16  FINANCING DEBT\n\nFinancing debt issued to finance the solvency requirements of operational entities or to acquire a portfolio of contracts is isolated in a specific aggregate of the statement of financial position and is accounted for at amortized cost.\n\n## 1.17  OTHER LIABILITIES\n\n## 1.17.1 Income taxes\n\nThe current income tax expense (benefit) is recorded in the income statement on the basis of local tax regulations.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities emerge from temporary di/ff erences between the accounting and fiscal values of assets and liabilities, and when applicable from tax loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available to o/ff set the temporary di/ff erences taking into account the existence of tax groups and any legal or regulatory requirements on the limits (in terms of amounts or timing) relating to the carry forwards of unused tax\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\ncredits. The recoverability of deferred tax assets recognized in previous periods is re-assessed at each closing.\n\nIn particular, a deferred tax liability is recognized for any taxable temporary di/ff erence relating to the value of shares in a consolidated company held, unless the Group controls at what date the temporary di/ff erence will reverse and it is probable that the temporary di/ff erence will not reverse in the foreseeable future. If a Group company decides to sell its stake in another consolidated entity, the di/ff erence between the carrying value and the tax value of these shares for the company that holds them leads to the recognition of deferred tax (including as part of a business combination when the Group as the buyer intends to sell or carry out internal restructuring of the shares following the acquisition). The same approach applies to dividend payments that have been voted or deemed likely, to the extent that a tax on dividends will be due.\n\nDeferred taxes for taxable temporary di/ff erences relating to tax deductible goodwill are recognized to the extent they do not arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. These deferred taxes are only released if the goodwill is impaired or if the corresponding consolidated shares are sold.\n\nThe measurement of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets reflects the expected tax impact, at the balance sheet date. That would follow the way the Group expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. When income taxes are calculated at a di/ff erent rate if dividends are paid, deferred taxes are measured at the tax rate applicable to undistributed profits. The income tax consequences of dividends are only accounted when a liability to pay the dividend is recognized.\n\n## 1.17.2 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nPensions and other post-retirement benefits include the benefits payable to AXA Group employees after they retire (retirement compensation, additional pension benefit, health insurance). In order to meet those obligations, some regulatory frameworks have allowed or enforced the set up of dedicated funds (plan assets).\n\nDefined contribution plans: payments are made by the employer to a third party ( e.g. pension trusts). These payments free the employer of any further commitment, and the obligation to pay acquired benefits to the employees is transferred. The contributions paid by the employer are recorded as an expense in the income statement and no liability needs to be recorded once contributions are made.\n\nDefined benefit plans: an actuarial assessment of the commitments based on each plan's internal rules is performed. The present value of the future benefits paid by the employer, known as the DBO (Defined Benefit Obligation), is calculated annually on the basis of long-term projections of rate of salary increase, inflation rate, mortality, staff turnover, pension\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The amount recorded in the balance sheet for defined benefit plans is the di/ff erence between the present value of the Defined Benefit Obligation and the market value at the balance sheet date of the corresponding invested plan assets a/f\\_t er adjustment for any minimum funding requirement or any asset ceiling e/ff ect. If the net result is positive, a provision is recorded under the provision for risks and charges heading. If the net result is negative, a prepaid pension asset is recorded in the balance sheet but not more than its recoverable amount (asset ceiling). Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in shareholders' equity (in Other Comprehensive Income) in full in the period in which they occur. Similarly, the actual return on assets and any change in asset ceiling, excluding the net interest income on assets, is recognized in shareholders' equity. The regular impact in the income statement mainly relates to the current service cost (annually accruing employee benefit) and the net interest on the amount recorded in the opening balance sheet (unwinding of discount applied to the net liability/asset at start of the annual period, taking into account contributions and benefits payments during the period). Past service cost represents the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment to a defined benefit plan. It is recognized totally and immediately in the income statement when incurred. Gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan also have an impact in the income statement when the settlement occurs.\n\nIt should be noted that, all cumulative past actuarial gains and losses on all employee benefit plans were recognized in retained earnings as of January/uni00A01, 2004, AXA Group's transition date.\n\n## 1.17.3 Share-based compensation plans\n\nThe Group's share-based compensation plans are predominantly settled in equities.\n\nAll equity-settled share-based compensation plans are accounted for at fair value at the date they were granted and the fair value is expensed over the vesting period.\n\nCash-settled share-based compensation plans are recognized at fair value, which is remeasured at each balance sheet date with any change in fair value recognized in the statement of income.\n\nThe AXA Shareplan issued under a specific French regulatory framework includes a traditional and a leveraged formula (with an application subject to specific local regulations within the Group).\n\nThe cost of the traditional formula of Shareplan is valued according to the specific guidance issued in France by the ANC ( Autorit\u00e9 des normes comptables ). The cost of the leveraged formula plan is valued by taking into account the five-year lockup period for the employees (as in the traditional plan) but adding the value of the advantage granted to the employees by enabling them to benefit from an institutional derivatives-based pricing instead of a retail pricing.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## 1.18  PROVISIONS FOR RISKS, CHARGES AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\n\n## 1.18.1 Restructuring costs\n\nRestructuring provisions other than those that may be recognized on the balance sheet of an acquired company on the acquisition date are recorded when the Group has a present obligation evidenced by a binding sale agreement or a detailed formal plan whose main features are announced to those a/ff ected or to their representatives.\n\n## 1.18.2 Other provisions and contingencies\n\nProvisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events, when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when the provision can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses. The same applies to contingent liabilities, except if identified at the time of a business combination (see paragraph/uni00A01.3.2).\n\nProvisions are measured at management's best estimate, at the balance sheet date, of the expenditure required to settle the obligation, discounted at the market risk-free rate of return for long term provisions.\n\n## 1.19  REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\n## 1.19.1 Gross written premiums\n\nGross written premiums correspond to the amount of premiums written by insurance and reinsurance companies on business incepted in the year with respect to both insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participating features, net of cancellations and gross of reinsurance ceded. For reinsurance, premiums are recorded on the basis of declarations made by the ceding company, and may include estimates of gross written premiums. Any subsequent di/ff erences arising on such estimates are recorded in the period they are determined. For multi-year reinsurance treaties which are payable in annual installments, generally, only the initial annual installment is included as premiums written at policy inception due to the ability of the reinsured to commute or cancel coverage during the term of the policy. The remaining annual installments are included as premiums written at each successive anniversary date within the multi-year term.\n\nReinstatement premiums are recognized at the time a loss event occurs where coverage limits for the remaining life of the contract are reinstated under pre-defined contract terms and are fully earned when recognized.\n\nRetroactive loss portfolio transfer contracts are evaluated to determine whether they meet the established criteria for reinsurance accounting, and, if so, at inception, written premiums",

The contracts can cause significant variances in gross premiums written, net premiums written, net premiums earned, and net incurred losses in the years in which they are written.\n\n## 1.19.2 Fees and revenues from investment contracts with no discretionary participating features\n\nAmounts collected as premiums from investment contracts with no discretionary participating features are reported as deposits net of any loadings and policy fees. Revenues from these contracts consist of loadings and policy fees relating to underwriting, investment management, administration and surrender of the contracts during the period. Front-end fees collected corresponding to fees for future services are recognized over the estimated life of the contract (see 'Unearned fees reserves' paragraph/uni00A01.14.3).\n\n## 1.19.3 Deposit accounting\n\nInvestment contracts with no discretionary participating features fall within the scope of IAS/uni00A039. Deposit accounting applies to these contracts, which involves the following:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Group directly recognizes the consideration received (apart from potential fees) as a deposit financial liability rather than as revenues;\n- /uni25A0 claims paid are recognized as withdrawals with no posting in the income statement apart from potential fees.\n\n## 1.19.4 Unbundling\n\nThe Group unbundles the deposit component of contracts when required by IFRS/uni00A04, i.e. when both the following conditions are met:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Group can measure separately the 'deposit' component (including any embedded surrender option, i.e. without taking into account the 'insurance' component);\n- /uni25A0 the Group accounting methods do not otherwise require the recognition of all obligations and rights arising from the 'deposit' component.\n\nNo such situation currently exists within the Group. In accordance with IFRS/uni00A04, the Group continues to use the accounting principles previously applied by AXA to insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participating features. According to these principles, all rights and obligations related to contracts are recognized.\n\n## 1.19.5 Change in unearned premiums reserves net of unearned revenues and fees\n\nChanges in unearned premium reserves net of unearned revenues and fees include both the change in the unearned premiums reserve reported as a liability (see 'Unearned\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\npremiums reserves' in paragraph/uni00A01.14.2) and the change in unearned revenues and fees. Unearned revenues and fees correspond to upfront charges for future services recognized over the estimated life of insurance and investment contracts with discretionary participating features (see 'Unearned revenues reserves' in paragraph/uni00A01.14.2) and investment contracts with no discretionary participating features (see paragraph/uni00A01.14.3 'Unearned fees reserves').\n\n## 1.19.6 Net revenues from banking activities\n\nNet revenues from banking activities comprise all revenues and expenses from banking operations, including interest expenses not related to financing, banking fees, capital gains and losses on sales of financial assets, changes in the fair value of assets under the fair value option and related derivatives.\n\nThey exclude bank operating expenses and change in bad debt provisions, doubtful receivables or loans, which are recorded in 'Bank operating expenses'.\n\n## 1.19.7 Revenues from other activities\n\nRevenues from other activities mainly include:\n\n- /uni25A0 commissions received and fees for services relating to Asset Management activities;\n- /uni25A0 insurance companies revenues from non-insurance activities, notably commissions received on the sales or distribution of financial products; and\n- /uni25A0 rental income received by real estate management companies.\n\nRevenue is recognized when the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a service to a customer. In particular, as asset management entities of the Group deliver investment management services to their clients, revenue for providing this service may theoretically occur over-time, with a time-based measure of progress, which is relevant as the service is provided continuously over the contract period. However, according to IFRS/uni00A015, revenue is recognized only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. As a result, as management fees and performance fees received by the Group are generally calculated based on a percentage of assets under management (AUM), they are considered as variable considerations, which are subject to market volatility and are recognized only when uncertainty is resolved.\n\n## 1.19.8 Net investment result excluding financing expenses\n\nNet investment result includes:\n\n- /uni25A0 investment income from investments other than from banking activities, net of depreciation expense on real estate investments (depreciation expense relating to owner occupied properties is included in 'administrative expenses'); this item includes interest received calculated using the e/ff ective\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Structured entities often have a narrow and well-defined objective or restricted activities.\n\nThe Group does not hold significant interests in unconsolidated insurance/reinsurance structured entities.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nFurthermore, given its insurance business, the Group holds direct investments in corporates of various sectors, such as debt instruments, equity securities and loans. These investments are not designed to be done in structured entities and the whole Group's exposure is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nIn addition, the Group holds interests in investment funds including real estate companies. Some of these funds are fully consolidated or accounted for using the equity method (see Note/uni00A02.1.). Other funds are not consolidated because they are not controlled or under significant influence. By nature, and notably because of the power of decision usually given to the asset managers (internal or external to AXA), most of these funds are structured entities.\n\nAs investor, AXA's interests in unconsolidated funds are limited to the investments held. These ones are fully recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. Depending on the nature of its investment, AXA receives interests or dividends and can realize capital gains or losses in case of sale. These investments are subject to impairment testing as any financial asset.\n\nThe Group's asset manager companies also receive fees for the services they provide when they manage investment funds. Some unconsolidated funds managed by the Group are partially or fully held by external investors.",

For AXA Belgium the recoverability of the goodwill is assessed using the value in use approach. Both approaches are described in the N ote/uni00A01 'Accounting principles'.\n\nFor the CGUs within the Property & Casualty business segment recoverability of goodwill is also assessed using the value in use approach, as described in the N ote/uni00A01. For AXA Investment Managers the recoverability of the goodwill follows a market approach  with  recoverable  value  derived  from  market information, such as the price to earnings ratio of peers, and the earnings expected for the year. This methodology represents the fair value of the company to be compared with the market capitalization.\n\n## MAIN ASSUMPTIONS\n\nFor the CGUs within the Property & Casualty business segment, the value in use approach uses cash flow projections based on business plans approved by management covering up to three years and discounted using a risk adjusted rate. Cash flows beyond that period are extrapolated using sustainable perpetual growth rates assumed to be achievable over the long term to derive a terminal value. The earnings included in the business plan of each CGU are agreed with the management and defined locally considering best estimate operating assumptions, including expenses and loss ratios, investment income, economic capital, premium rates and taxes, all compliant with the various\n\nstandards and the requirements of supervisory authorities, when applicable. The discount rates used for the valuation have been derived using the Capital Asset Pricing Model which includes assumptions for risk-free interest rates, equity risk premiums, insurance activity beta and leverage ratio that are consistent with the view of AXA's Management for the specific markets in which the CGU operates. The main CGUs discount rates range from 3.6% to 8.3% in 2021, compared to a range of 3.4% to 8.4% in 2020, and growth rates applied beyond the strategic plan horizon, where applicable, vary from 0.6% to 5.3% in 2021, compared to a range of 0.4% to 5.4% in 2020.\n\nFor Life & Savings CGUs, recoverable amounts are calculated using a risk neutral approach, relying on European Embedded Value (EEV) techniques, that are industry specific and widely used. The EEV represents the excess of the market value of assets over the market value of liabilities. The market value of liabilities is based on best estimate liabilities which are the probability weighted average of future cash flows adjusted to allow for the time value of money, using the relevant term structure of the riskfree interest rates, as well as for deviations related to the cost of non-hedgeable, i.e. non-financial, risks. The calculation of best estimate liabilities involves the use of operational and economic assumptions. Operational assumptions include factors, such as mortality, morbidity and lapse/surrender rates, expenses allowance and taxes, all compliant with the requirements of supervisory authorities. Future cash flows are discounted using reference rates that are compliant with EIOPA specifications of using swap rates adjusted for credit and volatility risk.\n\nThe table below shows the adjustments in basis points by currency:\n\n| Reference Yield Curve  (in bps)   |   EUR |   GBP |   USD |   JPY |   CHF |   HKD |\n|-----------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Volatility adjustment (added)     |     3 |     3 |    23 |     4 |     4 |     2 |\n| Credit risk adjustment (deducted) |    10 |    10 |    10 |    10 |    10 |    10 |\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The discount rate used to determine the recoverable value of AXA Belgium was 4.4% in 2021 as opposed to 4.5% used in 2020.\n\n## ALL CASH-GENERATING UNITS (CGU)\n\nThe results of cash flow projections exceed the carrying amount of each related CGU or group of units.\n\nThe test of the recoverability of goodwill for AXA XL CGU as of December/uni00A031, 2021 evidenced a significant margin. The value in use basis reflects management projections of the cash flows, which are based on the business plan of AXA XL and reflect (i)/uni00A0that following the significant organizational and underwriting actions undertaken over the past years to transform portfolio and restore profitability, AXA XL is well positioned for disciplined growth, (ii)/uni00A0further significant reductions in Nat Cat exposure to reduce earnings volatility and (iii)/uni00A0the continuation of significant tari/ff    increases that contribute to profitability over the horizon of the Plan. Sensitivities were performed with regards to the main assumptions and under the plausible scenarios, the value in use still exceeded the carrying amount.\n\nThe test of the recoverability of the Goodwill for AXA Germany P&C and AXA UK & Ireland P&C CGUs as of December/uni00A031, 2021 evidenced material margins. Cash flows projections based on the 2023 business plan approved by the AXA Group management,\n\nI\n\nI\n\ndemonstrate that AXA Germany and AXA UK & Ireland will continue to deliver resilient earnings leading to conclude that their goodwill is recoverable.\n\nThe recoverability of the goodwill of Japan Life & Savings CGU relies on European Embedded Value (EEV) and New Business Value (NBV) projections using a reasonable new business multiple, derived from market consistent assumptions. The level of profitability of products sold by AXA Japan in 2021 reached a high margin over the premiums received. The EEV and NBV projections exceeds the carrying amount of Japan Life & Savings CGU.\n\nFor all CGUs, to the extent that the valuation of securities and interest rate levels remain low for prolonged periods of time, or volatility and other market conditions stagnate or worsen, new business volumes and profitability together with the value of the inforce portfolio are likely be negatively a/ff ected. In addition, the future cash flow expectations from both the inforce and new business and other assumptions underlying management's current business plans could be negatively impacted by other risks to which the Group is exposed. For each CGU, sensitivity analyses were performed with regards to the discount rate: an increase of 0.5% in the discount rate would not lead to an impairment loss for any of the CGUs as the recoverable amount for each CGU would still exceed its carrying value.\n\nHowever, subsequent impairment tests may be based upon di/ff erent assumptions and future cash flow projections, which may result in an impairment of these assets in the foreseeable future.",

E/ff ective maturities may di/ff er from those presented, mainly because some assets include clauses allowing early redemption, with or without penalty or duration extension features. In some cases, the effect of derivatives (detailed in Note/uni00A020.3) modifies the maturity profile of assets presented below.\n\nDebt instruments (at cost) that are not quoted in an active market and loans and debt instruments backing contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders are excluded from the table below.

As substantially all of the risks and rewards of the financial assets remain with the Group over the entire lifetime of the transaction, the Group does not derecognize the financial assets. The proceeds of the sale are reported separately in the line item Net investment income within the consolidated\n\nstatement of income. Interest expense from repurchase and security lending transactions is accrued over the duration of the agreements.\n\nAdditionally, the Group is party to total return swaps where financial assets are sold to a counterparty with an agreement in which the Group retains substantially all the risk and rewards of the financial instruments. Therefore, the Group doesn't derecognize the assets.\n\nThe breakdown of transferred financial assets/liabilities not qualifying for derecognition was as follows:\n\n|                                                       | December/uni00A031, 2021                                              | December/uni00A031, 2021                      | December/uni00A031, 2021                  | December/uni00A031, 2020                                              | December/uni00A031, 2020                      | December/uni00A031, 2020                  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| (in Euro million)                                     | Debt  instruments  designated  at fair value  through profit  or loss | Debt  instruments  available  for/uni00A0sale | Debt  instruments  -

Such assets are categorized in the level/uni00A01 of the IFRS/uni00A013 fair value hierarchy.\n\nLevel/uni00A02 and 3 assets are investments which are not quoted in an active market or for which there is no active market. Fair values for level/uni00A02 and 3 assets include:\n\n- /uni25A0 values provided by external parties which:\n- \u00b7 are readily available including last transaction prices but relate to assets for which the market is not always active, or\n- \u00b7 are provided at the request of the Group by pricing services and which are not readily publicly available;\n- /uni25A0 assets measured on the basis of valuation techniques including a varying degree of assumptions supported by market transactions and observable data.\n\nThe common characteristic of level/uni00A02 and 3 assets is that their markets are considered as less active. Their value is generally based on mark to market basis, except when there is no market or when the market is distressed, in which case a mark to model approach is used. Assets not quoted in an active market which are marked to market mainly using observable inputs are classified in level/uni00A02. Assets not quoted in an active market for which fair value determination is not mainly based on observable inputs are classified as level/uni00A03. For all assets not quoted in an active market/no active market and for which a mark to model approach is used, the classification between level/uni00A02 and level/uni00A03 depends on the proportion of assumptions used supported by market transactions and market observable data:\n\n- /uni25A0 assumed to be used by pricing services or;\n- /uni25A0 used by the Group in the limited cases of application of mark to model valuations.\n\n## Fair values determined in whole directly by reference to an active market (level 1)\n\nDuring 2021, the global economic recovery has impacted the corporate bonds market which prices experienced a bid-ask spread tightening leading to transfers from level/uni00A02 to level/uni00A01.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, the net transfer from level/uni00A02 to level/uni00A01 amounted to \u20ac 14,454/uni00A0million. This amount comprised \u20ac19,637/uni00A0 million transferred from level/uni00A0 2 to level/uni00A0 1, and \u20ac5,183/uni00A0million from level/uni00A01 to level/uni00A02, of which \u20ac4,035/uni00A0million for corporate bonds and \u20ac682/uni00A0million for government bonds.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## Fair values of assets not quoted in an active market - no/uni00A0active markets (level 2 and level 3)\n\n## Overview of the nature of such investments\n\nAmounts presented in level/uni00A02 and 3 represent a variety of circumstances. A financial instrument is regarded as not quoted in an active market if there is little observation of transaction prices as an inherent characteristic of the instrument, when there is a significant decline in the volume and level of trading activity, in case of significant illiquidity or if observable prices cannot be considered as representing fair value because of dislocated market conditions. Characteristics of inactive markets can therefore be very di/ff erent in nature, inherent to the instrument or be indicative of a change in the conditions prevailing in certain markets.\n\nThe identification of level/uni00A03 assets among assets not quoted in an active market involves a significant level of judgment. The following are considered as observable: inputs provided by external pricing services, information observable obtained from specialized data providers, rating agencies, external surveys. The extent to which such data are external to the Group and not assessed by internal valuation teams is one of the main criteria applied in assessing whether data are observable or not. Should those data be significantly adjusted or would they be outdated because of the lack of newly available factors, such inputs would be deemed unobservable. Another area of judgment is the assessment of the significance of an input against the fair value measurement in its entirety. As a result, a di/ff erent cut between observable and unobservable data and variances in the weighting of the significance of each input against the fair value measurement in its entirety could produce a different categorization.\n\nAssets such as certain unquoted debt instruments, some instruments issued on private markets such as private equity instruments or private loans were always considered as not quoted in active markets as an inherent characteristic of these investments and were included as assets not quoted in active markets/no active markets in all periods presented. Valuations are based either on external pricing providers or internal models using techniques commonly used by market participants. Valuation teams make the maximum use of current transaction prices (if any) and observable data but some of the underlying sectors to which the investments relate may be so particular that significant adjustments are performed or unobservable data are used. Private equity funds of funds are measured on the basis of the latest net asset values of funds provided to the Group.",

Specifics to the valuation of investments are further described in Note/uni00A09.10.1 and the same principles apply to the fair value of investments at amortized cost.\n\nGenerally fair values of investments in real estate properties cannot be determined via reference to quotes of an active market from an exchange market or service provider and no property is therefore categorized in level/uni00A01. However, AXA's investments in real estate properties are mostly physically located within liquid markets with identical or comparable asset sales. Given the regulatory environment, some real estate properties located in markets such us France are valued by experts using very similar approaches leading to very limited dispersion in prices, with a majority of market inputs themselves homogeneous in terms of sources and values. Hence, the Group, consistently with the policy described in Note/uni00A01.5 which notably considers, for assets\n\nnot quoted in an active market, the weight of observable inputs in the valuation, concludes that the fair value calculations, which are based on valuations performed by qualified property appraisers mainly based on market observable inputs, are considered as level/uni00A02 fair values. However, as described in Note/uni00A01.5 and Note/uni00A09.10.1, the assessment of the significance of an input against the fair value measurement in its entirety involves judgment and a di/ff erent weighting could produce a di/ff erent categorization.\n\nThe fair values of debt instruments and loans at cost are determined with consideration of market inputs to the extent possible. For level/uni00A02 instruments, the fair value is mainly derived using valuation techniques based upon observable market interest rate curves. For level/uni00A03 instruments, the fair values of debt instruments and loans at cost are determined by valuation techniques using limited observable market data.\n\n## 9.11  INVESTMENTS BACKING CONTRACTS WHERE THE FINANCIAL RISK IS BORNE BY/uni00A0POLICYHOLDERS\n\n| (in Euro million)                                      | December/uni00A031, 2021 Fair value /uni00A0(a)   | December/uni00A031, 2020 Fair value/uni00A0 (a)   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Investment in real estate properties                   | 4,673                                             | 4,522                                             |\n| Equity instruments & non-consolidated investment funds | 72,629                                            | 63,541                                            |\n| Debt instruments                                       | 8,671                                             | 9,366                                             |\n| Others                                                 | 343                                               | 373                                               |\n| TOTAL INSURANCE ACTIVITIES                             | 86,315                                            | 77,802                                            |\n\nFinancial assets included in these investments are valued at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option.\n\nI\n\nI",

During this deferral period, additional disclosures related to SPPI criterion and to credit risk exposure are required.\n\nTo determine the appropriate classification of financial assets under IFRS/uni00A09, an entity would need to assess the contractual cash flows characteristics of any financial asset. Indeed, the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding i.e. cash flows that are consistent with a basic lending arrangement. In a basic lending arrangement, consideration for the time value of money and credit risk are typically the most significant elements of interest.\n\nIFRS/uni00A09 defines the terms 'principal' as being the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition, and the 'interest' as being compensation for (i)/uni00A0the time value of money, and (ii)/uni00A0the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time.\n\nThe tables below set out the result of the SPPI test for the assets not currently designated as at fair value through profit and loss, with a split between Insurance and Other activities.\n\nEach investment item is presented gross of tax and excluding the e/ff  ect of related hedging derivatives (IAS/uni00A039 qualifying hedges or economic hedges) and the potential impact resulting from the application of the future IFRS/uni00A017/uni00A0standard on insurance contracts that will avoid accounting mismatches in particular for contracts eligible to the variable fee approach measurement model.\n\n## INSURANCE\n\n|                                                                   | December/uni00A031, 2021   | December/uni00A031, 2021                              | December/uni00A031, 2021   | December/uni00A031, 2021                              | December/uni00A031, 2020   | December/uni00A031, 2020                              | December/uni00A031, 2020   | December/uni00A031, 2020                              |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                   | Fail the SPPI test         | Fail the SPPI test                                    | Pass the SPPI test         | Pass the SPPI test                                    | Fail the SPPI test         | Fail the SPPI test                                    | Pass the SPPI test         | Pass the SPPI test                                    |\n| (in Euro million)                                                 | Fair  value                | Change  in unrea- lized gain  or loss  in/uni00A02021 | Fair  value                | Change  in unrea- lized gain  or loss  in/uni00A02021 | Fair  value                | Change  in unrea- lized gain  or loss  in/uni00A02020 | Fair  value                | Change  in unrea- lized gain  or loss  in/uni00A02020 |\n| Debt instruments held to maturity                                 | 0                          | -

IFRS/uni00A07 requires the disclosure of fair value or value ranges for these contracts, unless the Group cannot reliably measure the participating features.\n\nIn the context of the current IFRS/uni00A04, the IASB acknowledged the di/ff iculties involved in the recognition and the measurement of discretionary participating features included in insurance or investment contracts. The IASB issued guidance to measure fair value but with no principles addressing policyholder participation features. It would therefore be premature to interpret this definitions before the implementation guidance of the future standard IFRS/uni00A017 clarifies it (see Note/uni00A01.2).\n\nTherefore, too many uncertainties remain outstanding to define how to determine the fair value of participating contracts. As a result, fair value or value ranges for investment contracts with discretionary participating features cannot be reliably disclosed.\n\n## 14.7 LOSS RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TABLE\n\nThe loss reserve development table shows movements in loss reserves between 2011  and 2021 , based on previously applied accounting standards. All contracts concerned are insurance contracts as defined by IFRS.\n\nThe first line labelled 'Gross reserves for unpaid claims and claims expenses developed initially at the booking date' represents the loss reserves developed in the Group's balance sheet on the reporting date for the year indicated in the column heading. For example, the amount of \u20ac45,946 /uni00A0million appearing in the first line of the table in the 2011  column represents all loss reserves developed in all years of occurrence prior to and including 2011 , recognized on the Group's balance sheet as of December/uni00A031, 2011 .\n\nThe second line titled 'Gross reserves for unpaid claims and claims expenses developed in 2021  adjusted for changes in exchange rates and scope of consolidation' indicates the amount that would have been developed initially at the booking date, had the exchange rates for the current year been used (for reserves recognized by AXA Group entities that do not use the Euro as their functional currency) and assuming an identical scope of consolidation to that used for the last diagonal of the table.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The final cost estimate varies year on year as information relating to losses still outstanding becomes more reliable.\n\nThe surplus (shortfall) of the initial reserve with respect to the re-estimated (gross) final cost for each year represents, for a given year N, the di/ff erence between the amount shown in the second line (gross reserves for unpaid claims and claims expenses developed in 2021  adjusted for changes in exchange rates and scope of consolidation) and the amount shown in the final diagonal under 'Reserve re-estimated'.\n\n## 14.7.1 Loss reserve development

The  decrease in deferred policyholders' participation liabilities mainly relates to a  decrease in unrealized gains on assets available for sale in France and Germany.\n\n## 14.9 PAYMENT, SURRENDER PROJECTIONS, INSURANCE AND INVESTMENT CONTRACT LIABILITIES DISCOUNT RATES\n\nIn the tables presented in Note/uni00A014.9.1 and 14.9.2, liabilities arising from Life/uni00A0& Savings and Property/uni00A0& Casualty insurance contracts and investment contracts exclude contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders. These liabilities are not exposed to interest rate or duration risk, except Unit-Linked contracts with performance guarantees. In addition, as far as liquidity risk is concerned, entities hold Unit-Linked assets backing the corresponding liabilities arising from these contracts. Occasional mismatches result mainly from administrative timing di/ff erences in the processing of day-to-day operations.\n\n## 14.9.1 Payment and surrender projections\n\nThe table below shows the breakdown of projected payments and surrenders related to insurance and investment contracts (excluding contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders). Actual maturities may di/ff er significantly from the estimates set out below, mainly because some of the contracts contain a surrender option controlled by the policyholder that may reduce their duration.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe projections shown below cannot be compared with the reserves carried on the balance sheet and are higher than the published balance sheet figures because they represent expected cash flows without the impact of discounting. They are also shown net of inflows of periodical premiums payable by policyholders.\n\nThe figures shown in the first line of the table below represent estimated undiscounted cash outflows in connection to death, incapacity and disability claims, surrenders, annuities, minimum guaranteed benefits for Unit-Linked contracts, Property/uni00A0& Casualty and Health claims, net of premiums due from policyholders under contracts in-force. These cash flows are based on assumptions regarding mortality, incapacity and disability, surrender and settlement frequency for Property/uni00A0& Casualty businesses, which are consistent with past experience. They are gross of reinsurance. Given the strong use of estimates, it is likely that actual payments will di/ff er.",

Liabilities are based on estimates, and one of the key assumptions used in these estimates is the discount rate.\n\nAs shown in the table below, as at December/uni00A031, 2021 : 83%  of Life/uni00A0& Savings reserves (excluding Unit-Linked contracts) were discounted, of which 12%  were subject to a revision of the discount rate and 70%  retained the rate set at inception, subject to the liability adequacy test described in Note/uni00A01.\n\nBy convention, contracts with zero guaranteed rates are deemed undiscounted, except for products o/ff ering guaranteed rates updated annually and for one year: these contracts are presented in discounted reserves. Reserves for savings contracts with\n\nnon-zero guaranteed rates are discounted at the technical restatements at closing and mainly consist of reserves for guarantees (Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits, etc.).\n\nIn Property/uni00A0& Casualty business, most reserves (94%  as of December/uni00A031, 2021 ) are not discounted, with the exception of disability annuities and Workers' Compensation liabilities that are deemed structured settlements and where the discount rate is revised regularly. Undiscounted reserves are not sensitive to interest rate risks in the financial statements.\n\nThe rates presented in the table below are weighted average rates for all the portfolios under consideration. For contracts with guaranteed rates that are revised annually, rates are considered at the closing date. The risk factors associated with policyholders contracts are set out in Note/uni00A04.\n\nDiscount rates are qualified as locked-in when those used in the first recognition of the technical liabilities remain unchanged in the subsequent years and are qualified as unlocked when updated in subsequent years.\n\n|                                                             | December/uni00A031, 2021   | December/uni00A031, 2021   | December/uni00A031, 2020   | December/uni00A031, 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| (in Euro million, except percentages)                       | Carrying  value            | Average  discount rate     | Carrying  value            | Average  discount rate     |\n| Life/uni00A0& Savings - Locked-in discount rate/uni00A0 (a) | 215,739                    | 1.85%                      | 218,960                    | 1.78%                      |\n| Life/uni00A0& Savings - Unlocked discount rate              | 37,682                     | 2.26%                      | 38,170                     | 2.28%                      |\n| Life/uni00A0& Savings - Undiscounted reserves               | 53,443                     | -                          | 50,405                     | -                          |\n| Sub-total Life/uni00A0& Savings                             | 306,865                    | -                          | 307,535                    | -                          |\n| Non Life - Locked-in discount rate/uni00A0 (a)              | 4,703                      | 2.81%                      | 4,631                      | 2.85%                      |\n| Non Life - Unlocked discount rate                           | 2,361                      | 2.51%                      | 2,225                      | 2.49%                      |\n| Non Life - Undiscounted reserves                            | 109,270                    | -                          | 103,321                    | -                          |\n| Sub-total - Non Life                                        | 116,335                    | -                          | 110,177                    | -                          |\n| TOTAL INSURANCE AND INVESTMENT CONTRACTS                    | 423,200                    | -                          | 417,712                    | -                          |\n\nAmounts are presented excluding the impact of derivatives on insurance and investment contracts (presented in Note/uni00A020.4) and excluding liabilities related to unearned revenues and fees, and to policyholders' participations.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

As of December/uni00A031, 2021, the carrying value and fair value amount and the related contractual amount due at maturity for such liabilities were \u20ac641/uni00A0million and \u20ac581/uni00A0million respectively (\u20ac690/uni00A0million and \u20ac644/uni00A0 million as of December/uni00A031, 2020), including the Euro Medium Term Notes.\n\nThe Group applies the IFRS/uni00A013 fair value hierarchy as described in Note/uni00A01.5. The valuation method of liabilities arising from banking activities excluding derivatives (detailed in Note/uni00A020.5) are as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 banking liabilities issued at fair value - Retail customers (\u20ac641/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021): values are based upon market prices that are available in active markets and are/uni00A0considered as level/uni00A01 fair values;\n- /uni25A0 retail customers deposits (\u20ac3,726/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021) and Corporate customers deposits (\u20ac5,886/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021) are not traded in active markets and quoted prices are not available. Given the short maturities of main liabilities arising from banking activities (see Note/uni00A015.2), the carrying amounts may be considered as reasonable proxies for fair values. Thus, the fair value of amounts displayed above for these instruments are considered to be level/uni00A03 fair values;\n- /uni25A0 interbanking refinancing (\u20ac2,325/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021):\n- \u00b7 \u20ac2,251/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021 (\u20ac2,001/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020): values are based upon market prices that are available in active markets and are/uni00A0considered as level/uni00A01 fair values,\n- \u00b7 \u20ac74/uni00A0 million as of December/uni00A031, 2021 (\u20ac109/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020): mainly based on non-observable market data inputs and are considered to be level/uni00A03 fair values;\n- /uni25A0 refinancing  with  central  banks:  \u20ac2,076/uni00A0 million  as  of December/uni00A031, 2021 (\u20ac1,887/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020): values are based on observable market data inputs. As such, the fair values of these liabilities were considered as level/uni00A02 instruments.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The fair value decreased by \u20ac151/uni00A0million compared to December/uni00A031, 2020 in line with the interest rates increase throughout the year and the repayment of the Mandatorily exchangeable bonds for \u20ac-703/uni00A0million,\n\npartly offset by the Green bonds subordinated issuance for \u20ac+1,000/uni00A0million.\n\nThe Group applies the IFRS/uni00A013 fair value hierarchy as described in Note/uni00A01.5./uni00A0The fair value amounts are mainly based on observable market data inputs and are therefore considered as level/uni00A02 fair value.\n\n## 17.3 EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK AND CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES\n\nThe table below sets out the maturities based on contractual cash flows of financing debt (including the impact of derivatives detailed in Note/uni00A020.1).

Effective maturities may differ from those presented, mainly because some instruments include clauses allowing early redemption, with or without penalty.\n\n|                                                                                             | December/uni00A031, 2021                                                | December/uni00A031, 2021                                                | December/uni00A031, 2021                                                |                        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                                                                             | Carrying value of other debt instrument  by/uni00A0contractual maturity | Carrying value of other debt instrument  by/uni00A0contractual maturity | Carrying value of other debt instrument  by/uni00A0contractual maturity |                        |\n| (in Euro million)                                                                           | 12/uni00A0months  or/uni00A0less                                        | More than  1/uni00A0year up  to/uni00A05/uni00A0years                   | More than  5/uni00A0years                                               | Total  carrying  value |\n| Debts relating to investments under total return swap agreement ('TRS')                     | 1,060                                                                   | 1,060                                                                   | 4,154                                                                   | 6,273                  |\n| Other debt instruments issued, notes and bank overdra/f\\_t s excluding  TRS -

The change relates to:\n\n- /uni25A0 impact of rate differences on notional tax charges (\u20ac571/uni00A0million) corresponding to the di/ff erence between the blended tax (expected tax calculated at each entity level with the applicable standard rate) and the tax calculated using the 28.41% French tax rate applicable to the Company. This tax rate is composed of a basic tax rate (27.50%) and a social contribution (0.91%). The blended standard rate was 24.05% in 2021 and 35.96% in 2020. The decrease of the blended tax rate is mainly due to an unfavorable geographical mix related to the significant COVID-19 losses incurred at AXA XL in 2020;\n\n## 19.2 DEFERRED TAX\n\nIn the table below, the net deferred tax position corresponds to the di/ff erence between Deferred Tax Assets (DTA) and Deferred Tax Liabilities (DTL) carried on the Group's consolidated statement of financial position.

Their net fair value amounted to \u20ac-1,575/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021 (\u20ac2,736 /uni00A0million at the end of 2020), comprised of the fair value of derivatives on invested assets (\u20ac-2,689/uni00A0million and \u20ac1,356/uni00A0million at the end of 2020 - see Note/uni00A020.3) and the fair value of derivatives on liabilities (\u20ac-1,123/uni00A0million and \u20ac-1,380/uni00A0million at the end of 2020 - see Note/uni00A020.4).\n\nAXA uses derivatives primarily to hedge various risks stemming from both sides of the balance sheet in the context of its Asset Liability Management (ALM) strategy in insurance companies, as well as holdings and banks. Notional amount of such hedging strategies amounted to \u20ac369.2/uni00A0billion as of December/uni00A031, 2021 (\u20ac338.9/uni00A0billion at the end of 2020) and were mainly used to:\n\n- /uni25A0 manage interest rate exposures on fixed maturity investments, long-term debt and guaranteed interest rates on insurance contracts;\n- /uni25A0 reduce foreign-currency exposures on foreign-currency denominated investments and liabilities;\n- /uni25A0 manage liquidity positions (including the ability to pay benefits and claims when due) in connection with Asset Liability Management and local regulatory requirements for insurance and banking operations;\n- /uni25A0 limit equity risk;\n- /uni25A0 limit credit risk about certain investments in corporate debt instruments.\n\nAXA also uses derivatives as an alternative to gain exposure to certain asset classes through 'synthetic positions', for example, holding cash and equity futures instead of physical equities. Another example is the combination of government bonds and credit default swaps (CDS) as a synthetic position and an alternative to the direct purchase of a corporate bond. These\n\nschemes do not add any specific risks compared with other investment assets.\n\nThe notional amount of derivatives which is used to express the volume of instruments outstanding and to provide a basis for comparison with other financial instruments most certainly overstates the level of activity and does not directly measure risk as it greatly exceeds the possible credit and market loss that could arise from such transactions. It does not represent the amounts that are e/ff ectively exchanged by the parties, and thus is not a measure of the Group's exposure to derivative instruments. For example, the Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of its counterparties to the derivative instruments but is not exposed to credit risk on the entire notional amounts. AXA actively manages counterparty risk generated by derivatives through a specific group-wide policy. This policy includes a limit framework and an exposure monitoring process. Limits are specifically set for each authorized counterparty, based on an internal scoring system. This policy also includes daily to weekly collateralization for the majority of the Group's exposure. The total net collateral given communicated for all derivative instruments including those related to derivatives held within investment funds of the 'Satellite Investment Portfolio' (see Note/uni00A01.8.2) was \u20ac2.0/uni00A0billion as of December/uni00A031, 2021 (\u20ac1.4/uni00A0billion at the end of 2020). This net total includes amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and unrecognized commitments received or given disclosed in Note/uni00A029.\n\nAXA is increasing or decreasing its derivative positions in accordance with AXA's governance framework for derivatives. In particular, hedging activities are one of the most important instruments to decrease the risk of the options and guarantees that are embedded in some Life/uni00A0& Savings and Property/uni00A0& Casualty products; they also lead to a reduction of the capital requirements for those business activities under Solvency/uni00A0II.

They also include 'macro-hedging' derivatives as defined by the IASB in IAS/uni00A039.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, the notional amount of hedging derivative instruments as defined by IAS/uni00A039 (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge and net investment hedge) of the Group was \u20ac115.7/uni00A0billion versus \u20ac97.1/uni00A0billion at the end of 2020. The net fair value recorded was \u20ac-2,239/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021, versus \u20ac-52/uni00A0million at the end of 2020.\n\n## 20.2.1 Interest rate derivative instruments\n\nThe AXA Group's primary interest rate exposure is related to contracts with guaranteed benefits and the risk that the value of the financial assets purchased with the consideration received from the contract holders is insu/ff icient to fund the guaranteed benefits and expected discretionary participation payable to them. To hedge against potential adverse market conditions, derivative strategies are used to reduce the risk arising from the guarantee liability over time.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, the notional amount of interest rate derivative instruments totalled \u20ac203.6/uni00A0billion (\u20ac189.7/uni00A0billion at the end of 2020). Their net fair value as of December/uni00A031, 2021 amounted to \u20ac974/uni00A0million (\u20ac2,075/uni00A0million at the end of 2020).

Their net fair value amounted to \u20ac209/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021 (\u20ac101/uni00A0million at the end of 2020).

        "page_content": "## 20.2.3 Currency derivative instruments\n\nThe Group has entered into di/ff erent currency instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk. Currency derivative instruments represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed price and settlement date.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, the notional amount of currency derivative amounted to \u20ac137.2/uni00A0billion versus \u20ac119.8/uni00A0billion at the end of 2020. Their market value was \u20ac-1,133/uni00A0million versus \u20ac1,169/uni00A0million at the end of 2020. AXA mainly uses (i)/uni00A0currency future and forward contracts (60% of total notional amount of currency derivative instruments), (ii)/uni00A0currency option contracts (21%), and (iii)/uni00A0currency swaps (18%).\n\nOne of the main objectives of currency derivatives instruments used by the Company is to limit variations in net foreign currencydenominated assets resulting from movements in exchange rates in order to protect partially the value of AXA's net foreigncurrency investments in its subsidiaries to the extent of the following year's foreseeable dividends and more generally the exposure of AXA SA's liquidity to forex movements. The notional amount of derivatives used by the Company to hedge the foreign currency exposure increased from \u20ac16.3/uni00A0billion at the end of 2020 to \u20ac22.9/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021.\n\nCurrency derivative instruments are also used to hedge foreign exchange mismatch between assets and liabilities in insurance subsidiaries of the Group. While most of the operating units' commitments are matched by assets denominated in the same currency, some entities may invest in foreign currency denominated assets to diversify their investments. This is the case mainly in (i)/uni00A0Switzerland using such contracts to hedge exchange rate risk arising from their investments in equities and debt instruments denominated in non-CHF currencies (mainly Euro and US Dollar) with a total notional amount of \u20ac17.9/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021 versus \u20ac19.1/uni00A0billion at the end of 2020, (ii)/uni00A0Japan using future and forward foreign currency contracts to hedge exchange-rate risk arising from its investments mainly in fixedmaturity debt instruments denominated in non JPY currencies with a total notional amount of \u20ac16.5/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021 versus \u20ac18.0/uni00A0billion at the end of 2020 and (iii)/uni00A0Hong Kong using forward contracts and cross currency swaps to hedge exchange rate risk with a total notional amount of \u20ac19.1/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021 versus \u20ac12.5/uni00A0billion at the end of 2020.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nA description of exchange-rate risk related to the operating activities of Group subsidiaries and the Company is included in Section/uni00A05.3 'Market Risks' of this Annual Report with amounts of exposures to exchange-rate risk and corresponding hedges.\n\nIn accordance with IAS/uni00A021 and IAS/uni00A039, the translation di/ff erence relating to these debt instruments used in operational entities is recognized in profit or loss and o/ff sets most of the change in market value of associated derivative instruments, which is also recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## 20.2.4 Credit derivative instruments\n\nThe Group, as part of its investment and credit Risk Management activities, uses strategies that involve credit derivatives, which consist mainly of Credit Default Swaps (CDS). These instruments are used as an alternative to corporate bonds portfolios, when coupled with government debt instruments, but also as a protection on single names or specific portfolios.\n\nAs of December/uni00A0 31, 2021, the notional amount of credit derivatives held by the Group was \u20ac12.4/uni00A0billion compared to \u20ac15.8/uni00A0billion at the end of 2020 (including the instruments held within investment funds of the 'Satellite Investment Portfolio' for \u20ac2.0/uni00A0billion; see Note/uni00A01.8.2).\n\nCredit derivative instruments are mainly used to:\n\n- /uni25A0 hedge credit risk involving the purchase of CDS as a protection mainly on single corporate names or specific portfolios starting from a certain level of losses through tranches instruments (notional amount of \u20ac1.5/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021 versus \u20ac2.7/uni00A0billion at the end of 2020);\n- /uni25A0 enhance the return mainly on government bonds portfolios by holding government bonds and at same time selling protection on very good quality names as an alternative to the direct purchase of a corporate bond. This type of ALM strategy is implemented to compensate for the lack of depth or liquidity in some markets by taking a synthetic credit risk (notional amount of \u20ac10.9/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021 versus \u20ac12.9/uni00A0billion at the end of 2020).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The level of benefits is generally based on members' length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement.\n\nIn Switzerland, the benefit plan is a Swiss contribution-based plan classified as a defined benefit plan under IAS/uni00A019 because of guarantees, risks related to the mortality and disability coverage.\n\nI\n\nIn the United Kingdom and Germany, pensions in payment are generally updated in line with the retail price index or inflation, as opposed to other countries where pensions do not necessarily receive inflationary increases once in payment.\n\nMost of the defined benefit pension plans are funded through long-term employee benefit funds or covered by insurance policies or Mutual funds.\n\nBenefit payments in the United Kingdom and Switzerland are from trustee-administered funds and plan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practices. The Board of trustees, generally composed of representatives of the Company and plan participants in accordance with the respective plan's regulations is responsible for the governance of the plans including investment decisions and contribution schedules in order to meet the existing minimum funding requirement or funding regime objective.\n\nexpected disposal of a General Account Savings portfolio in Belgium, partly offset by lower restructuring costs and e/ff  iciency measures, mainly in Germany; and\n\n- /uni25A0 France (\u20ac+232/uni00A0million) mainly due to higher commissions and sta/ff  costs in line with business growth on all segments.\n\nThis was partly o/ff set by:\n\n- /uni25A0 international (\u20ac-168/uni00A0million) mainly driven by the partial contribution in expenses of Central & Eastern Europe (\u20ac222/uni00A0 million), the Gulf Region (\u20ac-96/uni00A0million), and Greece operations (\u20ac-89/uni00A0million) following their disposals, partly o/ff  set by the loss related to the disposal process of Singapore (\u20ac+230/uni00A0million).",

Central to the scheme funding regime are: the Statutory Funding Objective (SFO), which is a requirement that the Scheme has su/ff icient and appropriate assets to meet its technical provisions ( i.e. the amount required, on an actuarial calculation, to make provision for the scheme's liabilities); and the Statement of Funding Principles (SFP), which is a document prepared by the trustees which sets out its policy for ensuring that the SFO is met.\n\nAs part of the triennial actuarial valuation process, acting in accordance with the scheme funding legislation and the trust deed and rules of the AXA UK Group Pension Scheme, the Trustee determines an appropriate level of employer contributions to be paid to the AXA UK Group Pension Scheme, having consulted with the Scheme Actuary and discussed this with AXA UK plc. The resulting schedule of contributions is prepared by the Trustee and the Scheme Actuary sets out what contributions are payable and by when. This is then agreed by AXA UK plc. Where there is a deficit on a technical provision funding basis, the Trustee will also need to agree and put in place a Recovery Plan, which sets out the period over which the SFO will be met. There is no prescribed period for a recovery plan, but the Pension Regulator will generally be concerned about long recovery plans. The Trustee is required to prepare the schedule of contributions following valuations but may revisit (and potentially amend) the\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nschedule of contributions in between actuarial valuations, for example if significant events occur during the period.\n\nIn Switzerland and Belgium, entities should fund the cost of the entitlements expected to be earned on at least a yearly basis where contributions are determined as a percentage of pensionable salaries depending on the age-class of the beneficiaries.\n\nThe assets covering a large part of the retirees' obligation in Switzerland have been managed internally as a non-transferable collective insurance contract between AXA Life Switzerland and AXA pension fund. These assets have been disclosed as 'Other Assets' in Note/uni00A026.2.6 and the retirees' obligation remained on the AXA balance sheet. Nevertheless, under statutory and legal regulations  applicable in Switzerland   , the pension fund  was considered as fully funded, as the sole purpose of these assets is the coverage of the AXA pension fund liabilities. There is no requirement of additional contributions to the pension fund from AXA. However, in 2021, AXA Life Switzerland and the pension fund have commonly decided to terminate the collective insurance contract mentioned above for the retirees and to transfer the allocated assets to the pension fund. Once the assets transferred, they will be aggregated in the Plan Assets backing the global pensions' DBO in Switzerland. Indeed, the allocated assets cannot/uni00A0 be returned to AXA and will be available only to pay or fund employee benefits but not to AXA's own creditors (even in bankruptcy). As a result, the pension fund in Switzerland will be fully funded under IAS/uni00A019. As the transfer decision became irrevocable on December/uni00A028, 2021 with an e/ff ective transfer date as of January/uni00A01, 2022, the transaction will be accounted for in the Group's 2022 financial statements.\n\nIn France, voluntary regular employer annual contributions are made to Separate Assets, with an objective of the coverage ratio remaining within a targeted range of the total defined benefit obligation after consideration of the yearly predetermined service cost.\n\nIn Germany, there is no requirement to fund employee defined benefit obligation.\n\nIn summary, considering Other Assets in Switzerland, some small Other Assets in Spain and Separate Assets i.e. all Assets other than Plan Assets backing the current liabilities, the net economic situation of the funding for defined benefit plans is the following:\n\n|                                                        | Pension benefits          | Pension benefits          | Other benefits            | Other benefits            | Total                     | Total                     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (in Euro million)                                      | December/uni00A031,  2021 | December/uni00A031,  2020 | December/uni00A031,  2021 | December/uni00A031,  2020 | December/uni00A031,  2021 | December/uni00A031,  2020 |\n| Statement of financial position  liability/uni00A0 (a) | (6,707)                   | (8,076)                   | (180)                     | (217)                     | (6,887)                   | (8,293)                   |\n| Assets other than plan assets/uni00A0 (b)              | 2,565                     | 2,685                     | -                         | -                         | 2,565                     | 2,685                     |\n| Net economic position                                  | (4,142)                   | (5,391)                   | (180)                     | (217)                     | (4,322)                   | (5,608)                   |\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The investment strategy is reviewed regularly, following actuarial valuations of the funded benefit plans.\n\nThe investment positions are managed within an Asset Liability Management (ALM) framework defining an optimal strategic allocation with respect to the liabilities structure. The management of the assets notably includes liquidity management, diversification of each asset type so that the failure of any specific investment does not present a material risk to the plans, and implementation of hedging programs.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the pension scheme entered into several longevity swap transactions:\n\n- /uni25A0 in 2015, for economically hedging longevity risk inherent within the pensioner population;\n- /uni25A0 in 2019, for covering pensioner members that retired prior to April/uni00A01, 2019;\n- /uni25A0 in 2020, for covering longevity risk (subject to a level of retention) of the remaining unhedged members.\n\nFurthermore, a hedging strategy has been in place to protect the scheme funding level from movements in inflation and interest rate. The strategy is reviewed on a regular basis by AXA UK, Trustees and investment advisors.\n\nAdditionally, caps on inflationary increases were in place in the United Kingdom and Ireland to protect the scheme against extreme inflation.\n\n## 26.2.11  Statement of financial position/balance sheet reconciliation\n\n| (in Euro million)                                    | December/uni00A031, 2021   | December/uni00A031, 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Net position (excluding separate assets)/uni00A0 (a) | (6,887)                    | (8,293)                    |\n| - (assets)/liabilities held for sale/uni00A0 (b)     | -                          | 185                        |\n| Other liabilities                                    | (363)                      | (229)                      |\n| TOTAL/uni00A0 (c)                                    | (7,250)                    | (8,337)                    |\n\n- (a)  Net position (excluding separate assets) for pension benefits and other benefits as reported in Note/uni00A026.2.6.\n- (b)  As of December/uni00A031, 2020, the amounts comprise liabilities and assets of AXA Bank Belgium and the operations in Greece   for  which the sale process was not finalized.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The risk-free interest rate was based on the Euro Swap Rate curve for the appropriate term.\n\nThe option pricing assumptions and fair value at grant date for plans issued for the last time in 2018 are shown below:\n\n|                                                              | 2018   | 2017   | 2016   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Assumptions                                                  |        |        |        |\n| Dividend yield                                               | 5.79%  | 6.50%  | 6.60%  |\n| Volatility                                                   | 20.72% | 25.05% | 26.60% |\n| Risk-free interest rate                                      | 0.72%  | 0.55%  | 0.36%  |\n| Expected life (in years)                                     | 8.6    | 8.5    | 8.5    |\n| Weighted average fair value per option at grant date in Euro | 1.21   | 1.81   | 1.80   |\n\nThe total cost has been amortized over the vesting period and a nil estimated pre-vesting lapse rate was applied over the remaining vesting period. On that basis, the expense recognized in profit or loss for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021 was \u20ac1.2/uni00A0million (\u20ac2.1/uni00A0million for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2020).\n\n## AXA GROUP SHAREPLAN\n\nAXA o/ff  ers its employees the opportunity to become shareholders through a special employee share o/ff ering. In countries that meet the legal and fiscal requirements, two investment options are available: the traditional plan and the leveraged plan.\n\nThe traditional plan allows employees to purchase, through a personal investment, AXA shares (either through Mutual funds (FCPE) or through direct share ownership, depending on the country) with a discount of 20%. The shares are held within the Group Company Savings Plans and are restricted from sale during a period of approximately 5/uni00A0years (except specific early exit cases allowed by applicable laws). Employees are subject to the share price evolution, up or down, as compared to the subscription price.\n\nThe leveraged plan allows employees to purchase, on the basis of 10/uni00A0times their personal investment, AXA shares (either through Mutual funds (FCPE) or through direct share ownership, depending on the country) with a discount. The shares are held within the Group Company Savings Plans and are restricted from sale during a period of approximately 5/uni00A0years (except specific early exit cases allowed by applicable laws). Employees' personal investment is guaranteed by a bank, and employees also benefit from a portion of the share appreciation, calculated on the basis of the non-discounted reference price. At the end of the 5/uni00A0years holding period, the employees can, depending on their residence country, do any one of the following: (i)/uni00A0receive the cash value of their investment, (ii)/uni00A0receive the value of their investment in\n\nI\n\nI\n\nthe form of AXA shares, or (iii)/uni00A0transfer their assets invested in the leveraged plan into the traditional plan.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 crisis, only the traditional investment option was o/ff  ered in 2020. In 2021, both traditional and leveraged plans were o/ff ered to AXA employees.\n\nThe cost of the shareplan plan is valued taking into account the five-year lock-up period, as recommended by the ANC ( Autorit\u00e9 des normes comptables ). The ANC approach values the restricted shares through a replication strategy whereby the employee would sell the restricted shares forward at the end of the lockup period, borrow enough money to buy unrestricted shares immediately, and uses the proceeds of the forward sale together with dividends paid during the lock-up period to finance the loan. For the leveraged plan, the cost also includes the opportunity gain implicitly provided by AXA by enabling its employees to benefit from an institutional price for derivatives as opposed to a retail price.\n\nIn 2021, AXA o/ff ered its employees to subscribe to a traditional share o/ff ering, at a price of \u20ac18.86 per share (discount of 20% to the reference price of \u20ac23.57 representing the average over the twenty trading days ending on the date preceding the Chief Executive O/ff icer's decision setting the definitive terms of the operation) and at a price of \u20ac21.98 per share for the leveraged plan (discount of 6.75% to the reference price of \u20ac23.57). A total of 13.8/uni00A0million new shares were issued, increasing the share capital by \u20ac292.8/uni00A0million. This o/ff ering represented a total cost of \u20ac6.89/uni00A0million taking into account the five-year lock-up period. In 2021, the cost of the lock-up period was measured at 18.35% for the traditional plan and 6.74% for the leveraged plan (due to different discounts). In addition to the lock-up cost, the opportunity gain o/ff ered to the employees under the leveraged plan was measured at 2.27%.",

These Performance Share plans are equity-settled award plans subjected to performance conditions and a three-year vesting period. In addition, for some identified beneficiaries, a compulsory two-year holding period can be applicable a/f\\_t er the vesting period.\n\nIn 2021, the valuation was based on a market price of \u20ac22.64 per share at grant date and an estimate 5% pre-vesting lapse rate per year. The grant date fair value of Performance Shares granted in 2021 was \u20ac15.57 (\u20ac9.75 for 2020 grants).\n\nThe total cost of Performance Shares recognized was \u20ac67.8/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021 (\u20ac59.0/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020).\n\n## AXA International Performance Shares\n\nSince 2013, AXA has issued International Performance Shares to executive o/ff icers and other key employees mainly outside France.\n\nUnder the International Performance Shares (PSi) plan, beneficiaries have the right to receive at the settlement date, a certain number of AXA shares based on the achievement of performance criteria defined by AXA. The performance period is currently three years. The vesting period (service condition) is between three and five years. The settlement is made in shares rather than in cash (except where the settlement in shares is impossible for legal or other reasons).\n\nThe total cost of the International Performance Shares recorded as of December/uni00A0 31, 2021, was \u20ac84.3/uni00A0 million in earnings (\u20ac76.9/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020).\n\n## AXA Retirement Performance Shares\n\nAs voted by the Shareholders' Meeting of April/uni00A024, 2019, AXA's Board of Directors is authorized to grant retirement performance shares to designated senior executives in France. Under this plan, beneficiaries of Performance Shares have the right to receive at the settlement date, a certain number of AXA shares based on the achievement of a performance condition related to the average AXA Group Solvency/uni00A0II ratio calculated during the performance period of three years.\n\nFor the grants from 2016 to 2018, a/f\\_t  er the three-year performance period, the performance shares definitively acquired are subject to (i)/uni00A0an additional restriction on transfer period of two years following the performance period, and (ii)/uni00A0an obligation to hold the shares until retirement, provided that the beneficiaries may sell their shares for diversification purposes (following the threeyear performance period and two-year restriction on transfer period), as long as the sale proceeds are invested in a long-term savings plan until the beneficiary's retirement.\n\nFrom 2019 grants, the restriction on the two years transfer period is no longer applicable.\n\nThe total cost of the Performance Shares Retirement recorded as of December/uni00A031, 2021, was \u20ac18.9/uni00A0million in earnings, gross of tax (\u20ac11.1/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The Investment Managers Performance Shares incentive plan is a long term award plan in which participants are allocated rights to acquire AXA Investment Managers shares upon completion of a specified vesting period depending on applicable local regulations, and subject to fulfilment of certain performance conditions. The performance condition is based on the achievement of Actual AXA Investment Managers Underlying Earnings Group share versus budgeted and/or investment performance conditions.\n\nIn 2021, following the change in the deferred remuneration fully in DIP, AXA Investment Managers decided to cease issuing the Investment Managers Performance Shares incentive plan. As a result, the last plan was the one granted in March/uni00A02020.\n\nThe total cost of AXA Investment Managers Performance Shares recorded as of December/uni00A031, 2021, amounted to \u20ac10.9/uni00A0million in earnings (\u20ac12.7/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020), gross of tax.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## 26.4 COMPENSATION OF MANAGEMENT AND OFFICERS\n\nCompensation costs/expenses:\n\n- /uni25A0 short-term benefits: compensation paid to members of the Management Committee in 2021 totaled \u20ac19.2/uni00A0million (\u20ac20.4/uni00A0 million in 2020), including fixed salary, bonuses, directors' fees, benefits in kind and other short-term benefits;\n- /uni25A0 share-based compensations: the expense recognized in 2021 in respect of share-based compensations granted by AXA/uni00A0SA to Management Committee members was \u20ac11.7/uni00A0million (\u20ac10.5/uni00A0million in 2020);\n- /uni25A0 post-retirement benefits: the estimated cost to the Group of providing defined benefit pensions and other post-retirement benefits to members of the Management Committee for the current year of service measured in accordance with IAS/uni00A019 amounted to \u20ac3.9/uni00A0million in 2021 (\u20ac4.1/uni00A0million in 2020).\n\n## 26.5 SALARIED WORKFORCE\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2021, the Group employed 92,398 salaried people on a full-time equivalent basis (compared to 96,595 at December/uni00A031, 2020).\n\nThe decrease in salaried employees by 4,196 in 2021 was mainly driven by (i)/uni00A0the sale of AXA Bank Belgium and of our operations in the Gulf Region and in Greece (2,143), (ii)/uni00A0e/ff iciency programs notably in the United Kingdom & Ireland, Colombia, Spain and Germany (-656 ), (iii)/uni00A0a change in scope of consolidation at AXA Assistance (-627 ), and (iv)/uni00A0at AXA Business Services (-509) mainly following the disposal of Equitable Holdings,/uni00A0Inc.",

On December/uni00A031, 2021, the Mutuelles AXA collectively owned 14.93% of the Company's outstanding ordinary shares representing 24.73% of the voting rights.\n\nEach Mutuelle AXA is supervised by a Board of Directors elected by delegates representing policyholders. One member of the Company's Management Committee serves as director of the Mutuelles AXA.\n\nThe Mutuelles AXA and two of the Company's French insurance subsidiaries engaged in the Property/uni00A0& Casualty insurance business and Life/uni00A0& Savings insurance business, AXA France IARD and AXA France Vie respectively (the 'Subsidiaries'), are parties to an agreement pursuant to which they provide a full range of management services to manage the insurance operations and portfolios of the Mutuelles AXA. The agreement includes provisions designed to ensure the legal independence and protection of the respective client portfolios of the Mutuelles AXA and these Subsidiaries. Certain costs and charges (excluding commissions) are allocated between the Subsidiaries and the Mutuelles AXA through an economic interest grouping ( groupement d'int\u00e9r\u00eat  \u00e9conomique ) or 'GIE'.\n\nThe Property/uni00A0& Casualty insurance business generated in France by insurance brokers was mainly underwritten through co-insurance and reinsurance arrangements between AXA Assurances IARD Mutuelle and AXA France IARD. Aggregate written premiums under these agreements amounted to \u20ac2,143/uni00A0million in 2021 (of which \u20ac2,023/uni00A0million was attributed to AXA France IARD).\n\n## 28.2 GROUPEMENT D'INT\u00c9R\u00caT \u00c9CONOMIQUE (GIE)\n\nFrom time to time the Company enters into GIEs with certain of its subsidiaries. GIEs are intercompany partnerships, governed by French law, created to perform various common services for their members and to allocate associated costs and expenses among their members. The allocation of costs and expenses invoiced to GIE members is based on various agreed criteria including particular activity drivers. The GIEs of which the Company was a member during 2021 covered a\n\nI\n\nvariety of common services including services performed by the Group's central functions (GIE AXA) for the benefit of AXA Group companies ( e.g. finance, accounting and reporting, tax, legal, internal audit, human resources, information systems, r isk m anagement, cash management). Expenses invoiced by these GIEs to the Company and its subsidiaries are generally invoiced at cost and are included in the consolidated expenses reflected in Note/uni00A025 'Expenses by type' to the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements. Expenses invoiced by the GIE AXA to its members in 2021 and 2020 amounted to respectively \u20ac251/uni00A0million and \u20ac259/uni00A0million.\n\n## 28.3 LOANS/GUARANTEES/CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS, ETC.\n\nThe Company has given numerous commitments, including financing  commitments,  guarantees  given  to  financial institutions and customers, pledged assets, collateralized commitments and letters of credit. For a description of these commitments and guarantees, see Note/uni00A029 'Contingent assets and liabilities and unrecognized contractual commitments' to the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nCertain of these guarantees are given by the Company for the benefit of its subsidiaries and affiliates for various business purposes including to promote development of their business ( e.g. to facilitate acquisitions, integration of acquired businesses, distribution arrangements, o/ff -shoring arrangements, internal restructurings, sales or other disposals of assets or businesses, sales or renewals of products or services or similar transactions), to support their credit ratings, and/or to promote e/ff icient use of the Group's capital resources. In this context, the Company may guarantee repayment of loans or other obligations of its subsidiaries to third parties, or provide other types of guarantees to support its subsidiaries' obligations. The beneficiaries of these guarantees are generally required to compensate the Company at a negotiated rate based on prevailing market rates for guarantees with similar conditions. In addition, from time to time, the Company may provide comfort letters or similar letters to rating agencies and/or regulators in support of its subsidiaries and a/ff  iliates for various business purposes, including facilitating specific transactions, achieving target rating levels and, more generally, helping to develop the business of these subsidiaries.\n\nCommitments granted by the Company to its subsidiaries are disclosed in Appendix/uni00A0III of this Annual Report 'AXA parent C ompany financial statements: Subsidiaries and participating interests'.\n\nThe Company may enter into various types of transactions with its subsidiaries and a/ff iliates from time to time for various business purposes including (i)/uni00A0in connection with liquidity, solvency and capital management initiatives designed to promote e/ff icient use and fungibility of the Group's capital resources or (ii)/uni00A0to finance their business operations and/or to promote the development of their business ( e.g. to facilitate acquisitions, integration of acquired businesses, distribution arrangements, internal",

These transactions may involve loans or other types of credit arrangements, capital contributions, acquisitions or sales of assets, securities or other financial instruments (including swaps or other types of derivatives), securitization transactions, and/or other types of arrangements or transactions to which the Company may be a direct party and/or guarantor. The Company may also from time to time borrow from its subsidiaries for various business purposes. These transactions are generally carried out on arms-length terms and conditions with loans bearing interest at floating rates that generally reflect prevailing market rates at the respective dates such loans were originated.\n\n## 28.4 KEY MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, based on information reported to it:\n\n- /uni25A0 on December/uni00A031, 2021, there were no loans outstanding from the Group to the Company's two corporate o/ff icers or to any member of the Company's Board of Directors;\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n- /uni25A0 various members of the Company's Board of Directors as well as various other executive o/ff icers and directors of other AXA Group companies may, from time to time, purchase insurance, wealth management or other products or services o/ff ered by AXA in the ordinary course of its business. The terms and conditions of these transactions are substantially similar to the terms and conditions generally available to the public or to AXA employees in general. In addition, certain members of the Board of Directors are corporate o/ff icers, directors or have interests, directly or indirectly, in companies that may have agreements or enter into transactions from time to time with AXA Group entities including extensions of credit, loans, purchases of securities (for their own account or for third parties), underwriting of securities and/or furnishing of other types of services or goods. These agreements or deals are generally fully negotiated and performed on arm's length terms and conditions.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

This includes the potential liability of AXA UK under customary warranties and indemnities given by AXA UK to Resolution/uni00A0Ltd. in connection with this transaction.\n\n## 29.4.2 Employee and director Indemnification Obligations\n\nIn addition to other employment-related obligations, various AXA subsidiaries are required to indemnify their employees and directors against certain liabilities and costs that they may incur from time to time in performing activities within the scope of their duties. These activities may include, for example, service as a director, o/ff icer, agent, general partner, or in a similar capacity for/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0an AXA Group company other than the employee's principal employer or (ii)/uni00A0a company outside the AXA Group where service is at the request of (or for the benefit of) the Group ( e.g. joint ventures, partnerships, or special-purpose investment Companies or funds). The potential amount of compensation relating to commitments covered by these obligations cannot be evaluated with any certainty.\n\n## 29.4.3 Supports provided without having a contractual or constructive obligation to do so\n\nThe Group did not provide any material support without having a contractual or constructive obligation to do so to structured entities during the period.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## 29.5 OTHER ITEMS: RESTRICTION ON DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO/uni00A0SHAREHOLDERS\n\nCertain AXA subsidiaries and joint ventures, principally insurance companies, are subject to restrictions on the amount of funds they may transfer in the form of cash dividends or otherwise.\n\nIn most cases, the amounts available for distribution from AXA's insurance subsidiaries and joint ventures are limited to net income for the year and retained earnings calculated in accordance with the statutory accounting policies used by the subsidiaries to prepare their local financial statements. Further restrictions may be imposed by the local insurance regulators in countries where AXA operates. In some cases, amounts available for distribution are also subject to regulatory capital adequacy tests or the approval of an independent actuary or subject to individual provisions contained in a company's by laws.\n\nIn accordance with European Union directives, insurance companies with their registered office in a European Union member country are required to maintain minimum solvency ratios which must be supported by eligible elements. AXA's insurance operations in countries outside the European Union are also subject to local capital adequacy and solvency margin regulations.\n\nAXA/uni00A0 SA is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations notably stemming from its Non-Euro participations. The aim of the hedging programs of the Company is to protect the shareholder value while managing the associated costs.",

If we determine the likelihood of a negative outcome is probable, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we establish a reserve and record an estimated loss for the expected outcome of the litigation. However, it is o/f\\_t en di/ff icult to predict the outcome or estimate a possible loss or range of loss because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, particularly when plaintiffs allege substantial or indeterminate damages, the litigation is in its early stages, or when the litigation is highly complex or broad in scope.\n\n## 31.1 MATTERS DIRECTLY CONCERNING AXA/uni00A0SA\n\nAXA/uni00A0SA is involved in lawsuits, investigations and other actions arising in the various jurisdictions where it does business, including the following:\n\nIn 2007, AXA/uni00A0SA completed the squeeze out of the minority shareholders at two German subsidiaries, AXA Konzern/uni00A0AG ('AKAG') and K\u00f6lnische Verwaltungs-AG f\u00fcr Versicherungswerte ('KVAG'). Following the effective date of these squeeze out transactions in July/uni00A02007, certain former AKAG and KVAG shareholders brought proceedings in Germany alleging that the cash compensation o/ff ered by AXA/uni00A0SA was not adequate. In the first half of 2016, an initial expert valuation report was delivered to the court based on recent precedents in other\n\nI\n\nI\n\nGerman minority buy-out transactions and recommending a significant increase in the cash compensation to be paid to minority shareholders. In addition, interest will be payable on any additional amount finally decided. AXA/uni00A0SA appointed an independent expert to challenge this report and submitted its statement in February/uni00A02017. A court-appointed expert provided a revised report in response to AXA's expert in November/uni00A02018.\n\nA first instance decision was issued in December/uni00A02019. The court decided that the AKAG and KVAG valuation compensation should be increased by approximately 22% of the amount paid by AXA in 2007. The minority shareholders have appealed the decision and AXA counter appealed.\n\n## 31.2 MATTERS CONCERNING AXA SUBSIDIARIES\n\nAXA and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal actions and proceedings of a character normally incidental to their business including claims litigation arising in connection with the Group's insurance business and litigation arising from the Group's Asset Management business.\n\nIn addition, several AXA subsidiaries are involved in lawsuits (both class action and individual), investigations, and other actions arising in the various jurisdictions where they do business, including the United States.",

        "page_content": "A number of lawsuits have been filed against insurers in the United States and elsewhere involving the scope and interpretation of policies, insurers' sales practices, alleged misconduct or misrepresentation, alleged failure to properly supervise agents, compensation of intermediaries, product features, fees or performance as well as numerous other matters. Some of these actions have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers (including material amounts of punitive damages) or in substantial settlements. In certain jurisdictions, juries have broad discretion in awarding punitive damages. AXA's subsidiaries are involved in these types of litigations as well as regulatory inquiries, investigations or actions with respect to these and a wide variety of other matters related to the ownership or management of real estate, asset or investment activities, corporate transactions, employee benefit disputes, alleged discrimination in employment practices, as well as other matters.\n\nFurthermore, a number of AXA subsidiaries are involved in a significant number of litigations relating to COVID-19 exposure under business interruption policies and non-damage business interruption extensions to business interruption policies. In certain of the countries in which those AXA subsidiaries operate (notably in France) the courts have delivered inconsistent judgments, which we expect will continue to be the case as appeals are pursued.\n\nSome of the litigations described above have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of claimants, and certain of the claimants in these actions seek significant or unspecified amounts of damages, including punitive damages.\n\n## 31.2.1 AXA XL Division\n\nEnedis (formerly ERDF, a subsidiary of \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France, the primary electric utility in France) has notified claims for coverage under a professional liability policy underwritten by AXA Corporate Solutions Assurance, which was merged into XL Insurance Company/uni00A0SE on December/uni00A031, 2019 ('AXA XL Division'). The underlying liabilities in question arise out of a series of lawsuits (more than 500/uni00A0individual suits) brought against Enedis by local electricity producers in France engaged in production of solar/green energy and AXA XL Division was joined to proceedings, as insurer, in over 200 cases. These local producers allege financial losses due to Enedis' delay in processing their applications to be connected to the public grid within the statutory period. AXA XL Division pleaded the illegality of the Decrees as its defense and in March/uni00A02019, the French Supreme Court upheld the decision of the ECJ. Lower courts continue to dismiss cases based on the above rulings.\n\nRoyal Bank of Scotland/uni00A0Plc ('RBS') has notified claims for coverage to AXA XL Division under general liability policies covering the years 2001-2004. AXA XL Division insured the primary layer (up to \u00a35/uni00A0million per claim or series of related claims) under these policies. RBS seeks coverage for potential liabilities arising out of three class actions brought against NatWest (an RBS subsidiary) between 2005-2007 in the New York Federal Court under the US Anti-Terrorism Act for aiding and abetting terrorism due to certain accounts it maintained. AXA XL Division is not a party to this litigation. NatWest succeeded in having this\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\ncase dismissed in 2019 on a summary judgment motion, which plainti/ff s appealed. In April/uni00A02021, the New York Second Circuit Court of Appeals a/ff irmed the lower court decision dismissing the lawsuit. In September/uni00A02021, the plainti/ff s filed for leave to appeal the dismissal to the United States Supreme Court\n\n## 31.3 OTHER LITIGATION\n\nIn addition to the various matters noted above, AXA and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous legal actions and proceedings arising out of transactions involving the acquisition or sale of businesses or assets, mergers or other business combination transactions, the establishment or dissolution of joint ventures or other partnerships, public exchange or tender offers, buy-outs of minority interests or similar types of transactions ('M&A Transactions'). In connection with M&A Transactions, AXA and its subsidiaries from time to time:\n\n- /uni25A0 are involved in legal actions or other claims brought by purchasers, joint venture partners, shareholders or other transaction parties asserting claims for damages on various theories (including misrepresentation, failure to disclose material  information,  failure  to  perform  contractual duties, breach of fiduciary duties), seeking contractual indemnification, or otherwise seeking to impose liability on AXA and/or its subsidiaries; and/or\n- /uni25A0 benefit from contractual rights to indemnification from third party sellers or other transaction counterparties that are designed to protect the Group against existing or potential future litigation exposures or other types of contingent liabilities of the acquired businesses or assets. These indemnities generally constitute unsecured obligations of the indemnifying party and, consequently, their value may be substantially impaired or rendered worthless in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the indemnifying party.\n\nAXA and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in tax assessment negotiations and/or active litigation with tax authorities over contested assessments or other matters in a number of jurisdictions including in France. These actions or assessments arise in a variety of circumstances including matters in connection with M&A, restructuring or financing transactions as well as in the ordinary course of business.\n\nOver the past several years a number of jurisdictions, including France and Belgium, have enacted legislation that permits corporate entities to be charged with criminal offences. The standard for attributing criminal conduct by corporate o/ff icers and employees to corporate entities is not clearly defined in many of these jurisdictions and government prosecutors and judges have broad discretion in this area. In recent years, complaints against or indictments of corporate entities for alleged criminal o/ff ences have become increasingly common and certain AXA Group companies have been the subject of penal complaints and/or indictments from time to time including in Belgium and France. While a criminal complaint against or indictment of a corporate entity may not pose material financial risk, it has broad potential implications for a regulated financial institution like\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

In this context, AXA and its subsidiaries are subject, from time to time, to examinations, investigations, enforcement proceedings and other actions by regulatory and law enforcement authorities (involving civil and/or penal matters) as well as to proposed changes in law and/or regulation that may significantly impact their business and results of operations. For additional information on these matters as well as other risks and contingent liabilities affecting the Group and its business, please see Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' and Section/uni00A07.3 'General Information' and Note  29 'Contingent assets and liabilities and unrecognized contractual commitments'  in Part 6 ' Consolidated Financial Statements'   of this Annual Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## I Note/uni00A032 Subsequent events\n\n## AXA announced the successful placement of \u20ac1.25/uni00A0billion dated subordinated notes due 2042\n\nOn January/uni00A06, 2022, AXA announced the successful placement of \u20ac1.25/uni00A0billion of Reg S subordinated notes due 2042 to institutional investors, to be used for general corporate purposes including the refinancing of part of its outstanding debt/uni00A0 (1) .\n\nThe initial fixed coupon has been set at 1.875% per annum until the end of the 6-month call window period (July/uni00A02032), when it will become a floating coupon based on 3-month EURIBOR plus a margin including a 100/uni00A0basis points step up. Investor demand was strong with a book subscribed more than 2/uni00A0times.\n\nThe notes will be treated as capital from a regulatory and rating agencies' perspective within applicable limits. The transaction has been structured for the notes to be eligible as Tier/uni00A02 capital under Solvency/uni00A0II.\n\nThe notes are rated BBB+/Stable by Standard & Poor's, A3(hyb)/ Stable by Moody's and BBB/Positive by Fitch. Settlement of the notes took place on January/uni00A010, 2022.\n\nAlthough the outcome of any lawsuit cannot be predicted with certainty, particularly in the early stages of an action, Management believes that the ultimate resolutions of the matters described above are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Group, taken as a whole. In addition, as of December/uni00A031, 2021, to the Company's knowledge, there were no other governmental, judicial or arbitration proceedings, either pending or threatened, that may have, or have had a significant impact on the financial situation or profitability of the Company or the Group over the past 12/uni00A0months. However, due to the nature of such lawsuits and investigations and the frequency of large damage awards and regulatory sanctions in certain jurisdictions (particularly the United States) that bear little or no relation to actual economic damages incurred by plaintiffs or the underlying regulatory violations, Management cannot make an estimate of loss, if any, or predict whether these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse e/ff ect on the Group's consolidated results of operations in any particular period.\n\n## AXA completed the sale of its insurance operations/uni00A0 (2) in Singapore\n\nOn February/uni00A011, 2022, AXA announced that it completed the sale of AXA Insurance Pte Limited ('AXA Singapore') to HSBC Insurance (Asia-Pacific) Holdings Limited, for a total cash consideration of US$ 529/uni00A0million (or \u20ac463/uni00A0million/uni00A0 (3) ).\n\n## War in Ukraine\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, triggering a war and worldwide geopolitical tensions, leading the United States, Europe and some other countries to impose unprecedented financial and trade sanctions on the Russian economy, including asset freezes and restrictions on individuals and institutions, notably the Russian Central Bank. As a consequence, the Ruble has significantly weakened and the Russian economy is facing a major crisis with repercussions on the global economy.\n\nAXA insures risks of various types in Russia, Ukraine and neighboring countries that may or may not give rise to claims depending on a number of factors including the evolution of the conflict and its geographic scope, as well as the nature and scope of international sanctions imposed and the consequent damages.\n\nAXA also holds a minority stake of 38.6% in 'Reso Garantia', a Russian insurance company mainly selling motor insurance to local retail customers, for which financial information is disclosed in Section 6.6 - Note 10.3 'Main associates' of this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI",

Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organisation and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles/uni00A0L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Measurement of Life/uni00A0& Savings future policy benefit reserves including deferred acquisition costs\n\n(See Notes/uni00A01.7.3, 1.14.2, 4.4 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements)\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the matter\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2021, the Group has recorded material Life/uni00A0& Savings liabilities arising from insurance contracts (\u20ac271,492/uni00A0million) and liabilities arising from investment contracts with discretionary participation features (\u20ac35,297/uni00A0million), where risks are born by the Group, as described in Notes/uni00A014.2 and 14.3 to the financial statements.\n\nThe primary assumptions that must be made as part of the valuation include assumptions about mortality, longevity, lapses, morbidity, disability and costs as well as economic assumptions such as interest rates and equity market performance.\n\nAs described in Notes/uni00A01.14.2 and 4.4 to the consolidated financial statements, measurements of Life/uni00A0& Savings technical reserves are as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 for life and protection insurance contracts, the future policy benefit reserves relating to these contracts are generally measured based on a prospective basis using assumptions on investment yield, mortality, longevity, lapses, morbidity and expenses;\n- /uni25A0 some of these reserves, in particular Protection/uni00A0& Health products, include contracts with surrender guarantees and, in some cases a guaranteed long-term rate or long-term guarantees;\n- /uni25A0 for investment contracts with discretionary participation features, future policy benefits reserves are generally calculated using a prospective approach based on discount rates usually set at inception.\n\nAssumptions used are generally locked-in at inception, and for some Life/uni00A0& Savings reserves are based on unlocked discount rates as stated in Note/uni00A014.9.2 of financial statements.\n\nAt each closing, the Company uses a Liability Adequacy Test to determine that technical reserves are su/ff icient, and that deferred acquisition costs are recoverable. Liability Adequacy Test is based on current best estimates of all future contractual cash flows that are valued using complex actuarial models and involve a significant degree of judgment.\n\nCertain changes in these assumptions could result in material impact to the valuation of these liabilities and assets.\n\nAccordingly, we deemed the valuation of the future policy benefit reserves covering these contracts to be a key audit matter.\n\nI\n\nOur audit approach to the risk relating to the valuation of these liabilities and assets in the Life/uni00A0& Savings line of business was as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 we assessed the compliance of the methodology with current accounting standards;\n- /uni25A0 we updated our knowledge of the methodologies for measuring future policy benefit reserves covering these contracts as well as the models used to calculate the reserves and evaluated their appropriateness;\n- /uni25A0 we assessed the IT systems used to process the technical data and integrate that data into the accounting system;\n- /uni25A0 we assessed the design of the internal control system and tested the operating e/ff ectiveness of the internal controls we deemed key to our audit;\n- /uni25A0 we tested, on a sample basis and based on our risk assessment, the calculation models applied to estimate the future cash flows used to determine the future policy benefit reserves and for the liability adequacy tests;\n- /uni25A0 we applied procedures to test the reliability of the underlying data used in the models and reserve calculations;\n- /uni25A0 we evaluated the reasonability of the assumptions used by management and the sensitivity of the models to the assumptions;\n- /uni25A0 we applied analytical procedures with a view to identifying and analyzing any material unusual and/or unexpected changes.\n\nFinally, we assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the financial statements.\n\nI",

They include claims incurred and reported, claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) as well as claims handling costs.\n\nThese reserves are calculated using statistical and actuarial methods, on the basis of historical claims data and patterns, and use assumptions to estimate ultimate claims cost.\n\nFor some line of business, these estimates require a high degree of judgment, and the assumptions selected may have a significant impact on the ultimate claims cost of these reserves at the end of the reporting period as the inherent uncertainty is higher. This is especially the case for Property/uni00A0& Casualty lines of business that are considered long-tail such as general and professional liability, worker's compensation, and other specialty lines.\n\nIn addition, estimates of gross and net loss from natural catastrophe events and large man-made losses, including business written or reinsured through AXA XL, are more di/ff icult to project as they are less frequent but can be of higher severity.\n\nAccordingly, due to these inherent uncertainties to calculate the estimates, we deemed the measurement of claim reserves in the Property/uni00A0& Casualty line to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit approach to the risk relating to the valuation of claim reserves was as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 we assessed the compliance of the methodology applied by the Group with current accounting standards;\n- /uni25A0 we evaluated and tested the design and operating e/ff ectiveness of the internal controls relating to:\n- -the management of claims and, in particular, the measurement of reserves on a case-by-case basis,\n- -the calculation of the ultimate cost (assumptions, judgments, data, methodologies, compliance with the applicable accounting principles and methods), including any second opinions supplied by Risk Management with respect to technical reserves,\n- -the IT systems used to process the technical data and integrate that data into the accounting system;\n- /uni25A0 we tested the reliability and the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data;\n- /uni25A0 we applied procedures (including monitoring the change in loss ratios) to analyse the significant changes that took place over the reporting period;\n- /uni25A0 we evaluated the outcome of the accounting estimates made the previous year with a view to assessing the reliability of the process used by management to calculate these estimates;\n- /uni25A0 our work also consisted in assessing the statistical methods and actuarial inputs applied, as well as of the assumptions used, with respect to the applicable regulations, market practices, on going litigations and the economic and financial context of the AXA Group taking into account contrary and corroborating evidence;\n- /uni25A0 focusing on those classes of business where reserve estimates present a higher risk of uncertainty and judgement, we undertook an independent evaluation of the reserves for certain insurance risk categories with a view to providing a basis for our professional judgment and our assessment of the estimates used by the Group.\n\nFinally, we assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the financial statements.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Goodwill is allocated to the CGUs of the activities into which that business was incorporated.\n\nAn impairment test of goodwill, as stated in Note/uni00A01.7.1 to the consolidated financial statements, is performed at least once a year to ensure that the net carrying amount does not exceed the recoverable amount and there is no impairment.\n\nThe recoverable amount corresponds to the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.\n\nAs stated in Note/uni00A05 to the consolidated financial statements, value in use calculations are based on the following main assumptions:\n\n- /uni25A0 cash flow projections based on business plans;\n- /uni25A0 discount rates; and\n- /uni25A0 growth rates,\n\nthus, requiring significant judgment from management. This is especially the case for the AXA XL CGU.\n\nAccordingly, we deemed the measurement of the recoverable amount of goodwill to be a key audit matter.\n\n## SPECIFIC VERIFICATIONS\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations of the Group's information given in the management report of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the consolidated financial statements, reminded that it is not our responsibility to conclude on the fair presentation and consistency with the financial statements of the solvency related information required by Article/uni00A0L.356-23 of the French Insurance Code ( Code des assurances ).\n\nWe attest that the consolidated non-financial statement required by Article/uni00A0L.225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) is included in the Group's management report, it being specified that, in accordance with Article/uni00A0L.823-10 of this Code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the financial statements of the information contained therein. This information should be reported on by an independent third party.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nOur audit approach to the risk relating to recoverability of goodwill was as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 we assessed the compliance of the methodology applied by the Group with current accounting standards and its implementation;\n- /uni25A0 we evaluated and tested the design and operating e/ff ectiveness of the internal controls related to goodwill impairment test process;\n- /uni25A0 we also performed substantive procedures regarding the main assumptions to test that:\n- -the  projected  future  cash  flows  are  consistent  with management's most recent estimates, as calculated during the budget process,\n- -the assumptions made with respect to projected future cash flows are reasonable in terms of the economic and financial context of the CGU and, by assessing the reasons for di/ff  erences between projected and actual performances, that the process by which the estimates were calculated is reliable,\n- -the discount rate and long-term growth rate are in a reasonable range and consistent with the projected cash flows to which they apply;\n- /uni25A0 we also performed sensitivity analysis around the main assumptions to ascertain that selected adverse changes to main assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount;\n\nWe assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the financial statements.",

As it relates to consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging of these consolidated financial statements complies with the format defined in the above delegated regulation.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\n## Appointment of Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as Statutory Auditors of AXA/uni00A0SA by the Shareholders' Meetings held on February/uni00A028,/uni00A01989 (PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit) and on June/uni00A08,/uni00A01994 (Mazars).

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article/uni00A0L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the a/ff airs of the Company.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

These shares were acquired for an aggregate purchase price of \u20ac1,366,028,500.64 (with a par value of \u20ac2.29 per share).\n\nFurthermore, for information purposes, it should be noted that on December/uni00A031, 2021, the total number of treasury shares held by Company's  subsidiaries was 223,814 (or 0.01% of AXA's share capital at that date). The booking value of these 223,814/uni00A0treasury shares on December/uni00A031, 2021 was \u20ac6,582,000.\n\n## EMPLOYEE SHAREHOLDERS\n\n## Shareplan\n\nSince 1993, the AXA Group has promoted employee shareholding by offering each year to its employees an opportunity to become shareholders through a share capital increase reserved exclusively to them ('Shareplan').\n\nBy virtue of the authorization granted by the Shareholders' Meeting of April/uni00A029, 2021, the Board of Directors increased the Company's share capital through the issue of shares reserved to the Group employees under the Shareplan 2021 program. The shareholders waived their preferential subscription rights so that this o/ff  ering could be made exclusively to Group employees (Shareplan 2021).\n\nIn countries that met the legal, regulatory and tax requirements to participate in Shareplan, two investment options were o/ff ered to the Group employees in 2021:\n\n- /uni25A0 the traditional plan, o/ff ered in 34/uni00A0countries;\n- /uni25A0 the leverage plan, o/ff ered in 32/uni00A0countries.\n\nThe traditional plan allowed employees to subscribe through a personal investment to AXA shares (either through Mutual funds (FCPE) or through direct share ownership, depending on countries) with a 20% discount. The shares are held within the Group Company Savings Plans and are restricted from sale during a period of approximately 5/uni00A0years (except specific early exit cases allowed by applicable law). Employees are subject to the share price evolution, up or down, as compared to the subscription price.\n\nI\n\nI",

These shares are held within the Group Company Savings Plans and are restricted from sale during a period of approximately 5/uni00A0years (except specific early exit cases allowed by applicable law). Employees' personal investment is guaranteed by a bank, and employees also benefit from a portion of the share appreciation, calculated on the basis of the nondiscounted reference price.\n\nAt the end of the 5/uni00A0year holding period, the employees can, depending on their country of residence, do any one of the following: (i)/uni00A0receive the cash value of their investment; (ii)/uni00A0receive the value of their investment in the form of AXA shares; or (iii)/uni00A0transfer their assets invested in the leveraged plan into the traditional plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\nMutual funds (FCPE) with direct voting rights have been created since 2005 to allow beneficiaries, in most cases, to directly exercise their voting rights during the Company's Shareholders' Meetings.\n\nThe Shareplan 2021 program was carried out through a capital increase that took place in November/uni00A02021. Approximately 21,000/uni00A0employees took part in the Shareplan 2021 program, representing approximately 19% of eligible employees:\n\n- /uni25A0 the total amount invested was approximately \u20ac293/uni00A0million;\n- /uni25A0 a total of approximately 14/uni00A0million new shares were issued, each with a par value of \u20ac2.29. These shares began earning dividends on January/uni00A01, 2021.\n\nOn December/uni00A031, 2021, AXA employees and agents held 4.10% of the share capital and 5.98% of the voting rights. These shares are owned through Mutual funds (FCPE) or directly either in the form of ordinary shares or ADS.\n\n## Transactions involving AXA's share capital\n\nOn December/uni00A031, 2021, AXA's share capital was comprised of 2,421,568,696 ordinary shares, each with a par value of \u20ac2.29. All these shares were fully paid up and non-assessable and began earning dividends on January/uni00A01, 2021.\n\nThe following table sets forth changes in the number of shares from January/uni00A01,

The Company's registered o/ff ice is located at 25, avenue Matignon, 75008 Paris, France and its  telephone  number  is  +33 (0) 1 40 75 57 00.  AXA/uni00A0 SA  was incorporated in 1957 but the origin of its activities dates to 1852. The Company's corporate existence will continue, subject to dissolution or prolongation, until December/uni00A031, 2059. The Company is registered with the Paris Trade and Companies Register ( Registre du commerce et des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ) under number/uni00A0572 093 920. AXA's legal entity identifier (LEI) is F5WCUMTUM4RKZ1MAIE39.\n\nThe following documents may be consulted at the AXA Group Legal Department (Tour Majunga - 6, place de la Pyramide - 92908\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## I Regulation and Supervision\n\nAXA is engaged in regulated business activities on a global scale through numerous operating subsidiaries. The Group's principal business activities of insurance, reinsurance and a sset m anagement are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision in each of the various jurisdictions where the Group operates. AXA/uni00A0SA, the ultimate parent holding company of the AXA Group, is also subject to extensive regulation as a result of its listing on Euronext Paris and its direct and indirect shareholding in numerous regulated insurance and a sset m anagement subsidiaries. Given that the AXA Group is headquartered in Paris, France, this supervision is based to a significant extent on European Union directives and regulations and on the French regulatory system. AXA's principal regulators and supervisory authorities in France are the AMF, which is the financial markets regulator, and the Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (the 'ACPR'), which is the insurance, reinsurance and financial services supervisor.\n\nI\n\nParis La D\u00e9fense, France) until the filing of AXA's next Universal Registration Document with the Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers (the 'AMF'): (i)/uni00A0the b ylaws of the Company, (ii)/uni00A0the reports or other documents prepared by any expert at the Company's request which are (in whole or in part) included or referred to in this Universal Registration Document, and (iii)/uni00A0AXA SA's financial statements and Consolidated Financial Statements for each of the three financial years preceding the publication of this Universal Registration Document. These documents are also available on AXA's website and, more specifically, at the following links for the b ylaws of the Company (https://group.axa.com/en/ about-us/governance-overview) and the documents referred to in (ii)/uni00A0and (iii)/uni00A0(https://group.axa.com/en/investor/annual-andinterim-reports).\n\nAs a global company operating in numerous jurisdictions, the AXA Group is subject to various laws and regulations. This section does not purport to describe all of the regulations to which AXA Group is subject nor to provide all of the information in connection with the AXA Group's supervision in every jurisdiction in which the AXA Group is present.\n\nThis section presents what the AXA Group considers to be the most significant regulations and supervision mechanisms to which the AXA Group is subject as of the filing date of this Annual Report with the AMF.\n\nAs discussed in Section/uni00A02.1 'Operating highlights' of this Annual Report, AXA/uni00A0SA intends to transform into the Group's internal reinsurer while remaining the holding company of the Group (the 'Internal Reinsurance Transformation'). AXA/uni00A0SA has therefore applied to obtain a reinsurance license from the ACPR. The Internal Reinsurance Transformation is subject to the",

Upon receipt of the reinsurance license, AXA/uni00A0SA would become a licensed reinsurance company subject to the applicable ACPR regulations governing reinsurance entities and activities, and would enter into annually renewable 25% quota share reinsurance treaties with certain of AXA's European Property/uni00A0& Casualty carriers. As part of the Internal Reinsurance Transformation, AXA Global Re, the Group's existing internal reinsurance entity, would also be merged with and into AXA/uni00A0SA, with AXA/uni00A0SA as the surviving entity.\n\n## INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE OPERATIONS\n\nWhile the extent and nature of regulation varies from country to country, most jurisdictions in which AXA's insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries operate have laws and regulations governing distribution practices, standards of solvency, levels of capital and reserves, permitted types and concentrations of investments, and business conduct to be maintained by insurance and reinsurance companies, as well as agent licensing, approval of policy forms and, for certain lines of insurance, approval or filing of rates. In certain jurisdictions, regulations limit sales commissions, fees and certain other marketing expenses that may be incurred by the insurer and impose product suitability and disclosure requirements. In general, insurers and reinsurers are required to file detailed annual financial statements with their supervisory agencies in each of the jurisdictions in which they do business. Such agencies may conduct regular or unexpected examinations of the insurers' and reinsurers' operations and accounts and request additional information from the insurer and reinsurer. Certain jurisdictions also require registration and periodic reporting by holding companies that control a licensed insurer and reinsurer. This holding company legislation typically requires periodic disclosure, reporting concerning the corporation that controls the licensed insurer or reinsurer and other a/ff  iliated companies, including prior approval (or notice) of transactions between the insurer or reinsurer and other a/ff iliates such as intra-group transfers of assets and payment of dividends by the controlled insurer or reinsurer. In addition, such legislation generally provides that any direct or indirect acquisition of 'control' of our insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries domiciled in a given jurisdiction will be subject to the prior approval of the insurance and reinsurance regulatory authorities in such jurisdiction; the definition of 'control' for such purposes generally includes any direct or indirect acquisition of shares or other instruments representing more than a 9.9% voting interest, and would include the acquisition of shares of AXA/uni00A0SA as an insurance holding company. In general, these regulatory schemes are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than shareholders. For additional information, see the paragraph 'The Group and our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision and adverse judicial decisions in the various jurisdictions in which we operate' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n## REGULATORY CAPITAL AND SOLVENCY REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe Group and its insurance and reinsurance entities are subject to regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions where they do business, which are designed to monitor capital adequacy and to protect policyholders. While the specific regulatory capital requirements (including the definition of admitted assets and methods of calculation) vary between jurisdictions, an insurer's or reinsurer's required regulatory capital can be impacted by a wide variety of factors, including, but not limited to, business mix, product design, sales volume, invested assets, liabilities, reserves and movements in the capital markets, including interest rates and financial markets. Regulatory capital requirements may increase, possibly significantly, during periods of declining financial markets and/or lower interest rates.\n\n## Solvency/uni00A0II\n\nThe European Union has implemented a regulatory regime for European insurers which became effective on January/uni00A01, 2016, following the adoption of Directive 2009/138/EC dated November/uni00A025, 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of insurance and reinsurance, as amended (the 'Solvency/uni00A0II Directive') and the regulations promulgated thereunder (together with the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive, 'Solvency/uni00A0II'). Solvency/uni00A0II was implemented into French law beginning in 2015. In June/uni00A02019, amendments to the delegated regulations enacted under the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive were issued in connection with the 2018 interim review of Solvency/uni00A0II.\n\nSolvency/uni00A0II is designed to implement solvency requirements that reflect the risks that insurance and reinsurance companies face and build a supervisory system that is consistent across all EU Member States. Solvency/uni00A0II is based on three pillars: (1)/uni00A0Pillar/uni00A01 consists of the quantitative requirements around own funds, valuation rules for assets and liabilities and solvency capital requirements; (2)/uni00A0Pillar/uni00A02 sets out qualitative requirements for the governance and r isk m anagement of insurers, as well as for the e/ff ective supervision of insurers, including the requirement for insurers to submit an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ('ORSA'); and (3)/uni00A0Pillar/uni00A03 introduces an enhanced reporting and disclosure regime, pursuant to which subject insurance undertakings headquartered in the European Union are required to prepare a Regular Supervisory Report ('RSR'), to be submitted by the undertaking to the competent national supervisory authority on a regular basis as determined by the regulation, and a Solvency and Financial Condition Report ('SFCR'), to be made publicly available on an annual basis. Solvency/uni00A0II covers, among other matters, the valuation of assets and liabilities, the treatment of insurance and reinsurance groups, the definition of capital and the overall level of required capital. A key aspect of Solvency/uni00A0 II is that assessment of the Group's risks and capital requirements is aligned closely with economic capital methodologies and allows the use of either a standard model or an insurer's or reinsurer's own internal economic capital model (to permit a better understanding of the actual risks and Risk Management of the insurer or reinsurer) to calculate the Solvency\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

The Solvency/uni00A0II ratio of the Group as of December/uni00A031, 2021, published on February/uni00A024, 2022, was estimated at 217%/uni00A0 (1) , compared to 200% as of December/uni00A031, 2020. The Group maintained eligible own funds in excess of its SCR at all times during 2021.\n\nAXA continues to regularly review the scope, underlying methodologies and assumptions of the Internal Model, and will adjust its SCR accordingly. In addition, AXA's Internal Model has been and may be revised from time to time in accordance with applicable regulations. However, any significant change to the Internal Model would be subject to the prior approval of the ACPR, which may require adjustments to the level of SCR.\n\nFor more information on the Internal Model, please refer to Section/uni00A05.2.3 'Internal Model' of this Annual Report. For further information on AXA's SCR, Internal Model and other Solvency/uni00A0II disclosures, please refer to the AXA Group's SFCR for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2020, available on AXA's website (www.axa. com). AXA Group's SFCR for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021, is expected to be published on May/uni00A020, 2022, on the same website.\n\n## Solvency/uni00A0II review\n\nThe Solvency/uni00A0II framework is currently under review by the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. Following the opinion submitted by EIOPA to the European Commission on December/uni00A017, 2020 as part of the review of the Solvency/uni00A0II framework (the 'Solvency/uni00A0II Opinion'), the European Commission published on September/uni00A022, 2021, its proposed directive amending the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive and explained its overall intentions on the most important aspects of the forthcoming level/uni00A02 amendments (in particular with respect to risk margin). Proposed amendments to the Solvency/uni00A0II framework include, among others, (i)/uni00A0the extrapolation method and changes to the volatility adjustment, including the introduction of principles for the modelling of the\n\ndynamic volatility adjustment; (ii)/uni00A0new reporting requirements such as/uni00A0(a) the assessment of the impact of long-term climate change scenarios on our business in the ORSA,/uni00A0(b) structural changes to the Solvency and Financial Condition Report (SFCR) that would require undertakings to split their content into a part addressed to policyholders and a part addressed to other market participants, and/uni00A0(c) the requirement for internal model users to calculate and report their solvency and financial condition using the standard formula; (iii)/uni00A0the introduction of macroprudential tools, including the integration of macroeconomic considerations in the ORSA and granting supervisory authorities extended powers with respect to macro prudential concerns, allowing them to impose additional measures to reinforce insurance groups and companies' financial condition, such as restricting or suspending dividend or other payments to shareholders (including share buybacks) and other implementing measures aimed at mitigating liquidity risk-related concerns; and (iv)/uni00A0amending the g roup supervision regime (including the required amount of eligible own funds ('EOF') requirements and the MCR for groups).\n\n## Recovery and resolution regimes for insurers and reinsurers\n\nCurrently, insurance and reinsurance recovery and resolution systems are national and only in place in some but not all EU Member States. In the event of a failure by an insurance or reinsurance company or an insurance holding company to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements (including the MCR and the SCR, as applicable), insurance supervisors generally have broad authority to require or take various regulatory actions, including limiting or prohibiting the issuance of new business, prohibiting or restricting payment of dividends or other shareholder distributions, and/or putting a company into rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings. In particular, under the French recovery and resolution framework for the insurance industry, set forth in Order No./uni00A02017-1608 of November/uni00A027, 2017, and its various implementing measures (the 'French Resolution Framework'), the ACPR has broad resolution powers with respect to insurance groups, insurance holding companies, such as AXA/uni00A0 SA, and insurance or reinsurance companies, including prohibiting payment of dividends, ordering portfolio transfers, establishing temporary bridge institutions and imposing a temporary stay on early termination rights. Under the French Resolution Framework, French major insurance groups, such as the AXA Group, are required to prepare and file with the ACPR a pre-emptive recovery plan ( plan pr\u00e9ventif de r\u00e9tablissement ) covering  insurance  holding  companies,  insurance  and reinsurance subsidiaries thereof, and any other entity of such\n\nI\n\nI",

In particular, EIOPA proposed in its Solvency/uni00A0II Opinion to establish a minimum harmonized and comprehensive recovery and resolution framework, advocating for strengthened preventive and resolution powers available to national authorities, while the Financial Stability Board (the 'FSB') and the IAIS are increasingly focusing on the development of recovery and resolution frameworks, strategies and supervisory practices in the insurance industry. For instance, on August/uni00A025, 2020, the FSB published its Key Attributes Assessment Methodology for the Insurance Sector, which sets out essential criteria to guide the assessment of the compliance of a jurisdiction's insurance resolution framework with the FSB's Key Attributes of E/ff ective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions, as updated in 2014, which constitute the FSB's 'umbrella' standard for resolution regimes for all types of financial institutions. On the same date, the FSB also issued a note explaining the application of the aforementioned methodology and key attributes during the period of suspension of the designation of global systemically important insurers ('G-SIIs'), and indicated that the Key Attributes should continue to apply during the suspension period to any insurer that could be systemically significant. Furthermore, as part of its work on recovery and resolution, the IAIS published an Application Paper on Recovery Planning on November/uni00A018, 2019, and an Application Paper on Resolution Powers and Planning on June/uni00A023, 2021, which aim to provide guidance on supervisory practices related to resolution and on the application of certain insurance core principles ('ICPs') and related ComFrame standards in a resolution context.\n\nOn September/uni00A022, 2021, the European Commission published its proposed directive establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of insurance and reinsurance companies with a view towards harmonizing national laws on recovery and resolution of insurers and reinsurers, ensuring that Member States have the same tools and procedures to address failures of insurers and reinsurers, safeguarding the interests of policyholders, preserving the real economy and facilitating cooperation between national supervisory authorities when dealing with the failure of crossborder insurance and reinsurance groups. The proposed directive includes requirements for, among others, (i)/uni00A0content, timing and monitoring of individual and group pre-emptive recovery plans; (ii)/uni00A0resolvability assessments; and (iii)/uni00A0content and governance with respect to individual and cross-border group resolution plans.\n\n## EU-US Covered Agreement\n\nIn connection with Solvency/uni00A0II, on September/uni00A022, 2017, the European Union and the United States signed the 'Bilateral Agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on Prudential Measures Regarding Insurance and Reinsurance' (the 'Covered Agreement') which sets out principles governing the imposition of Group capital and supervisory standards for insurance groups headquartered in an EU Member State or the United States with operations in both. Following approval by the European Parliament on March/uni00A0 1, 2018, and the Council of the European Union on March/uni00A020, 2018, the Covered Agreement entered into force on April/uni00A04, 2018, and will be fully implemented within five years from its signing date. Pursuant to the Covered Agreement, the AXA Group will remain subject to group supervisory and capital requirements, as currently provided under Solvency/uni00A0II, with AXA's US insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries remaining subject to local requirements. The Covered Agreement also addresses various regulatory information-sharing and reporting matters, as well as EU/US reinsurance market issues.\n\nOn October/uni00A028, 2021, the European Union and the United States held the fourth meeting of the joint c ommittee. Participants provided updates regarding the implementation of the Covered Agreement with respect to reinsurance activities, group supervision and the exchange of information between insurance supervisors. Participants acknowledged the progress made towards the timely implementation of the Covered Agreement and discussed the status of the removal of collateral and local presence requirements, the procedure for potential preemption and the provisions on group supervision and the exchange of information. In addition, the United States and the European Union reaffirmed their commitment to close coordination and the continuous review of the progress on the Covered Agreement. Consistent with the Covered Agreement, both the United States and European Union are continuing to encourage relevant authorities to refrain from taking any measures that are inconsistent with any of the provisions of the Covered Agreement.\n\n## LLOYD'S\n\nFollowing the acquisition of the XL Group in 2018, AXA has been managing, through Catlin Underwriting Agencies Limited, Syndicate 2003, one of the larger syndicates at Lloyd's. As a result, AXA is exposed to a variety of Lloyd's-related regulatory matters, such as the Council of Lloyd's wide discretionary powers to regulate members of Lloyd's, vary the method by which the capital solvency ratio is calculated, or impose additional or special levies on members.\n\nFor further information on the risks related to regulatory capital requirements, see the paragraph 'the Group's or its insurance or reinsurance entities' failure to meet their solvency and capital\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

From 2013 to 2016, the FSB, in consultation with the IAIS and national authorities, annually published a list of GSIIs, which included AXA in each of such years. On May/uni00A018, 2020, EIOPA published an updated list of IAIGs headquartered in the European Union, established in accordance with ComFrame, which included AXA.\n\nOn November/uni00A014, 2019, the IAIS adopted the ComFrame, which includes the version 2.0 of the ICS. As part of the IAIS implementation schedule, ICS/uni00A02.0 is first subject to a five-year monitoring period, starting in January/uni00A02020, during which IAIGs can be asked by their supervisors to compute an ICS, on a voluntary basis, for confidential reporting and discussion in supervisory colleges. The end objective for the IAIS is to have the ICS implemented in all jurisdictions as a group-wide prescribed capital requirement for IAIGs a/f\\_t er the monitoring period. On November/uni00A014, 2019, the IAIS also adopted a holistic framework for the assessment and mitigation of systemic risk in the insurance sector (the 'Holistic Framework'), in lieu of the previous individual GSII designation mechanism, which continues to be implemented.\n\nThe Holistic Framework comprises a set of enhanced supervisory measures and powers of intervention ( e.g. , ongoing supervisory requirements, applied to insurers, enhanced macro-prudential surveillance, crisis management and recovery planning), which are embedded within certain ICPs and ComFrame materials, an annual global monitoring exercise by the IAIS (at individual insurer and sector-wide levels), as well as implementation assessment activities aimed at assessing and mitigating the potential build-up of systemic risk in the global insurance sector. The Holistic Framework moves away from the previous binary approach, in which a set of pre-determined policy measures applied to only a small group of identified GSIIs, to an approach promoting a proportionate application of an enhanced set of supervisory policy measures and powers of intervention for macro-prudential purposes to a broader portion of the insurance sector.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe IAIS will however continue to use risk factors similar to those used in the past to identify GSIIs, to assess potential systemic risk at individual insurers as part of its global monitoring exercise and systemic risk assessment. In addition, many of the enhanced supervisory measures reflected in the Holistic Framework are similar to and derived from the enhanced policy measures the IAIS had formerly adopted for application to GSIIs only. In light of the development and adoption of the Holistic Framework by the IAIS, the FSB has decided to continue suspending the annual identification of GSIIs as from the beginning of 2020. In November/uni00A02022, the FSB will review the need to either discontinue or re-establish an annual identification of GSIIs based on the initial implementation of the Holistic Framework.\n\nAXA will continue to monitor the development of the Holistic Framework, ICPs and ComFrame and expects the regulatory landscape with respect to insurance, reinsurance and financial markets to continue to evolve in 2022 and beyond with further legislative and regulatory initiatives.\n\nIn connection with the Internal Reinsurance Transformation, AXA/uni00A0SA has applied to obtain a reinsurance license from the ACPR, and would, upon receipt thereof, become a licensed reinsurance company subject to the applicable ACPR regulations governing reinsurance entities and activities, and would enter into annually renewable 25% quota share reinsurance treaties with certain of AXA's European Property/uni00A0& Casualty carriers. As part of the Internal Reinsurance Transformation, AXA Global Re, the Group's existing internal reinsurance entity, would be merged with and into AXA/uni00A0SA, with AXA/uni00A0SA as the surviving entity. For additional information, see paragraphs 'The Group's or its insurance or reinsurance entities' failure to meet their solvency and capital adequacy requirements could have a material adverse e/ff ect on our business, liquidity, ratings, results of operations and financial condition', 'We are dependent on our subsidiaries to cover our operating expenses and dividend payments' and 'The Group and our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision,  adverse judicial decisions and emerging social and reputational trends in the various jurisdictions in which we operate' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n## ASSET MANAGEMENT & BANKING ACTIVITIES\n\nAXA Investment Managers and other AXA a sset m anagement entities are subject to extensive regulations in the various jurisdictions in which they operate. These include, in Europe, Directive 2011/61/EU dated June/uni00A0 8, 2011 on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (as amended, 'AIFMD'), and Directive 2009/65/EC dated July/uni00A013, 2009 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities ('UCITS'), and their various implementing regulations and transposition measures.

In addition, AXA's investment management operations in the United States are subject to regulation by the SEC.\n\nThese regulations are generally designed to safeguard client assets and ensure the adequacy of disclosures concerning investment returns, the risk characteristics of invested assets in various funds, the suitability of investments for client investment objectives and risk tolerance, as well as the identity, regulatory approvals and qualifications of the investment manager. These regulations generally grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the carrying on of business for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. In such event, the possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in business for specific periods, the revocation of the registration as an investment company, censures and/or fines.\n\nIn addition, certain AXA entities must comply with revised obligations on capital resources for banks and certain investment firms, including Directive 2013/36/EU dated June/uni00A026, 2013, on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms (as amended 'CRD'), and Regulation (EU) No./uni00A0575/2013 dated June/uni00A026, 2013, on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms, as amended, which set forth specific capital, governance and remuneration requirements (as amended 'CRR'). On June/uni00A027, 2019, Directive (EU) 2019/878 dated May/uni00A020, 2019 ('CRD/uni00A0II') and Regulation (EU) 2019/876 dated May/uni00A020, 2019 ('CRR/uni00A0II'), which respectively amend CRD and CRR, entered into force. CRD/uni00A0II and CRR/uni00A0II further implement the Basel/uni00A0III framework by amending various CRD and CRR provisions regarding, e.g. , holding company rules, leverage ratios, large exposures, liquidity, market risk and counterparty credit risk, as well as reporting and disclosure requirements (including on remuneration). Most provisions of CRD/uni00A0II had to be transposed into national law by EU Member states by December/uni00A028, 2020, and were transposed in France by Order No./uni00A02020-1635 dated December/uni00A021, 2020, while most CRR/uni00A0II requirements will be applicable from June/uni00A028, 2021.\n\nMoreover, certain AXA entities are subject to Directive 2014/65/ EU dated May/uni00A015, 2014, on markets in financial instruments (as amended, 'MiFID/uni00A0II') and Regulation (EU) No./uni00A0600/2014 on markets in financial instruments, as amended ('MiFIR' and, together with MiFID/uni00A0II, and the various regulations promulgated thereunder, the 'MiFID/uni00A0II Package') which entered into force in 2018. The MiFID/uni00A0II Package, which was designed to better integrate the European Union's financial markets and increase cross-border investments, market transparency and investor protection, imposes a wide variety of new requirements including with respect to trading/\n\nclearing of certain derivatives on organized platforms, regular reporting with respect to derivatives positions and certain other types of financial instruments, enhanced governance and investor protection standards, restrictions and/or prohibitions on certain types of compensation arrangements or other monetary inducements to firms providing independent investment advice and greater regulation of structured products and other complex financial instruments.\n\nThe reforms introduced by the MiFID/uni00A0II Package significantly impacted EU securities and derivatives markets. The European Commission conducted a public consultation on the review of the MiFID/uni00A0II Package, which expired in May/uni00A02020, and consequently revised the MiFID/uni00A0II Package in successive Commission delegated regulations published on March/uni00A026, 2021, July/uni00A014, 2021 and August/uni00A02, 2021. These regulations require investment firms that manufacture and distribute financial instruments to, among other things, (i)/uni00A0clarify that their processes and internal control systems appropriately reflect sustainability risks, (ii)/uni00A0confirm that they have the knowledge and technical capacities to analyze those risks, and (iii)/uni00A0confirm that, for each financial instrument that is intended to be distributed to clients seeking to invest in financial instruments with a sustainability-related profile, sustainability factors are considered in/uni00A0(a) the product approval process and/uni00A0 (b) other product governance and oversight arrangements.\n\nIn addition, the European Securities and Markets Authority ('ESMA') simultaneously conducted a public consultation on several issues arising out of the MiFiD/uni00A0II Package and published its MiFIR review report on March/uni00A023, 2021, specifically on the obligations to report transactions and reference data, with a view towards simplifying the current reporting regimes whilst ensuring the quality and usability of the reported data. ESMA is expected to provide additional technical advice on the proposals contained in the report and the European Commission is expected to adopt legislative proposals based on the report.\n\nA legislative review of certain aspects of the MiFID/uni00A0II Package, related to market structure topics, was proposed by the European Commission on November/uni00A025, 2021.\n\nSome AXA entities are directly or indirectly subject to Regulation (EU) No./uni00A01286/2014 dated November/uni00A026, 2014, on key information documents for packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (as amended, the 'PRIIPs Regulation') which entered into force in 2018, the objective of which is to enhance retail investor protection by standardizing the information through predefined key information documents. While the PRIIPs Regulation has already impacted insurance undertakings, banks and asset managers, its technical regulatory standards are under review by the European Commission, and review of the PRIIPS Regulations under consideration by the European Union in order to reach better convergence with other EU regulations.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

AXA's asset managers and banks, which manage derivatives on behalf of various AXA Group a/ff iliates (including on behalf of AXA), operate in conformity with these rules, in line with the Group's overall financial risk framework.\n\nFor additional information, see the paragraph 'The Group and our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision,  adverse judicial decisions and emerging social and reputational trends in the various jurisdictions in which we operate' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n## OTHER SIGNIFICANT LEGISLATIVE AND/uni00A0REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS\n\n## EU Data Protection Reform\n\nThe EU Data Protection Reform, which was adopted in 2016 and entered into force in 2018, establishes a comprehensive framework governing the protection and processing of personal data in the private and public sectors, which includes the GDPR.\n\nThe main principles of the GDPR include (i)/uni00A0the strengthening of citizens' fundamental rights, giving them more control over their personal data and making it easier for them to access it, (ii)/uni00A0 an increased harmonization of the applicable law across the European Union and a 'one-stop-shop' that will streamline cooperation between the data protection authorities on issues with implications for all the European Union, and (iii)/uni00A0a stronger enforcement regime, under which competent data protection authorities are able to fine companies that do not comply with EU rules up to 4% of their global annual turnover. The GDPR applies to both EU and non-EU companies, if the latter are offering goods and services or monitoring the behaviour of individuals in the European Union. As insurance and reinsurance companies need an EU license for providing insurance services in the European Union, the GDPR applies primarily, in the insurance and reinsurance sector, to companies operating in the European Union.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIn France, the EU Data Protection Reform has been transposed by Law No./uni00A02018-493 regarding personal data protection, which entered into force on May/uni00A025, 2018, and various implementing measures, including Decree No./uni00A02018-687 dated August/uni00A01, 2018.\n\nFor further information concerning data protection, please see the paragraph 'The evolving and complex regulatory environment surrounding data protection and transfer worldwide could increase our costs and adversely impact our business' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n## Personal data transfers to non-EU jurisdictions (without an adequacy decision adopted by the/uni00A0European Commission)\n\nFollowing invalidation in 2015 of the European Commission's Safe Harbor Decision by the European Union Court of Justice (the '2015 ECJ Decision'), which had allowed, under certain conditions, for the transfer of personal information for commercial purposes from companies in the European Union to companies in the United States which had signed up to the US Department of Commerce 'Safe Harbor Privacy Principles,' transatlantic data flows between companies continued using other mechanisms, such as standard contractual clauses with US companies and binding corporate rules for transfers within a multinational corporate group. Following the 2015 ECJ Decision, a new safe harbor, referred to as the 'EU-US Privacy Shield,' had been created in July/uni00A02016, but was invalidated by the European Union Court of Justice on July/uni00A016, 2020 (the '2020 ECJ Decision'), which also required that supplementary measures be considered for other mechanisms for data transfers to any non-EU jurisdiction (without an adequacy decision adopted by the European Commission). As banks, insurance and reinsurance companies were generally not eligible to register and participate in the EU-US Privacy Shield, the AXA Group has continued to rely on standard contractual clauses when transferring data to non-AXA non-EU companies, and binding corporate rules when transferring personal data between companies within the AXA Group. We currently believe that we can continue using such mechanisms to transfer data to the US and to other non-EU jurisdictions and add supplementary measures as required. For further information concerning transatlantic data transfers, please see the paragraph 'The evolving and complex regulatory environment surrounding data protection and transfer worldwide could increase our costs and adversely impact our business' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.",

In addition, on October/uni00A08, 2020, EIOPA issued an additional set of guidelines, the 'Guidelines on information and communication technology security and governance', aimed at promoting the operational resilience of the digital operations of insurance and reinsurance undertakings. Both sets of guidelines provide guidance to national competent authorities and insurance and reinsurance undertakings on the information and communication technology ('ICT') security and governance requirements envisaged under Solvency/uni00A0II, and have applied since July/uni00A01, 2021. AXA Group has tracked the progress of both sets of guidelines, provided feedback to EIOPA and confirmed the alignment of its practices or strategy with the guidelines.\n\nThese guidelines set out the principles developed for the financial sector under the European Commission's Digital Operational Resilience Act ('DORA'). On November /uni00A024, 2021, the Council of the European Union approved the dra/f\\_t  DORA regulation, which is now being submitted for final consideration by the European Parliament before adoption. DORA is designed to establish a comprehensive framework on digital operational resilience for EU financial institutions, including insurance and reinsurance undertakings and intermediaries, credit institutions, investment firms, alternative investment fund managers and UCITS management companies. This framework is aimed at enhancing the ICT r isk m anagement conducted by financial institutions, establishing a thorough testing of ICT systems, increasing supervisors' awareness of cyber risks and ICT-related incidents faced by financial institutions, as well as introducing powers for competent supervisory authorities to oversee risks stemming from financial institutions' dependency on ICT third-party service providers. DORA also proposes to create a consistent incident reporting mechanism in order to strengthen supervisory e/ff ectiveness. This dra/f\\_t  regulation is currently being considered by the European Parliament through the regular EU legislative process.\n\n## Executive compensation\n\nSolvency/uni00A0II sets out the remuneration policy principles and governance requirements to be implemented by European insurers and specifies that the companies subject to Solvency/uni00A0II must adopt a written remuneration policy compliant with a number of principles set out in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 dated October/uni00A010, 2014 (as amended, the 'Solvency/uni00A0II Regulation')  which  promotes  sound  and  effective  r isk m anagement and does not encourage risk-taking that exceeds the risk tolerance limits of the Company. In this context, AXA has reviewed and formalized its existing Group remuneration policy, identified the individuals responsible for managing and having an impact on the Group's overall risk profile, and\n\ndefined a consistent approach to manage remuneration of individuals in charge of control functions. AXA's Compensation & Governance Committee is in charge of overseeing the design of the remuneration policy and remuneration practices, their implementation and operation.\n\nSince 2008, there have been a variety of proposals with respect to executive compensation practices at financial institutions including from the FSB and other regulatory bodies. Certain of these proposals have been embodied in regulation or legislation, while others remain best practice recommendations.\n\nIn  2009,  the  FSB  published  the  'Principles  for  Sound Compensation Practices', together with implementation standards. Among the matters covered in these standards and principles are a variety of mechanisms (including minimum recommended deferrals of cash bonuses, greater use of longterm equity grants rather than cash as a form of compensation, minimum vesting/deferral periods, and performance criteria for vesting of long-term awards) that are designed to ensure an appropriate alignment of interests between (i)/uni00A0Executive Management and certain employees (such as traders) who can have a potentially significant impact on the nature and duration of risks incurred, (ii)/uni00A0the Company and (iii)/uni00A0shareholders. The FSB's principles were supplemented by additional guidance published by the FSB in 2018, which has been developed in the form of recommendations regarding improvements in compensation practices and tools that could be used to reduce misconduct risk and address misconduct incidents.\n\nIn addition, on April/uni00A07, 2020, EIOPA published an opinion on the supervision of remuneration principles in the insurance sector. This opinion is based on EIOPA's views that the remuneration principles defined in the Solvency/uni00A0II Regulation are high-level and leave considerable discretion to undertakings and supervisory authorities, and aims at ensuring that consistent practices be applied in the application of the remuneration principles included in the Solvency/uni00A0II framework. As a result, EIOPA's opinion sets out guidance to national supervisory authorities on how to challenge the application of certain remuneration principles, and focuses on employees identified as potential higher profile risk-takers including, subject to certain variable compensation thresholds, (i)/uni00A0members of the administrative, management or supervisory body of the undertaking, (ii)/uni00A0Executive Directors who e/ff ectively run the undertaking, (iii)/uni00A0key function holders within the meaning of the Solvency/uni00A0II regulations ( i.e. , r isk m anagement, compliance, internal audit and actuarial), and (iv)/uni00A0 employees whose professional activities have a material impact on the undertakings' risk profile. EIOPA has indicated that it will begin monitoring the application of this opinion by national supervisory authorities two years a/f\\_t er its publication ( i.e. , a/f\\_t  er April/uni00A07, 2022).\n\nThese principles and standards are reflected in a variety of regulations and legislative initiatives that have been enacted over the past few years in various jurisdictions where the Group does business.

The application of these principles and standards may vary among the di/ff erent actors in the financial sector (such as banks, insurers, asset managers, private equity funds and hedge funds) and across the various jurisdictions where the Group does business, which may give rise to certain competitive issues for the Group, including by a/ff ecting the Group's ability to attract and retain top-rate talents.\n\n## Evolution of accounting standards\n\nPolicyholders' liabilities are currently accounted for according to IFRS/uni00A04, which generally allows the use of a wide variety of accounting practices for insurance contracts, reflecting di/ff erent national accounting requirements, and the continuation of accounting policies applied prior to conversion to IFRS. On May/uni00A018, 2017, the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB') issued the IFRS/uni00A017 - Insurance Contracts, which will replace IFRS/uni00A04, finalizing a long-standing project of the IASB to develop a single and consistent approach to the accounting for insurance contracts. In particular, IFRS/uni00A017 requires insurance obligations to be accounted for using current values, instead of historical costs. Following amendments decided on June/uni00A025, 2020, by the IASB, the updated IFRS/uni00A017 will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after January/uni00A01, 2023. The amended version of IFRS/uni00A017 was adopted by the European Union on November/uni00A019, 2021 with an exemption setting forth that a company may choose not to apply the annual cohort requirement prescribed in IFRS/uni00A017 to certain groups of investment contracts under certain circumstances.\n\nIn parallel with IFRS/uni00A017, the Group will apply the IFRS/uni00A09 Financial Instruments. The published e/ff ective date of IFRS/uni00A09 was January/uni00A01, 2018. However, given the interaction between financial assets and insurance liabilities, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS/uni00A04 allowing, under certain criteria, entities issuing insurance contracts within the scope of IFRS/uni00A04 to defer the implementation of IFRS/uni00A09 until the e/ff ective date of IFRS/uni00A017, but no later than January/uni00A01, 2023, so that qualifying insurers could apply both standards for the first time simultaneously. The Group is eligible for this temporary exemption and has decided to apply it.\n\nThe implementation of these two standards within the Group is in progress and management is currently assessing the impact of their adoption.\n\n## Climate and sustainable finance-related regulatory initiatives/uni00A0 SNFP\n\nThere are various initiatives at the French, EU and international levels with respect to climate change and sustainable finance, which generally aim at proposing reforms to and potential changes a/ff ecting investment activities, disclosure requirements and requirements relating to the inclusion of (i)/uni00A0environmental, social and governance ('ESG') considerations in insurance and a sset m anagement products and advice and (ii)/uni00A0climate change in stress testing.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## Disclosure requirements with respect to/uni00A0climate change and sustainable finance\n\nIn France, the national framework for non-financial reporting requirements for companies (including financial institutions) has been successively strengthened by (i)/uni00A0Article/uni00A0173-VI of Law No./uni00A02015-992 dated August/uni00A017, 2015, on the energy transition for green growth ('Article/uni00A0173') and (ii)/uni00A0 Article/uni00A0 29 of Law No./uni00A02019-1147 dated November/uni00A08, 2019, on energy and climate ('Article/uni00A029') and the decree implementing Article/uni00A029 published on May/uni00A027, 2021.\n\nArticle/uni00A0 173 imposes increased transparency obligations on investors (including institutional investors), requiring them to disclose how they incorporate ESG objectives, including the specific consideration of climate risk, into their investment strategies and the measures implemented to support the energy and ecological transition.\n\nArticle/uni00A029 maintains the current disclosure framework under Article/uni00A0173 and strengthens certain of its provisions, particularly with respect to the publication of risks related to climate change and biodiversity erosion. The decree implementing Article/uni00A029 published on May/uni00A027, 2021, provides a framework for extrafinancial reporting by market participants, which will include certain entities of the AXA Group, and defines how ESG qualitative information and the means implemented to support the energy and ecological transition are to be presented.\n\nAt the European Union level, Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector ('SFDR') was adopted on November/uni00A027, 2019. The SFDR sets out harmonized rules for financial market participants, which includes certain AXA Group entities, on transparency with respect to the integration of sustainability risks, the consideration of adverse sustainability impacts of market participants' processes and the provision of sustainability-related information of certain financial products. The final report on regulatory technical standards for the content and presentation of disclosure requirements under SFDR was published by the ESMA on October/uni00A022, 2021. However, the application of the final regulatory technical standards has been delayed until January/uni00A01, 2023.\n\nRegulation (EU) 2020/852 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment (the 'Taxonomy Regulation') was adopted on June/uni00A018, 2020. The Taxonomy Regulation applies, in particular, to undertakings (such as the Company) that are required to publish a non-financial statement. The Taxonomy Regulation establishes the criteria for determining whether an economic activity qualifies as environmentally sustainable for the purposes of establishing the degree to which an investment is environmentally sustainable. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 dated June/uni00A04, 2021, and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 dated July/uni00A06, 2021, supplement the Taxonomy Regulation by, among other things, specifying the content and presentation of the information to be disclosed in a non-financial statement.",

Directive 2014/95/ EU (also known as the Non-Financial reporting Directive, or 'NFRD') is an amendment to Directive 2013/34/EU (the 'Accounting Directive') that requires certain large companies, such as AXA/uni00A0SA, to publish annually a non-financial statement. The European Commission is currently reviewing the NFRD as part of its strategy to strengthen the foundations for sustainable investment and conducted a public consultation that closed on June/uni00A011, 2020. On April/uni00A021, 2021, the European Commission published: the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (the 'CSRD') which, with respect to corporate sustainability reporting, amends the Accounting Directive, Directive 2004/109/EC (the Transparency Directive, as amended), Directive 2006/43/EC and Regulation (EU) No./uni00A0537/2014. In the CSRD, the European Commission, among other things, introduced new sustainabilityrelated reporting requirements for companies, including (i)/uni00A0the principal risks the issuer faces with respect to sustainability matters and how the issuer manages those risks, (ii)/uni00A0the resilience of the issuer's business model and strategy in light of risks related to sustainability matters, (iii)/uni00A0the opportunities which sustainability matters may present for the issuer, (iv)/uni00A0the issuer's plan(s) to ensure that its business model and strategy are compatible with the transition to a sustainable economy and with the global warming limit of 1.5\u00b0C set by the Paris Agreement, an international climate change agreement that entered into force on November/uni00A04, 2016, (v)/uni00A0a description of the targets set by the issuer related to sustainability matters and the progress the issuer has made towards achieving those targets, (vi)/uni00A0the role of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies with regards to sustainability matters, and (vii)/uni00A0the due diligence process(es) implemented by the issuer with respect to sustainability matters.\n\nFinally,  the  Group  supports  and  implements  the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and publishes voluntary information in line with these recommendations, which include, among others, recommendations with respect to disclosure of actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning, disclosure of the organization's governance around climaterelated risks and opportunities and disclosure of metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\n## Requirements relating to the inclusion of environmental, social and governance considerations in insurance and Asset Management products and advice\n\nOn April/uni00A0 30, 2019, EIOPA issued a technical opinion to the European Commission with respect to the integration of sustainability risks and factors in the delegated acts under the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive and Directive (EU) 2016/97 dated January/uni00A020, 2016, on insurance distribution (as amended, 'IDD'). On September/uni00A030, 2019, EIOPA issued its opinion on sustainability under Solvency/uni00A0II framework.\n\nBased on the public consultation conducted by the European Commission between June/uni00A02020 and July/uni00A02020, the European Commission adopted on April/uni00A021, 2021, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/1257 amending the regime for the integration of sustainability factors, risks and preferences into the product oversight  and  governance  requirements  for  insurance undertakings and insurance distributors and into the rules on conduct of business and investment advice for insurance-based investment products. Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/1257 will be applicable on August/uni00A02, 2022, when sustainability factors (as defined in Article/uni00A02(24) of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088) will, inter alia , have to be taken into account in the definition of the target market of each insurance product, in the marketing of insurance products and in the appropriate tests.\n\nAt the international level, the IAIS completed in January/uni00A02021 a public consultation on a draft Application Paper on the supervision of climate-related risks in the insurance sector, developed to support insurance supervisory authorities in their e/ff orts to integrate climate-related risks into their respective supervisory frameworks.\n\n## Requirements in connection with climate change in/uni00A0 stress testing\n\nThe ACPR conducted an initial climate pilot exercise that incorporated certain climate change scenarios and assumptions into stress testing, the first results of which were published in May/uni00A02021. Pursuant to these first results, the exposure of French financial institutions to the sectors that are most impacted by the risks related to the ecological transition (as identified in the climate pilot exercise) is relatively limited.\n\nThese or similar initiatives are expected to continue in 2022 and could result in new or additional requirements for financial institutions.\n\nFor further information on climate change, please refer to Section/uni00A04.3 'Climate c hange and ESG i ntegration' of this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI",

In particular, Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 dated June/uni00A08, 2016 (as amended, the 'EU Benchmark Regulation'), which entered into force on January/uni00A01, 2018, as well as the EU Benchmark Regulation as incorporated into UK law as from January/uni00A01, 2021 (the 'UK Benchmark Regulation' and, together with the EU Benchmark Regulation, the 'Benchmark Regulation') imposed additional requirements on the provision of financial market-related benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of benchmarks within the EU and the UK.\n\nSeveral interbank market benchmarks have been designated as critical benchmarks under the Benchmark Regulation, including LIBOR, EURIBOR and EONIA, and their related benchmark methodologies have been made subject to review. Certain critical benchmarks have been or might be discontinued in the future, including, EONIA, which ceased to be published in January/uni00A02022, and LIBOR (publication of most LIBOR settings ceased on December/uni00A031, 2021, and publication of certain USD LIBOR settings are expected to cease on June/uni00A030, 2023). In this context, Regulation (EU) 2021/168 amending the EU Benchmark Regulation was adopted on February/uni00A010, 2021, and allows the European Commission to impose a statutory replacement for certain critical benchmarks, whose cessation might result in significant disruption to the EU financial markets' operations. This new statutory benchmark would replace other benchmarks used in contracts and financial instruments, which (i)/uni00A0have not been renegotiated before the date of cessation of the benchmark, and (ii)/uni00A0contain either no contractual replacement (or so-called 'fallback provision'), or a fallback provision which is deemed unsuitable be supervisors. The European Commission has designated statutory replacements for EONIA and CHF LIBOR. The FCA has also exercised certain powers under the UK Benchmark Regulation to compel the publication of the 1-, 3- and 6-month GBP and JPY LIBOR settings on the basis of a changed or 'synthetic' methodology until December/uni00A031, 2022.\n\nBecause these reforms are a/ff ecting the whole financial sector, the transition to the new benchmarks creates industry-wide risks, to which AXA is therefore exposed. AXA is conducting a Groupwide project to manage this transition and manage the impacts of future benchmark changes, which could have implications for our capital models, r isk m anagement efforts, investment strategies and product design, among others.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## Evolution of the regulatory and litigation environment\n\nThe Group's insurance, reinsurance, a sset m anagement and banking operations are subject to an increasing number of legislative and regulatory initiatives designed to increase consumer protection in the sector of financial services. In the European Union, initiatives related to the financial sector include in particular the IDD, MiFID/uni00A0II and the PRIIPs Regulation. Similar initiatives are under review (or in the course of implementation) in other jurisdictions where the Group operates, and these initiatives are likely to continue to expand, resulting in increased operational compliance costs to meet regulatory expectations.\n\nThe IDD superseded the Insurance Mediation Directive and is designed to improve consumer protection by ensuring that all distributors of i nsurance products operate on a level playing field. The main provisions of the IDD relate to enhanced professional requirements ( e.g. , continuing training and development for distributors), conduct of business rules, conflicts of interest (relating to fees, commissions and bonuses), increased disclosure and transparency and extensive product governance requirements. It also includes additional requirements for the sale of i nsurance products with investment elements in order to ensure that policyholders receive a similar level of protection as buyers of r etail i nvestment products regulated under MiFID/uni00A0II ( e.g. , when providing advice, distributors have to assess whether the insurance-based investment product is suitable for the customer).\n\nThe IDD entered into force on October/uni00A01, 2018, while MiFID/uni00A0II and the PRIIPs Regulation entered into force at the beginning of January/uni00A02018.\n\nFinancial crime compliance programs of financial institutions (anti-money laundering, anti-corruption and international sanctions compliance) continue to be a major focus for regulatory and law enforcement authorities, with increasingly significant penalties imposed for compliance failures. In particular, French Law No./uni00A02016-1691 dated December/uni00A09, 2016, on transparency, the fight against corruption and modernization of the economy, known as 'Sapin/uni00A0II', which was introduced in June/uni00A0 2017, included new requirements for all large French companies to establish internal procedures to prevent and detect acts of corruption and influence peddling committed in France and abroad. Sapin/uni00A0II also established a new French anti-corruption agency ( Agence fran\u00e7aise anticorruption ), which was given strengthened supervisory and enforcement powers. Furthermore, Orders No./uni00A02020-1342 of November/uni00A04, 2020 and No./uni00A02020-115 of February/uni00A012, 2020, enhanced the requirements for French financial institutions, including the reinforcement of internal procedures to implement asset-freezing measures and prevent and detect acts of corruption committed in France and abroad, while strengthening the supervisory and enforcement powers of supervisory authorities.",

In continental Europe, the introduction of class actions, including in France in 2014, has, and is likely to continue to, increase litigation risks and costs for insurers, asset managers and other financial institutions. Most recently, the adoption of Directive (EU) 2020/1828 dated November/uni00A025, 2020, on representative actions for the protection of the collective interests of consumers at the EU level aims at enabling qualified entities to seek remedy through representative actions against infringements of provisions of EU law in a variety of areas (including data protection and financial services), in order to provide an e/ff ective and e/ff icient way of protecting the collective interests of consumers. This Directive must be transposed by EU Member States by December/uni00A025, 2022, for a scheduled application date of June/uni00A025, 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## AXA Group Tax Policy\n\nBoth as a multinational company and as a provider of i nvestments and s avings products, the AXA Group follows a responsible and transparent approach on tax issues.\n\nThe taxes AXA pays are an important part of its wider economic and social impact and play a key role in the development of countries where it operates/uni00A0 (1) . AXA regards it as a critical element of its commitment to grow in a sustainable, responsible and socially inclusive way.\n\nAXA also squares its responsibilities as a co-operative, compliant taxpayer in each and every country in which it operates, with the need to support competitive business growth - serving all its stakeholders including investors, suppliers and employees.\n\n## TAX ASPECTS IN RELATION TO AXA AS/uni00A0A/uni00A0MULTINATIONAL COMPANY\n\n## The AXA Group's approach to tax issues\n\nIn the countries where it operates, AXA is both a taxpayer and a tax collector, given that many specific taxes are levied on insurance and reinsurance policies and collected from our customers as part of the insurance, reinsurance and a sset\n\nIn addition, the litigation environment has been evolving in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, with holders of property and casualty insurance policies increasingly seeking coverage for losses caused by the governmental actions and measures implemented to contain the spread of COVID-19, such as lockdown measures. A number of lawsuits have been and may be introduced against insurers, such as AXA, in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nFor additional information, please see 'The Group and our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision,  adverse judicial decisions and emerging social and reputational trends in the various jurisdictions in which we operate' and 'We have been and may become in the future subject to lawsuits, regulatory investigations and/or other proceedings (including activism related to environmental, social and governance matters and other societal and reputational trends) which may affect our business, brand, reputation, relations with regulators and/or results of operations' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' and Section/uni00A05.8 'Other material risks - Regulatory risks' of this Annual Report.\n\nm anagement revenues while others are remitted to the various state and federal administrations around the world.\n\nThe tax function is organized within the Group to ensure full compliance with all tax legislation in the countries where AXA operates. In addition to the Group Tax Department based in France, all key operational entities/countries/geographic zones have a tax team in charge of ensuring that tax regulations are well understood and fully satisfied by the entities.\n\nAs a part of the global internal risk assessment, a specific tax internal control program is implemented. These controls must be reported and documented by each team in scope to ensure full compliance.\n\nA Tax Code of Ethics, agreed between Group Tax Department and local tax teams, highlights the key principles guiding the actions of the various tax teams:\n\n- /uni25A0 to remain up to date with respect to applicable laws and regulations;\n- /uni25A0 to comply with tax laws and regulations;\n- /uni25A0 to maintain a good relationship with the local tax authorities; and\n- /uni25A0 not to engage in aggressive tax driven transactions that could compromise the good reputation of the Group.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n7",

In addition, a bi-annual tax review process of each key entity or business line is performed by the Group Tax Department in connection with each local team. During these reviews, specific attention is given to tax audits and associated tax risks as well as market positions on tax matters that may impact AXA. These reviews o/ff er a global framework for the tax teams to identify, analyze, control, and report tax risks.\n\nLastly, an International Tax Committee composed of various senior tax executives within AXA tax teams meets every quarter to ensure consistency in approach on some technical topics, as well as agreements on guidelines, when necessary, connected to specific items.\n\nAs an international group operating in several countries, the AXA Group is subject to various tax regimes and regulations and takes into account any changes in tax law. AXA is specifically vigilant about the changes that could result in higher tax expenses and payments, higher compliance costs or that may a/ff ect the AXA Group's tax liability, return on investments and business operations. In particular, please see the paragraph 'Changes in tax laws or uncertainties in the interpretation of certain tax laws may result in adverse consequences to our business and our results of operations' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\nWhen considering how AXA entities structure commercial arrangements, tax implications are analyzed in parallel with other consequences such as capital e/ff iciency and legal and regulatory aspects when deciding between potential alternative arrangements.\n\nAXA has no licensed insurance or operating business activities in the countries specifically identified as non-cooperative jurisdictions/uni00A0 (1) under French and European rules, except in Panama. The presence in this jurisdiction is purely driven by operational purposes.\n\nAXA still holds two non-consolidated operating companies in Panama (one providing assistance services to local customers, and the other delivering health claim services) employing circa 45/uni00A0people at the end of 2021.\n\n(1)\n\nI\n\nMore globally, AXA does not use non cooperative jurisdictions to avoid taxes on operational activities performed elsewhere.\n\nAny presence in countries in which AXA operates with tax rates lower than France are driven by business operations. With the acquisition of the XL Group in September/uni00A02018, AXA now has a material presence and substance in Bermuda with nearly 200/uni00A0employees working for AXA XL there. Despite the fact that Bermuda is a low-tax jurisdiction, it is a center of expertise and one of the key locations of the worldwide reinsurance market. It is not considered as a non-cooperative jurisdiction according to the French and European Union laws. This presence is mainly driven by local capital management regulation enabling flexibility on the required capital for reinsurance activities and AXA supports the Economic Substance legislation enacted in this country. This situation will in no way change how the AXA Group is managed on the tax side. AXA will continue to tax its operations in the various countries where operational profits are made.\n\n## Disclosure on tax matters and information on/uni00A0taxes connected with the Group's activities in each country\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in compliance with IFRS standards (as disclosed in Section/uni00A06.6 Note/uni00A01 'Accounting principles' of this Annual Report). Accounting for income taxes recognizes both the current tax consequences of transactions and events and the future tax consequences of the future recovery or settlement of the carrying amount of the entity's assets and liabilities, as required by IAS/uni00A012 (see Section/uni00A06.6 - Note/uni00A01.17.1 'Income taxes' of this Annual Report).\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements present the reconciliation between the theoretical tax charge and the e/ff ective tax charge under IFRS. All di/ff erences are fully explained (see Section/uni00A06.6 - Note/uni00A019 'Tax' of this Annual Report). It should be noted that in many jurisdictions where AXA operates, the income and capital gains on s avings-products benefit from a favorable tax treatment, also when such products are included in l ife insurance products. This leads to a lower e/ff ective tax rate for l ife insurance companies.\n\nI",

AXA's income tax expenses/benefits are extensively disclosed in the Annual Report and are broken down by business segment and country. For each, a dedicated paragraph provides a comment about the line related to Tax Income (see Section/uni00A02.3 'Activity Report - Underlying Earnings, Adjusted Earnings and Net Income Group share' of this Annual Report).\n\nSince 2019, AXA has been annually reporting a Tax Transparency report where it discloses a lot of information around its tax footprint in its key geographies, as well as key principles of its tax policy. This report is available on the AXA website (www.axa. com) at the end of the AXA Group Tax Policy page. AXA updates this report annually and the most recent version was issued in May/uni00A02021.\n\n## TAX ASPECTS OF ACTIVITIES AND/uni00A0PRODUCTS OFFERED BY THE GROUP\n\n## Activities of the Group\n\nThe Group's activities are subject to strict regulations and rigorous control in each territory in which AXA operates. In addition to these regulations, AXA has developed a set of detailed internal standards that applies to all Group entities that are managed or controlled by AXA, regardless of the activities undertaken by the entity or its ownership structure.\n\nAccording to these internal standards, Chief Executive O/ff icers must ensure that sta/ff  are fully conversant, and comply with applicable laws, mandatory Codes of Conduct, rules and regulations (including applicable tax laws and regulations) relevant to their area of operations.\n\nThis means that local senior management must appreciate the tax implications of the activities in their entity. The main considerations are:\n\n- /uni25A0 compliance with the taxation of employees in the territory in which they are employed;\n- /uni25A0 compliance with the taxation of business undertaken in the territory (including levies and sales taxes); and\n- /uni25A0 cross-border tax issues.\n\nA specific focus on transfer pricing is made in application of these standards, to ensure that the pricing of our intra-group activities is consistent with the OECD 'arm's length' principle as well as with local transfer pricing rules to pay adequate tax on profits where the value is created.\n\nIn particular, Chief Financial O/ff icers must ensure that insurance and reinsurance policies entered into represent a true transfer of risk and that their status as insurance or reinsurance contracts could not be subject to challenge. Business between Group companies must be transacted at market prices where a market price exists, or in the absence of market prices, must be supported by formally documented justification for the charge made.\n\n## Products o/ff  ered by the Group\n\nAXA products are not designed to allow or encourage tax evasion. The Group has set up a validation framework to ensure that new products undergo a thorough approval process before they go to market.\n\nThe local decision to launch a new product must result from a documented approval process that complies with the AXA Group's standards in terms of product features, pricing, assetliability management and aspects related to legal, compliance, regulatory, accounting and reputation.\n\nMoreover, AXA has established strict policies regarding its cross-border activities and knowledge of its customers, in order to ensure that our products and services are not misused for money laundering or tax evasion purposes and are governed by specific rules according to which cross-border l ife insurance proposals must be presented to the Group Tax and Compliance Departments for validation.\n\nWhile all Group entities must in any case comply with local regulations, the Group Tax Department can veto a product if this product is not compliant with internal rules.\n\nPursuant to Directive (EU) 2018/822, AXA may, as a provider of i nvestments and s avings products, have tax reporting obligations with respect to certain cross-border products it designs or implements. In particular, certain i nvestments and s avings products with no particular tax motive may be reportable under the above-mentioned Directive.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

As a result, AXA/uni00A0SA would become a licensed reinsurance company subject to the applicable ACPR regulations governing reinsurance entities and activities, and AXA/uni00A0 SA's corporate purpose as currently described in Article/uni00A03 of its b ylaws would be amended, subject to the approval of two-thirds of the shareholders attending or represented at the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting to be held on April/uni00A028, 2022 (for more information about the amendment of AXA SA's b ylaws and AXA/uni00A0 SA's Shareholders' Meetings, please refer to the paragraphs below 'Modification of shareholders' rights' and 'Shareholders' Meetings'). AXA SA's b ylaws, as amended, will be available on the website of the Company.\n\n## MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CORPORATE OFFICERS\n\nIn addition to French law provisions, AXA SA's b ylaws and the terms of reference of the Board of Directors include a number of specific provisions concerning members of the Board of Directors and corporate o/ff icers, including the following:\n\n## Compensation\n\nThe corporate o/ff icers of the Company receive compensation in the amount and on conditions set by the Board of Directors, upon proposal of the Compensation & Governance Committee.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nMembers of the Board of Directors receive a fixed annual directors' fee, the maximum overall amount of which is determined by the Shareholders' Meeting and apportioned by the Board of Directors among its members, pursuant to the rules set forth in the terms of reference of the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the above, the terms of reference of the Board of Directors provide that no directors' fee shall be paid to corporate o/ff icers.\n\nFor further information, please see Part/uni00A03 'Corporate governance' of this Annual Report.\n\n## Age limit\n\nNotwithstanding the term of o/ff ice for which the Chairman of the Board of Directors is appointed, his/her functions shall terminate, at the latest, at the end of the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting convened to approve the financial statements of the preceding fiscal year and held during the year the Chairman reaches the age of 70.\n\nNotwithstanding the term of o/ff ice for which the Chief Executive O/ff icer is appointed, his/her functions shall terminate at the latest at the end of the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting convened to approve the financial statements of the preceding fiscal year and held during the year the Chief Executive O/ff icer reaches the age of 65. The same rule applies for the Deputy Chief Executive O/ff icers.\n\nAn individual aged 70 or older may be appointed or reappointed to the Board of Directors exclusively for a two-year term of o/ff ice. His/her term of o/ff ice can be renewed only once.\n\nWhen the number of Board members aged 70 or older exceeds one-third of the directors in o/ff ice, the oldest director is deemed to have resigned automatically unless any member of the Board of Directors aged 70 or older voluntarily resigns within three months.\n\nWhen the permanent representative of a legal entity member of the Board of Directors reaches 70/uni00A0years old, the legal entity is deemed to have resigned automatically unless it designates a new representative within three months.\n\n## Shareholding\n\nIn accordance with the Afep-Medef Code and regardless of any statutory obligation of holding shares, the directors, with the exception of directors representing employees, shall personally be shareholders of the Company and own a significant number of shares in the Company; if they do not own such shares at the time they are first appointed, they shall use their directors' fees to acquire AXA shares. Accordingly, the Board of Directors has set for each Board member, whether an individual or a permanent representative of a legal entity to whom directors' fees were paid, the objective of holding, within two years a/f\\_t er first being appointed, a number of shares in the Company, the value of",

The shares purchased for the purpose of this holding objective will be held in registered form.\n\nFor additional information regarding the Board of Directors and corporate o/ff icers of the Company, please see Part/uni00A03 'Corporate governance' of this Annual Report.\n\n## RIGHTS, PREFERENCES AND RESTRICTIONS ATTACHED TO THE SHARES\n\n## Voting rights\n\nEach AXA share entitles its holder to one vote at every AXA SA's Shareholders' Meeting, subject to the provisions regarding double voting rights described below. On May/uni00A026, 1977, the Shareholders' Meeting decided that each ordinary share fully paid up and held in registered form by the same person for at least two full fiscal years entitled its holder to double voting rights with respect to such share.\n\nIn the event of a capital increase by capitalization of existing reserves, profits or premiums, shares granted for free to any shareholder holding shares entitled to double voting rights will also carry double voting rights.\n\nThe rights of the holders of double voting rights may only be modified or cancelled upon the decision of an Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting and after authorization by a special meeting of the holders of these rights.\n\nWith the exception of double voting rights, there is currently only one class of shares with equal rights for all shareholders.\n\n## Dividends\n\nUpon proposal by the Board of Directors of AXA/uni00A0SA, the shareholders of AXA/uni00A0SA may decide to allocate all or part of distributable profits to special or general reserves, to carry them forward to the next fiscal year as retained earnings, or to allocate them to the shareholders as dividends. If AXA/uni00A0SA has earned a distributable profit since the end of the previous fiscal year, as reflected in an interim balance sheet certified by its Statutory Auditors, the Board of Directors may distribute interim dividends to the extent of the distributable profit without prior approval of the shareholders. AXA SA's Bylaws require AXA/uni00A0SA to distribute any dividends between its shareholders in proportion to their share in the capital.\n\nUnder the provisions of AXA SA's Bylaws, the actual dividend payment date is decided by the Board of Directors.\n\nAXA SA's Bylaws provide that, the Shareholders' Meeting may grant each shareholder the choice to receive dividends in either cash or additional ordinary shares.\n\n## Pre-emptive rights\n\nUnder French law, shareholders have preferential subscription rights to subscribe, on a pro rata basis, additional ordinary shares (and/or convertible, exchangeable or other securities giving a claim, directly or indirectly, to AXA/uni00A0SA ordinary shares). This subscription right is transferable and normally trades separately during the subscription period for a capital increase. Issuing additional shares without preferential subscription rights requires the approval of two-thirds of the shareholders attending or represented at an Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## Liquidation rights\n\nIf AXA/uni00A0SA is liquidated, the assets remaining a/f\\_t er it pays its debts, liquidation expenses and all prior claims will be used to repay AXA SA's shareholders up to the amount of the liquidation balance and the par value of the shares held by each shareholder. Any surplus will be divided among all shareholders, subject to rights arising, if any, from di/ff erent classes of shares, in proportion to the rights they own in the Company's share capital.\n\n## MODIFICATION OF SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS\n\nUnder French law, shareholders of a French public company ( soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme ) have the power to amend AXA SA's b ylaws. Such an amendment generally requires the approval of two-thirds of the shareholders attending or represented at an Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting. However, no such Extraordinary Shareholders' Meetings may decide (i)/uni00A0to increase the liability of the shareholders in respect of the Company or a third party; or (ii)/uni00A0to reduce the individual rights vested in each shareholder (such as voting rights, right to distributable profits of the Company, right to sell one's shares and right to sue the Company).\n\n## SHAREHOLDERS' MEETINGS\n\nShareholders are convened, meet and deliberate in accordance with applicable French laws and AXA SA's b ylaws.\n\nA notice of meeting must be published in the Bulletin des annonces l\u00e9gales obligatoires ('BALO'), at least 35/uni00A0days before any Shareholders' Meeting (or 15/uni00A0days in certain specific cases), and must indicate, in particular, the agenda and the proposed resolutions.\n\nAt least 15/uni00A0days (or six days in certain cases) prior to the date set for the meeting on first call, and at least 10/uni00A0days (or four days in certain cases) before any second call, the Company shall send a final notice containing all the information requested by law by mail to all registered shareholders who have held shares for more than one month prior to the date of this final notice and publish a final notice in a bulletin of legal notices, as well as the BALO.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

This ownership is justified by a book entry showing the number of shares in the name of the shareholder (or the intermediary for the account), on the second business day preceding the meeting at 0:00 am, Paris time (France), either in the registered share accounts kept by the Company or in the bearer share accounts kept by a qualified intermediary.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Article/uni00A0L.22.10-10 5\u00b0 of the French Commercial Code, the conditions for the participation to Shareholders' Meetings are detailed in Article/uni00A023 of AXA SA's b ylaws, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.\n\nIn addition, the information referred to in Article/uni00A0L.22-10-11 of the French Commercial Code is made public in the corporate governance report approved by AXA SA's Board of Directors' and attached to the Board of Directors' report of AXA/uni00A0SA included in this Annual Report. For further information, please refer to Appendix/uni00A0VII 'C orporate governance report - Cross- Reference Table' to this Annual Report.\n\n## ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS\n\nThere are no French anti-takeover statutes similar to the antitakeover statutes enacted by certain states in the United States and other jurisdictions. However, a number of French law provisions, in particular those resulting from Law No./uni00A02014-384 dated March/uni00A029, 2014 ( visant \u00e0 reconqu\u00e9rir l'\u00e9conomie r\u00e9elle ), from Law No./uni00A02019-486 dated May/uni00A022, 2019 ( relative \u00e0 la croissance et la transformation des entreprises ), known as 'PACTE', or from certain provisions of Directive 2004/25/EC dated April/uni00A021, 2004 on takeover bids (which was implemented in France in 2006), may have certain anti-takeover e/ff ects. In the case of AXA, the relevant provisions include, among other things, the existence of AXA shares with double voting rights, which are described above, and specific notification requirements applicable when holdings exceed specified thresholds, as described below.\n\nFrench law generally requires mergers and certain consolidations to be approved by two-thirds of the shareholders attending or represented at the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting convened to decide on such matters.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS WHEN HOLDINGS EXCEED SPECIFIED THRESHOLDS\n\nPursuant to Article/uni00A07 of AXA SA's b ylaws, any person, acting alone or jointly, who comes to hold, directly or indirectly, through companies it controls within the meaning of Article/uni00A0L.233-3 of the French Commercial Code, a number of shares representing 0.5% of the Company's share capital or voting rights, shall notify the Company by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt within five days from the threshold crossing. This notification shall detail the total number of shares and voting rights held as well as the total number of securities giving a di/ff ered claim to the share capital and the potential voting rights attached thereto.\n\nThe notification shall be repeated in the conditions stated above each time an additional fraction of 0.5% of the share capital or voting rights is crossed upward or downward.\n\nIn  the  event  of  failure  to  comply  with  the  notification requirements described above, shares exceeding the fraction that should have been notified will be deprived of voting rights at the Shareholders' Meetings if, at such meetings, the notification failure has been recorded and if one or more shareholders jointly holding at least 5% of the share capital so request. Loss of voting rights shall be applicable in all Shareholders' Meetings that would be held up until two years following proper notification.\n\n## CHANGES IN CAPITAL\n\nThe Company's share capital may be modified only under the conditions stipulated by the legal and regulatory provisions in force. The provisions of the b ylaws or the terms of reference of the Board of Directors of AXA/uni00A0SA shall not prevail over changes in the law governing the Company's share capital.",

AXA's Statutory Auditors provide a reasonable assurance report on AXA Group's ICOFR each year.\n\nThe IFC program is based on the Group Internal Control Standard and the Group Internal Control Policy, which include additional specific requirements for the IFC framework.\n\n## (a) IFC framework\n\nThe IFC framework is based on the 'Internal Control - Integrated Framework' issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). It is designed to define the IFC scope, governance, and principles in order to ensure consistency and quality in AXA Group's financial reporting.\n\n## (A.1) IFC SCOPE\n\nThe IFC program includes primarily the entities which are individually significant to consolidated financial position or results of operations, as well as the entities which provide significant services to AXA and/or its consolidated subsidiaries (the 'Group').\n\n## (A.2) IFC GOVERNANCE\n\nManagement, including the Group Chief Executive O/ff icer (CEO), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate ICOFR.\n\nThe IFC program is steered by the Group IFC Committee chaired by the Group CFO and involves the Planning Budgets Results Central (PBRC) Department, other relevant AXA departments, and representatives from each in-scope entity. The IFC program and the conclusion of management as to the e/ff ectiveness of AXA Group's ICOFR are also reviewed by AXA's Audit Committee.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## (A.3) IFC PRINCIPLES\n\nAXA Group's ICOFR includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that:\n\n- /uni25A0 the maintenance of records accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Group assets;\n- /uni25A0 the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the applicable generally accepted accounting principles;\n- /uni25A0 the receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of management and directors of the Group; and\n- /uni25A0 unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Group assets that could have a material e/ff ect on the Group's financial statements would be prevented or detected in a timely manner.\n\nIn order to assess the e/ff ectiveness of ICOFR, financial reporting risks are initially identified at Group level with a focus on identifying those risks that may result in a material misstatement of Consolidated Financial Statements not being prevented or detected in a timely manner. This top-down and risk-based approach enables to identify in-scope entities and processes.\n\nIn line with the COSO framework, AXA Group's ICOFR is organized around the following key process categories: Entity-Level Controls (ELC), IT ELC, Financial Statement Closing Process, Business Processes, and IT General Controls.\n\nFor every key process category, the in-scope entities (i)/uni00A0document the significant processes and/or controls, as well as the rationale of how the associated risk of material misstatement due to error or fraud can be reduced to an acceptable level, (ii)/uni00A0test the design and operational e/ff ectiveness of key controls based on the test plans elaborated with insight into risks, and (iii)/uni00A0remediate identified control deficiencies.\n\nOutstanding control deficiencies are consolidated at Group level to evaluate their impact on Consolidated Financial Statements, compensating controls and other qualitative factors. This evaluation process is designed to identify any control deficiencies that may rise to the level of a material weakness. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's financial statements will not be prevented or detected on time.",

        "page_content": "## (A.4) IFC CERTIFICATION\n\nAt each year-end, the in-scope entities are required to perform an evaluation of their ICOFR as part of an internal certification process. This process involves formal sign-o/ff  by the entity's process owners and culminates with a formal management report from the entity's CFO or another senior executive o/ff icer stating their conclusion as to the e/ff ectiveness of the entity's ICOFR.\n\nThis internal certification process across all in-scope entities is designed to assist AXA's management in its evaluation of AXA Group's ICOFR and to support its conclusion as to the e/ff ectiveness of AXA Group's ICOFR.\n\n## (b) Management's annual evaluation on ICOFR based on the IFC framework\n\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the e/ff ectiveness of AXA Group's ICOFR in accordance with the IFC framework as described above. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that AXA Group's ICOFR was e/ff ective as of December/uni00A031, 2021 .\n\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be e/ff ective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of e/ff ectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or if the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures deteriorates.\n\n## (c)  Report of the Statutory Auditors on ICOFR\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Mazars have performed audit procedures in order to be able to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether management's conclusion as to the e/ff ectiveness of AXA Group's ICOFR based on the IFC framework is fairly stated.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA",

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS accounting principles. The assessment of the e/ff ectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is based on criteria established in the Internal Financial Control (IFC) framework, as described in management's annual evaluation of internal control over financial reporting on  pages 472 and 473  of this Annual Report. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's management's assertion, based on our audit procedures.\n\nWe conducted our work in accordance with French professional standards and ISAE/uni00A03000 ('Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information'). These standards require that we plan and perform the audit procedures to obtain reasonable assurance about whether AXA management's assertion that internal control over financial reporting is e/ff ective, was fairly stated in all material respects. Our audit procedures included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating e/ff ectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe the evidence gathered is su/ff icient and appropriate to express our opinion.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of e/ff ectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or if the degree of compliance with the principles or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nIn our opinion, the Company's management's assertion that internal control over financial reporting as of December/uni00A031, 2021 is e/ff ective, in all material respects, is fairly stated based on the criteria determined in the IFC framework.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Courbevoie, March/uni00A021, 2022\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Vignon - Gr\u00e9gory Saugner\n\nMazars\n\nGilles Magnan - Maxime Simoen\n\nI\n\nMazars\n\n61, rue Henri R\u00e9gnault 92400 Courbevoie\n\nI",

HIGHLIGHTS\n\nThe significant account movements are presented in the tables in these notes.\n\n## 2. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\n## 2.1 General principles\n\nThe financial statements as at December/uni00A031, 2021, are prepared and presented in accordance with the provisions of the 2014 Chart of Accounts (regulation ANC n\u00b02014-03 dated June/uni00A05, 2014).\n\nSince January/uni00A01, 2011, AXA has applied regulation ANC n\u00b02015-05 linked to term financial instrument and hedge operation.\n\nSince January/uni00A01, 2005, AXA has applied regulations CRC/uni00A02002-10 related to depreciation and amortization of assets (amended by regulations CRC/uni00A02003-07 and CRC/uni00A02005-09), and CRC/uni00A02004-06 related to the definition, recognition and measurement of assets, repealed and replaced by regulation ANC n\u00b02014-03 chapter ' titre/uni00A0II, chapitre/uni00A0I Actifs non financiers '; application of these regulations has had no impact on the Company's financial statements.\n\nIn accordance to regulation CRC/uni00A02008-15, repealed and replaced by regulation ANC n\u00b02014-03 chapter ' titre/uni00A0 VI, chapitre/uni00A0 II, Section/uni00A04 Plans d'options d'achat ou de souscription d'actions et plans d'attribution d'actions gratuites aux salari\u00e9s ' (especially Articles/uni00A0624-15 and 624-16) and chapters ' titre/uni00A0IX, chapitre/uni00A0IV, Section/uni00A05 Comptes financiers ' (especially Article/uni00A0945-50) treasury shares are recorded in 'Marketable securities'. As of December/uni00A031, 2021, 65,818,351/uni00A0shares were allocated to hedging purposes, representing \u20ac1,527 /uni00A0million.\n\nThe application of regulations relating to the accounting treatment of stock options (subscription and purchase) and performance shares/units (free shares granted to employees and subject to performance conditions) had no impact on the Company's financial statements (regulation ANC n\u00b02014-03 chapter ' titre/uni00A0VI, chapitre/uni00A0II, Section/uni00A04 Plans d'options d'achat ou de souscription d'actions et plans d'attribution d'actions gratuites aux salaries' ).\n\nFind below a summary of options and performance shares or units shares granted in 2021 and 2020 to members of the Management Committee paid by the Company:\n\n|            | Year 2021                                 | Year 2021                                                                                  | Year 2020                                 | Year 2020                                                           |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| (in  Euro) | Value of options granted  during the year | Value of performance  shares and performance  units granted  during/uni202Fthe/uni202Fyear | Value of options granted  during the year | Value of performance  shares granted  during/uni202Fthe/uni202Fyear |\n| TOTAL      | -                                         | 3,955,416                                                                                  | -                                         | 4,037,100                                                           |\n\nStocks options, performance shares and performance units plans are described in  Section/uni00A03.2 'Executive compensation and share ownership' of this Annual Report.\n\n## 2.2 Presentation of the financial statements\n\n## BALANCE SHEET\n\nIntangible assets include concessions, patents, brands and so/f\\_t ware.\n\nTangible assets include investments in real estate, split between land and buildings, as well as fixtures and fittings.\n\nFinancial assets consist in (i)/uni00A0investments in and receivables from subsidiaries and a/ff iliates, and (ii)/uni00A0other financial assets and loans.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nSecurities are classified using the following criteria:\n\n- /uni25A0 investments in subsidiaries and affiliates are securities representing at least 10% of the share capital of the issuing company plus those which the Company deems held for the long term;\n- /uni25A0 other financial assets comprise securities representing less than 10% of the share capital and which are not investments in subsidiaries and a/ff iliates.\n\n## INCOME\n\nThe income statement distinguishes between ordinary operations and capital operations:\n\n- /uni25A0 ordinary operations include dividends, revenues from other investments, financial expenses, operating expenses and income from transactions in marketable securities;",

        "page_content": "- /uni25A0 capital operations include gains or losses on the disposal of investments in subsidiaries and a/ff iliates and portfolio management investments, impairment charges and reversals in respect of these securities and related receivables, gains and losses arising from exchange rate movements, charges and reversals of provisions for risks and charges, and exceptional income and expense.\n\nDisposals of investments in subsidiaries and a/ff iliates are measured using the weighted average unit cost method.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the financial statements, (i)/uni00A0charges and releases of provisions for exchange rate risk are recognized in foreign exchange result, and (ii)/uni00A0charges and reversals of provisions for tax repayment risk are recognized in income tax benefit/expense.\n\n## 2.3 Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets totaled \u20ac322/uni00A0million which mainly included the AXA brand valued at \u20ac308/uni00A0million.\n\n## 2.4 Tangible assets\n\nTangible assets are recognized at acquisition cost or transfer value. Buildings are depreciated using the straight line method over fi/f\\_t y years, and fitting work is depreciated over five or ten years as appropriate.\n\n## 2.5 Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are measured at acquisition cost or transfer cost. At the balance sheet date, the acquisition cost is compared to the fair value, and the lower of these two values is then recognized in the balance sheet.\n\nThe fair value of investments in subsidiaries and a/ff iliates is their going concern value for the firm. This may be determined as a function of (i)/uni00A0their share price, (ii)/uni00A0their shareholders' equity (including unrealized gains) or (iii)/uni00A0prospects for the subsidiary.\n\nThis multi-criteria analysis reflects the long-term nature of AXA's ownership in these subsidiaries and excludes factors relating to short-term market volatility. Net book value is compared with the going concern value, which is the value of the assets and expected profits of existing and new business, taking into account the entity's future prospects. The value of future profits is estimated on the basis of calculations of the European Embedded Value of the Life/uni00A0& Savings business published by the Group, or similar calculations for other activities.\n\nFor other investments, the fair value is the share price for listed securities and the likely trading value for unlisted securities.\n\n## 2.6 Receivables\n\nReceivables are measured at nominal value. An impairment provision is charged in the event of risk of non-recovery.\n\n## 2.7 Marketable securities\n\nAt the balance sheet date, the acquisition cost is compared to the fair value, which corresponds to the exit value for SICAV and FCP Mutual funds and to the average share price over the last month before the balance sheet date for the other securities.\n\n## 2.8 Prepayments and accrued income\n\nDeferred charges correspond to debt issue costs, which are spread over the lifetime of the issue or for a maximum of 10/uni00A0years when the debt has no predetermined maturity.\n\n## 2.9 Employee benefits\n\nEmployee benefit liability was reviewed and a valuation was carried out, in accordance with the Recommendation ANC n\u00b0 2013-02, so as to measure any additional adjustment necessary to ensure the coverage of defined post-retirement benefit obligations and for accounting purposes. The method 1, as defined by this Recommendation has been applied: past service costs are recognized in profit and loss over the vesting period and the expected return on asset is used in developing the net periodic pension cost. Pursuant to this review, the employee benefit liability recognized was nil as at December/uni00A031, 2021. Additional information on employees' defined benefit obligations is provided in Note/uni00A026.2 of Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 2.10 Unrealized foreign exchange gains/losses\n\nForeign currency receivables and liabilities are adjusted at the balance sheet date exchange rate. The matching item for this adjustment is a translation variance asset account when the di/ff erence is an unrealized loss, and a translation variance liability account when it is an unrealized gain. These items do not flow through the income statement but a provision for foreign exchange risk is made to recognize unrealized losses relating to the translation variance asset.\n\nWhen a loan or borrowing generates an unrealized translation loss, but is hedged, a provision for unhedged risk is registered.\n\n## 2.11 Derivative products\n\n- /uni25A0 Interest rate swaps: these transactions are recognized by applying the accrued interest method. A distinction is made in the income statement and balance sheet between income from the principal transaction, which is the subject of the swap, and the net income from the swap transaction. The nominal value of the swaps serving as a basis for interest rate swaps is recognized o/ff -balance sheet;\n- /uni25A0 Derivative products qualifying as hedges against foreign exchange risk (exchange rate or currency swaps, currency futures) are recognized o/ff -balance sheet as a reciprocal liability and receivable commitment. For currency options, the premium paid on acquisition is recognized as an asset on the balance\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA",

The same is true when the option is not exercised at term. For option sales, a provision for risks and charges is recognized to take into account the unrealized loss. Other derivative instruments are recognized o/ff -balance sheet at their nominal value. Unrealized losses arising from the estimated market value of these financial instruments give rise to recognition of a provision for foreign exchange loss when the hedge accounting cannot be applied;\n\n- /uni25A0 Equity derivative products: equity option rights paid or received are posted in a suspense account on payment or receipt of funds. At the balance sheet date, if the option has not been exercised, the rights received, representing possible income, are not recognized in the income statement. A provision is created against rights paid if it is likely, given market trends, that the option will not be exercised. When the option is exercised, this represents an addition to the acquisition price of the underlying instrument and an addition to the sale price when the option is sold.\n\n## 3.

The tax consolidation regime provides that tax savings should be recognized directly in the Company's financial statements. However, a provision for the return of tax savings is recognized when there is a high probability that the benefit will accrue to subsidiaries as a result of the prospect of future taxable income resulting from the Group's strategic planning.",

The Company has the option of deferring payment of the coupons under certain conditions. Nonetheless, the coupons must be\n\npaid when these conditions cease to be met or on redemption of the instruments. When payment is deferred for an extended period, the coupons remain payable by law. Similarly, in the absence of dividends being paid, unpaid coupons accumulated over the years will be recognized as payable upon liquidation, if any. These instruments are classified as debt on the basis of this contractual obligation to pay the coupons.\n\n## 3.13 Financial debt\n\n| (in Euro million)                                    | Value at  December/uni00A031, 2021   | Less than one/uni00A0year   | 1 to 5/uni00A0years   | More than 5/uni00A0years   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|\n| Euro Medium Term Notes                               | 500                                  | -                           | -                     | 500                        |\n| Bonds of which \u20ac3,686m  related to the Group entites | 3,686                                | 200                         | 2,505                 | 981                        |\n| Deposits under collateral agreements                 | 123                                  | 123                         | -                     | -                          |\n| Loans granted by Group entities                      | 11,477                               | 1,168                       | 3,467                 | 6,842                      |\n| Commercial papers                                    | 500                                  | 500                         | -                     | -                          |\n| Accrued interests                                    | 81                                   | 81                          | -                     | -                          |\n| TOTAL                                                | 16,367                               | 2,072                       | 5,972                 | 8,323                      |\n\nFinancial debt amounted to \u20ac16,367/uni00A0million from \u20ac17,286/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020, reflecting a decrease of \u20ac919/uni00A0million, of which \u20ac703/uni00A0million of the repayment of the mandatory exchangeable bonds for Equitable Holding,/uni00A0Inc., shares and \u20ac295/uni00A0million in outstanding commercial papers repayment.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA",

This Statutory Auditors' report includes information required by European regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the Statutory Auditors or verification of the management report and other documents provided to shareholders. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\nTo the Shareholders' Meeting,\n\n## AXA/uni00A0SA\n\n25, Avenue Matignon 75008 Paris France\n\n## OPINION\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Shareholders' Meeting, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of AXA/uni00A0SA for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at December/uni00A031, 2021 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## BASIS FOR OPINION\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/ff icient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of rules required by the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and the French Code of ethics ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for Statutory Auditors for the period from January/uni00A01, 2021 to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article/uni00A05(1) of Regulation (EU) N\u00b0/uni00A0537/2014.\n\n## JUSTIFICATION OF ASSESSMENTS - KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles/uni00A0L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\nI\n\nI",

At the end of the fiscal year, an impairment allowance is recognized if the value at closing date is less than the acquisition cost. As described in Note/uni00A02.5 to the financial statements, the value at closing date corresponds to the value in use and is determined by management on the basis of the share price, the equity value (including unrealized gains), or the future prospects of the subsidiary.\n\nEstimating the value in use of these types of investments requires a significant degree of judgment from management in terms of selecting the measurement methods, depending on the investment in question, and in determining which data and assumptions should be used to estimate the expected profits when these are taken into account in the valuation. The value of future profits is estimated on the basis of the European Embedded Value (EEV) calculations for the Life/uni00A0& Savings segment published by the Group, or similar calculations for the other activities.\n\nGiven the inherent uncertainty involved in the use of forecasts (in terms of whether or not they will be achieved) and in the judgment required to assess value in use, we deemed the correct measurement of investments in subsidiaries and a/ff iliates, particularly those based on forward-looking data, to be a key audit matter.\n\nTo assess the reasonableness of the estimated value in use of investments in subsidiaries and a/ff iliates, based on the information provided to us, our audit work consisted primarily of verifying that the estimated values determined by management were based on an appropriate measurement method and assumptions, depending on the investment concerned.\n\nFor valuations based on forecast data:\n\n- /uni25A0 assess the appropriateness of the methodology and assumptions used with regard to the Solvency/uni00A0II texts and the European Embedded Value principles published by the CFO Forum when the values in use of life and non-Life insurance companies are based on these frameworks;\n- /uni25A0 for the other entities, obtain the projections for cash flow and operating cash flow for the businesses produced by their respective operational management teams, and:\n- -check the consistency of the historical data used with the financial statements of the audited entities,\n- -check that the assumptions made are consistent with the economic environment at the closing date and at the date the financial statements were prepared,\n- -compare projections made in previous periods with actual results in order to assess the reliability of the estimates,\n- -verify the accuracy of the value in use calculated,\n- -confirm that the value in use, which is based on projected cash flows, has been adjusted to account for debts.\n\nWe also verified the recording of provisions for contingencies where the Company is exposed to the losses of a subsidiary with negative equity. Finally, we assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the financial statements.\n\n## SPECIFIC VERIFICATIONS\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by law and regulations.\n\n## Information given in the management report and in the other documents with respect to/uni202Fthe/uni202Ffinancial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders\n\nWe have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the management report of the Board of Directors and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders.\n\nWe attest the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information relating to the payment deadlines mentioned in Article/uni00A0D.441-6 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ).\n\n## Report on corporate governance\n\nWe a ttest that the Board of Directors' report on corporate governance sets out the information required by Articles/uni00A0L.225-37-4, L.22-10-10 et L.22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ).\n\nConcerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article/uni00A0L.22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) relating to remunerations and benefits received by or allocated to the directors and any other commitments made in their favor, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your Company from controlled companies which are included in the scope of consolidation. Based on these procedures, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA",

Based on these procedures, we have no observations to make on this information.\n\n## Othe r  Information\n\nIn accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the identity of the shareholders and holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report.\n\n## REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n\n## Format of presentation of the financial statements included in the Annual Financial Report\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with the professional standard applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by the statutory auditor relating to the annual and consolidated financial statements presented in the European single electronic format, that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Financial Report mentioned in Article/uni00A0L.451-12,/uni00A0I of the French Monetary and Financial Code ( Code mon\u00e9taire et financier ), prepared under the responsibility of the Chief Executive O/ff  icer, complies with the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation No 2019/815 of December/uni00A017, 2018.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the financial statements included in the Annual Financial Report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\n## Appointment of Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as Statutory Auditors of AXA/uni00A0SA by the Shareholders' Meetings held on February/uni00A028, 1989 for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and on June/uni00A08, 1994 for Mazars. As at December/uni00A031, 2020, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Mazars were in the thirty-third and in the twenty-eigth consecutive year of total uninterrupted engagement, respectively.\n\n## RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR/uni202FTHE/uni202FFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with French accounting principles and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the e/ff ectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe financial statements were approved by/uni00A0the Board of Directors.\n\n## STATUTORY AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Objectives and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nI\n\nI",

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- /uni25A0 Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ff ectiveness of the internal control;\n- /uni25A0 Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements;\n- /uni25A0 Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- /uni25A0 Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## REPORT TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article/uni00A06 of Regulation/uni00A0(EU)/uni00A0No./uni00A0537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles/uni00A0L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and in the French Code of Ethics ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for Statutory Auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Courbevoie, March/uni00A021, 2022\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nMazars\n\nB\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Vignon - Gr\u00e9gory Saugner\n\nGilles Magnan - Maxime Simoen\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA",

It is defined as the excess of market value of assets over best estimate liabilities and Risk Margin as per Solvency/uni00A0II regulation.\n\n## Solvency/uni00A0II ratio\n\nThis ratio is calculated as per Sol vency/uni00A0II and is equal to the total amount of the Group's Eligible Own Funds ('EOF') divided by the Group's Solvency Capital Requirement ('SCR'). The Solvency Capital Requirement, i.e. the denominator of the Solvency/uni00A0II ratio, is set at a level ensuring that insurers and reinsurers are able to meet their obligations towards policyholders and beneficiaries over the next 12/uni00A0months, with a 99.5% probability. The Solvency Capital Requirement can be calculated either based on the standard formula or an internal model. The Group is using an internal model.\n\nThe Solvency/uni00A0II ratio is estimated primarily using AXA's internal model calibrated based on an adverse 1/200/uni00A0years shock. For further information on AXA's internal model and Solvency/uni00A0II disclosures, please refer to AXA Group's Solvency and Financial Condition Report (SFCR) as of December/uni00A031, 2021, available on AXA's website (www.axa.com).\n\n## Debt Gearing*\n\nDebt Gearing refers to the level of a company's debt related to its equity capital, usually expressed as a percentage. Debt Gearing is used by Management to measure the financial leverage of the Group and the extent to which its operations are funded by creditors as opposed to shareholders. AXA's Debt Gearing is calculated by dividing the gross debt (financing debt and undated and deeply subordinated debts) by total capital employed (consolidated shareholders' equity excluding undated and deeply subordinated debts and reserves relating to the change in the fair value of financial instruments and of hedge accounting derivatives plus the gross debt). Furthermore, mandatory exchangeable bonds into EQH shares issued by AXA in May/uni00A02018, and redeemed in May/uni00A02021 in exchange of EQH shares, were excluded from Debt Gearing since EQH had been deconsolidated.\n\n## ACTIVITIES\n\n## Insurance\n\n## LIFE/uni00A0& SAVINGS HYBRID AND GENERAL ACCOUNT CAPITAL LIGHT PRODUCTS\n\nHybrid products: Savings products allowing clients to invest in both Unit-Linked and General Account funds.\n\nGeneral Account Capital-Light products: General Account Savings products which, at inception, create more EOF than the economic capital they consume.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## LIFE/uni00A0& SAVINGS NET INFLOWS\n\nLife/uni00A0& Savings Net Inflows are defined as the collected premiums (including risk premiums, fees and revenues), net of surrenders, maturities, claims paid, and other benefits paid. This definition is applicable to all Life/uni00A0& Savings products as well as Life-like Health products, except for Mutual funds products.\n\n## NEW BUSINESS APE (NEW BUSINESS ANNUAL PREMIUM EQUIVALENT)\n\nNew business APE represents 100% of new regular premiums plus 10% of single premiums, in line with EEV methodology. APE is Group share.\n\n## NBV (NEW BUSINESS VALUE)\n\nThe value of newly issued contracts during the current year. It consists of the present value of future profits a/f\\_t er the costs of acquiring business, less (i) /uni00A0 an allowance for the time value of financial option and guarantees, and (ii)/uni00A0 cost of capital and nonfinancial risks. AXA calculates this value net of tax.\n\n## NBV MARGIN (NEW BUSINESS VALUE MARGIN)\n\nNew Business Value Margin is the ratio of:\n\n- /uni25A0 New Business Value representing the value of newly issued contracts during the current year; to\n- /uni25A0 Annual Premium Equivalent.\n\nThis ratio represents the profitability of the new business.\n\n## MARGIN ANALYSIS\n\nThe Margin Analysis is presented on an underlying earnings basis.\n\nEven though the presentation of the Margin Analysis is not the same as the Statement of Income (underlying basis), it is based on the same GAAP measures as used to prepare the Statement of Income in accordance with IFRS.\n\n## Underlying investment margin includes the following items:\n\n- /uni25A0 net investment income; and\n- /uni25A0 interests and bonuses credited to policyholders and unallocated policyholder bonuses (and the change in specific reserves purely linked to invested assets returns) related to the net investment income as well as the unwind of the discount rate used in calculating technical reserves.\n\n## Underlying fees & revenues include:\n\n- /uni25A0 loadings charged to policyholders (or contractual charges) on premiums of all Life/uni00A0& Savings products;\n- /uni25A0 loadings on deposits received on all Life/uni00A0& Savings products and fees on funds under management for separate account (Unit-Linked) business;\n- /uni25A0 capitalization of deferred income linked to new business: Unearned Revenue Reserve (URR) and Unearned Fee Reserve (UFR);\n- /uni25A0 amortization of Unearned Revenue Reserve (URR) and Unearned Fee Reserve (UFR), including the impact of interest capitalized;\n- /uni25A0 revenues derived from mutual fund sales (which are part of consolidated revenues); and\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA",
