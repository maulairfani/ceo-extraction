We have increased capital expenditure to support our fast-growing categories particularly co/ffee and pet care - to meet future demand.\n\n## Driving fast-paced innovation\n\nWe invest in developing solutions to meet growing consumer preferences for healthier products, reducing the time from concept to store shelf. Our focus is on anticipating growing trends, rapidly testing new ideas and bringing products to market with ongoing adaptation. We have maintained the same innovation speed since 2019 despite challenges due to the pandemic.\n\nBuilding a pipeline of meaningful innovations by investing in R&D fuels our growth. We deliver innovations quickly and scale them across brands, categories and geographies. Throughout the pandemic our launches have steadily increased. In 2021, we increased the number of global/multi-market launches and test launches by 12%.\n\nCo/ffee. From the way co/ffee is grown and produced to how it is consumed, we are innovating for better consumer co/ffee experiences and improved livelihoods for farmers. Nestl\u00e9's plant scientists announced a major breakthrough in 2021 by discovering two new Robusta varieties with up to 50% higher yields per tree versus standard varieties along with lower carbon emissions. Harnessing Nestl\u00e9's unique expertise in roasting technology, the new Nescaf\u00e9 Gold Blend Roastery Collection is a super-premium barista-style soluble co/ffee. For co/ffee connoisseurs, Nespresso limited edition La Cumplida Refinada co/ffee uses fermentation to create a uniquely sweet and fruity flavor profile.\n\n'Building a pipeline of meaningful innovations by investing in R&D fuels our growth. We deliver innovations quickly and scale them across brands, categories and geographies.'\n\nVitamins, minerals and supplements. Our rich pipeline of innovations in Nestl\u00e9 Health Science continues to empower people to take more control over their health. Responding to increased demand for products that support a healthy immune system, Nestl\u00e9 Health Science introduced Vital Proteins Immune Support Gummies and Persona Immune Support.\n\nPlant-based. Market demand for plant-based products is creating opportunities for new o/fferings across the entire food and beverage portfolio, which also contribute to our sustainability goals. Following the success of Vuna since its launch in 2020, in 2021 Garden Gourmet introduced vegan egg and shrimp alternatives, vEGGie and Vrimp . Plant-based food products generated sales of around CHF 800 million in 2021, posting 16.8% organic growth. We also expanded our dairy alternatives with pea-based, carbon-neutral Wunda . The new plant-based KitKat V is delighting both KitKat lovers and new consumers.\n\n## Connecting through digitalization\n\nNestl\u00e9 is accelerating digitalization, using data and technology to unlock e/fficiencies and growth opportunities. We are taking advantage of rapid shifts in consumer behavior by amplifying our digital-centric businesses and scaling digital capabilities. Artificial intelligence and remote assistance are allowing us to be more agile and flexible in our manufacturing sites and supply chains.\n\nWe see enhancing digital capabilities as a success factor. Across each of our categories, digital ecosystems are unlocking new avenues for insight, innovation and sustainable profitable growth. We are scaling direct access to consumers to enhance personalization in our marketing and direct-to-consumer o/fferings for greater engagement and loyalty. E-commerce sales grew by 15.1% to account for 14.3% of total Group sales.\n\n## Creating Shared Value\n\nCreating Shared Value has always been fundamental to the way we do business at Nestl\u00e9.

We maintained our\n\npractice of adding diverse experience and expertise through the appointment of a new independent director. In recent years we have, in particular, strengthened the Board's expertise on food systems, food and beverage, digitalization and other topics.\n\nDuring 2021, the Board further refined its governance framework by the creation of a separate, dedicated Sustainability Committee, which advises on all aspects of Nestl\u00e9's ESG agenda, including the Group's e/fforts on climate change, human rights, and diversity and inclusion.\n\n## Bringing our purpose to life\n\nWe are creating shared value for our shareholders and all stakeholders connected to our business by unlocking the power of food to enhance quality of life.

Our agility in changing environments and cultivation of our high-quality global, regional and local brands contribute to long-term financial performance. Our objective is to sustain a mid single-digit organic growth rate through rapid innovation, market share gains and portfolio management.\n\nWe compete in attractive and growing categories and prioritize investments to stay relevant and win in every segment and market in which we operate. Our digital technologies help us identify emerging consumer needs and business model opportunities so we can bring di/fferentiated innovation to market fast. We partner with customers across the retail landscape to adapt our product portfolio and channel strategies, leveraging our global brands to customize new products for local tastes and preferences. In 2021, our investment in strategic drivers yielded the following:\n\n- -High-growth categories of co/ffee, pet care, nutrition, water and nutritional health science, together representing 63% of sales, grew by 8.2%.\n- -Plant-based food products generated sales of around CHF/uni00A0800 million with organic growth of 16.8%.\n- -31 of our trusted brands, including Maggi , Milo and Nido , generated over CHF 1 billion each in annual sales at the retail level.\n- -E-commerce sales represented 14.3% of sales and grew by 15.1%, and our digital spend increased to 51%.\n- -Direct-to-consumer businesses represented 8.7% of sales and grew by 8.7%.\n- -Our premium o/fferings represented 35% of sales and grew by 12%.\n- -Emerging markets represented 41% of sales and grew by 7.8%.\n- -Sales of a/ffordable, accessible products - many nutrientfortified - grew by 7.1% and accounted for 18.9% of emerging market sales.\n\nWe focus on categories and geographies with attractive dynamics where Nestl\u00e9 has an ability to win. Since 2017, we have completed or announced more than 85 transactions (acquisitions and divestitures) with annual sales equivalent to around 20% of 2017 Group sales.

In combination with sales growth, this approach enables us to free up resources for reinvestment in product innovation, brand building, digitalization and sustainability initiatives, while creating value for our shareholders.\n\nWe continued to adapt our organization to be more agile, flexible and digitalized. In manufacturing, we continued to upgrade our operational footprint. In 2021, we reduced factory fixed overheads by 1.0%. In procurement, increased global buying combined with a reduced number of product specifications helped us reduce costs and complexity. Global buying through our three purchasing hubs was 63% in 2021. In our administration, we continued to simplify and standardize processes. The penetration of our shared service centers increased for the sixth consecutive year. Our fivequarter average working capital in % of sales was essentially stable at 0.1% at the end of 2021.\n\n## Allocating capital prudently\n\nOur priorities are to invest in the long-term growth and development of our business, while increasing shareholder returns and creating shared value. We take a disciplined approach to capital allocation, with prudent financial policies designed to strike the right balance between growth, returns and flexible access to financial markets.\n\nInvesting for the long term takes the form of R&D investment, brand support and capital expenditure to support organic profitable growth. We allocate these resources discerningly, focusing on projects with the highest potential to create economic profit. We are accelerating our capital expenditure plans for our fast-growing categories, particularly co/ffee and pet care.\n\nWe are disciplined when it comes to mergers and acquisitions in order to protect our Return on Invested Capital (ROIC). We have a thorough project governance in place, with clear accountability and targets. Potential acquisitions must have a good strategic and cultural fit with our organization and o/ffer attractive financial returns. We look for creative ways to structure transactions and build partnerships that enhance our strategic options.\n\nWe have demonstrated our commitment to maintaining a high level of reinvestment into the business while at the same time continually increasing capital returns to shareholders. We do this by increasing our dividend year after year. Based on our 2021 performance, the Board of Directors has proposed a dividend increase of 5 centimes to CHF/uni00A02.80 per share to be paid in April 2022. This will be our 27th consecutive annual dividend increase.

This purpose drives us to make a positive impact on the lives of people, pets and the planet - now and in the future.\n\n## Evolving our approach to creating shared value\n\nCreating Shared Value (CSV) has always been fundamental to the way we do business. We have long believed that our company can only be successful in the long term by creating value both for our shareholders and for society. For decades, our activities and products have aimed to make a positive di/fference to society and foster Nestl\u00e9's ongoing success.\n\nThis focus on shared value is more important than ever. The first-ever UN Food Systems Summit highlighted the need to transform food systems if society is to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). With only eight years left to meet the 2030 SDG deadline, Nestl\u00e9 is fully committed to helping accelerate the transformation toward equitable, net-zero emission and nature-positive food systems that can nourish the world.\n\n## Guided by materiality\n\nIn an ever-changing world, we know that stakeholder priorities are constantly evolving and that we must reevaluate our activities to continue to meet expectations. Every two years, we conduct a comprehensive materiality assessment based on stakeholder interviews to identify and prioritize the economic, social and environmental impacts that matter most to our business and stakeholders. The analysis helps guide where we focus internal resources and the areas covered in our reporting.\n\nWe are investing CHF/uni00A01.2/uni00A0billion by 2025 to help farmers adopt regenerative practices.\n\nThe assessment is fully integrated with Nestl\u00e9's Enterprise Risk Management process, to ensure wider sustainability impacts are incorporated into the risks and opportunities under consideration across the company. The financial review section has more information on the principal risks to our business.\n\nIn 2021, we tested the use of more data-driven insights to supplement the stakeholder interviews. We found that climate change and decarbonization still rank high globally, while water, human rights and responsible sourcing remain significant. We also confirmed that diversity and inclusion as well as biodiversity are increasingly important. All topics are covered in our Creating Shared Value and Sustainability Report .\n\nThis section covers the major material impacts identified in our materiality assessment. We cross-referenced these areas with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards for Processed Foods and Non-Alcoholic Beverages to ensure coverage of the topics most relevant to our investors. We plan to update our materiality assessment in full in 2022.\n\nRead our Creating Shared Value and Sustainability Report\n\n:\n\nwww.nestle.com/csv-report-2021 Read more about materiality on our website: www.nestle.com/materiality",

Our business was assessed as highly compliant in Mexico and the Philippines, the two countries where BMS manufacturers' marketing practices were assessed.\n\nEarlier in 2021, we published our response to the BMS Call to Action. Nestl\u00e9 unilaterally committed to stop the promotion of formulas for infants from birth to six months of age in all countries by end of 2022.\n\nWe are fully committed to transparency and publish our WHO Code compliance report annually on our website: www.nestle.com/compliance-record\n\nWe also continue to lead the industry in responsible marketing to children. The ATNI Global Index continues to recognize our policy on Marketing Communication to Children and our global response mechanism for correcting any non-compliances.\n\nIn July 2021, we endorsed the new International Food & Beverage Alliance (IFBA) commitment on responsible marketing, together with the Alliance's 10 other members.

In December 2021, we updated our Human Rights Framework based on the lessons learned over the last decade and to strengthen our focus on due diligence. Our next step is to publish action plans for each of our salient human rights issues.

This is why we made our net zero pledge. We have identified climate-related risks, including supply constraints; policy changes such as increased carbon taxes, land-use restrictions and agricultural subsidy shifts; and increased public concern a/ffecting our reputation.\n\nAs more than 70% of our direct and indirect GHG emissions occur in our agricultural supply chain, our primary focus is on the physical risks facing producers. Based on a decade of work, we are building robust mitigation and adaptation plans to improve supply chain resilience. Examples include our work on drought-resistant co/ffee varieties (see the Powdered and Liquid Beverages case study) and our investment in new technologies to increase dairy-farm e/fficiency while reducing emissions and improving animal welfare.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to apply the Taskforce on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework by assessing physical risks in our value chain over a longer time horizon. Details are available in our second TCFD report: www.nestle.com/tcfd-report. We also joined the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures working group in 2021, to advance the collective understanding of how to report on risks and dependencies related to the natural environment.\n\n## Tackling plastic pollution\n\nTackling plastic waste is an urgent priority and an issue we take seriously.

We are accelerating our plastic packaging reduction activities.\n\nNestl\u00e9 Philippines completed its first full year of plastic neutrality in 2021, having collected and co-processed more than 27,000 tonnes of plastic waste along with partners slightly more than the market produced in the same period.\n\nNestl\u00e9's 2021 Creating Shared Value (CSV) Prize rewarded five winners working to transform the future of waste and bring us closer to a circular economy. The overall winner was Promesa, a Mexico City-based social enterprise that works with schools across Latin America to educate youth about combatting the global waste challenge.\n\n## Improving water stewardship\n\nOur long-term success relies on sustainable access to water in the regions where we source ingredients, operate our factories and sell our products. Yet scientists predict that as our climate changes, almost half of watersheds will\n\nNestl\u00e9 Waters is working at a local level to help manage shared water challenges such as flood risks and water scarcity.\n\nreach their limit by 2050. As water is a shared resource, we can only address challenges in collaboration with local stakeholders. Our water business is leading the way with regeneration of water cycles.\n\nIn our supply chain, we are working with suppliers and farmers to increase resilience in areas that are water-scarce now, or that may become so due to climate change. We have already developed action plans tailored to the needs of specific crops, such as cereals, co/ffee, dairy, sugar and tomatoes, in high-priority regions and will work to incorporate water stewardship into our global regenerative agriculture program.\n\n## Advancing the regeneration of water cycles\n\nNestl\u00e9 Waters is investing CHF/uni00A0120/uni00A0million to assist the implementation of more than 100/uni00A0projects to help regenerate ecosystems in the areas around each of its bottling sites. As of 2025, these projects will help nature retain more water than the business uses in its operations.\n\nIn Buxton, a famous British spa town, we are partnering with local stakeholders to come up with practical, natural interventions to help prevent flooding. Our aim is to help retain more rainwater in the landscape so it does not rush into the river too rapidly and cause flooding. All interventions at Buxton also aim to increase biodiversity and carbon capture.",

From engaging the consumer through analytics to speeding up operations with artificial intelligence (AI), we are accelerating our digital transformation to drive growth and agility.\n\n## Leveraging connections\n\nConsumers today want access to goods and services their way, regardless of channel. They care about sustainability and health. And they expect brands to o/ffer personalized solutions in real time. To meet these needs, we are focusing our digitalization e/fforts in the following areas:\n\n- -Consumer-focused, channel-less digital ecosystems.\n- -Always-on analytics across the value chain.\n- -Connected operations for e/fficiency, sustainability and growth.\n- -Tracking progress on sustainability initiatives.\n\n## Creating channel-less ecosystems\n\nWe see enhancing digital capabilities as a key driver of our evolution. Across each of our categories, digital ecosystems are unlocking new avenues for insight, innovation and sustainable, profitable growth. Our digital-centric businesses are acting as lighthouses to transform our core brands.\n\nThe optimal consumer experience is just as important as the optimal product. Our strategy is to delight di/fferent audiences with the right experience and content optimized for every platform. We are focused on channel-less commerce, thinking together with our retail partners about the brand experience rather than individual channels.\n\nThrough the responsible use of data, we are identifying growth opportunities where we can develop and adapt products that meet consumer needs. We leverage data across our category ecosystems to drive tra/ffic and identify\n\nNestl\u00e9 partnered with Italian blogger and fashion designer Chiara Ferragni for a limited edition Nespresso x Chiara Ferragni collection and digital campaign.\n\nnew business opportunities. We seek growth across digital ecosystems, from partnerships with retailers to direct-to-consumer businesses such as Nespresso, Persona and Tails.com.\n\nStrong growth in pet care is an example of how digital connections to the consumer can be successfully leveraged through an ecosystem of products and services. The business has been on a journey of digital transformation, evolving from a pet food business to a pet care business. We acquired Wamiz , the pet adoption and advice platform, in 2018. Nestl\u00e9's majority stake in Tails.com is boosting\n\nour data and analytic capabilities. We are collaborating with scientists, veterinarians and pet care professionals to deliver advanced pet food solutions and first-class pet care services. Thanks to the momentum created by this network of partners, we are now an attractive partner of choice for start-ups through our Unleashed accelerator program.\n\nIn 2021, our e-commerce sales accounted for 14.3% of sales and grew by 15.1%. This strong growth reflects our agility in adapting quickly to rapidly evolving consumer demands. We expect to increase our investment in digital marketing by 50% and almost double the percentage of e-commerce by 2025.\n\n## Advancing always-on analytics\n\nQuick access to actionable data insights is key to understanding fast-changing consumer needs and optimizing our demand-generation activities, thus maximizing our resources. We are harnessing the power of data to streamline our business practices, becoming more strategic and predictive while making changes in real time. We continue to upgrade our analytics capabilities to measure the value of each consumer and customer touchpoint and the impact of every campaign. This allows us to make smarter, quicker decisions.\n\nBacked by powerful data models and algorithms, our AIpowered sales teams can increasingly optimize our sales prices and promotional activity. Smart identification of priority outlets and must-sell items allows for even better investment behind our brands. Our strategic revenue management program now covers 90% of our markets. This capability helps us to define go-to-market strategies and feeds the continuous evolution of brand value propositions, product formats and pricing structures. We are also leveraging AI with end-to-end analytics to deepen collaboration with customers, prioritize production and enhance promotion e/ffectiveness.",

Our digital media campaigns are supported by an expanded network of 35 content studios that e/fficiently deliver dynamic, high-quality personalized content.\n\n## Expanding connected operations\n\nTo delight our consumers, our teams in operations must master every step of the production process, from sourcing of materials to manufacturing in our factories, to the supply of our products at the point of purchase. At the same time, we are increasing our ability to tailor our products to our customers' specific needs.\n\nAll of this is made easier by innovative digital solutions and capabilities. We call it connected operations and have deployed the core technology to more than 100/uni00A0sites worldwide. All of our factories, not only the most advanced and modern, are benefitting from the changes.\n\nIt all starts with better connected workers, giving our people the tools and information to take the right decisions quickly and easily. AI and predictive analytics enable the delivery of consistently exceptional quality and zero breakdowns, while collaborative robotics support factory automation and end-of-line customization. That gives us a new level of flexibility to produce for di/fferent channels and routes to market.\n\nConnected transport hubs have better visibility and are able to plan deliveries more reliably and sustainably. Real-time tracking of trucks in transport hubs allows for fast rerouting in case of problems, less waiting time and fewer wasted truck miles.\n\nSince 2017, Nestl\u00e9's in-house content studios have grown from 5 to 35/uni00A0across all markets, consolidating the creation of original brand content for all digital channels.\n\nConnected operations is helping us to act more as one team across all functions with complete visibility of the entire process from start to finish. By breaking down silos we are closer to our colleagues, suppliers, customers and consumers. Changes in demand or challenges in the supply chain are visible in real time so we can adapt fast in the most coordinated and e/ffective way. This gives us a competitive advantage.\n\n## Supporting sustainability\n\nDigitalization not only supports e/fficiency and growth, it also helps enable our sustainability agenda. To that end we continue to deploy systems\n\nand tools to monitor our progress with increased accuracy, through better primary data and improved calculations, in areas such as sustainable packaging, responsible sourcing, climate change and water management.\n\nOur work with partners to test and deploy technology solutions in our upstream supply chains continued in 2021. This supports transparency by improving end-to-end traceability and substantiating sustainability claims. With our partner OpenSC, alongside farmers and suppliers in Congo, we designed a technology blueprint for end-to-end co/ffee traceability using smart devices and QR codes. We also tested methods to monitor and verify certain sustainability aspects of our supply chains, such as farmer's income, through mobile money.",

They include among others:\n\n- -Organic growth, Real internal growth and Pricing;\n- -Underlying trading operating profit margin and Trading operating profit margin;\n- -Net financial debt;\n- -Free cash flow; and\n- -Underlying earnings per share (EPS) and EPS in constant currency.\n\nManagement believes that these non-IFRS financial performance measures provide useful information regarding the Group's financial and operating performance.\n\nThe Alternative Performance Measures document published under www.nestle.com/investors/publications defines these non-IFRS financial performance measures.\n\nOperating segments 2020 comparative figures have been restated following the disclosure of Nestl\u00e9 Health Science and Nespresso as standalone reportable segments from 2021 onwards (previously combined and presented in Other businesses - see Note 3 of the 2021 Consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn 2021, we remained focused on executing our long-term strategy and stepping up growth investments, while at the same time navigating global supply chain challenges. Our organic growth was strong, with broad-based market share gains, following disciplined execution, rapid innovation and increased digitalization. We limited the impact of exceptional cost inflation through diligent cost management and responsible pricing. Our robust underlying earnings per share growth shows the resilience of our value creation model. The entire Nestl\u00e9 team demonstrated exemplary perseverance and agility in a challenging environment.\n\nThe evolution of our portfolio continued, focusing on categories with attractive growth opportunities and di/fferentiated o/fferings. Recent examples include the acquisition of the core brands of The Bountiful Company and the divestiture of the mainstream water brands in North America.\n\nOur sustainability agenda further progressed as we enhance the well-being of our consumers, help regenerate the environment and strengthen the farming communities in our supply chains.\n\nWe continued to create value for our shareholders through disciplined capital allocation, steadily increasing dividends and significant share buybacks. Going forward, we are confident in the strength of our value creation model.\n\n## Group sales\n\nOrganic growth was 7.5%, with RIG of 5.5%. Pricing increased to 2.0%, reaching 3.1% in the fourth quarter, to o/ffset significant cost inflation.\n\nGrowth was broad-based across most geographies and categories. Organic growth reached 7.2% in developed markets, the highest level in more than a decade, based mostly on RIG with positive pricing. Organic growth in emerging markets was 7.8%, with robust RIG and positive pricing.\n\nBy product category, the largest contributor to organic growth was co/ffee, fueled by strong momentum for the three main brands Nescaf\u00e9 , Nespresso and Starbucks. Sales of Starbucks products grew by 17.1% to reach CHF/uni00A03.1/uni00A0billion, generating over CHF/uni00A01/uni00A0billion of incremental sales compared with 2018. Purina PetCare posted double-digit growth, led",

Prepared dishes and cooking aids reported high single-digit growth, based on strong sales developments for Maggi , Stou/ffer's and Lean/uni00A0Cuisine . Sales in vegetarian and plantbased food grew at a double-digit rate, reaching around CHF/uni00A0800/uni00A0million. Nestl\u00e9 Health Science recorded doubledigit growth, reflecting strong demand for vitamins, minerals and supplements, as well as healthy-aging products. Dairy saw mid single-digit growth, based on strong demand for premium and fortified milks, co/ffee creamers and ice cream. Sales in confectionery grew at a high singledigit rate, supported by a strong sales development for KitKat and gifting products. Water posted high singledigit growth, driven by premium brands and a recovery in out-of-home channels. Infant Nutrition reported negative growth, impacted by a sales decline in China and lower birth rates globally. Sales of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) products continued to see robust growth, reaching CHF/uni00A01.2/uni00A0billion.\n\nBy channel, organic growth in retail sales was 6.4%. E-commerce sales grew by 15.1%, reaching 14.3% of total Group sales, with strong momentum in most categories, particularly Purina PetCare, co/ffee and Nestl\u00e9 Health Science. Organic growth in out-of-home channels reached 24.5%, helped by a low base of comparison due to the pandemic.\n\nNet divestitures decreased sales by 2.9%, largely related to the Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America, Yinlu and Herta transactions. Divestitures were partially o/ffset by acquisitions, including the core brands of The Bountiful Company and Freshly. The negative impact on sales from foreign exchange moderated to 1.3%.

The underlying trading operating profit margin decreased by 30/uni00A0basis points to 17.4% in constant currency and on a reported basis, reflecting time delays between cost inflation and pricing actions. The one-o/ff integration costs related to the acquisition of The Bountiful Company's core brands had a negative impact of around 10/uni00A0basis points.\n\nGross margin decreased by 130/uni00A0basis points to 47.8%, reflecting significant broad-based inflation for commodity, packaging, freight and energy costs. The impact of cost inflation, which increased strongly in the second half, was partly o/ffset by price increases, operating leverage and e/fficiencies.\n\nDistribution costs as a percentage of sales decreased by 20/uni00A0basis points, mainly as a result of the disposal of the Nestl\u00e9 Water brands in North America.\n\nMarketing and administration expenses decreased as a percentage of sales by 80/uni00A0basis points, based on strong operating leverage and e/fficiencies. At the same time, the Group continued to invest for growth and increased its consumer-facing marketing expenses in constant currency.\n\nRestructuring expenses and net other trading items increased by CHF/uni00A02.3/uni00A0billion to CHF/uni00A03.0/uni00A0billion, largely reflecting impairments related to the Wyeth business.

In the context of significant supply chain disruptions, the Group increased its inventory levels temporarily. Free cash flow decreased from CHF/uni00A010.2/uni00A0billion to CHF/uni00A08.7/uni00A0billion, mainly due to a temporary increase in capital expenditure to meet strong volume demand, particularly for Purina PetCare and co/ffee.\n\n## Evolution of the Nestl\u00e9 S.A. share in 2021\n\nIn CHF\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Nestl\u00e9 S.A. share\n- Nestl\u00e9 relative to Swiss Market Index\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Share capital by investor type, long-term evolution (a)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (a) Percentage derived from total number of registered shares.

We aim to create long-term value through a balance of sustainable growth and resource e/fficiency. Our culture and values - rooted in respect for ourselves, others, diversity and the future - guide our decisions and actions. Our Creating Shared Value approach helps to prioritize those areas that maximize value creation for shareholders and cultivate positive societal and environmental impacts.\n\nThe Nestl\u00e9 Group Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework is designed to assess and mitigate risks in order to minimize their potential impact and support the achievement of Nestl\u00e9's long-term purpose and business strategy. A top-down assessment is performed at Grouplevel once a year. A bottom-up assessment occurs in parallel, resulting in aggregation of the individual market assessments. This creates a good understanding of the company's key risks in order to allocate ownership to drive specific actions around them and take any relevant steps to address them.\n\nAdditionally, Nestl\u00e9 engages with external stakeholders to better understand the issues that are of most concern to them. The materiality assessment (www.nestle.com/ materiality) rates the degree of external stakeholder concern and potential business impact. This helps to ensure that wider sustainability issues are incorporated into the risks and opportunities under consideration across the company.\n\nRisk assessments and any mitigating actions are the responsibility of the individual line management. If Group-level intervention is required, responsibility for mitigating actions will generally be determined by the Executive Board. The annual Group risk assessment is reported annually to the Executive Board, Audit Committee and Board of Directors. Further detail of the ERM processes can be found in the Corporate Governance Report 2021 .\n\nWe are committed to transparency and action on climaterelated risks and opportunities. As such, we have aligned our reporting disclosures with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Our TCFD-aligned disclosures, including our analysis undertaken in 2021, can be found on www.nestle.com/tcfdreport.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences continue to lead to profound changes on operating environments\n\nacross our markets. The long-term impacts remain di/fficult to predict. The Group assessed the potential impacts of the pandemic and its consequences across our risk universe and the factors are reported under the relevant risks disclosed here. The Group continues to monitor and respond to these areas of increased risk for any material changes.\n\nThe risks listed below are considered the most relevant for our business and performance. Many of the long-term mitigation strategies are expanded on in our Creating Shared Value and Sustainability Report .",

We continue to balance the pursuit of top-line and bottom-line growth with capital e/fficiency. Our science- and consumer-driven innovations meet fast-changing consumer needs. At the same time, we use our scale, resources and expertise to create shared value for all our stakeholders.\n\nIn 2021, we set forth our plans to support and accelerate the transition to regenerative food systems to protect and restore the environment, improve the livelihoods of farmers and enhance the well-being of farming communities. This engagement ties in with our prior commitments and our company purpose to unlock the power of food to enhance quality of life for everyone, today and for generations to come.\n\nWe also continue our engagement on climate action, aiming to halve our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050. At the 2021 Annual General Meeting, our shareholders strongly supported our detailed Net Zero Roadmap.\n\nOur diverse Board of Directors is engaged to oversee the direction of our company. Since 2015, we have strengthened the Board through eleven new independent directors with diverse experience and expertise directly relevant to Nestl\u00e9, for example, with respect to food systems, food and beverage, digitalization and other topics.\n\nWe continue to engage with our shareholders through our roadshows, investor meetings and analyst calls. Our Chairman's Roundtables took place virtually with investors in Asia, the Middle East, North America, Switzerland, Germany, the UK, France and the Netherlands.\n\nIn 2021, our Board created a separate, dedicated Sustainability Committee to advise on all aspects of our environmental and social sustainability. In particular, the Sustainability Committee oversees our response to climate change, our human rights due diligence program, and our strategies for diversity and inclusion.\n\nOur Chair's and Corporate Governance Committee regularly reviews aspects of our governance, as well as our asset and liability management and other risk management topics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Nomination Committee, chaired by our Lead Independent Director, evaluates Board composition, performance, structure and succession planning. It assesses candidates for nomination to the Board.\n\nOur Compensation Committee ensures alignment of our remuneration systems with our values, strategies and performance. In 2021, it implemented a set of ESG-related KPIs for the Executive Board.\n\nOur Audit Committee oversees internal and external audit, financial reporting, internal controls, compliance and risk management. It reviews reports regarding compliance, fraud, enterprise risk management and the Group's annual risk assessment.\n\nWe recognize that for our company to be successful over time and create sustainable value for shareholders, we must also create value for society. Our governance helps us strike the right balance in our pursuit of long-term, sustainable value creation.",

Our commitments to ethics, integrity, fairness and authenticity are enshrined in our Purpose and Values, the Corporate Business Principles and the Nestl\u00e9 Code of Business Conduct . Our comprehensive Compliance Management System helps our employees and managers do the right thing for the right reason, while protecting and strengthening Nestl\u00e9's reputation.\n\nOur Board of Directors and our Executive Board oversee and promote good practices throughout the company. Line management is supported by our dedicated Corporate Compliance function, which provides guidance and functional leadership, as well as by all other functions engaged in our risk- and principles-based Compliance program. Our Group Compliance Committee ensures a continuous evolution of our Integrated Assurance Framework. Market Compliance O/fficers and Committees ensure a consistent approach across the Group and help identify local compliance priorities.\n\nIn 2021, a significant increase in the number of mandatory trainings on topics such as the Corporate Business Principles or the Nestl\u00e9 Code of Business Conduct was achieved. During the year more than 900/uni00A0000/uni00A0modules were completed.\n\nOur IT Roadmap enables compliance through new automated tools. This facilitates an e/ffective management of our Compliance Management System.\n\nWe monitor compliance through our corporate functions, our internal audit function and our external auditors. Through our CARE program, we regularly assess specific aspects of our social compliance with the help of independent external auditors. A new cycle started in 2021, with a renewed focus on human rights.\n\nIn 2021, we launched our new single reporting channel for non-compliance concerns and questions, Speak Up, which replaces the internal IRS reporting system and the external Tell Us system. This system is independently operated by a third party to ensure confidentiality. It allowed us to address 2475/uni00A0concerns from employees and external stakeholders. All complaints are investigated and remedial actions taken as needed. Trend analysis enables us to focus on monitoring key risks, the quality of consequence management decisions and the improvement action plans. Substantiated complaints\n\nhelped us address issues such as abuse of power and/or mobbing/bullying, labor practices, discrimination and harassment, sexual harassment, fraud and non-compliance with the WHO Code. 133/uni00A0employees had to leave our company and 6/uni00A0service providers were terminated as a result of non-compliance incidents.\n\nOur Compliance culture helps in creating sustainable value for all our stakeholders and making Nestl\u00e9 a force for good.",
