Organization of the Siemens Group and basis of presentation\n\nSiemens is a technology group that is active in nearly all countries of the world, focusing on the areas of automation and digitalization in the process and manufacturing industries, intelligent infrastructure for buildings and distributed energy systems, smart mobility solutions for rail and road and medical technology and digital healthcare services.\n\nSiemens comprises Siemens Aktiengesellschaft (Siemens AG), a stock corporation under the Federal laws of Germany, as the parent company, and its subsidiaries. Our Company is incorporated in Germany, with our corporate headquarters situated in Munich. As of September 30, 2021, Siemens had around 303,000 employees.\n\nAs  of  September  30,  2021,  Siemens  has  the  following  reportable  segments: Digital  Industries , Smart  Infrastructure , Mobility and Siemens Healthineers , which together form our 'Industrial Business' and Siemens Financial Services (SFS), which supports the activities of our industrial businesses and also conducts its own business with external customers. Furthermore, we report results for Portfolio Companies , which comprises businesses that are managed separately to improve their performance.\n\nOur reportable segments and Portfolio Companies may do business with each other, leading to corresponding orders and revenue. Such orders and revenue are eliminated on the Group level.\n\n## Non-financial matters of the Group and Siemens AG\n\nSiemens has policies for environmental, employee and social matters, for the respect of human rights, and anti-corruption and bribery matters, among others. Our business model is described in chapters 1 and 3 of this Combined Management Report. Reportable information that is necessary for an understanding of the development, performance, position and the impact of our activities on these matters is included  in  this  Combined  Management  Report,  in  particular  in  chapters  3  through  7.  Forward-looking  information,  including  risk disclosures,  is  presented  in  chapter  8.  Chapter  9  includes  additional  information  that  is  required  to  be  reported  in  the  Combined Management Report related to the parent company Siemens AG. As supplementary information, amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial  Statements  and  the  Annual  Financial  Statements  of  Siemens  AG  related  to  such  non-financial  matters,  and  additional explanations thereto, are included in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2021, Notes 17, 18, 22, 26 and 27, and in the Notes to the Annual Financial Statements for fiscal 2021, Notes 16, 17, 20, 21 and 25. In order to inform the users of the financial reports in a focused manner, these disclosures are not subject to a specific non-financial framework - in contrast to the disclosures in our separate 'Sustainability  Report  2021'  document,  which  are  based  on  the  standards  developed  by  the  Global  Reporting  Initiative  (GRI).  Said document also includes detailed information on DEGREE, Siemens' new sustainability framework which was introduced during fiscal 2021. With DEGREE, Siemens intends to manage and track its progress on selected ambitions in the environmental, social and governance areas.",

        "page_content": "## 2. Financial performance system\n\n## 2.1 Overview\n\nThe Siemens Financial Framework includes targets that we aim to achieve over a cycle of three to five years. During fiscal 2021, we modified this framework. The resulting changes became effective starting with fiscal 2022.\n\n## 2.2 Revenue growth\n\nIn the Siemens Financial Framework, up to and including fiscal 2021, we aimed to achieve a revenue growth range of 4% to 5% per year on a comparable basis.\n\nOur primary measure for managing and controlling our revenue growth is comparable growth, because it shows the development in our business net of currency translation effects, which arise from the external environment outside of our control, and portfolio effects, which involve business activities which are either new to or no longer a part of the respective business.\n\nCurrency translation effects are the difference between revenue for the current period calculated using the exchange rates of the current period and revenue for the current period calculated using the exchange rates of the comparison period. For calculating the percentage change year-over-year, this absolute difference is divided by revenue for the comparison period. A portfolio effect arises in the case of an acquisition  or  a  disposition  and  is  calculated  as  the  change  year-over-year  in  revenue  related  to  the  transaction.  For  calculating  the percentage change, this absolute change is divided by revenue for the comparison period. Any portfolio effect is excluded for the 12 months following the relevant transaction after which both current and past reporting periods fully reflect the portfolio change. For orders, we apply the same calculations for currency translation and portfolio effects as described above.\n\nUnder the modified framework, we aim to achieve comparable revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7% per year over a cycle of three to five years.\n\n## 2.3 Profitability and capital efficiency\n\nWithin the Siemens Financial Framework, we aim to achieve margins that are comparable to those of our relevant competitors. Therefore, we have defined profit margin ranges for our industrial businesses which also consider the profit margins of their respective relevant competitors. Profit margin is defined as profit of the respective business divided by its revenue.\n\nFor  our  industrial  businesses,  in  fiscal  2021  profit  represented  EBITA  adjusted  for  operating  financial  income  (expenses),  net,  and amortization of intangible assets not acquired in business combinations (Adjusted EBITA).\n\nThe margin ranges for our industrial businesses were as follows:\n\n## Margin ranges until fiscal 2021\n\n|                                            | Margin range   |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Digital Industries                         | 17 - 23%       |\n| Smart Infrastructure                       | 10 - 15%       |\n| Mobility                                   | 9 - 12%        |\n| Siemens Healthineers                       | 17 - 21%       |\n| Industrial Business                        | 11 - 15%       |\n| Siemens Financial Services (ROE after tax) | 17 - 22%       |\n\nBeginning with fiscal 2022, the profit definition no longer adjusts EBITA for operating financial income (expenses), net to present a more transparent view on operating earnings. Operating financial income, net for Industrial Business was \u20ac23 million in fiscal 2021, without a change to the reported margin.\n\nThe margin ranges were set as follows:\n\n## Margin ranges from fiscal 2022\n\n|                                            | Margin range   |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Digital Industries                         | 17 - 23%       |\n| Smart Infrastructure                       | 11 - 16%       |\n| Mobility                                   | 10 - 13%       |\n| Siemens Healthineers                       | 17 - 21%       |\n| Siemens Financial Services (ROE after tax) | 15 - 20%       |\n\nFor Siemens Healthineers, we present the margin range we expect as that company's majority shareholder.\n\nIn line with common practice in the financial services business, our financial indicator for measuring capital efficiency at Siemens Financial Services is return on equity after tax, or ROE after tax. ROE is defined as Siemens Financial Services' profit after tax, divided by its average allocated equity.\n\nFor purposes of managing and controlling profit and profitability at the Group level, we use net income as our primary measure. This measure is the primary driver of basic earnings per share from net income (EPS).",

        "page_content": "Beginning  with  fiscal  2022,  we  will  in  addition  report  EPS  before  purchase  price  allocation  accounting  (EPS  pre  PPA)  to  increase transparency regarding our operating performance. EPS pre PPA is defined as basic earnings per share from net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and related income taxes. Like for EPS, EPS pre PPA includes the amounts attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG. We aim to achieve high-single-digit annual growth in EPS pre PPA over a cycle of three to five years. EPS pre PPA for fiscal 2021 was \u20ac8.32.\n\nWe seek to work profitably and as efficiently as possible with the capital provided by our shareholders and lenders. For purposes of managing and controlling our capital efficiency, we use return on capital employed, or ROCE, as our primary measure in our Siemens Financial Framework.\n\nBeginning with fiscal 2022, ROCE excludes defined acquisition-related effects for Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (Varian), which was acquired by Siemens Healthineers in fiscal 2021, to further increase the transparency on our operating performance. Our goal is to achieve a ROCE within a range of 15% to 20% over a cycle of three to five years.\n\n## 2.4 Capital structure\n\nSustainable  revenue  and  profit  development  is  supported  by  a  healthy  capital  structure.  Accordingly,  a  key  consideration  within  the Siemens Financial Framework is to maintain ready access to the capital markets through various debt products and preserve our ability to repay and service our debt obligations over time. Our primary measure for managing and controlling our capital structure is the ratio of Industrial net debt to EBITDA (continuing operations). This financial measure indicates the approximate amount of time in years that would be  needed  to  cover  Industrial  net  debt  through  income  from  continuing  operations,  without  taking  into  account  interest,  taxes, depreciation and amortization. In fiscal 2021, we aimed to achieve a ratio of up to 1.0. Beginning with fiscal 2022, this ratio was raised to up to 1.5.\n\n## 2.5 Liquidity and dividend\n\nWe intend to continue providing an attractive return to our shareholders under the Siemens Financial Framework. Beginning with fiscal 2022, this includes striving for a dividend per share that exceeds the amount of the preceding year, or that at least matches the prior-yearlevel.\n\nAs in the past, we intend to fund the dividend payout from Free cash flow. To provide an assessment of our ability to generate cash, and ultimately to pay dividends, in fiscal 2021 we used the cash conversion rate of Industrial Business, defined as the ratio of Free cash flow from  Industrial  Business  to  Adjusted  EBITA  Industrial  Business.  Because  growth  requires  investments,  we  aimed  to  achieve  a  cash conversion rate of 1 minus the annual comparable revenue growth rate of Industrial Business.\n\nBeginning with fiscal 2022, we use the cash conversion rate for the Siemens Group to reinforce our commitment to cash generation on a Group level. It is defined as the ratio of Free cash flow (continuing and discontinued operations) to Net income. We aim to achieve a cash conversion rate of 1 minus the annual comparable revenue growth rate for the Group over a cycle of three to five years.\n\nAt the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Managing Board, in agreement with the Supervisory Board, will submit the following proposal to allocate the unappropriated net income of Siemens AG for fiscal 2021: to distribute a dividend of \u20ac4.00 on each share of no par value entitled to the dividend for fiscal 2021 existing at the date of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting; the remaining amount is to be carried forward. Payment of the proposed dividend is contingent upon approval by Siemens shareholders at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 10, 2022. The prior-year dividend was \u20ac3.50 per share.\n\n## 2.6 Calculation of return on capital employed\n\n## Calculation of ROCE\n\n|                                                                                        | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                                                     | 2021          | 2020          |\n| Net income                                                                             | 6,697         | 4,200         |\n| Less: Other interest expenses/income, net 1                                            | (769)         | (692)         |\n| Plus: SFS Other interest expenses/income                                               | 842           | 806           |\n| Plus: Net interest expenses related to provisions for pensions and similar obligations | 53            | 66            |\n| Less: Interest adjustments (discontinued operations)                                   | (11)          | 100           |\n| Less: Taxes on interest adjustments (tax rate (flat) 30%)                              | (34)          | (84)          |\n| (I) Income before interest after tax                                                   | 6,778         | 4,397         |\n| (II) Average capital employed                                                          | 51,723        | 56,190        |\n| (I) / (II) ROCE                                                                        | 13.1%         | 7.8%          |\n\n\u00b9\n\nItem Other interest expenses/income, net primarily consists of interest relating to corporate debt, and related hedging activities, as well as interest income on corporate assets.",

        "page_content": "## 3. Segment information\n\n## 3.1 Overall economic conditions\n\nThe global economic development in fiscal 2021 was still dominated by the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) and its many repercussions. After the recession in calendar 2020, in which global gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 3.4%, calendar 2021 is expected to show a very strong rebound with global GDP increasing by 5.5%.\n\nGlobal  economic activity  expanded at  very  high  rates  in  the  third  quarter  of  calendar  2020  after  the  first  wave  of  COVID-19  ebbed. Subsequent infection waves in winter months caused fears of a new global recession. But economic activity had already adapted to the pandemic and was supported by massive stimulus programs, especially in Europe and the U.S. Globally, governments allocated nearly USD 11 trillion in stimulus programs and more than USD 6 trillion in liquidity support to businesses and households in response to the pandemic. Central banks gave support with expansionary measures, in particular new quantitative easing programs, while short-term interest rates were at or near zero. Accordingly, the global economy continued to expand also in the fourth quarter of calendar 2020 and the first quarter of calendar 2021, despite renewed outbreaks and lockdowns. In December 2020, the first countries approved new COVID-19 vaccines, which were developed in a very short time and which are of paramount importance in order to solve the health crisis and economic challenges.\n\nHowever, momentum again weakened in the first half of calendar 2021, due to increasing infections in many countries. The new Delta variant was more contagious than previous virus strains. Vaccine roll-out could not keep up with the spread of this new variant, especially in emerging countries. In addition, supply disruptions, which were both caused and magnified by the pandemic, impaired the recovery. Bottlenecks had impacts across the value chains from raw materials to high tech goods, especially semiconductors, and were exemplified by extraordinary disruptions in global logistics systems. In addition, many companies were surprised by the strong recovery and high demand for goods which often exceeded their production plans and short-term capacity. The extraordinarily high demand for goods was caused  by  consumers  with  high  excess  savings  and  limited  spending  alternatives  as  many  service  offerings  were  still  not  available ('services-to-products  shift').  Limited  supply,  logistics  bottlenecks  and  record  high  consumer  demand  for  goods  caused  substantial increases of producer prices for many products, which partly translated to an increase of general inflation. In addition, energy prices increased, and base effects from reduced 2020 price levels as well as temporary effects (e.g. provisional changes in taxation) contributed to the elevated rate of inflation.\n\nThe Chinese economy - with the world's largest manufacturing sector - benefited particularly from the high global demand for goods and is expected to grow by 8.2% in calendar 2021. However, tensions in the property sector and energy shortages weighed on economic activity in the second half of calendar 2021.\n\nOverall, the other major economies have experienced very strong economic rebounds and GDP is expected to grow strongly in calendar 2021: European Union (EU) 5.0%, U.S. 5.4%, Japan 2.3%, India 7.7%. For advanced countries in aggregate, calendar 2021 GDP is expected to expand by 4.9%. For emerging markets, the increase in calendar 2021 GDP is estimated at 6.4%.\n\nThe partly estimated figures presented here for GDP are based on an IHS Markit report dated October 15, 2021.\n\n## 3.2 Digital Industries\n\nDigital Industries offers a comprehensive product portfolio and system solutions for automation used in discrete and process industries; these  offerings  include  automation  systems  and  software  for  factories,  numerical  control  systems,  motors,  drives  and  inverters  and integrated automation systems for machine tools and production machines. Digital Industries also provides process control systems, machine-to-machine communication products, sensors (for measuring pressure, temperature, level, flow rate, distance or shape) and radio  frequency  identification  systems.  Furthermore,  Digital  Industries  offers  production  and  product  lifecycle  management  (PLM) software,  and  software  for  simulation  and  testing  of  mechatronic  systems.  These  leading  software  offerings  are  integrated  with  an electronic design automation (EDA) software portfolio, and the open, cloud-based industrial internet of things (IIoT) operating system MindSphere, which connects machines and physical infrastructure to the digital world. All these software offerings are complemented by the Mendix cloud-native low-code application development platform, which allows customers to significantly reduce app development times through visual representation of underlying code. Digital Industries also provides customers with lifecycle and data-driven services. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, Digital Industries' stake in Bentley Systems, Inc. (Bentley) was transferred to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. In August 2021, Digital Industries closed the acquisition of Supplyframe, Inc. (Supplyframe), a marketplace for the global electronics value chain, to significantly strengthen and accelerate growth of its offerings in digital marketplaces. For further information on the acquisition see Note 3 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2021.\n\nTaken together, Digital Industries' offerings enable customers to optimize entire value chains from product design and development through production and post-sale services. With its advanced software solutions in particular, Digital Industries supports customers in their evolution towards the 'Digital Enterprise,' resulting in increased flexibility and efficiency of production processes and reduced time to market for new products. The most important markets include the automotive industry, the machine building industry, the pharmaceutical and chemicals industry, the food and beverage industry and the electronics and semiconductor industry. Digital Industries serves its customers through a common regional sales organization spanning all its businesses, using various sales channels depending on the type of customer and industry and also enhancing customer choice across all channels. Changes in customer demand, especially for standard products, are driven strongly by macroeconomic cycles, and can lead to significant short-term fluctuation in Digital Industries' profitability. Volume from large contracts in the software business, particularly for EDA, may also result in strong fluctuations in quarterly volume and profitability. Starting in fiscal 2022, Digital Industries intends to transition parts of its software business, particularly PLM, from largely upfront revenue recognition towards Software as a Service (SaaS), which yields more predictable recurring revenue and offers growth opportunities by opening access to new customers, especially small and medium-sized companies seeking to reduce costs associated with owning complex IT infrastructure. During the transition, Digital Industries expects impacts on revenue growth rates and profit margin development  in  the  software  business.  Competition  with  Digital  Industries'  business  activities  comes  primarily  from  multinational corporations that offer a relatively broad portfolio and from smaller companies active only in certain geographic or product markets.",

        "page_content": "Digital Industries sees three trends influencing its business and providing long-term growth opportunities. Producers of investment goods in today's increasingly digital environment must modernize their production capacity, particularly to increase production flexibility and reduce time to market. This environment also spurs producers to complement their core products with vertical solutions and service offerings, which their customers either need or want in order to take full advantage of the investment goods. Finally, there is a trend from globalization to regionalization, to support local economic development or to better adapt solutions to local needs. This is increasingly accompanied by more differentiated regulatory requirements.\n\nResearch & Development (R&D) activities at Digital Industries are aimed at providing its customers with solutions that allow them to exploit  the  potential  of  data  in  their  businesses  and  to  combine  the  real  and  the  digital  worlds.  Digital  Industries  is  developing  and integrating technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), edge computing, cloud technologies, additive manufacturing and industrial 5G wireless technology. For example, Digital Industries cooperated with Schaeffler Group by combining its IIoT platform Sidrive IQ, which augments drive systems with AI-based analytics and digital content, with Schaeffler's products and services in the area of designing, manufacturing, and servicing bearings. Digital Industries introduced a new Industrial Edge Management system with which users can remotely monitor the status of every connected device and remotely install edge apps and software functions on distributed edge devices. Also in fiscal 2021, Digital Industries announced a cooperation with Google Cloud which aims at the integration of factory automation systems from Digital Industries with Google's data cloud, AI and machine learning technologies. In the field of additive manufacturing, Digital Industries worked with EOS and DyeMansion to present the first virtual additive manufacturing reference factory for selective laser sintering and industrial post-processing. During the 2021 Hanover Fair, Digital Industries demonstrated its first industrial 5G router and set up a private 5G campus network with a focus on industrial use cases such as automated guided vehicles, augmented reality, and autonomous mobile robots. Major investments of Digital Industries in fiscal 2021 relate to its own factory automation, motion control and process automation businesses, to further automate and digitalize facilities particularly in Germany, China and the Czech Republic.\n\n|                            | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   | % Change   | % Change   |\n|----------------------------|---------------|---------------|------------|------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)         | 2021          | 2020          | Actual     | Comp.      |\n| Orders                     | 18,427        | 15,896        | 16%        | 18%        |\n| Revenue                    | 16,514        | 14,997        | 10%        | 13%        |\n| therein: software business | 4,290         | 4,144         | 4%         | 7%         |\n| Adjusted EBITA             | 3,362         | 3,252         | 3%         |            |\n| Adjusted EBITA margin      | 20.4%         | 21.7%         |            |            |\n\nSignificant order growth  for  Digital  Industries  was  driven  by  the  automation  businesses,  particularly  factory  automation  and  motion control, on a recovery of their most important customer industries such as the automotive and machine building industries, which a year earlier were strongly impacted by effects related to COVID-19. Orders in the software business came in lower compared to fiscal 2020, which included a sharply higher volume from large orders, most notably in the EDA business. Revenue rose in all businesses, including significant growth contributions from the factory automation and motion control businesses and successful mitigation of supply chain risks primarily associated with electronics components. On a geographic basis, order and revenue were up in all regions with growth mainly  driven  by  the  region  Asia,  Australia,  due  primarily  to  substantial  increases  in  China,  and  the  region  comprising  Europe, Commonwealth of Independent States (C.I.S.), Africa, Middle East, including a strong growth contribution from Germany. Adjusted EBITA rose moderately even though the prior fiscal year included a \u20ac767 million positive effect related to Digital Industries' former stake in Bentley. The effect resulted mainly from revaluation of the stake following Bentley's public listing. Excluding this effect, Adjusted EBITA rose on double-digit increases in all businesses and improved profitability compared to the prior fiscal year, with the strongest growth contributions coming from the factory automation and motion control businesses. Adjusted EBITA improved also from successful execution of the cost structure improvement program in prior periods, which strengthened current profitability. Furthermore, severance charges, which resulted primarily from the ongoing program, fell substantially to \u20ac114 million from \u20ac210 million in the prior year. During the first half of fiscal 2021, Adjusted EBITA development benefited from expense reductions year-over-year related to COVID-19 restrictions, such as lower travel and marketing expenses. Digital Industries' order backlog was \u20ac7 billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which \u20ac6 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2022.\n\nIn fiscal 2021 the market environment for Digital Industries improved strongly as global manufacturing production recovered throughout the fiscal year from burdens related to COVID-19, which were most noticeable in the second and third quarter a year earlier. The rebound was faster and stronger than assumed and led to constraints in global value chains over the course of the fiscal year. The main driver of the upswing was China where the growth dynamic was extremely strong in the first half of the fiscal year. Other countries followed with a delay of around three to six months, but their recovery was less pronounced than in China resulting in moderate growth in the regions Americas and Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East. Discrete industries recovered particularly quickly and strongly, benefiting in part from restocking effects, while recovery in the more project-related process industries was delayed. The automotive industry started strongly into fiscal 2021, but the recovery was held back by supply chain constraints which impacted production especially in the second half of the fiscal year. This led to slowing or even limited contraction of production during the last months of the fiscal year. The machine building industry also recovered faster than expected, with the recovery starting in China and benefiting from demand for general investment goods.  This  development  was  evident  in  demand  for  automation  equipment  which  in  addition  benefited  from  the  trend  towards digitalization  and  from  stock-building  effects  to  mitigate  risks  from  supply  chain  constraints.  The  pharmaceutical  and  the  chemicals industries expanded during the entire fiscal year. While the pharmaceuticals industry benefited from COVID-19 vaccine demand among other factors, the chemicals industry steadily improved in line with the overall economic recovery. The development in the food and beverage  industry  followed  a  similar  pattern  and  grew  steadily  throughout  the  fiscal  year.  Global  production  of  electronics  and semiconductors was not held back by effects related to COVID-19, and experienced strong growth during fiscal 2021. However, market shifts within the semiconductor industry led to global shortages of semiconductors for certain customer segments that grew worse through the fiscal year and increasingly affected the automotive and machine building industries. In addition, supply constraints for plastics, metals and freight delivery impacted Digital Industries' market environment. Price increases affected all markets and were stronger than usually experienced during periods of economic rebound. While prices started to surge in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 mainly in the raw material sector  (e.  g.  copper),  they  spread  further  to  intermediate  goods  and  to  all  markets,  including  electrical  equipment,  in  the  following",

Digital Industries expects its primary markets, as described above, to show clear growth in fiscal 2022, with somewhat diminished momentum compared to fiscal 2021 and more geographic balance among the three reporting regions.\n\n## 3.3 Smart Infrastructure\n\nSmart Infrastructure offers products, systems, solutions, services and software to support a sustainable transition in energy generation sources, from fossil to renewable and a transition to smarter, more sustainable buildings and communities. This versatile portfolio is structured into three businesses: buildings, electrification and electrical products. The buildings business addresses the needs of operators, owners, occupants and users of buildings. It spans integrated building management systems and software; heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) controls; fire safety and security products and systems; and solutions and services such as energy and performance services. The electrification business makes grids more resilient, flexible and efficient. Its offerings cover grid simulation, operation and control software; substation automation and protection; medium-voltage primary and secondary switchgear (including SF6-free mediumvoltage  switchgear);  and  low-voltage  switchboards  and  eMobility  charging  infrastructure.  The  electrical  products  business  supplies electrification  and  buildings.  Its  offerings  include  low-voltage  switching,  measuring  and  control  equipment;  low-voltage  distribution systems and switchgear; and circuit breakers, contactors and switching for medium-voltage. In fiscal 2021, Smart Infrastructure acquired C&S  Electric  Limited  (C&S  Electric),  India,  a  provider  of  electrical  and  electronic  equipment  for  infrastructure,  power  generation, transmission and distribution to strengthen its position in India as a supplier of low-voltage power distribution and electrical installation technology.\n\nSmart  Infrastructure's  customer  base  is  diverse.  It  encompasses  infrastructure  developers,  construction  companies  and  contractors; owners,  operators  and  tenants  of  both  public  and  commercial  buildings  including  hospitals,  campuses,  airports  and  data  centers; companies  in  heavy  industries  such  as  oil  and  gas,  mining  and  chemicals;  companies  in  discrete  manufacturing  industries  such  as automotive and machine building; and utilities and power grid network operators (transmission and distribution). Smart Infrastructure serves its customers through a broad range of channels, including its global sales organization, distributors and partners such as panel builders, original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and value-added resellers and installers, all complemented by direct sales such as through the branch offices of its regional solutions and services units worldwide and e-commerce channels. Smart Infrastructure's principal competitors consist mainly of large multinational companies and smaller manufacturers in emerging countries. Its solutions and services business also competes with local players such as system integrators and facility management firms. Smart Infrastructure's businesses are impacted by changes in the overall economic environment to varying degrees, depending on customer segment. While customer demand in discrete manufacturing industries changes quickly and strongly with macroeconomic cycles, it reacts more slowly in infrastructure, construction, heavy industries and the utilities sector. The building solutions business in particular is affected by economic cycles in the non-residential  building  construction  markets  with  a  time  lag  of  two  to  four  quarters.  Overall,  Smart  Infrastructure  has  developed  a balanced and resilient business mix with its diversified regional and vertical markets; its range of products, systems, solutions and services; and its participation in both long- and short-cycle markets. To further strengthen the resilience of its portfolio, Smart Infrastructure aims at increasing the share of service revenue and beginning with fiscal 2022 will report revenue generated from service activities.\n\nSmart Infrastructure benefits from a number of favorable trends . These include urbanization, demographic change, climate change, and digitalization. Urbanization and demographic change drive a need for smarter and more human-centric buildings. Climate change drives the need for decarbonization. This results in an increasing demand for flexible and resilient energy infrastructures and rapid growth in electric mobility. Digitalization is an enabler for such changes in both buildings and grids, making it possible to develop smarter buildings and  manage  electricity  distribution  with  a  higher  share  of  renewables.  The  markets  served  are  experiencing  shifts  that  present opportunities where building technologies and electrification meet.\n\nSmart  Infrastructure's R&D  activities focus  on  sustainable  and  decarbonized  infrastructures  in  electrification,  distribution  grids  and buildings.  It  develops  digital  offerings  for  the  energy  market  such  as  for  integrating  renewable  energy  into  conventional  grids. Furthermore, R&D efforts strengthen Smart Infrastructure's capabilities to create comfortable, safe and energy-efficient buildings and infrastructures that support increased efficiency for occupants, equipment and the use of building space. Smart Infrastructure is expanding its digital offerings such as cloud solutions using field data from controllers and IoT devices. Furthermore, it develops technologies for environmentally friendly and increasingly renewable-based energy systems, ranging from photovoltaic and battery storage inverters to charging solutions for e-mobility. In this regard, data from field devices is the basis for intelligent grid control and protection, providing grid stability and flexibility and continuously matching energy supply and demand while protecting grid assets. For electrical distribution systems and industrial plants, Smart Infrastructure continuously drives digitalization of its switching and control products with built-in intelligence, connectivity to the cloud, and increasingly remote diagnostics and edge computing capability. Its digital twins of products, building systems or grids deliver customer value from online configuration and parametrization, to operation, to maintenance planning. Smart Infrastructure also develops data-driven applications and digital services. To a large extent, its capital expenditures relate to the products  businesses.  Main investment areas  are  replacement  of  fixed  assets  and  further  digitalization  of  factories  and  technical equipment, with a strong focus on innovation.\n\n|                            | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   | % Change   | % Change   |\n|----------------------------|---------------|---------------|------------|------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)         | 2021          | 2020          | Actual     | Comp.      |\n| Orders                     | 16,071        | 14,734        | 9%         | 12%        |\n| Revenue                    | 15,015        | 14,323        | 5%         | 8%         |\n| therein: products business | 5,769         | 5,182         | 11%        | 15%        |\n| Adjusted EBITA             | 1,743         | 1,302         | 34%        |            |\n| Adjusted EBITA margin      | 11.6%         | 9.1%          |            |            |\n\nOrders at Smart Infrastructure rose in all businesses on broad-based improvements in its main customer markets. The strongest growth contributions came from the products business, which saw a clear recovery in demand from industrial customers, and from the systems business, which won a number of significant contracts including orders from semiconductor manufacturers in the U.S. Orders in the solutions and services business grew slightly as the business saw first signs of recovery in relevant markets towards the end of the fiscal year. Revenue growth also was driven mainly by the products business and the systems business, while a slight decline in the solutions",

        "page_content": "and services business was due to negative currency translation effects. Despite more challenging supply conditions, Smart Infrastructure maintained its delivery capacity by successfully avoiding major supply chain disruptions. On a geographic basis, orders and revenue were up in all regions, with double-digit volume growth in the region Asia, Australia including a particularly strong contribution from China. Volume growth in the Americas included strong demand from residential markets in the U.S. Overall, growth in this region was sharply impacted by negative currency translation effects, which eased towards the end of the fiscal year. Adjusted EBITA and profitability rose in all businesses, with the strongest growth contributions coming from the products business and the systems business on higher revenue and increased capacity utilization. Adjusted EBITA overall rose also due to cost savings related to prior execution of Smart Infrastructure's competitiveness program, while severance associated with the program fell sharply, to \u20ac47 million from \u20ac195 million a year earlier. Particularly during the first half of fiscal 2021, Adjusted EBITA development benefited from expense reductions year-over-year related to COVID-19 restrictions. These effects were only partly offset by negative currency effects. For comparison, Adjusted EBITA in fiscal 2020 benefited from a \u20ac159 million gain from the sale of a business. Smart Infrastructure's order backlog was \u20ac11 billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which \u20ac7 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2022.\n\nOverall, markets served by Smart Infrastructure grew moderately in fiscal 2021, experiencing a recovery from COVID-19-related effects that had a strong impact on most customer industries a year earlier. Industrial markets developed well, with strong growth in the machine building and pharmaceutical industries, followed by the automotive, food and beverage, oil and gas and chemicals industries. Grid markets grew clearly as utilities continued to prioritize investments in making legacy networks more automated, intelligent, flexible and reliable. Ongoing strong demand for remote working and cloud services resulted in strong growth in the data center market. Conditions in nonresidential construction markets were challenging, while residential construction markets, in which Smart Infrastructure has a significantly lower exposure, grew strongly. On a geographic basis, market growth in fiscal 2021 was mainly driven by the region Asia, Australia, which recovered earlier from impacts related to COVID-19, while market volume in the Americas declined. Smart Infrastructure also experienced a  number of supply chain constraints, especially in the areas of base metals (copper, aluminum, steel), plastics, semiconductors and transportation services. Whereas the management of these constraints required additional effort, Smart Infrastructure's supply chains have proven to be resilient, so that major interruptions could be avoided and delivery ability was maintained. In fiscal 2022, markets served by Smart Infrastructure are expected to grow slightly faster than in fiscal 2021. Demand from the pharmaceutical industry, data centers and utilities are expected to be main growth drivers, while growth rates of the non-residential construction markets are expected to come in below the average growth of markets served by Smart Infrastructure. On a geographic basis, Asia, Australia is expected to continue to be the fastest-growing region. Growth in the region Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East is expected to accelerate and markets in the region Americas are expected to return to growth.\n\n## 3.4 Mobility\n\nMobility combines all Siemens businesses in the area of passenger and freight transportation. Within its rolling stock business, its offerings encompass trains for urban and regional transport such as vehicles for metro systems, trams and light rail, and commuter trains as well as trains and passenger coaches for intercity and long-distance services, such as high-speed rail. Rolling stock offerings furthermore include locomotives for freight or passenger transport and solutions for automated transportation such as automated people movers. Offerings in its rail infrastructure business include products and solutions for rail automation, such as automatic train control systems, interlocking, operations control and telematic systems, digital station solutions and railway communication systems, signaling on-board and crossing products and yard and depot solutions; for electrification such as AC and DC traction power supply, contact lines and network control; and intermodal solutions, such as platforms for fleet management, route planning, ticketing and payments solutions and data analytics. With its service business, Mobility provides customer services for rolling stock and rail infrastructure throughout the entire lifecycle, such as maintenance and digital services. In its turnkey business, it bundles consulting, planning, financing, construction, service and operation of completed mobility systems. Its intelligent traffic systems business provides solutions for traffic management such as autonomous driving, eHighway systems and tolling solutions. During fiscal 2021, Mobility carved out the intelligent traffic systems business to form a separately managed entity, which operates under the brand name Yunex Traffic.\n\nMobility sells its products, systems and solutions through its worldwide network of sales units. The principal customers of Mobility are public and state-owned companies in the transportation and logistics sectors, so its markets are driven primarily by public spending. Customers usually have multi-year planning and implementation horizons, and their contract tenders therefore tend to be independent of short-term economic trends. Large contracts in the rolling stock and the rail infrastructure business are often awarded together with service contracts, which start to generate revenue only after the respective products and solutions have been put in operation, which can be  a  number  of  years  after  the  contract  award.  Mobility's  principal  competitors  are  multinational  companies.  Consolidation  among Mobility's  competitors  is  continuing:  In  January  2021,  Alstom  SA  of  France  announced  the  closing  of  the  acquisition  of  Bombardier Transportation. In August 2021, Hitachi Ltd., Japan, announced an agreement of Hitachi Rail to acquire the Ground Transportation Systems business of Thales. Market consolidation may lead to increased competitive pressure within the rail supply industry and also to fewer sourcing options for rail customers.\n\nThe main trends driving Mobility's markets are urbanization and the need to reduce emissions, particularly from transportation. Increasing populations in urban centers need daily mobility that is simpler, faster, and more flexible, reliable and affordable. At the same time, cities and  national  economies  face  the  challenge  of  cutting  CO2  and  noise  emissions  and  reducing  space  requirements  and  costs  of transportation.  The  pressure  on  mobility  providers  to  meet  all  these  needs  is  expected  to  rise  continuously.  Furthermore,  improving availability,  connectivity,  and  sustainability  of  rail  infrastructures  increasingly  requires  digital  solutions,  which  provide  growth opportunities. While a significant drop in ridership driven by COVID-19 has strongly impacted mobility operators, overall trends towards urbanization and decarbonization persist unchanged and recovery programs in many countries have been allocating significant funds to rail and public transport operators to address these trends.\n\nMobility's R&D strategy is  focused  on  making  trains  and  infrastructures  more intelligent,  thereby increasing its customers' return on investment, improving the passenger experience, and guaranteeing availability. Decarbonization and seamlessly connected (e-)mobility are also key factors for the future of transportation. Mobility's major R&D areas include the development of efficient vehicle platforms with optimized lifecycle cost and maximum customization flexibility; eco-friendly, alternative power supplies for trains (batteries, hydrogen, dual mode) and trucks (eHighway); digital services for railways via its Railigent application suite; 'signaling in the cloud,' a new system architecture for rail infrastructure and IoT/cloud-based technologies; solutions for more automated and autonomous driving for rail and road;  innovative  brake  monitoring  systems  for  freight  trains;  and  digital  technologies  and  IoT  solutions  including  cyber  security,",

Large contract wins in the region Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East included an order for passenger coaches in the Czech Republic, an order for regional trains in Austria and an order for light rail vehicles in Germany, each worth \u20ac0.4 billion, and in the region Asia, Australia a \u20ac0.2 billion order for a signaling system in Taiwan. Revenue growth was driven by the rail infrastructure business, including significant growth in its mainline activities. On a geographic basis, revenue rose in the Americas due particularly to a significant growth contribution from the U.S., and in the region Europa, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East, including clear growth in Germany. These increases were only partly offset by lower revenue in the region Asia, Australia. Adjusted EBITA rose in the majority of the businesses, most strongly in the rail infrastructure business. For Mobility overall, impacts related to COVID-19, such as measures in the rolling stock business to safeguard employee health in manufacturing facilities, held back revenue and Adjusted EBITA growth, albeit to a lesser extent than a year earlier. Severance charges were \u20ac22 million, compared to \u20ac20 million a year earlier. Mobility's order backlog reached \u20ac36 billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which \u20ac9 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2022.\n\nMarkets served by Mobility grew moderately in fiscal 2021 as they partly recovered from impacts related to COVID-19. The market for rolling stock saw large orders across all segments, especially for high-speed trains, commuter trains and locomotives. The rail infrastructure market has seen growth both in urban and mainline segments due to the renewal and extension of mainline tracks and the ongoing trend towards automatic train protection (ATP), including communications-based train control (CBTC) and European train control system (ETCS) technologies. Service demand partly recovered from prior-year impacts related to COVID-19, due to growing installed bases which drove a corresponding increase in the spare parts and maintenance market. On a geographic basis, market development in Europe continued to be characterized by awards of mid-size to large orders, particularly in Germany, Denmark and in Switzerland. While demand in the Middle East rose, demand in Africa was held back by ongoing uncertainties related to budget constraints and political climates. In the Americas region, investment activities were driven by demand for urban and mainline transport, especially in the U.S. and Canada. Within the Asia, Australia region, markets saw ongoing rail investments, particularly in China. For fiscal 2022, markets served by Mobility are expected to further recover from impacts related to COVID-19 and to grow clearly, partly benefiting from fiscal stimulus and investment programs. Mobility anticipates that rail operators in Europe, particularly in Germany and in the U.K., will continue making significant investments and that customers in the Middle East and Africa will tender large turnkey systems, especially for additional rail lines in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Markets in the Americas region are expected to remain strong, especially due to ongoing investments in urban and mainline transport and large investment programs dedicated to transportation and enhancements of existing infrastructure in the U.S. In China, investments in high-speed trains, urban transport, freight logistics and rail infrastructure are expected to continue to drive growth. In India, privatization is expected to drive infrastructure enhancements and upgrades and to lead to strong market growth through investments in mainline (high-speed, freight infrastructure, additional rolling stock), urban metro and rail electrification with ambitious electrification targets for the broad-gauge network. Despite an adverse short-term impact from COVID-19, rail transport and intermodal mobility solutions are expected to remain a high priority as urbanization continues to progress around the world. In emerging countries, rising incomes are expected to result in greater demand for public transport solutions.\n\nIn October 2021, Mobility closed the acquisition of SQCAP B.V. (Sqills), Netherlands, a provider of cloud-based inventory management, reservation,  and  ticketing  software  for  public  transport  operators  to  enhance  its  offerings  that  increase  the  availability,  capacity  and utilization of public transportation. The purchase price is \u20ac537 million paid in cash plus a contingent consideration recognized at the acquisition date at its maximum amount of \u20ac79 million. For further information see Note 34 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2021.\n\n## 3.5 Siemens Healthineers\n\nSiemens is majority shareholder in the publicly listed Siemens Healthineers AG, Germany (Siemens Healthineers). Siemens Healthineers is a global provider of healthcare solutions and services. It develops, manufactures, and sells a diverse range of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic products and services to healthcare providers. In addition, it also provides clinical consulting services, complemented by extensive training and service offerings. This comprehensive portfolio supports customers all along the care continuum, from prevention and  early  detection  to  diagnosis,  treatment,  and  follow-up  care.  The  customer  spectrum  ranges  from  public  and  private  healthcare providers, including hospitals and hospital systems, public and private clinics and laboratories, universities, physicians/physician groups, public health agencies, state-run and private health insurers, to pharmaceutical companies and clinical research institutes. The imaging business provides imaging products, services and solutions. Its most important products are equipment for magnetic resonance, computed tomography, X-ray systems, molecular imaging, and ultrasound. The diagnostics business offers in-vitro diagnostic products and services to healthcare providers in laboratory, molecular and point-of-care diagnostics. The portfolio of the advanced therapies business consists of highly integrated products, solutions and services across multiple clinical fields that are designed to support image-guided minimally invasive treatments, in areas such as cardiology, interventional radiology and surgery. On April 15, 2021, Siemens acquired Varian, which is active in the field of cancer care, with solutions especially in radiation oncology and related digital solutions and applications. Varian thus  offers  a  good  complement  to  Siemens  Healthineers'  businesses  in  medical  imaging,  laboratory  diagnostics  and  interventional procedures. The purchase price paid in cash amounted to USD 16.4 billion (\u20ac13.9 billion as of the acquisition date). To partially finance this acquisition, Siemens Healthineers carried out a capital increase during fiscal 2021 without the participation of Siemens, consequently",

        "page_content": "reducing Siemens' stake in Siemens Healthineers from about 79% to slightly over 75%. Competition in the imaging, Varian and advanced therapies businesses consists mainly of a small number of large multinational companies, while the diagnostics market is fragmented with a variety of global players that compete with each other across market segments and also with several regional players and specialized companies in niche technologies. The business activities of Siemens Healthineers are to a certain extent resilient to short-term economic trends because large portions of its revenue stem from recurring business. They are, however, directly and indirectly dependent on trends in healthcare markets and on developments in health policy, and geopolitical developments around the world.\n\nThe addressable markets of Siemens Healthineers are shaped by four major trends . The first is demographic, in particular the growing and aging global population. This trend poses major challenges for global healthcare systems and, at the same time, offers opportunities for players  in  the  healthcare  industry  as  the  demand  for  cost-efficient  healthcare  solutions  continues  to  intensify.  The  second  trend  is economic development in emerging countries, which opens up improved access to healthcare for many people. Significant investment in the expansion of private and public healthcare systems will persist, driving overall demand for healthcare products and services and hence market growth. The third trend is the increase in chronic diseases as a consequence of an aging population and environmental and lifestylerelated changes. This trend results in far more patients with multiple morbidities, putting further pressure on healthcare systems and leading to higher costs; it also increases the need for new, more timely ways to detect and treat diseases. The fourth global trend, the transformation of healthcare providers, results from a combination of societal and market forces that are driving healthcare providers to operate and organize their businesses differently. Increasing cost pressure on the healthcare sector is prompting the introduction of new remuneration models for healthcare services, such as value-based rather than treatment-based reimbursement. Digitalization and artificial intelligence are thereby likely to be key enablers for healthcare providers as they increasingly focus on enhancing the overall patient experience, with better outcomes and overall reduction in cost of care. This development is driven partly by society's increasing resistance to healthcare costs, payers' increasing professionalization, burdens from chronic disease, rapid scientific progress and staff shortages. As a result of these factors, healthcare providers are consolidating into networked structures, resulting in larger clinic and laboratory chains, often operating internationally, which act increasingly like large corporations. Applying this industrial logic to the healthcare market can lead to systematic improvements in quality, while at the same time reducing costs.\n\nR&D activities at Siemens Healthineers are aimed at delivering innovative, sustainable solutions to its customers while safeguarding and improving its competitiveness. Particularly in the field of digitalization and artificial intelligence, it has further expanded its activities and has 67 products and applications on the market that are designed to further improve its customers' productivity, while enabling clinical decisions to be more precise and tailored to the individual patient. Furthermore, Siemens Healthineers is continuously expanding its portfolio  of  digital  services  to  support  customers  in  their  transition  to  value-based  care.  The  teamplay  digital  health  platform  brings together data, applications and services to make better decisions for patients in an efficient way. In addition, in fiscal 2021 Siemens Healthineers extended its portfolio in the field of cancer care with the Varian acquisition. The combined company pursues an intelligent cancer care strategy, harnessing advanced technologies such as AI and data analytics to improve cancer treatment and expand global access to cancer care.  In addition to continually updating its portfolio, Siemens Healthineers also improves existing products and solutions. Siemens Healthineers focuses its investments mainly on enhancing competitiveness and innovation. The main capital expenditures were for spending for factories to expand manufacturing and technical capabilities, in particular in China and the U.S., and for additions to intangible assets, including capitalized development expenses within the Atellica Solution and Central Lab product lines.\n\n|                       | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   | % Change   | % Change   |\n|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|------------|------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)    | 2021          | 2020          | Actual     | Comp.      |\n| Orders                | 20,320        | 16,163        | 26%        | 18%        |\n| Revenue               | 17,997        | 14,460        | 24%        | 19%        |\n| Adjusted EBITA        | 2,847         | 2,184         | 30%        |            |\n| Adjusted EBITA margin | 15.8%         | 15.1%         |            |            |\n\nIn fiscal 2021, Siemens Healthineers recorded double-digit growth both in orders and revenue , with both metrics developing similarly. While all businesses contributed to growth, the increases were highest in the diagnostics and imaging businesses. On a geographic basis, growth was particularly strong in the region Europe, C.I.S. Africa, Middle East. The reporting regions Asia, Australia and Americas also saw double-digit increases, the latter one despite significant currency translation effects. Portfolio effects primarily following the acquisition of  Varian  added  twelve  percentage  points  to  order  growth  and  nine  percentage  points  to  revenue  growth. Adjusted  EBITA was substantially higher year-over-year, due primarily to strong earnings development in the diagnostics business that was driven by high demand for rapid coronavirus antigen tests. The imaging business again posted strong earnings, which were higher than in the prior year. Varian delivered a positive contribution to earnings on an operating basis. In contrast, Adjusted EBITA in the advanced therapies business was lower year-over-year. Adjusted EBITA included subsequent measurement effects from purchase price allocation related to the Varian acquisition  totaling  \u20ac0.1  billion  and  expenses  totaling  \u20ac0.1  billion  related  to  the  closing  of  the  Varian  transaction  and  its  ongoing integration. Profitability was also burdened by negative currency effects. Severance charges were \u20ac68 million in fiscal 2021 and \u20ac65 million in fiscal 2020. The order backlog for Siemens Healthineers was \u20ac27 billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which \u20ac9 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2022.\n\nIn general, the markets addressed by Siemens Healthineers showed significant growth in fiscal 2021. Nearly two years after the first case of  COVID-19  was  identified,  the  virus  continues  to  impact  health  systems  worldwide.  Competition  among  the  leading  healthcare companies remained at elevated high levels. While the long-term market trends generally remained intact, the COVID-19 pandemic did reinforce some of these trends and has, for example, raised the already increasing cost pressure on health systems and customers to unprecedented levels. Especially in countries with severe COVID-19 outbreaks such as the U.S., India, and Brazil, a significant impact on healthcare economics was apparent in the form of additional cost increases combined with simultaneous revenue losses for hospitals. Staff shortages became more acute, leading to significant care disruptions at many hospitals and overburdening healthcare systems. The pandemic served to drive efforts toward innovation and digital transformation in healthcare. From a regional perspective, China is one of the biggest markets for medical technology and a major incremental growth driver. In the course of the last fiscal year, China's healthcare market recovered almost fully from effects related to the coronavirus pandemic during the fiscal year. In the region Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East, public investment programs as well as a rise in COVID-19-related demand helped drive a market rise in several countries. The private market also began to recover. In the U.S., business began to return to normal as progress was made in the vaccination campaign.",

        "page_content": "Markets addressed by the imaging business grew significantly, mainly due to large COVID 19-driven demand for computer tomography systems and initial signs of normalization in all other modalities. For the Imaging market, it is expected that a normalization of growth to pre-COVID-19 levels will occur in fiscal year 2022. In the diagnostics business, the markets for point-of-care tests for patient monitoring and for lab tests increased in fiscal 2021. On the one hand, the backlog of purchasing decisions and capital expenditure by laboratories and hospitals from the previous year dissipated while, on the other, demand for certain diagnostic reagents, particularly tests for routine care, increased. The markets for combating the COVID-19 pandemic posted sharp growth. Vaccination rates in the population and further COVID-19 implications such as future waves and testing guidelines are key factors for determining expected growth in the market for the diagnostics business. Siemens Healthineers expects demand for tests for acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 to decrease sharply. In the Varian business,  growth  was  driven  primarily  by  new  and  replacement  business.  In  markets  such  as  the  U.S.  and  Western  Europe,  product innovations led to higher customer investment. The market for Varian is expected to continue to grow throughout fiscal 2022. The recovery in the advanced therapies markets was made possible through a combination of a resumption in elective surgical procedures and the gradual return of patients. The expectation is that the slight market recovery already seen in fiscal 2021 will continue on a broad basis in fiscal 2022.\n\n## 3.6 Siemens Financial Services\n\nSiemens Financial Services provides financing solutions for Siemens' customers as well as other companies in the form of debt and equity investments. Based on its comprehensive financing know-how and specialist technology expertise in the areas of Siemens businesses, SFS supports  its  customers'  investments  with  leasing,  lending  and  working  capital  financing  solutions  as  well  as  equipment,  project  and structured financing. In addition, SFS supports Siemens' industrial businesses via a joint go-to-market that includes SFS's risk management expertise, such as to assess the risk profiles of projects or business models. Furthermore, SFS collaborates with the industrial businesses to co-develop new digital business models. Recent examples include energy as a service or pay-per-use and pay-for-outcome options that give customers more financial flexibility.\n\n|                             | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   |\n|-----------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)          | 2021          | 2020          |\n| Earnings before taxes (EBT) | 512           | 345           |\n| therein: equity business    | 49            | 82            |\n| ROE (after taxes)           | 15.4%         | 11.7%         |\n\n|                    | Sep 30,   | Sep 30,   |\n|--------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac) | 2021      | 2020      |\n| Total assets       | 30,384    | 28,946    |\n\nA high earnings contribution from the debt business resulted in a sharp increase in Earnings before taxes and was also the main factor for the increase of the ROE. The improvement was due mainly to sharply lower expenses for credit risk provisions compared to fiscal 2020, when results were significantly influenced by effects related to COVID-19. However, results from the equity business were affected by high ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. Additionally, sales of investments in the previous fiscal year lifted profit for that period. This led also, along with seasonal effects on offshore wind-farm projects, to a lower share of profit from investments accounted for using the equity method in fiscal 2021. For comparison, results in the equity business in fiscal 2020 included a loss of \u20ac98 million from an impairment of an equity investment in the U.S.\n\nThe increase in total assets since the end of fiscal 2020 was due to growth in the debt business and positive currency translation effects.\n\nNet cash from operations (defined as the sum of cash flows from operating and investing activities) amounted to \u20ac105 million compared to \u20ac(284) million in fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, net cash from operations comprised Free cash flow of \u20ac820 million and \u20ac611  million,  respectively,  and  remaining  cash  flows  from  investing  activities,  including  from  change  in  receivables  from  financing activities, of \u20ac(715) million and \u20ac(895) million, respectively.\n\nSFS is de-risking its business profile by reducing exposure in connection with energy-related equity investments as a consequence of the spin-off of Siemens Energy. This has the additional benefit of more tightly focusing SFS's business scope and capital allocation on areas of intense domain know-how closely aligned with Siemens' customers and markets, particularly for Digital Industries, Smart Infrastructure and Mobility. Accordingly, SFS is influenced by the business development of the markets served by our industrial businesses, among other factors, including effects related to COVID-19. In addition to its high level of diversification across industries, SFS has a strong regional footprint in investment-grade countries, with the highest share in the U.S. SFS intends to maintain a highly diversified portfolio across regions, while participating in the strong economic development of selected Asian markets.\n\n## 3.7 Portfolio Companies\n\nPortfolio  Companies comprise  businesses  which  deliver  a  broad  range  of  customized  and  application-specific  products,  software, solutions, systems and services for different industries including oil and gas, chemical, mining, cement, logistics, energy, marine, water and fiber. Unrealized potential within these businesses requires adjustment in their approach using defined measures including internal re-organization, digitalization, cost improvements, and optimizing procurement, production and service activities. After achieving certain threshold performance targets, businesses may be transferred to one of Siemens industrial businesses, combined with an external business from the same industry, sold or placed into an external private equity partnership.\n\nIn March 2021 Siemens sold Flender GmbH, Germany, (Flender) to Carlyle Group Inc., U.S. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021 the businesses of Flender (previously reported in Portfolio Companies) were classified as held for disposal and discontinued operations. Priorperiod amounts are presented on a comparable basis. For further information see Note 3 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2021.",

        "page_content": "After this disposal, Portfolio Companies consists mainly of three fully consolidated, separately managed units at the end of fiscal 2021. Large Drives Applications, which offers electric motors, converters and solutions for mining, will be carved out beginning with fiscal 2022 to increase its entrepreneurial freedom and thereby unlock its full potential. Similarly, Siemens Logistics, which offers sorting technology and solutions, will be reorganized to separate its mail and parcel activities from its airport logistics activities, which focuses on baggage and cargo handling. The third fully consolidated unit, Siemens Energy Assets, comprises certain regional remaining business activities of the former Gas and Power segment; as part of the Siemens Energy carve-out these activities remained with Siemens due to country-specific regulatory restrictions or economic considerations. Portfolio Companies also holds an at-equity investment in Valeo Siemens eAutomotive GmbH.\n\nDemand within  the  industries  served  by  Portfolio  Companies  mainly  shows  a  delayed  response  to  changes  in  the  overall  economic environment.  The  results  of  fully  consolidated  units  are  strongly  dependent,  however,  on  customer  investment  cycles  in  their  key industries. In commodity-based industries such as oil and gas or mining, these cycles are driven mainly by commodity price fluctuations rather than changes in produced volumes. The broad range of fully consolidated units and their heterogonous industrial customer base are reflected in the use of various sales and marketing channels, requiring a dedicated sales approach based on in-depth understanding of specific industries and customer requests.\n\n|                       | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   | % Change   | % Change   |\n|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|------------|------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)    | 2021          | 2020          | Actual     | Comp.      |\n| Orders                | 3,516         | 3,024         | 16%        | 20%        |\n| Revenue               | 3,058         | 3,209         | (5)%       | (2)%       |\n| Adjusted EBITA        | (85)          | (673)         | 87%        |            |\n| Adjusted EBITA margin | (2.8)%        | (21.0)%       |            |            |\n\nEven though volume development was held back by adverse currency translation effects and impacts related to COVID-19, orders still increased significantly, driven by Siemens Logistics and Large Drives Applications. However, Portfolio Companies recorded lower revenue compared to fiscal 2020, as Large Drives Applications in particular could not offset these headwinds. Fully consolidated units made good progress with profitability and delivered overall a sharply improved earnings performance, even though Portfolio Companies recorded higher severance charges of \u20ac74 million, up from \u20ac21 million in fiscal 2020, related to cost structure improvement measures mainly at Large Drives Applications. A positive Adjusted EBITA for fully consolidated units was more than offset by continued negative results from the at-equity investment in Valeo Siemens eAutomotive GmbH. For comparison, fiscal 2020 included an impairment of \u20ac453 million on the at-equity investment and a goodwill impairment of \u20ac99 million related to Siemens Energy Assets. Portfolio Companies' order backlog was \u20ac4 billion at the end of fiscal 2021, of which \u20ac2 billion was expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2022.\n\nAlthough the broad range of businesses are operating in diverse markets, overall the main markets served by Portfolio Companies are generally impacted by uncertainties regarding geopolitical and economic developments and by cautiousness of investment sentiment. However, ongoing recovery is expected to continue in most end-customer vertical markets in fiscal 2022.\n\n## 3.8 Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nProfit\n\n|                                                                     | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                                  | 2021          | 2020          |\n| Siemens Energy Investment                                           | (396)         | (24)          |\n| Siemens Real Estate                                                 | 94            | 325           |\n| Corporate items                                                     | (435)         | (887)         |\n| Centrally carried pension expense                                   | (170)         | (211)         |\n| Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations | (738)         | (691)         |\n| Eliminations, Corporate Treasury and other reconciling items        | (94)          | (243)         |\n| Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements                 | (1,739)       | (1,731)       |\n\nThe result for Siemens Energy Investment included Siemens' share of Siemens Energy AG's result after tax and, in addition, expenses from amortization  of  assets  resulting  from  purchase  price  allocation  due  to  the  initial  recognition  of  the  investment  at  fair  value  in September 2020. In fiscal 2021, Siemens' share of Siemens Energy AG's net loss amounted to \u20ac159 million, which was due mainly to planned restructuring measures by Siemens Energy to improve its competitiveness, while the expenses from amortization amounted to a \u20ac237 million.\n\nLower profit at Siemens Real Estate was due mainly to reduced gains related to disposals. The prior year included a gain of \u20ac219 million from the transfer of an investment.\n\nThe positive change in Corporate items was mainly due to the following factors in fiscal 2021: Firstly, a positive result, primarily resulting from revaluation gains, totaling \u20ac358 million related to the transfers of assets to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. in Germany, which included the stakes in Bentley and ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. (ChargePoint). Secondly, a gain of \u20ac314 million related to the revaluation of, and dividends received for the stake in, Thoughtworks Holdings Inc. (Thoughtworks), which completed its initial public offering in the U.S. in September 2021. These factors were partly offset by expenses of \u20ac94 million from revised estimates related to provisions for a legacy project. Severance charges within Corporate items were \u20ac73 million (\u20ac68 million in fiscal 2020).\n\nImproved results in Eliminations, Corporate Treasury and other reconciling items were due mainly to lower interest expenses on debt and positive effects related to reinsurance contracts.",

The order backlog was \u20ac85 billion as of September 30, 2021.\n\n## Orders (location of customer)\n\n|                                     | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   | % Change   | % Change   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|------------|------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                  | 2021          | 2020          | Actual     | Comp.      |\n| Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East | 34,311        | 27,778        | 24%        | 20%        |\n| therein: Germany                    | 12,118        | 10,646        | 14%        | 9%         |\n| Americas                            | 20,474        | 16,780        | 22%        | 24%        |\n| therein: U.S.                       | 17,555        | 14,212        | 24%        | 26%        |\n| Asia, Australia                     | 16,589        | 13,473        | 23%        | 20%        |\n| therein: China                      | 9,029         | 7,094         | 27%        | 23%        |\n| Siemens (continuing operations)     | 71,374        | 58,030        | 23%        | 21%        |\n| therein: emerging markets 1         | 19,208        | 15,234        | 26%        | 25%        |\n\nOrders related to external customers were up substantially year-over-year on double-digit growth in all four industrial businesses, reflecting a very strong rebound in economic activity even though the economic environment was still strongly impacted by COVID-19. Orders in Mobility increased sharply on a higher volume from large orders which included a \u20ac2.8. billion order for trainsets including dual powered and  hybrid  battery  vehicles  and  associated  services  in  the  U.S.,  its  largest-ever  order  in  the  Americas.  Siemens  Healthineers,  Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure also posted double-digit order growth year-over-year. The broad-based increase in emerging markets was driven by China and, to a lesser degree, India.\n\nIn the Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East region, order intake was up substantially year-over-year with increases in all four industrial businesses. Sharp order growth in Siemens Healthineers included high volume from rapid coronavirus antigen tests. Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure also recorded double-digit growth, while orders in Mobility were up clearly year-over year. In Germany, order intake in Siemens Healthineers almost doubled due mainly to the high volume from rapid coronavirus antigens tests. Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure posted double-digit growth, while Mobility posted a substantial decline due to a lower volume from large orders which in fiscal 2020 had included a \u20ac1.1 billion order for high-speed trains.\n\nOrder growth in the Americas and in the U.S. was due mainly to a higher volume from large orders in Mobility, particularly including the large order in the U.S. mentioned above. Overall, order intake both in the region and in the U.S. was subject to significantly negative currency translation effects, partly offset by portfolio effects which related primarily to the acquisition of Varian.\n\nIn the Asia, Australia region, orders overall rose substantially due to double-digit increases in all four industrial businesses, with the highest contributions from Siemens Healthineers and Digital Industries. The pattern of order development in China was largely the same as for the region.\n\n## Revenue (location of customer)\n\n|                                     | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   | % Change   | % Change   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|------------|------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                  | 2021          | 2020          | Actual     | Comp.      |\n| Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East | 31,138        | 27,252        | 14%        | 12%        |\n| therein: Germany                    | 11,249        | 9,373         | 20%        | 16%        |\n| Americas                            | 16,312        | 15,218        | 7%         | 10%        |\n| therein: U.S.                       | 13,521        | 12,761        | 6%         | 9%         |\n| Asia, Australia                     | 14,815        | 12,784        | 16%        | 13%        |\n| therein: China                      | 8,232         | 6,594         | 25%        | 21%        |\n| Siemens (continuing operations)     | 62,265        | 55,254        | 13%        | 11%        |\n| therein: emerging markets\u00b9          | 17,651        | 15,323        | 15%        | 15%        |\n\nRevenue related to external customers went up significantly year-over-year, led by double-digit growth in Siemens Healthineers and Digital Industries.  Smart  Infrastructure  recorded  a  clear  increase,  while  Mobility  posted  slightly  higher  revenue  year-over-year.  The  revenue increase in emerging markets was driven by substantially higher demand in China and, to a lesser degree, India.\n\nRevenue in Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East increased significantly  on  growth  in  all  four  industrial  businesses.  Within  the  region, Germany showed sharp growth particularly due to Siemens Healthineers which doubled its revenue in the country through sales of rapid coronavirus antigen tests. The other industrial businesses posted sizeable increases in Germany.",

Severance charges for continuing operations were \u20ac410 million, of which \u20ac251 million were in Industrial Business. In fiscal 2020, severance charges for continuing operations were \u20ac589 million, of which \u20ac490 million were in Industrial Business.\n\nThe tax rate in fiscal 2021 was 25%, close to the 24% rate in fiscal 2020, benefiting from reversal of income tax provisions and largely taxfree gains resulting from the transfers of assets to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. mentioned above. These benefits were partly offset by losses related to equity investments which were not tax-deductible. As a result, the increase in Income from continuing operations was 36%.\n\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in fiscal 2021 included a gain of \u20ac0.9 billion from the sale of Flender and also benefited from reversal of income tax provisions. The prior year included a pretax gain of \u20ac0.9 billion, net of related expenses, from the spin-off of Siemens Energy AG (Siemens Energy), as well as a positive contribution from Flender. These positive factors were largely offset, however, by losses at the former operating businesses Gas and Power and Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (now part of Siemens Energy) and \u20ac0.3 billion in income tax expenses mainly related to the carve-out of Siemens Energy.\n\nThe increase in basic earnings per share reflects an increase of Net income attributable to Shareholders of Siemens AG, which was \u20ac6,161 million in fiscal 2021 compared to \u20ac4,030 million in fiscal 2020, combined with a lower number of weighted average shares outstanding.\n\nAs expected, ROCE improved year-over-year, but was below the target range set in our Siemens Financial Framework. The increase yearover-year was due both to sharply higher income before interest after tax and to clearly lower average capital employed following the spin-off of Siemens Energy at the end of fiscal 2020.\n\n## 4.3 Research and development\n\nIn fiscal 2021, we reported research and development expenses of \u20ac4.9 billion, compared to \u20ac4.6 billion in fiscal 2020. The resulting R&D intensity, defined as the ratio of R&D expenses and revenue, was 7.8% (fiscal 2020: 8.3%). Additions to capitalized development expenses amounted to \u20ac0.3 billion in fiscal 2021, compared to \u20ac0.4 billion in fiscal 2020. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, Siemens held approximately 43,400 and 40,900 respectively, granted patents worldwide in its continuing operations. On average, we had 42,500 R&D employees in fiscal 2021.\n\nOur research and development activities are ultimately geared to developing innovative, sustainable solutions for our customers - and the Siemens businesses - while also strengthening our own competitiveness. Joint implementation by the operating units and Technology, our central R&D department, ensures that research activities and business strategies are closely aligned with one another, and that all units  benefit  equally  and  quickly  from  technological  developments.  As  in  previous  years,  we  focused  on  the  following  technologies: additive  manufacturing,  autonomous  robotics,  blockchain  applications,  connected  (e-)mobility,  connectivity  and  edge  devices,  cyber security, data analytics and artificial intelligence, distributed energy systems, energy storage, future of automation, materials, power electronics, simulation and digital twin, and software systems and processes.\n\nWe advance certain of these technologies also through our open innovation concept. We are working closely with scholars from leading universities and research institutions, not only under bilateral cooperation agreements but also in publicly funded collective projects. Our focus here is on our strategic research partners, and especially the eight Centers of Knowledge Interchange that we maintain at leading universities worldwide.",

The increase of the latter was driven also by higher business volume, primarily at Siemens Healthineers. Goodwill increased also due to the acquisition of Supplyframe. These increases were partly offset by the sale of Flender, among other factors. This applies mainly to inventories, trade and other receivables, and property, plant and equipment. For further information see Note 3 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2021.\n\nThe increase in other financial assets was driven mainly by increased equity investments as well as higher receivables from finance leases and higher loans receivable at SFS. The increase of the latter two was mainly due to new business and - in case of loans receivable - also to a reassessment of the expected repayment dates. Set against these factors was a decrease resulting mainly from contributions of assets to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V., including the stake in Bentley.",

This was offset by repayment of euro and U.S. dollar instruments totaling \u20ac3.5 billion, and by a \u20ac1.9 billion decrease in commercial papers.\n\nIncreases in deferred tax liabilities and contract liabilities year-over-year were due mainly to the acquisition of Varian. For further information see Note 3 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2021.\n\nLong-term debt increased due primarily to the issuance of U.S. dollar instruments of \u20ac8.4 billion. Set against this were mainly decreases from the above-mentioned reclassifications and currency translation effects for bonds issued in the U.S. dollar and British pound.\n\nProvisions for pensions and similar obligations substantially decreased mainly due to a positive return on plan assets and extraordinary fundings in Germany, including the transfer of Siemens' stake in Bentley to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V.\n\nThe decrease of provisions is due mainly to reclassification of a large part of a major asset retirement obligation to current provisions .\n\nThe main factors for the increase in total equity attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG were \u20ac6.2 billion in net income attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG; positive other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, of \u20ac3.5 billion resulting mainly from positive effects from remeasurements of defined benefit plans and from currency translation; and higher retained earnings of \u20ac1.2 billion due to Siemens Healthineers' increase in share capital. The increase was partly offset by dividend payments of \u20ac2.8 billion (for fiscal 2020) and the repurchase of 976,346 treasury shares totaling \u20ac0.5 billion (including final payment to a commissional bank).\n\nThe share capital increase of Siemens Healthineers mentioned above contributed also to higher non-controlling interests totaling \u20ac1.0 billion. For further information see Note 3 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2021.\n\n## Capital structure ratio\n\nOur capital structure ratio as of September 30, 2021 increased to 1.5 from 1.3 a year earlier. The change was due primarily to the abovementioned increase in long-term debt and decreased cash and cash equivalents related to the acquisition of Varian.\n\n## Debt and credit facilities\n\nAs of September 30, 2021, we recorded, in total, \u20ac43.4 billion in notes and bonds, \u20ac2.3 billion in loans from banks, \u20ac0.1 billion in other financial indebtedness and \u20ac2.9 billion in lease liabilities. Notes and bonds were issued mainly in the U.S. dollar and euro, and to a lesser extent in the British pound.\n\nWe have credit facilities totaling \u20ac7.5 billion which were unused as of September 30, 2021.\n\nFor further information about our debt see Note 16 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2021. For further information about the functions and objectives of our financial risk management see Note 25 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Off-balance-sheet commitments\n\nAs of September 30, 2021, the undiscounted amount of maximum potential future payments related primarily to credit and performance guarantees amounted to \u20ac15.6 billion. This included primarily Siemens' obligations from performance and credit guarantees in connection with the Siemens Energy business, for which Siemens has reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy.\n\nIn  addition  to  these  commitments,  there  are  contingent  liabilities  of  \u20ac0.5  billion  which  mainly  result  from  other  guarantees,  legal proceedings and from joint and several liabilities of consortia. Other guarantees include \u20ac0.2 billion in connection with the Siemens Energy business, for which Siemens has reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy.\n\nIrrevocable loan commitments amounted to \u20ac3.9 billion. A considerable portion of these commitments resulted from asset-based lending transactions, meaning that the respective loans can be drawn only after the borrower has provided sufficient collateral.\n\nFor further information about our commitments and contingencies see Note 21 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2021.\n\n## Share buyback\n\nThe share buyback announced in November 2018 was completed on September 24, 2021 with a total volume of \u20ac3 billion. On June 24, 2021, Siemens announced that it intends to launch a new five-year share buyback program of up to \u20ac3 billion, beginning in fiscal 2022.\n\n## 6.2 Cash flows\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                                                      | Fiscal year 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Cash flows from operating activities                                                    |                    |\n| Net income                                                                              | 6,697              |\n| Change in operating net working capital                                                 | (187)              |\n| Other reconciling items to cash flows from operating activities -

Also in our opinion, our operating net working capital is sufficient for our present requirements.\n\n## Investing activities\n\nAdditions to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment from continuing operations totaled \u20ac1.7 billion in fiscal 2021. Within the industrial businesses, ongoing investments related mainly to technological innovations; maintaining and extending our capacities for designing, manufacturing and marketing new solutions; improving productivity; and replacements of fixed assets. These investments amounted to \u20ac1.3 billion in fiscal 2021. The remaining portion related mainly to Siemens Real Estate, including significant amounts for projects such as new office buildings in Germany. Siemens Real Estate is responsible for uniform and comprehensive management of Company real estate worldwide (except for Siemens Healthineers) and supports the industrial businesses and corporate activities with customer-specific real estate solutions.\n\nWith regard to capital expenditures for continuing operations, we expect a significant increase in fiscal 2022. In the coming years, up to \u20ac0.6 billion are to be invested in Siemensstadt Square. This project initiated in fiscal 2019 aims to transform Siemens' existing industrial area in Berlin into a modern urban district supporting a diverse range of purposes, including strengthening key technologies. Further investments are planned in relation to Siemens Campus Erlangen. In addition, we continue to invest in attractive innovation fields through Next47, our global venture capital unit.",

        "page_content": "## 7. Overall assessment of the economic position\n\nSiemens successfully executed on its strategy as a focused technology company in fiscal 2021, following the spin-off and public listing of Siemens  Energy  in  September  2020.  All  our  industrial  businesses  are  addressing  highly  attractive  markets  in  industrial  automation, infrastructure, transportation and healthcare. With our offerings we are taking advantage of growth trends such as digitalization and decarbonization, for example by helping our customers to combine the real and the digital worlds. With the financial framework that we presented in June 2021, we have set ambitious new targets: we aim to further accelerate our profitable growth while placing an even greater emphasis on free cash flow.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, Siemens made further progress in sharpening its business focus by divesting activities such as the Flender business on one side, while on the other side strengthening our industrial businesses with a number of significant acquisitions. Important examples are: in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the acquisition of C&S Electric, a provider of electrical and electronic equipment for infrastructure, power generation, transmission and distribution in India, to strengthen Smart Infrastructure's position in that country as a supplier of low-voltage power distribution and electrical installation technology; in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, the acquisition of Varian, a global leader in the field of cancer care, with solutions especially in radiation oncology and related digital solutions and applications, which provides a good complement to Siemens Healthineers' activities in medical imaging, laboratory diagnostics and interventional procedures; in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the acquisition of Supplyframe, a marketplace for the global electronics value chain, with which Digital Industries intends to significantly strengthen digital marketing and accelerate sales of its offerings to small and medium-sized companies. At the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2022, Mobility closed the acquisition of Sqills, a provider of cloud-based inventory management, reservation,  and  ticketing  software  for  public  transport  operators,  which  enhances  Mobility's  existing  offerings  for  increasing  the availability, capacity and utilization of public transportation.\n\nFollowing the deep recession during fiscal 2020, many of Siemens' key customer industries including automotive, machine building, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, electronics, and cloud services recovered or continued to grow during fiscal 2021. Although COVID-19 led to a significant drop in public transit ridership, recovery programs in many countries have been allocating significant funds to transport providers, resulting in strong order development. During the fiscal year, Siemens succeeded in maintaining its supply chains and delivery capacity and continued to be a reliable partner for its customers, despite more challenging supply condition. These developments were reflected in our strong financial performance for fiscal 2021. We raised our outlook during the fiscal year, most recently after the third quarter, and reached or exceeded all the targets set for our primary measures for fiscal 2021. We achieved revenue growth of 11.5% net of currency translation and portfolio effects and delivered net income of \u20ac6.7 billion. Return on capital employed (ROCE) was double-digit at 13.1% and our capital structure ratio came in at 1.5.\n\nOrders rose 23% year-over-year to \u20ac71.4 billion, for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.15, thus fulfilling our expectation of a ratio above 1. All our four industrial businesses increased orders year-over-year. Mobility achieved the highest growth rate due to a sharply higher volume from large orders, including its largest ever order in the Americas, worth \u20ac2.8 billion, for trainsets and associated services. Substantial order growth at Siemens Healthineers included new volume from the acquisition of Varian. Significant order growth at Digital Industries was driven mainly by its factory automation and motion control businesses, while orders at Smart Infrastructure increased clearly on growth in all its businesses, with the strongest contributions coming from the products business and the systems business.\n\nRevenue was also higher in all our industrial businesses, rising to \u20ac62.3 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year. The strongest increases came from Siemens Healthineers and Digital Industries, which both posted double-digit growth. Revenue growth at Siemens Healthineers included all businesses with the highest increases coming from the diagnostics and imaging businesses. Revenue development at Digital Industries  also  included  increases  in  all  its  businesses  led  by  factory  automation  and  motion  control.  Revenue  growth  at  Smart Infrastructure was driven by its products business and its systems business. Revenue at Mobility rose slightly, as parts of its businesses continued to be impacted by restrictions related to COVID-19. Excluding currency translation and portfolio effects, revenue for Siemens grew 11.5%. We thus exceeded our forecast given in our Annual Report 2020, which was to achieve moderate comparable revenue growth and we met our raised guidance given after the third quarter of fiscal 2021, which was to achieve comparable revenue growth of 11% to 12%.\n\nAdjusted EBITA Industrial Business rose 17% to \u20ac8.8 billion on growth in all industrial businesses, led by Siemens Healthineers on strong earnings development in its diagnostics business driven by strong demand for rapid coronavirus antigen tests and by Smart Infrastructure on increases in all its businesses. Adjusted EBITA at Digital Industries rose moderately even though prior-year results benefited from a \u20ac0.8 billion positive effect related mainly to a revaluation of the stake in Bentley. Adjusted EBITA at Mobility also rose moderately, driven by its rail infrastructure business.\n\nAdjusted EBITA margin Industrial Business rose to 15.0%, up from 14.3% a year earlier. With Adjusted EBITA margins of 11.6%, 15.8% and 9.3%, respectively, Smart Infrastructure, Siemens Healthineers and Mobility improved their Adjusted EBITA margins year-over-year. The Adjusted EBITA margin of 20.4% at Digital Industries came in below the prior-year level of 21.7%, which included the above-mentioned substantial positive effect related to Bentley, which added 5.1 percentage points to Digital Industries' Adjusted EBITA margin.\n\nSiemens Financial Services sharply increased earnings before taxes due to lower expenses for credit risk provisions year-over-year, resulting in  a  return  on  equity  after  tax  of  15.4%.  In  addition,  results  outside  Industrial  Business  in  fiscal  2021  benefited  from  a  \u20ac0.3  billion revaluation gain and gains related to transfers of assets to Siemens Pension Trust e.V. in Germany were higher in the current period. A \u20ac0.4 billion loss related to Siemens Energy Investment was due mainly to Siemens Energy's execution of planned restructuring measures to improve its competitiveness and expenses from amortization of assets resulting from purchase price allocation. For comparison, results outside  Industrial  Business  a  year  earlier  included  an  impairment  of  \u20ac0.5  billion  on  our  equity  investment  stake  in  Valeo  Siemens eAutomotive GmbH.\n\nNet income in fiscal 2021 rose 59% to \u20ac6.7 billion, and basic EPS from net income increased 54% to \u20ac7.68. We thus exceeded the forecast given in our Annual Report 2020, which was for a moderate increase in net income, and also exceeded our raised forecast after the third quarter, which was for net income in the range of \u20ac6.1 billion to \u20ac6.4 billion. This improvement was due mainly to the aforementioned significantly higher Adjusted EBITA Industrial Business and the lower loss outside Industrial Business. In addition, discontinued operations, largely related to the sale of Flender, contributed income of \u20ac1.1 billion in fiscal 2021.",

We thus exceeded our forecast for ROCE given in our Annual Report 2020, which was for ROCE to remain in the single-digit range in fiscal 2021.\n\nWe evaluate our capital structure using the ratio of Industrial net debt to EBITDA. Due primarily to an increase in net debt year-over-year, this ratio rose to 1.5, compared to 1.3 in fiscal 2020. We thus achieved our forecast given in our Annual Report 2020, which was for a ratio above 1.0 in fiscal 2021.\n\nFree cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations for fiscal 2021 increased 29% year-over-year to \u20ac8.2 billion, reaching a new high.\n\nWe intend to continue providing an attractive shareholder return.

        "page_content": "## 8. Report on expected developments and associated material opportunities and risks\n\n## 8.1 Report on expected developments\n\n## 8.1.1 Worldwide economy\n\nAfter the deepest recession and the fastest rebound in decades, in calendar 2020 and calendar 2021, respectively, the global economic recovery is expected to continue with slowing momentum in fiscal 2022. Global gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to expand by 4.3% in calendar 2022. The outlook is still subject to a high level of uncertainty. The biggest source of concern remains COVID-19. New variants  could  emerge  before  widespread  vaccination  is  reached  globally,  or  they  could  escape  existing  immunity,  while  vaccine effectiveness might fade more quickly than expected.\n\nHowever, in our baseline forecast we assume the impact of the Delta variant will recede further, vaccination rates will continue to rise, especially in developing countries, and the global economy gradually will return to normal. The service sector will reopen further, and consumer spending for services will recover, which will contribute significantly to the global recovery. This is supported by consumers still having substantial pent-up savings which will continue to fuel consumer demand. In addition, companies in general have low levels of inventory and will seek to re-stock, adding to demand, even if consumer spending should slow. Also, many companies might want to have structurally higher inventory levels to improve supply chain resilience, as supply chains were often stressed during the pandemic. However, we expect supply shortages to continue in the first half of calendar 2022.\n\nBesides a potential re-emergence of the pandemic, further risks exist for fiscal 2022. Supply bottlenecks might last longer and restrain the recovery. While we expect price pressures to subside for the most part in fiscal 2022 in our baseline outlook, persistent supply bottlenecks or  further  energy  price  increases  could  fuel  inflation  and  inflation  expectations,  and  thus  prompt  a  faster-than-anticipated  monetary tightening. This could reverberate in financial markets and weigh on investment spending. Risks for financial markets could also emerge from other sources, e.g. an escalation of the U.S.-China trade and technology conflict, high corporate or government debt levels or China's property sector which could undergo a substantial correction after a period of over-investment.\n\nThe necessary adjustments in the Chinese property sector, a high ratio of debt to GDP and worsening business conditions will limit China's GDP growth in calendar 2022 to 5.7%. The European Union economy is expected to expand by 4.0% in calendar 2022, still supported by catch-up effects and announced stimulus programs becoming effective. In the U.S., GDP is expected to expand by 4.3%, where government spending has a negative effect on GDP growth, as it is reduced from calendar 2021 on, implying a negative fiscal impulse. An important pre-requisite is preventing federal limits on borrowing (the debt ceiling) from disrupting government operations and spending programs.\n\nGlobal fixed investments are expected to expand by 4.4% in calendar 2022, after already growing by 6.4% in calendar 2021. Important customer industries for Siemens are participating in the global recovery (e.g. electronics, pharma, materials, chemicals). Yet persistent supply bottlenecks have the potential to significantly derail this recovery, such as in the automotive sector due to semiconductor shortages. The infrastructure sector (particularly public transport and electricity grids) will benefit from various green stimulus programs.\n\nOverall, the market environment for Siemens is expected to remain favorable in fiscal 2022, but with some deceleration compared to fiscal 2021. Risks for the outlook are still substantial.\n\nThe forecasts presented here for GDP and fixed investments are based on a report from IHS Markit dated October 15, 2021.\n\n## 8.1.2 Siemens Group\n\nWe are basing our outlook for fiscal 2022 on the above-mentioned expectations and assumptions regarding the overall economic situation, including continuing healthy growth in global GDP albeit with slowing momentum, and also on the specific market conditions we expect for our respective industrial businesses, as described in chapter 3 Segment information. Furthermore, we assume that the challenges to our businesses from COVID-19 will ease during fiscal 2022. Although we also expect supply chain constraints to recede somewhat during fiscal 2022, we expect continued impacts from higher prices for raw materials and components and from wage increases, which we intend to mitigate by adjusting prices for our own products, solutions and services.\n\nWe are exposed to currency translation effects, mainly involving the U.S. dollar, the British pound and currencies of emerging markets, particularly the Chinese yuan. While we expect volatility in global currency markets to continue in fiscal 2022, we have improved our natural hedge on a global basis through geographic distribution of our production facilities in the past. Nevertheless, Siemens is still a net exporter from the Eurozone to the rest of the world, so a weak euro is principally favorable for our business and a strong euro is principally unfavorable. In addition to the natural hedging strategy just mentioned, we also hedge currency risk in our export business using derivative financial instruments. We expect these steps to help us limit effects on income related to currency in fiscal 2022. Based on currency exchange rates as of the beginning of November 2021, we do not expect significant currency effects on nominal growth rates in volume and profit for our businesses in fiscal 2022.\n\nThis outlook excludes burdens from legal and regulatory matters.\n\n## Segments\n\nWe expect our industrial businesses to continue their profitable growth.\n\nDigital Industries expects for fiscal 2022 to achieve comparable revenue growth of 5% to 8%. The profit margin is expected to be 19% to 21%, including known headwinds of up to two percentage points associated with the strategic transition to software as a service (SaaS) in parts of its large software business.\n\nSmart Infrastructure expects for fiscal 2022 comparable revenue growth of 5% to 8%. The profit margin is expected to be 12% to 13%.\n\nMobility expects for fiscal 2022 comparable revenue growth of 5% to 8%. The profit margin is expected to be 10.0% to 10.5%.",

        "page_content": "Siemens Healthineers expects to achieve comparable revenue growth in the range of 0% to 2% in fiscal 2022. The profit margin, which was 15.8% in fiscal 2021, is expected to continue to improve.\n\nSiemens Financial Services expects to further improve Earnings before taxes year-over-year. Return on equity (ROE) (after tax) is expected to reach the lower half of the new target range of 15% to 20%.\n\n## Revenue growth\n\nFor  comparable  revenue,  net  of  currency  translation  and  portfolio  effects,  we  expect  the  Siemens  Group  to  achieve  mid-single-digit growth. Furthermore, we anticipate that orders in fiscal 2022 will exceed revenue for a book-to-bill ratio above 1.\n\nAs of September 30, 2021, our order backlog totaled \u20ac85 billion, and we expect conversion from the backlog to strongly support revenue growth in fiscal 2022 with approximately \u20ac34 billion of past orders converted to current revenue. For expected conversion of order backlog to revenue for our respective segments, see chapter 3 Segment information.\n\n## Profitability\n\nWe assume that rigorous execution of our portfolio optimization strategy in fiscal 2022 will contribute similarly as in fiscal 2021, when we generated \u20ac1.5 billion in net income from the sale of our Flender business, divestment of our stakes in Bentley and ChargePoint, Inc., and revaluation of our stake in Thoughtworks. In October 2021, Siemens already recognized a \u20ac0.3 billion pretax gain (\u20ac0.2 billion after tax) related to its investment in Fluence Energy, LLC (Fluence).\n\nWe expect  our  fully  consolidated  units  within  Portfolio  Companies  to  reach  profit  margins  above  5%,  while  results  from  the  equity investment are expected to be volatile and negative.\n\nIn addition, results for Siemens Energy Investment, which includes Siemens' share of Siemens Energy AG's profit after tax, amounting to a negative \u20ac0.2 billion in fiscal 2021, is expected to improve; amortization of assets resulting from purchase price allocation due to the initial recognition of the investment at fair value in September 2020, which are also included in Siemens Energy Investment, are expected to decline to \u20ac0.1 billion in fiscal 2022, from \u20ac0.2 billion in fiscal 2021. We anticipate that Siemens Real Estate will continue with real estate disposals depending on market conditions, at a similar level as in fiscal 2021. Results for Innovation also are expected on the prioryear level, which was a negative \u20ac0.2 billion. Results related to Governance, were a negative \u20ac0.8 billion in fiscal 2021; we expect a substantial improvement in fiscal 2022, to a negative \u20ac0.5 billion. Centrally carried pension expense are expected to be on prior-year level, which was a negative \u20ac0.2 billion. Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations, which was \u20ac0.7 billion in fiscal 2021, is expected at \u20ac0.9 billion due mainly to the acquisition of Varian in April 2021. Financing, eliminations and other items, which were a positive \u20ac0.5 billion in fiscal 2021, are expected to include substantial parts of gains from revaluation and from divestments in fiscal 2022, resulting from our portfolio optimization strategy, among them the above-mentioned gain related to Fluence.\n\nWe anticipate our tax rate for fiscal 2022 to be in the range of 25% to 29%, depending strongly on portfolio-related gains, compared to 25% in fiscal 2021. This assumption does not take into consideration possible impacts from potential major tax reforms. We do not expect material influence on financial results from discontinued operations in fiscal 2022.\n\nOur forecast for net income takes into account a number of additional factors. We assume solid project execution to continue in fiscal 2022. We plan to increase the ratio of R&D expenses to revenue, which was 7.8% in fiscal 2021, to approximately 8% with a strong focus on software and digital technologies. Severance charges, which were \u20ac0.4 billion in fiscal 2021, are expected at \u20ac0.2 billion in fiscal 2022.\n\nGiven the above-mentioned assumptions, we expect profitable growth of our industrial businesses to drive an increase in net income and EPS pre PPA to a range of \u20ac8.70 to \u20ac9.10, up from \u20ac8.32 in fiscal 2021.\n\n## Capital efficiency\n\nFor fiscal 2022, we expect ROCE adjusted for defined Varian-related acquisition effects, which was 15.1% in fiscal 2021, to improve in our target range of 15% to 20%.\n\n## Capital structure\n\nFor our capital structure, defined as the ratio of industrial net debt to EBITDA (continuing operations), we expect in fiscal 2022 to achieve a ratio below the prior-year figure of 1.5. We assume that our targeted cash conversion rate of 1 minus the annual comparable revenue growth rate of the Group over a cycle of three to five years will support the achievement of the capital structure target in fiscal 2022.\n\n## 8.1.3 Overall assessment\n\nOur outlook for fiscal 2022 is based on continuing healthy growth in global GDP, albeit with slowing momentum, and our expectation that the challenges to our businesses from COVID-19 and supply chain constraints will ease during fiscal 2022. With these conditions and given our very strong fiscal year 2021, we expect our industrial businesses to continue their profitable growth.\n\nFor the Siemens Group we expect mid-single-digit comparable revenue growth, net of currency translation and portfolio effects, and a book-to-bill ratio above 1.\n\nWe expect profitable growth of our industrial businesses to drive an increase in EPS pre PPA to a range of \u20ac8.70 to \u20ac9.10, up from \u20ac8.32 in fiscal 2021. We assume that rigorous execution of our portfolio optimization strategy will contribute similarly as in fiscal 2021, when we generated \u20ac1.5 billion in net income from the sale of our Flender business, divestment of our stakes in Bentley and ChargePoint, and revaluation of our stake in Thoughtworks.\n\nThis outlook excludes burdens from legal and regulatory matters.\n\nOverall, the actual development for Siemens and its segments may vary, positively or negatively, from our outlook due to the risks and opportunities described below or if our expectations and assumptions do not materialize.",

        "page_content": "## 8.2 Risk management\n\n## 8.2.1 Basic principles of risk management\n\nOur risk  management policy stems from a philosophy of pursuing sustainable growth and creating economic value while managing appropriate risks and opportunities and avoiding inappropriate risks. As risk management is an integral part of how we plan and execute our business strategies, our risk management policy is set by the Managing Board. Our organizational and accountability structure requires each of the respective managements of our organizational units to implement risk management programs that are tailored to their specific industries and responsibilities, while being consistent with the overall policy.\n\n## 8.2.2 Enterprise risk management process\n\nWe have implemented and coordinated a set of risk management and control systems which support us in the early recognition of developments that could jeopardize the continuity of our business. The most important of these systems include our enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning is intended to support us in considering potential risks and opportunities well in advance of major business decisions, while management reporting is intended to enable us to monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management. Accordingly, if deficits are detected, it is possible to adopt appropriate measures for their elimination. This coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner.\n\nRisk  management  at  Siemens  builds  on  a  comprehensive,  interactive  and  management-oriented  Enterprise  Risk  Management  (ERM) approach that is integrated into the organization and that addresses both risks and opportunities. Our ERM approach is based on the globally accepted COSO Standard (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) Enterprise Risk Management Integrating with Strategy and Performance (2017) and the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) Standard 31000 (2018) and is adapted to Siemens requirements. The frameworks connect the ERM process with our financial reporting process and our internal control system. They consider a company's strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of its business operations, the reliability of its financial reporting and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.\n\nOur ERM process aims for early identification and evaluation of, and response regarding, risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing and effective measures and controls. If  risks  have  already  been considered in plans, budgets, forecasts or the consolidated financial statements (e.g. as a provision or risk contingency), they are supposed to be incorporated with their financial impact in the entity's business objectives. As a consequence, only additional  risks  arising  from  the  same  subject  (e.g.  deviations  from  business  objectives,  different  impact  perspectives)  should  be considered. In order to provide a comprehensive view of our business activities, risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle; we complement this periodic reporting with an ad-hoc reporting process that aims to escalate critical issues in a timely manner. Relevant risks and opportunities are evaluated in terms of impact and likelihood, considering different impact perspectives, including business objectives, reputation and regulatory  requirements.  The  bottom-up  identification  and  prioritization  process  is  supplemented  by  workshops  with  the  respective managements of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different  management  levels  and  are  included  in  the  subsequent  reporting  process,  if  found  to  be  relevant.  Reported  risks  and opportunities are analyzed regarding potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational units mentioned above.\n\nResponsibilities  are  assigned  for  all  relevant  risks  and  opportunities,  with  the  hierarchical  level  of  responsibility  depending  on  the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. In a first step, assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing one  of  our  general  response  strategies.  Our  general  response  strategies  with  respect  to  risks  are  avoidance,  transfer,  reduction  or acceptance of the relevant risk. Our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to 'seize' the relevant opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management. Accordingly, we have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the  risk  of  fluctuations  in  currency  and  interest  rates  by  engaging  in  hedging  activities.  Regarding  our  projects,  systematic  and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes, assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks in order to  reduce  our  exposure  to  such  risks  and  to  avoid  or  minimize  potential  losses.  Among  others,  we  address  the  risk  of  fluctuation  in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries, and by  adjusting  capacity  and  implementing  cost-reduction  measures  in  a  timely  and  consistent  manner  if  they  are  deemed  necessary. Worldwide there are risks from the transmission of infectious agents from animals to humans, from humans to humans and in other ways. Epidemic, pandemic or other infectious developments such as bioterrorism to cause high disease rates in countries, regions or continents. We constantly check information from the World Health Organization (WHO), the - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. and Europe, the Robert Koch Institute in Germany and other institutions in order to be able to identify early epidemic or pandemic risks and determine and initiate related mitigation actions as early as possible.\n\n## 8.2.3 Risk management organization and responsibilities\n\nTo oversee the ERM process and to further drive the integration and harmonization of existing control activities to align with legal and operational requirements, the Managing Board established a Risk Management and Internal Control Organization, led by the Head of Assurance. In order to allow for a meaningful discussion of risk at the Siemens Group level, this organization aggregates individual risks and opportunities of similar cause-and-effect nature into broader risk and opportunity themes. This aggregation naturally results in a mixture  of  risks,  including  those  with  a  primarily  qualitative  assessment  and  those  with  a  primarily  quantitative  risk  assessment. Accordingly, we do not adopt a purely quantitative assessment of risk and opportunity themes. Thematic risk and opportunity assessments",

The Head of Assurance assists the Managing Board with the operation and oversight of the risk and internal control system and reporting to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.\n\n## 8.3 Risks\n\nBelow we describe the risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business situation, financial condition (including effects on assets, liabilities and cash flows), results of operations and reputation. The order in which the risks are presented in each of the four categories reflects the currently estimated relative exposure for Siemens associated with these risks and thus provides an indication of the risks' current importance to us. Additional risks not known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business objectives and operations. Unless otherwise stated, the risks described below relate to all our organizational units.\n\n## 8.3.1 Strategic risks\n\nEconomic, political and geopolitical conditions: We see significant uncertainties regarding the global economic outlook. In particular, a renewed intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic could stall the recovery achieved to date, and even lead to a new recession, for example if current  vaccines  are  less  effective  with  new  variants,  leading  to  the  return  of  contact  restrictions  or  lockdowns.  There  is  also  great uncertainty about the long-term consequences of the pandemic for important Siemens customer industries, such as aerospace and nonresidential construction. Moreover, during the COVID-19 pandemic significant macroeconomic challenges have not been defused and in some cases, they have intensified. A renewed escalation of the trade conflict between the U.S. and China and an intensified de-coupling would significantly worsen global growth prospects. Adverse effects on confidence and investment activity would severely hit Siemens' business. Increasing trade barriers, protectionism, sanctions and in particular technical regulations would negatively impact production costs and productivity along our many value chains, as well as significantly impede or even hinder access to sales markets. A significant risk to our sales potential and cost structure is coming from mounting supply chain bottlenecks, due to growing lack of availability of intermediate goods, in particular electronic components. Bottlenecks in energy supply on the one hand and in access to raw materials on the other would substantially reduce industrial production potential. The escalating possibility of major defaults in the Chinese property sector, with potential spillover effects into the entire real estate market and financial markets, would significantly impact growth prospects of one of our core geographic markets and might have reverberations even on the global financial system and the world economy. A substantial increase in inflation rates could lead to serious distortions in global currency, capital, and foreign exchange markets, if central banks initiate the tightening cycle too fast and too aggressively. Highly indebted (emerging and industrialized) countries could suffer from increasing financing costs and a loss of investor confidence. Additional threats to the outlook could arise as well, ranging from market pressure to intensify austerity measures to declining confidence in individual currency markets. Additionally, a strong increase of raw material  and  intermediate  goods  prices  would  negatively  impact  Siemens's  cost  structure.  Other  significant  risks  could  arise  from geopolitical tensions (particularly in the Near and Middle East, Hong Kong and Taiwan), the European Union's relations with Russia, the economic vulnerability of several emerging markets (including Argentina, Turkey, Venezuela) and political upheavals. We are dependent on the economic development of certain industries; a continuation or even an intensification of the cyclical and structural headwinds in core customer industries, e.g., automotive or construction, would have adverse impact on our business prospects. Further business risk would result from an abrupt weakening of Chinese economic growth. A terrorist mega-attack or a significant cybercrime incident, or a series of such attacks or incidents in major economies, could depress economic activity globally and undermine consumer and business confidence. Additionally, the highly interconnected global economy remains vulnerable to natural disasters or further pandemics.\n\nIn general, due to long-cycle businesses in our organizational units and the importance of long-term contracts for Siemens, there is usually a  time lag between changes in macroeconomic conditions and their impact on our financial results. In contrast, short-cycle business activities react quickly to volatility in market demand. If the moderate growth of certain markets stalls again and if we are not successful in adapting our production and cost structure to subsequent changes in conditions in the markets in which we operate, there can be no assurance that we will not experience adverse effects. For example, our customers may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products, solutions and services, or fail to follow through on purchases or contracts already executed. Furthermore, the prices for our products, solutions and services may decline to a greater extent than we currently anticipate. In addition, it may become more difficult for our customers to obtain financing. Contracted payment terms, especially regarding the level of advance payments by our customers relating to long-term projects, may become less favorable, which could negatively impact our financial condition. Siemens' global setup with operations in almost all relevant economies, our wide range of offerings with varied exposures to business cycles, and our balanced mix of business models (e.g. equipment, components, systems, software, services and solutions) help us to absorb impacts from adverse developments in any single market.\n\nDisruptive technologies: The markets in which our businesses operate experience rapid and significant changes due to the introduction of innovative and disruptive technologies. In the fields of digitalization (e.g. IoT, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, Industry 4.0), there are risks associated with new competitors, substitutions of existing products/solutions/services, new business models (e.g. in terms of pricing, financing, extended scopes for project business or subscription models in the software business) and finally the risk that our competitors may have more advanced time-to-market strategies and introduce their disruptive products and solutions faster than Siemens. Our operating results depend to a significant extent on our technological leadership, our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in our markets and to optimize our cost base accordingly. Introducing new products and technologies requires a significant commitment to research and development, which in return requires expenditure of considerable financial resources that may not always result in success. Our results of operations may suffer if we invest in technologies that do not operate or may not be integrated as expected, or that are not accepted in the marketplace as anticipated, or if our products, solutions or systems are not introduced to the market in a timely manner, particularly  compared  to  our  competitors,  or  even  become  obsolete.  We  constantly  apply  for  new  patents  and  actively  manage  our intellectual property portfolio to secure our technological position. However, our patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling products and services that are similar to ours.\n\nCompetitive environment : The worldwide markets for our products, solutions and services are highly competitive in terms of pricing, product and service quality, product development and introduction time, customer service, financing terms and shifts in market demands. We face strong, established competitors as well as rising competitors from emerging markets and new industries, which may have a better cost structure. Some industries in which we operate are undergoing consolidation, which may result in stronger competition, a change in our relative market position, an increase in inventory of finished or work-in-progress goods, or unexpected price erosion.

We  address  these  risks  with  various  measures,  for  example  benchmarking,  strategic  initiatives,  sales  push  initiatives, executing  productivity  measures  and  target  cost  projects,  rightsizing  of  our  footprint,  outsourcings,  mergers  and  joint  ventures  and optimizing our product and service portfolio. We continuously monitor and analyze competitive, market and industry information in order to be able to anticipate unfavorable changes in the competitive environment rather than merely reacting to such changes.\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19): The COVID-19 situation may worsen, as the number of new infections is rising again in many countries. At the same time, the number of cases and the severe course of the disease will develop very differently depending on the respective vaccination  rate  in  the  countries.  The  impact  of  the  pandemic  therefore  varies  considerably  between  regions  and  customer  sectors. Governments and other local authorities are working to contain the spread of infection by implementing various countermeasures such as contact restrictions, adherence to minimum hygienic standards, wearing of respiratory masks, vaccine mandates, and vaccination and testing  services  to  avoid  widespread  curfews  and  restrictions  on  the  opening  of  certain  sectors  of  the  economy.  Depending  on epidemiological trends and political pressure, governments are expected to relax existing restrictions and avoid new ones to reduce the associated economic harm. The extent and duration of the individual impacts on our business are difficult to predict. For example, if containment measures are initiated at short notice or last an unpredictably long time, our business may be significantly impacted in ways that exceed current expectations and go beyond mitigation measures already in place. We could face unexpected closures of sites, factories or office buildings of our suppliers, customers or our own operations, which would affect our ability to produce or deliver our products, solutions and services. The most material uncertainties of the COVID-19 crisis are its continued duration, including for example potential further waves of infection, mutations of the virus and the evolution of global vaccination progress, and the economic costs of restrictions. Since the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we have felt the impact in our businesses, both our short-cycle businesses and project businesses, as, for example, customers cancelled orders or postponed investments, we were exposed to increased default risk, and our supply chain experienced difficulties in certain areas. Now we are seeing a recovery in many business sectors, and travel is also becoming easier. The longer  the  restrictive  measures  such  as  curfews  last,  the  deeper  the  resulting  recession  will  be.  Possible  consequences  include  an unchecked increase of public and private debt which hampers the post-crisis recovery, serious disruptions in the financial system and insolvencies among Siemens customers and suppliers. In the long term, a reversal of globalization could reduce potential future growth. Various task forces and crisis teams have been set up in all areas of Siemens to carefully monitor and mitigate the various impacts of COVID-19, with a focus on the health and safety of our employees through operational vaccination offers, testing concepts and making treatment offers available, and on business continuity. At the Group level, an executive-level crisis team at Group headquarters has worked out overarching decisions and coordinated the flow of information through the different levels of the organization, while empowering responsible management in each business and country to take appropriate action according to national and regional guidelines.\n\nIncreasing  sustainability  focus :  The  increasing  environmental,  social  and  governance  (ESG)  requirements  from  governments  and customers as well as financing restrictions from governments, customer demands and financing restrictions for greenhouse gas emitting technologies could result in additional costs. Additionally, business involvement in sensitive environmental, social or governance activities might be negatively perceived and trigger  adverse  media  attention.  This  could  lead  to  reputational  damage  and  have  an  impact  on achieving our business goals. In fiscal 2021 we introduced a binding ESG risk framework and with it an optimized due diligence process. This supports Siemens businesses with due diligence in the customer-oriented environment with a view to possible environmental and social risks as well as related human rights and reputational risks.\n\nPortfolio measures, at-equity investments, other investments and strategic alliances : Our strategy includes divesting our activities in some  business  areas  and  strengthening  others  through  portfolio  measures,  including  mergers  and  acquisitions.  With  respect  to divestments, we may not be able to divest some of our activities as planned, and the divestitures we do carry out could have a negative impact on our business situation, financial condition, results of operations and reputation. Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky because of difficulties that may arise when integrating people, operations, technologies and products. There can be no assurance that any of the businesses we acquire can be integrated successfully and in a timely manner as originally planned, or that they will perform as anticipated once integrated. In addition, we may incur significant acquisition, administrative, tax and other expenditures in connection with these transactions, including costs related to integration of acquired businesses. Furthermore, portfolio measures may result in additional financing needs and adversely affect our capital structure. Acquisitions can lead to substantial additions to intangible assets, including goodwill, in our statements of financial position. If we were to encounter continuing adverse business developments or if we were otherwise to perform worse than expected at acquisition activities, then these intangible assets, including goodwill, might have to be impaired, which could adversely affect our business situation, financial condition and results of operations. Our investment portfolio includes  investments  held  for  purposes  other  than  trading  and  other  investments.  Any  factors  negatively  influencing  the  financial condition and results of operations of our at-equity investments and other investments could have an adverse effect on our equity pickup related to these investments or may result in a related write-off. In addition, our business situation, financial condition and results of operations could also be adversely affected in connection with loans, guarantees or non-compliance with financial covenants related to these  investments.  Furthermore,  such  investments  are  inherently  risky  as  we  may  not  be  able  to  sufficiently  influence  corporate governance processes or business decisions taken by our at-equity investments, other investments and strategic alliances, which may have a negative effect on our business and especially on our reputation. In addition, joint ventures bear the risk of difficulties that may arise when integrating people, operations, technologies and products. Strategic alliances may also pose risks for us because we compete in some  business  areas  with  companies  with  which  we  have  strategic  alliances.  Besides  other  measures,  we  handle  these  risks  with standardized processes as well as dedicated roles and responsibilities in the areas of mergers, acquisitions, divestments and carve-outs. This includes the systematic treatment of all contractual obligations and post-closing claims.\n\n## 8.3.2 Operational risks\n\nCyber/Information security :  Digital technologies are deeply integrated into our business portfolio. Further integration of information technology  into  products  and  services  in  conjunction  with  changing  business  strategies  (such  as  outsourcing,  globally  distributed development, a lesser degree of sole production) are leading to an increasingly distributed supply chain, making efficient controls difficult. The fact of a large number of suppliers requires a significant effort for the initial and regular verification of the effective implementation of cybersecurity requirements by suppliers. Siemens business entities might lose market access if their products, solutions and services do not comply with increased regulations and legal requirements for cybersecurity in their respective countries. We observe a global increase",

        "page_content": "of cybersecurity threats and higher levels of professionalism in computer crime, which pose a risk to the security of products, systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data. According to various external data sources, this trend has accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Especially the number of phishing attacks as well as the number of malicious websites have increased significantly.  Moreover,  the  information  technology  market  is  concentrated  among  a  small  number  of  information  technology  and software vendors, which could lead to dependence on a single provider. There can be no assurance that the measures aimed at protecting our intellectual property and portfolio will address these threats under all circumstances. There is a risk that confidential information (data privacy) may be stolen or that the integrity of our portfolio may be compromised, e.g. by attacks on our networks, social engineering, data manipulations in critical applications and a loss of critical resources, resulting in financial damages. Cybersecurity covers the IT of our entire enterprise including office IT, systems and applications, special purpose networks, and our operating environments such as manufacturing and  research  and  development  (R&D).  Like  other  large  multinational  companies,  we  face  active  cyber  threats  from  sophisticated adversaries that are supported by organized crime and nation-states engaged in economic espionage or even sabotage. We strive to mitigate  these  risks  by  employing  a  number  of  measures,  including  employee  training,  considering  new  models  of  flexible  working environments, and comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems through cyber defense with an artificial intelligence solution to identify attacks faster and prevent damage to society and especially to critical infrastructures, our customers, our partners and Siemens overall. We initiated the industrial 'Charter of Trust,' signed by a growing group of global companies, which sets out principles for building trust in digital technologies and creating a more secure digital world. Nonetheless, our systems, products, solutions and services, as well as  those  of  our  service  providers,  remain  potentially  vulnerable  to  attacks.  Such  attacks  could  potentially  lead  to  the  publication, manipulation or leakage of information such as through industrial espionage. They could also result in deliberate improper use of our systems,  vulnerable  products,  production  downtimes  and  supply  shortages,  with  potential  adverse  effects  on  our  reputation,  our competitiveness and results of operations. For increased protection of Siemens and reduction of a potential financial impact caused by cyber incidents, the risk transfer possibilities have been evaluated. As a result of an international insurance tender, the currently insurable cybersecurity risks have been to a partial extent transferred to a consortium of insurance companies.\n\nSupply chain management : The financial performance of our operating units depends on reliable and effective supply chain management for  components,  sub-assemblies  and  materials.  Capacity  constraints  and  supply  shortages  resulting  from  ineffective  supply  chain management may lead to production bottlenecks, delivery delays, quality issues and additional costs. We also rely on third parties to supply us with parts, components and services. Using third parties to manufacture, assemble and test our products may reduce our control over manufacturing yields, quality assurance, product delivery schedules and costs. Although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid supplyrelated problems, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter supply problems in the future, especially if we use single-source suppliers for critical components. Shortages and delays could materially harm our businesses. Unanticipated increases in the price of components or raw materials due to market shortages or other reasons could also adversely affect performance. Furthermore, we may be exposed to the risk of delays and interruptions in the supply chain as a consequence of catastrophic events (including pandemics), cyber incidents or suppliers' financial difficulties, particularly if we are unable to identify alternative sources of supply or means of transportation in a timely manner or at all. Besides other measures, we mitigate price fluctuation in global raw material markets with various hedging instruments.\n\nInternal programs and initiatives : We are in a continuous process of operational optimization and constantly engage in cost-reduction initiatives,  including  ongoing  capacity  adjustment  measures  and  structural  initiatives.  Consolidation  of  business  activities  and manufacturing facilities, outsourcings, joint ventures and the streamlining of product portfolios are all part of these cost-reduction efforts. These measures may not be implemented as planned, may turn out to be less effective than anticipated, may become effective later than estimated or may not become effective at all. Any future contribution of these measures to our profitability will be influenced by the actual savings achieved and by our ability to sustain them. In case of restructuring and outsourcing activities, there could be delays in product deliveries or we might even experience delivery failures. Furthermore, delays in critical R&D projects could lead to negative impacts in running projects. We constantly control and monitor the progress of these projects and initiatives using standardized controlling and milestone tracking approaches.\n\nProject-related risks : A number of our segments conduct activities under long-term contracts that are awarded on a competitive bidding basis. Such contracts typically arise at Mobility and in various activities of Smart Infrastructure or Portfolio Companies. Some of these contracts are inherently risky because we may assume substantially all of the risks associated with completing a project and meeting postcompletion warranty obligations. For example, we may face the risk that we must satisfy technical requirements of a project even though we have not gained experience with those requirements before winning the project. The profit margins realized on fixed-priced contracts may vary from original estimates as a result of changes in costs and productivity over a contract's term. We sometimes bear the risk of unanticipated project modifications, shortage of key personnel, quality problems, financial difficulties of our customers and/or significant partners, cost overruns or contractual penalties caused by unexpected technological problems, unexpected developments at the project sites,  unforeseen  changes  or  difficulties  in  the  regulatory  or  political  environment,  performance  problems  with  our  suppliers, subcontractors  and  consortium  partners  or  other  logistical  difficulties.  Some  of  our  multi-year  contracts  also  contain  demanding installation and maintenance requirements in addition to other performance criteria relating to timing, unit cost and compliance with government regulations, which, if not satisfied, could subject us to substantial contractual penalties, damages, non-payment and contract termination.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  contracts  and  projects,  in  particular  those  with  long-term  duration  and  fixed-priced calculation, can be completed profitably. To tackle those risks, we established a global project management organization to systematically improve the technical and commercial capabilities of our project management personnel. For very complex projects we conduct dedicated risk assessments in very early stages of the sales phase before we decide to hand over a binding offer to our customers.\n\nShortage of skilled personnel : Competition for diverse and highly qualified personnel (e.g. specialists, experts, digital talent) remains intense in the industries and regions in which our businesses operate. We have ongoing demand for highly skilled employees and a need to enhance diversity, inclusion and sense of belonging in our workforce. Our future success depends in part on our continued ability to identify, assess and hire engineers, digital talent and other qualified personnel. We must also integrate, develop and retain them after they join us, which appears especially relevant in times of a new, increasingly virtual working environment. We address these topics for example by strengthening the capabilities and skills of our talent acquisition teams and a strategy of proactive search for people with the required capabilities in our respective industries and markets. Technology and digitalization help us to be more effective in attracting and selecting diverse talent. Furthermore, we have a focus on diversity and structured succession planning.",

        "page_content": "## 8.3.3 Financial risks\n\nRisks from pension obligations : The provisions for pensions and similar obligations may be affected by changes in actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate, as well as by movements in financial markets or a change in the mix of assets in our investment portfolio. Additionally, they are subject to legal risks with regard to plan design among other factors. A significant increase in the underfunding may have a negative effect on our capital structure and rating, and thus may tighten refinancing options and increase costs. In order to comply with local pension regulations in selected foreign countries, we may face an economic risk of increasing cash outflows due to change in funding level according to local regulations of our pension plans in these countries or to changes in the regulations themselves.\n\nAudits by tax authorities and changes in tax regulations : We operate in nearly all countries of the world and therefore are subject to many different tax regulations. Changes in tax laws in any of these jurisdictions could result in higher tax expenses and increased tax payments. Furthermore, legislative changes could impact our tax receivables and liabilities as well as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. In addition, the uncertain legal environment in some regions could limit our ability to enforce our rights. As a globally operating organization,  we  conduct  business  in  countries  subject  to  complex  tax  rules,  which  may  be  interpreted  in  different  ways.  Future interpretations or developments of tax regimes may affect our business situation, financial condition and results of operations. We are regularly audited by tax authorities in various jurisdictions and we continuously identify and assess relevant risks.\n\nMarket price risks : We are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates, especially between the U.S. dollar and the euro, because a high percentage of our business volume is conducted as exports from Europe to areas using the U.S. dollar. In addition, we are exposed to effects involving the currencies of emerging markets, in particular the Chinese yuan. Appreciable changes in euro exchange rates could materially change our competitive position. We are also exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. Even hedging activities to mitigate such risks may result in a reverse effect. Fluctuations in exchange or interest rates, negative developments in the financial markets and changes in central bank policies could therefore negatively impact our financial results.\n\nLiquidity and financing risks : Our treasury and financing activities could face adverse deposit and/or financing conditions from negative developments related to financial markets, such as limited availability of funds and hedging instruments, an updated evaluation of our solvency, particularly from rating agencies, negative interest rates, and impacts arising from more restrictive regulation of the financial sector, central bank policy, or the usage of financial instruments. Widening credit spreads due to uncertainty and risk aversion in the financial  markets  might  lead  to  adverse  changes  in  the  market  values  of  our  financial  assets,  in  particular  our  derivative  financial instruments.\n\nCredit risks : We provide our customers with various forms of direct and indirect financing of orders and projects, including guarantees. Siemens Financial Services in particular bears credit risks due to such financing activities if, for example, customers do not meet obligations arising from these financing arrangements, meet them only partially, or meet them late.\n\nFor further information on post-employment benefits, derivative financial instruments, hedging activities, financial risk management and related measures, see Notes 17, 24 and 25 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2021.\n\n## 8.3.4 Compliance risks\n\nCurrent  and  future  investigations  regarding  allegations  of  corruption,  of  antitrust  violations  and  of  other  violations  of  law : Proceedings against us or our business partners regarding allegations of corruption, of antitrust violations and of other violations of law may lead to fines as well as penalties, sanctions, injunctions against future conduct, profit disgorgements, disqualifications from directly and indirectly engaging in certain types of business, the loss of business licenses or permits, other restrictions and legal consequences as well as negative public media coverage. Accordingly, we may, among other things, be required to comply with potential obligations and liabilities arising in connection with such investigations and proceedings, including potential tax penalties. Moreover, any findings related to public corruption that are not covered by the 2008 and 2009 corruption charge settlements, which we concluded with U.S. and German authorities, may endanger our business with government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational organizations. Monitors could again be appointed to review future business practices and we may otherwise be required to further modify our business practices and our compliance program.\n\nIn its global business, Siemens does part of its business with state-owned enterprises and governments. We also participate in a number of projects funded by government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational organizations, such as multilateral development banks. Ongoing or potential future investigations into allegations of corruption, antitrust violations or other violations of law could as well impair relationships with such parties or could result in our exclusion from public contracts. Such investigations may also adversely affect existing private business relationships and our ability to pursue potentially important strategic projects and transactions, such as strategic alliances, joint ventures or other business alliances, or could result in the cancellation of certain of our existing contracts. Moreover, third parties, including our competitors, could initiate significant litigation.\n\nIn addition, future developments in ongoing and potential future investigations, such as responding to the requests of governmental authorities  and  cooperating  with  them,  could  divert  management's  attention  and  resources  from  other  issues  facing  our  business. Furthermore, we might be exposed to compliance risks in connection with recently acquired operations that are in the ongoing process of integration.\n\nAlong  with  other  measures,  Siemens  has  established  a  global  compliance  organization  that  conducts  among  others  compliance  risk mitigation  processes  such  as  Compliance  Risk  Assessments  or  initiates  internal  audit  activities  performed  by  the  internal  assurance department.\n\nChanges of regulations, laws and policies :  As a diversified company with global businesses we are exposed to various product- and country-related regulations, laws and policies influencing our business activities and processes. According to observations and analysis, there is an increasing risk that existing technical regulations in target markets will suddenly change, or new ones will be set in force, which determine market access criteria that our products do not meet. The affected products would lose marketability in this market. The way of resolving the risk of a sales-stop depends on the case of how to correct the non-conformity. In case the product can technically stay as is, while it has to undergo new and additional conformity assessment and certification, there will be considerable effort and cost to carry out the needed testing and certification procedures. In a worse case, the affected product will need re-engineering or re-design to meet the requirements of the changed or new technical regulation even before it can become re-assessed and certified for market approval.",

        "page_content": "The latter case will cause significant extra effort and cost to do the needed product changes and to maintain the country-specific product variant as an additional derivate item in the portfolio. In the worst case, if the two aforementioned ways of maintaining the product's marketability prove to be not feasible, sale of the affected product in the market has to be stopped. We monitor the political and regulatory landscape in all  our  key  markets  to  anticipate  potential  problem  areas,  with  the  aim  of  quickly  adjusting  our  business  activities  and processes to changed conditions. However, any changes in regulations, laws and policies could adversely affect our business activities and processes as well as our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nProtectionism  (including  tariffs/trade  war) :  Protectionist  trade  policies,  de-coupling  and  changes  in  the  political  and  regulatory environment in the markets in which we operate, such as import and export controls, tariffs and other trade barriers including debarment from certain markets and price or exchange controls, could affect our business in national markets and could impact our business situation, financial position and results of operations; and may expose us to penalties, other sanctions and reputational damage. In addition, the uncertainty of the legal environment in some regions could limit our ability to enforce our rights and subject us to increasing costs related to appropriate compliance programs.\n\nGeopolitical uncertainties including sanctions and export control :  As  a  globally operating organization, we conduct business with customers in countries which are subject to export control regulations, embargoes, economic sanctions, debarment policies or other forms of trade restrictions (hereafter referred to as 'sanctions') imposed by the U.S., the EU, China or other countries or organizations. New or expanded sanctions in countries in which we do business may result in a curtailment of our existing business in such countries or indirectly in other countries. We are also aware of policies of national authorities and institutional investors, such as pension funds or insurance companies, requiring divestment of interests in and prohibiting investment in and transactions with entities doing business with countries identified by the U.S. Department of State as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, it is possible that such policies may result in our being unable to gain or retain certain investors or customers. In addition, the termination of our activities in sanctioned countries may expose us to customer claims and other actions. Our reputation could also suffer due to our activities with counterparties in or affiliated with these countries.\n\nEnvironmental, health & safety and other governmental regulations : Some of the industries in which we operate are highly regulated. Current and future environmental, health and safety and other governmental regulations or changes thereto may require us to change the way we run our operations and could result in significant increases in our operating or production costs. Furthermore, we see the risk of potential environmental and health and safety incidents as well as potential non-compliance with environmental and health and safety regulations  affecting  Siemens  and  our  contractors  or  sub-suppliers,  resulting  for  example  in  serious  injuries,  business  interruptions, penalties, loss of reputation and internal or external investigations.\n\nIn addition, while we have procedures in place to ensure compliance with applicable governmental regulations in the conduct of our business operations, it cannot be excluded that violations of applicable governmental regulations may be caused either by us or by third parties  that  we  contract  with,  including  suppliers  or  service  providers  whose  activities  may  be  attributed  to  us.  Any  such  violations particularly expose us to the risk of liability, penalties, fines, reputational damage or loss of licenses or permits that are important to our business operations. In particular, we could also face liability for damage or remediation for environmental contamination at the facilities we design or operate. With regard to certain environmental risks, we maintain liability insurance at levels that our management believes are appropriate and consistent with industry practice. We may incur environmental losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of such insurance, and such losses may have an adverse effect on our business situation, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nCurrent or future litigation and legal and regulatory proceedings : Siemens is and potentially will be involved in numerous legal disputes and proceedings in various jurisdictions. These legal disputes and proceedings could result, in particular, in Siemens being subject to payment of damages and punitive damages, equitable remedies or sanctions, fines or disgorgement of profit. In individual cases this may also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits. Asserted claims are generally subject  to  interest  rates.  Some  of  these  legal  disputes  and  proceedings  could  result  in  adverse  decisions  for  Siemens  or  decisions, assessments or requirements of regulatory authorities could deviate from our expectations, which may have material effects on our business activities as well as our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Siemens maintains liability insurance for certain legal risks at levels our management believes are appropriate and consistent with industry practice. The insurance policy, however, does not protect Siemens against reputational damage. Moreover, Siemens may incur losses relating to legal proceedings beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of such insurance or exceeding any provisions made for losses related to legal proceedings. Finally, there can be no assurance that Siemens will be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms in the future.\n\nFor additional information with respect to specific proceedings, see Note 22 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2021.\n\n## 8.3.5 Assessment of the overall risk situation\n\nThe  most  significant  challenges  have  been  mentioned  first  in  each  of  the  four  risk  categories:    strategic,  operational,  financial  and compliance.\n\nWhile our assessments of individual risks have changed during fiscal 2021 due to developments in the external environment, changes in our business portfolio, effects of our own mitigation measures and the revision of our risk assessment, the overall risk situation for Siemens did not change significantly as compared to the prior year. We currently see the operational risk cyber/information security as the most significant challenge for us followed by the strategic risk arising from economic, political and geopolitical conditions.\n\nAt present, no risks have been identified that either individually or in combination could endanger our ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## 8.4 Opportunities\n\nWithin our ERM we regularly identify, evaluate and respond to opportunities that present themselves in our various fields of activity. Below we describe our most significant opportunities. Unless otherwise stated, the opportunities described relate to all organizational units. The order  in  which  the  opportunities  are  presented  reflects  the  currently  estimated  relative  exposure  for  Siemens  associated  with  these opportunities  and  thus  provides  an  indication  of  the  opportunities'  current  importance  to  us.  The  described  opportunities  are  not",

        "page_content": "necessarily the only ones we encounter. In addition, our assessment of opportunities is subject to change because the Company, our markets and technologies are constantly advancing. It is also possible that opportunities we see today will never materialize.\n\nFavorable political and regulatory environment (including sustainability) : We see opportunities from potential improvement in the geopolitical policy environment, which could quickly restore a more positive industrial investment sentiment that supports the growth of our markets. In addition, government initiatives and subsidies (including tax reforms, recovery plans among others) may lead to more government spending (e.g. infrastructure,  healthcare  or  digitalization  investments)  and  ultimately  result  in  an  opportunity  for  us  to participate in ways that increase our revenue and profit. By enabling our customers to lower their GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions across our portfolio and by reducing CO2 emission in our own operation, Siemens strives to support the trend towards a low-carbon economy. Siemens also welcomes and supports from an opportunity perspective, recent legislative and governmental accelerate to mitigate climate change worldwide, especially in Europe through e.g. the Green Deal or Sustainable Finance Initiative.\n\nMergers, acquisitions, equity investments, partnerships, divestments and streamlining our portfolio :  We constantly monitor our current and potential markets to identify opportunities for strategic mergers, acquisitions, equity investments and partnerships, which may complement our organic growth. Such activities may help us to strengthen our position in our existing markets, provide access to new or underserved markets, or complement our technological portfolio in strategic areas. Opportunities might also arise when portfolio optimization measures generate gains, which enable us to further pursue our other strategies for growth and profitability.\n\nValue creation through innovation : We drive innovation by investing significantly in R&D in order to develop sustainable solutions for our  customers  while  also  strengthening  our  own  competitiveness.  Being  an  innovative  company  and  constantly  inventing  new technologies that we expect will meet future demands arising from the megatrends of demographic change, urbanization, climate change and globalization is one of our core purposes. We are granted thousands of new patents every year and continuously develop new concepts and convincing new digital and data-driven business models. This helps us create the next generation of ground-breaking innovations in such fields as digitalization, artificial intelligence, autonomous machines and edge computing. Across our operating units, we are profiting from our strength in the 'Digital Enterprise.' Foremost, our cloud-based MindSphere platform enhances the availability of our customers' digital products and systems and improves their productivity and efficiency. We offer edge computing apps along with MindSphere in individual  facilities,  so  that  customers  can  connect  all  their  facilities  to  create  an  integrated  data  network.  We  see  also  significant opportunities to generate additional volume and profit from innovative digital products, services and solutions, including cyber security and applications for optimized energy consumption. We see growth opportunities in opening up access to new markets and customers through  new  marketing  and  sales  strategies,  which  we  implement  in  our  operating  units.  Our  position  along  the  value  chains  of automation and digitalization allows us to further increase market penetration. Along these value chains, we have identified several concrete growth fields in which we see our greatest long-term potential. Hence, we are combining and developing our resources and capabilities for these growth fields.\n\nTurning COVID-19 challenges into opportunities : The participation in governmental COVID-19 recovery programs such as the European Union's 'Next Generation EU\" recovery plan is an opportunity for Siemens. There is also the chance to strengthen our customer relationship through additional market offerings that specifically address use cases related directly to the COVID-19 pandemic. Potential growth areas might arise through the optimization program \"new normal\" with, for example, more working flexibility for our employees.\n\nOptimization of organization and processes : On the one hand, we leverage ideas to drive further improvements in our processes and cost structure, such as common computing architecture for image processing or optimizing factory capacities for shorter lead times. On the other hand, we see an opportunity of further penetrating markets by ramping up local business excellence (e.g. engineering) and increasing local sourcing and local manufacturing.\n\nAssessment of the overall opportunities situation : The most significant opportunity for Siemens is favorable political and regulatory environment (including sustainability) as described above.\n\nWhile our assessments of individual opportunities have changed during fiscal 2021 due to developments in the external environment, changes in our business portfolio, our endeavors to profit from them and revision of our strategic plans, the overall opportunity situation for Siemens did not change significantly as compared to the prior year.\n\n## 8.5 Significant characteristics of the accounting-related internal control and risk management system\n\nThe overarching objective of our accounting-related internal control and risk management system is to ensure that financial reporting is conducted in a proper manner, such that the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report of Siemens Group as well as the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG as the parent company are prepared in accordance with all relevant regulations.\n\nOur  ERM  approach  is  based  on  the  globally  accepted  COSO  Standard  (Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway Commission) Enterprise Risk Management - Integrating with Strategy and Performance (2017) and the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) Standard 31000 (2018) and is adapted to Siemens requirements. The frameworks connect the ERM process with our financial reporting process and our internal control system. They consider a company's strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of its business operations, the reliability of its financial reporting and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important. Our accounting-related internal control system is based on the internationally recognized Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) also developed by COSO. The two systems are complementary.\n\nAt the end of each fiscal year, our management performs an evaluation of the effectiveness of the implemented control system, both in design  and  operating  effectiveness.  We  have  a  standardized  procedure  under  which  necessary  controls  are  defined,  documented  in accordance  with  uniform  standards,  and  tested  regularly  for  their  effectiveness.  Nevertheless,  there  are  inherent  limitations  on  the effectiveness of any control system, and no system, including one determined to be effective, may prevent or detect all misstatements.\n\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared on the basis of a centrally issued conceptual framework which primarily consists of uniform Financial Reporting Guidelines and a chart of accounts. For Siemens AG and other companies within the Siemens Group required to prepare financial statements in accordance with German Commercial Code, this conceptual framework is complemented by mandatory regulations specific to the German Commercial Code. The need for adjustments in the conceptual framework due to regulatory changes",

Accounting departments are informed quarterly about current topics and deadlines from an accounting and closing process perspective.\n\nThe base data used in preparing our financial statements consists of the closing data reported by the operations of Siemens AG and its subsidiaries.  The  preparation  of  the  closing  data  of  most  of  our  entities  is  supported  by  an  internal  shared  services  organization. Furthermore,  other  accounting  activities,  such  as  governance  and  monitoring  activities,  are  usually  bundled  on  a  regional  level.  In particular cases, such as valuations relating to post-employment benefits, we use external experts. The reported closing data is used to prepare the financial statements in the consolidation system. The steps necessary to prepare the financial statements are subject to both manual and automated controls.\n\nQualification  of  employees involved in the accounting process is ensured through appropriate selection processes and training. As a fundamental principle, based on materiality considerations, the 'four eyes' principle applies, and specific procedures must be adhered to for data authorization. Additional control mechanisms include target-performance comparisons and analyses of the composition of and changes in individual line items, both in the closing data submitted by reporting units and in the Consolidated Financial Statements. In line  with  our  information  security  requirements,  accounting-related  IT  systems  contain  defined  access  rules  protecting  them  from unauthorized access. The manual and system-based control mechanisms referred to above generally also apply when reconciling the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) closing data to the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, we execute an internal certification process. Management at different levels of our organization, supported by confirmations by managements of entities under their responsibility, confirms the accuracy of the financial data that has been reported to Siemens' corporate headquarters and reports on the effectiveness of the related control systems.\n\nSiemens Healthineers is subject to our Group-wide principles for the accounting-related internal control and risk management system and is responsible for adhering to those principles. The management of Siemens Healthineers provides periodic signoffs to the Managing Board of Siemens AG, certifying the effectiveness of its accounting-related internal control system as well as the completeness, accuracy, and reliability of the financial data reported to us.\n\nAfter the acquisition of Varian, Siemens Healthineers has commenced to integrate the former Varian entities into our accounting-related internal control and risk management system. The integration efforts for the accounting-related internal control system will continue in fiscal 2022.\n\nOur internal audit function systematically evaluates our financial reporting integrity, the effectiveness of the control system and the risk management system, and adherence to our compliance policies. Siemens Healthineers has its own internal audit department and annual audit plan. Topics from the annual audit plan of Siemens Healthineers that are also relevant for our Managing Board and Audit Committee must be mandated first by Siemens Healthineers' Managing Board and Audit Committee and subsequently by our Managing Board and Audit Committee. The audit procedures for these topics will be generally executed by joint teams including members of our and Siemens Healthineers' internal audit functions, thus respecting the interests of both Siemens AG and Siemens Healthineers. In addition, the Audit Committee is integrated into our control system. In particular, it oversees the accounting and accounting process and the effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system and the internal audit system. Moreover, we have rules for accounting-related complaints.",

Siemens AG\n\nThe  Annual  Financial  Statements  of  Siemens  AG  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  regulations  set  forth  in  the  German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) and the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz).\n\nIn  fiscal  2021,  results  for  Siemens  AG  arise  mainly  from  the  business  activities  of  Digital  Industries  and  Smart  Infrastructure  and  are influenced significantly by the results of subsidiaries and investments we own either directly or indirectly. The business development of Siemens AG is fundamentally subject to the same risks and opportunities as the Siemens Group. Therefore, the foregoing explanations for the Siemens Group apply also for Siemens AG.\n\nThe Supervisory Board and the Managing Board propose from the unappropriated net income of Siemens AG for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, amounting to \u20ac3,400 million to distribute a dividend of \u20ac4.00 per share of no par value entitled to the dividend. The proposed dividend represents a total payout of \u20ac3.2 billion based on the estimated number of shares entitled to dividend at the date of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Based on Net income of Siemens group attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG of \u20ac6.2 billion for fiscal 2021, the dividend payout percentage is 52%. We intend to continue providing an attractive return to our shareholders. This includes striving for a dividend per share that exceeds the amount of the preceding year, or that at least matches the prior-year-level. For fiscal 2022, we expect that net income of Siemens AG will be sufficient to fund the distribution of a corresponding dividend.\n\nAs of September 30, 2021, the number of employees was 49.100.\n\n## 9.1 Results of operations\n\nStatement of Income of Siemens AG in accordance with German Commercial Code (condensed)\n\n|                                                                                     | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   | % Change   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                                                  | 2021          | 2020          |            |\n| Revenue                                                                             | 15,094        | 16,389        | (8)%       |\n| Cost of Sales                                                                       | (10,960)      | (12,032)      | 9%         |\n| Gross profit                                                                        | 4,135         | 4,357         | (5)%       |\n| as percentage of revenue                                                            | 27%           | 27%           |            |\n| Research and development expenses                                                   | (1,570)       | (1,677)       | 6%         |\n| Selling and general administrative expenses                                         | (2,999)       | (3,490)       | 14%        |\n| Other operating income (expenses), net                                              | (196)         | (555)         | 65%        |\n| Financial income, net thereof Income from investments, net 5,303 (prior year 8,078) | 5,797         | 6,557         | (12)%      |\n| Income from business activity                                                       | 5,166         | 5,192         | 0%         |\n| Income taxes                                                                        | (20)          | 78            | n/a        |\n| Net income                                                                          | 5,147         | 5,270         | (2)%       |\n| Profit carried forward                                                              | 171           | 141           | 22%        |\n| Allocation to other retained earnings                                               | (1,918)       | (2,436)       | 21%        |\n| Unappropriated net income                                                           | 3,400         | 2,975         | 14%        |\n\nThe decrease of revenue and cost of sales was due mainly to the business activities of Gas and Power which, effective with the beginning of calendar year 2020, were transferred to Siemens Energy Global GmbH & Co. KG in preparation of the Siemens Energy spin-off completed in September 2020.\n\nOn a geographical basis, 76% of revenue was generated in the Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East region, 17% in the Asia, Australia region and 7% in the Americas region. Exports from Germany accounted for 54% of overall revenue. In fiscal 2021, orders for Siemens AG amounted to \u20ac15.7 billion.\n\nResearch and development expenses and selling and general administrative expenses decreased due mainly to the above-mentioned transfer of the business activities of Gas and Power.\n\nThe R&D intensity (R&D as a percentage of revenue) was 10%, on the same level as fiscal 2020. The research and development activities of  Siemens  AG  are  fundamentally  the  same  as  for  its  corresponding  business  activities  within  the  Siemens  Group.  Research  and development expenses in both periods related mainly to Digital Industries. On an average basis, we employed 7,000 people in R&D in fiscal 2021.\n\nThe change in other operating income (expenses), net , was mainly due to higher expenses in fiscal 2020, which included expenses related to the valuation of an investment as well as expenses related to the spin-off of Siemens Energy.\n\nThe decrease in financial income, net was due primarily to lower income from investments, net, partly offset by a positive change in other financial income (expenses), net. The primary factors in lower income from investments, net were the following: a profit transfer agreement with Siemens Beteiligungen Inland GmbH, Germany, which reduced income by \u20ac0.9 billion; a decline in income from the investment in Siemens Holdings plc, Ltd., United Kingdom, of \u20ac0.7 billion; and a decrease of \u20ac0.5 billion in income from Siemens Ltd, China. Furthermore, fiscal 2020 included a gain of \u20ac2.1 billion from the disposal of Siemens Limited, India, which was partly offset by an impairment of \u20ac1.3 billion on the stake in Siemens Energy AG. In contrast, a gain of \u20ac0.9 billion from the sale of Flender GmbH, Germany in fiscal 2021 was recorded in income from investments, net. The positive change in other financial income (expenses), net included an increase  in  gains  from  non-current  securities  by  \u20ac0.5  billion  and  a  reduction  of  expenses  by  \u20ac0.4  billion  from  impairments  of  loan receivables  related  to  an  investment.  Higher  gains  from  non-current  securities  were  driven  by  a  transfer  of  investment  funds  and corresponding realization of hidden reserves as mentioned below.",

The supplemental fundings included stakes in Bentley Systems, Inc. in the amount of \u20ac1.0 billion and in ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. in the amount of \u20ac0.3 billion, as well as zero-coupon receiver swaps in the amount of \u20ac0.3  billion.  The  measures  to  simplify  the  investment  structure  included  a  transfer  of  investment  funds  at  fair  value  of  \u20ac4.8  billion (including realization of hidden reserves) to shares in affiliated companies, which led to a disposal of securities with a carrying amount of \u20ac4.1 billion in the fixed assets register. In addition to these transactions Siemens recorded the disposal of Flender GmbH in the fixed assets register, at a carrying amount of \u20ac1.0 billion.\n\nThe change in cash and cash equivalents, other securities related to the liquidity management of the Corporate Treasury of Siemens AG, which was focused not solely on the business activities of Siemens AG. The liquidity management is based on the financing policy of the Siemens Group, which is aimed towards a balanced financing portfolio, a diversified maturity profile and a comfortable liquidity cushion.  Intra-group  financing  activities  drove  both  an  increase  in  receivables  from  affiliated  companies,  which  resulted  in  higher inventories, receivables and other assets, and lower liabilities to affiliated companies, which was the main reason for the reduction of trade payables, liabilities to affiliated companies and other liabilities.\n\nThe increase in provisions for pensions and similar commitments was mainly due to recording of current service and interest costs and to lower discount rates partly offset by payments for pensions and similar commitments.\n\nThe increase in equity was attributable to net income for the year of \u20ac5.1 billion and the transfer of \u20ac0.5 billion in treasury shares to employees in connection with our share-based payments programs. These factors were partly offset by dividends paid in fiscal 2021 (for fiscal 2020) of \u20ac2.8 billion and share buybacks during the year amounting to \u20ac0.5 billion (including a \u20ac0.4 billion final payment to the commissioned bank). The equity ratio as of September 30, 2021 increased to 21%, from 18% a fiscal year earlier. For the disclosures in accordance with Section 160 para. 1 no. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act about treasury shares, refer to Note 15 of our Notes to Annual Financial Statements for fiscal 2021.\n\n## 9.3 Corporate Governance statement\n\nThe Corporate Governance statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code is publicly available on the company's website at siemens.de/corporate-governance.",

Takeover-relevant information (pursuant to Sections 289a and 315a of the German Commercial Code) and explanatory report\n\n## 10.1 Composition of common stock\n\nAs of September 30, 2021, the Company's common stock totaled \u20ac2.550 billion. The capital stock is divided into 850 million registered shares of no par value (Siemens shares). The shares are fully paid in. All shares confer the same rights and obligations. The shareholders' rights and obligations are governed in detail by the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act, in particular by Sections 12, 53a et seq., 118 et seq. and 186 of the German Stock Corporation Act.\n\n## 10.2 Restrictions on voting rights or transfer of shares\n\nAt the Shareholders' Meeting, each share of stock has one vote and accounts for the shareholder's proportionate share in the Company's net income. An exception to this rule applies with regard to treasury shares held by the Company, which do not entitle the Company to any rights. Under Section 136 of the German Stock Corporation Act the voting right of the affected shares is excluded by law.\n\nSiemens shares issued to employees worldwide under the employee share programs implemented since the beginning of fiscal 2009, in particular the Share Matching Plan, are freely transferable unless applicable local laws provide otherwise. Under the rules of the Share Matching Plan, however, in order to receive one matching share free of charge for each three shares purchased, participants are required to hold the shares purchased by them for a vesting period of several years, during which the participants must be continuously employed by Siemens AG or any of its affiliated companies. The right to receive matching shares is forfeited if the purchased shares are sold, transferred, hedged on, pledged or hypothecated in any way during the relevant vesting period.\n\nThe von Siemens-Verm\u00f6gensverwaltung GmbH (vSV) has, on a sustained basis, powers of attorney allowing it to exercise the voting rights for 10,716,740 shares (as of September 30, 2021) on behalf of members of the Siemens family. These shares are part of the total number of shares held by the family's members. The powers of attorney are based on an agreement between the vSV and, among others, members of the Siemens family. The shares are voted together by vSV, taking into account the suggestions of a family partnership established by the family's members or of one of this partnership's governing bodies.\n\n## 10.3 Legislation and provisions of the Articles of Association applicable to the appointment and removal of members of the Managing Board and governing amendment to the Articles of Association\n\nThe appointment and removal of members of the Managing Board are subject to the provisions of Sections 84 and 85 of the German Stock Corporation Act and Section 31 of the German Codetermination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz). According to Section 8 para. 1 of the Articles of Association, the Managing Board is comprised of several members, the number of which is determined by the Supervisory Board.\n\nAccording to Section 179 of the German Stock Corporation Act, any amendment to the Articles of Association requires a resolution of the Shareholders' Meeting. The authority to adopt purely formal amendments to the Articles of Association was transferred to the Supervisory Board under Section 13 para. 2 of the Articles of Association. In addition, by resolutions adopted during past Shareholders' Meetings, the Supervisory  Board  has  been  authorized  to  amend  Section  4  of  the  Articles  of  Association  in  accordance  with  the  utilization  of  the Authorized and Conditional Capitals, and after expiration of the then-applicable authorization and utilization period.\n\nResolutions of the Shareholders' Meeting require a simple majority vote, unless a greater majority is required by law (Section 23 para. 2 of the  Articles  of  Association).  Pursuant  to  Section  179  para.  2  of  the  German  Stock  Corporation  Act,  amendments  to  the  Articles  of Association require a majority of at least three-quarters of the capital stock represented at the time of the casting of the votes, unless another capital majority is prescribed by the Articles of Association.\n\n## 10.4 Powers of the Managing Board to issue and repurchase shares\n\nThe Managing Board is authorized to increase, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, the capital stock until February 2, 2026 by up to  \u20ac90  million  through  the  issuance  of  up  to  30  million  Siemens  shares  against  contributions  in  cash  (Authorized  Capital  2021). Subscription rights of existing shareholders are excluded. The new shares shall be offered exclusively to employees of the Company and any of its affiliated companies. To the extent permitted by law, such employee shares may also be issued in such a manner that the contribution to be paid on such shares is covered by that part of the annual net income which the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board may allocate to other retained earnings under Section 58 para. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act.\n\nFurthermore, the Managing Board is authorized to increase, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, the capital stock until January 29, 2024 by up to \u20ac510 million through the issuance of up to 170 million Siemens shares against cash contributions and/or contributions in kind (Authorized Capital 2019).\n\nAs of September 30, 2021, the total unissued authorized capital of Siemens AG therefore consisted of \u20ac600 million nominal that may be used, in installments with varying terms, by issuance of up to 200 million Siemens shares.\n\nBy resolutions of the Shareholders' Meetings on January 30, 2019 and February 5, 2020, the Managing Board is authorized to issue bonds with conversion, exchange or option rights or with warrants attached, or a combination of these instruments, entitling the holders to subscribe to up to 80 million and up to 60 million Siemens shares, respectively. Based on these two authorizations, the Company or its affiliated companies may issue bonds until January 29, 2024 and February 4, 2025, respectively, each in an aggregate principal amount of up to \u20ac15 billion. In order to grant shares of stock to holders/creditors of such convertible bonds or warrant bonds, the capital stock was conditionally increased by resolutions of the Shareholders' Meetings in 2019 and 2020, by up to 80 million and up to 60 million Siemens",

They are, as a matter of principle, to be offered to shareholders for subscription. The Managing Board is authorized to exclude, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, subscription rights of shareholders in the event of capital increases against contributions in kind. In the event of capital increases against contributions in cash, the Managing Board is authorized to exclude shareholders' subscription rights with the approval of the Supervisory Board in the following cases:\n\n- \u00b7 The issue price of the new shares/bonds is not significantly lower than the stock market price of the Siemens shares already listed or the theoretical market price of the bonds computed in accordance with generally accepted actuarial methods (exclusion of subscription rights, limited to 10% of the capital stock, in accordance with or by mutatis mutandis application of Section 186 para. 3 sentence 4 German Stock Corporation Act).\n- \u00b7 The exclusion is necessary with regard to fractional amounts resulting from the subscription ratio.\n- \u00b7 The  exclusion  is  used  to  grant  holders  of  conversion  or  option  rights  or  conversion  or  option  obligations  on  Siemens  shares  a compensation for the effects of dilution.\n\nThe new shares issued or to be issued in exchange for contributions in cash and in kind and with shareholders' subscription rights excluded, may in certain cases be subject to further restrictions. The details of those restrictions are described in the relevant authorization. In addition, the Managing Board has issued the commitment not to increase the capital stock from the Authorized Capital 2019 and the Conditional Capitals 2019 and 2020 by a total of more than 10% of the capital stock existing at the time of the Shareholders' Meeting on February 5, 2020, to the extent that capital increases with shareholders' subscription rights excluded are made from the Authorized Capital 2019 against  contributions  in  cash  or  in  kind  or  to  service  convertible  bonds  and/or  warrant  bonds  issued  under  the  authorizations approved on January 30, 2019 or February 5, 2020 with shareholders' subscription rights excluded. This commitment ends no later than February 4, 2025.\n\nThe Company may not repurchase its own shares unless so authorized by a resolution duly adopted by the shareholders at a general meeting or in other very limited circumstances set forth in the German Stock Corporation Act. On February 5, 2020, the Shareholders' Meeting authorized the Company to acquire until February 4, 2025 up to 10% of its capital stock existing at the date of adopting the resolution or - if this value is lower - as of the date on which the authorization is exercised. The aggregate of shares of stock of Siemens AG repurchased under this authorization and any other Siemens shares previously acquired and still held in treasury by the Company or attributable to the Company pursuant to Sections 71d and 71e of the German Stock Corporation Act may at no time exceed 10% of the then existing capital stock. Any repurchase of Siemens shares shall be accomplished at the discretion of the Managing Board either (1) by acquisition over the stock exchange, (2) through a public share repurchase offer or (3) through a public offer to swap Siemens shares for shares in a listed company within the meaning of Section 3 para. 2 German Stock Corporation Act. The Managing Board is additionally authorized to complete the repurchase of Siemens shares in accordance with the authorization described above by using certain derivatives (put and call options, forward purchases and any combination of these derivatives). In exercising this authorization, all stock repurchases based on the derivatives are limited to a maximum volume of 5% of Siemens' capital stock existing at the date of adopting the resolution at the Shareholders' Meeting. A derivative's term of maturity may not, in any case, exceed 18 months and must be chosen in such a way that the repurchase of Siemens shares upon exercise of the derivative will take place no later than February 4, 2025.\n\nIn addition to selling them over the stock exchange or through a public sales offer to all shareholders, the Managing Board is authorized by resolution of the Shareholders' Meeting on February 5, 2020 to also use Siemens shares repurchased on the basis of this or any previously given authorization for every permissible purpose, in particular as follows: Such Siemens shares may be\n\n- \u00b7 retired;\n- \u00b7 used in connection with share-based compensation programs and/or employee share programs of the Company or any of its affiliated companies and issued to individuals currently or formerly employed by the Company or any of its affiliated companies as well as to board members of any of the Company's affiliated companies;\n- \u00b7 offered and transferred, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to third parties against non-cash contributions;\n- \u00b7 sold by the Managing Board, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, against payment in cash if the price at which such Siemens shares are sold is not significantly lower than the market price of Siemens stock (exclusion of subscription rights, limited to 10% of the capital stock, by mutatis mutandis application of Section 186 para. 3 sentence 4 German Stock Corporation Act); or\n- \u00b7 used to service or secure obligations or rights to acquire Siemens shares arising particularly from or in connection with convertible bonds or warrant bonds of the Company or its affiliated companies. Moreover, the Managing Board is authorized to exclude subscription rights in  order  to  grant  holders/creditors of conversion or option rights or respective conversion or option obligations on Siemens shares subscription rights as compensation against effects of dilution to the extent to which they would be entitled after exercise of such rights or fulfillment of such obligations, and to use Siemens shares to service such subscription rights.\n\nFurthermore, the Supervisory Board is authorized to use shares acquired on the basis of this or any previously given authorization to meet obligations or rights to acquire Siemens shares that were or will be agreed with members of the Managing Board within the framework of rules governing Managing Board compensation.\n\nIn November 2018, the Company announced that it would carry out a share buyback of up to \u20ac3 billion in volume until November 15, 2021 at the latest. The buyback commenced on December 3, 2018 and terminated on September 24, 2021. Using the authorizations given by the Annual Shareholders' Meetings on January 27, 2015 and February 5, 2020, Siemens repurchased 29.4 million shares by September 30, 2021 under this share buyback. This buyback had the exclusive purposes of retirement, of issuing shares to employees, board members of affiliated companies and members of the Managing Board of Siemens AG, and of servicing/securing the obligations or rights to acquire Siemens  shares  arising  particularly  from  or  in  connection  with  convertible  bonds  and  warrant  bonds.  On  June  24,  2021,  Siemens announced that it intends to launch a new five-year share buyback program of up to \u20ac3 billion, beginning in fiscal 2022.\n\nAs of September 30, 2021, the Company held 47,644,581 shares of stock in treasury.",

        "page_content": "For details on the authorizations referred to above, especially with the restrictions to exclude subscription rights and the terms to include shares when calculating such restrictions, please refer to the relevant resolution and to Section 4 of the Articles of Association.\n\n## 10.5 Significant agreements which take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid\n\nAs of September 30, 2021, Siemens AG maintained lines of credit in the amount of \u20ac 7.45 billion.\n\nIn March 2021, Siemens AG entered into a bilateral loan agreement, which has been drawn in the full amount of \u20ac 500 million.\n\nIn addition, in March 2020 and in June 2019 respectively, a consolidated subsidiary as borrower and Siemens AG as guarantor entered into a bilateral loan agreement, each of which has been drawn in the full amount of US$ 500 million. In February 2021, a consolidated subsidiary as borrower entered into two bilateral loan agreements in the total amount of US$ 500 million; both loan agreements have been guaranteed by Siemens AG and have been fully drawn.\n\nThe lines of credit, and the relevant loan agreements mentioned above provide their respective lenders with a right of termination in the event that (1) Siemens AG becomes a subsidiary of another company or (2) a person or a group of persons acting in concert acquires effective control over Siemens AG by being able to exercise decisive influence over its activities (Art. 3(2) of Council Regulation (EC) 139 / 2004).\n\nFramework  agreements  concluded  by  Siemens  AG  under  International  Swaps  and  Derivatives  Association  Inc.  documentation  (ISDA Agreements) grant each counterparty a right of termination, including in certain cases of (i) a transformation (for example mergers and changes of form), (ii) an asset transfer or (iii) acquisition of ownership interests that enables the acquirer to exercise control over Siemens AG or its controlling bodies. Partially this right of termination exists only, if (1) the resulting entity fails to simultaneously assume Siemens AG's  obligations  under  the  ISDA  Agreements  or  (2)  the  resulting  entity's  creditworthiness  is  materially  weaker  than  Siemens  AG's immediately prior to such event. Generally, ISDA Agreements are designed such that upon termination all outstanding payment claims documented under them are to be netted.\n\n## 10.6 Compensation agreements with members of the Managing Board or employees in the event of a takeover bid\n\nThe contracts with the members of the Managing Board previously contained the right of the member to terminate his or her contract with the Company for good cause in the event of a change of control that results in a substantial change in the position of a Managing Board  member  (for  example,  due  to  a  change  in  corporate  strategy  or  a  change  in  the  Managing  Board  member's  duties  and responsibilities). A change of control exists if one or several shareholders acting jointly or in concert acquire a majority of the voting rights in Siemens AG and exercise a controlling influence, or if Siemens AG becomes a dependent enterprise as a result of entering into an intercompany agreement within the meaning of Section 291 of the German Stock Corporation Act, or if Siemens AG is to be merged into an existing corporation or other entity. If this right of termination is exercised, the Managing Board member is entitled to a severance payment in the amount of no more than two years' compensation. The calculation of the annual compensation includes not only the base compensation and the target amount for the bonus, but also the target amount for the stock awards, in each case based on the most recent completed fiscal year prior to termination of the contract. The stock-based compensation components for which a firm commitment already exists will remain unaffected. Additionally, the severance payments cover non-monetary benefits by including an amount of 5% of the total severance amount. Severance payments will be reduced by 10% as a lump-sum allowance for discounted values and for income earned elsewhere. However, this reduction will apply only to the portion of the severance payment that was calculated without taking account of the first six months of the remaining term of the Managing Board member's contract. There is no entitlement to a severance payment if the Managing Board member receives benefits from third parties in connection with a change of control. A right to terminate the  contract  does  not  exist  if  the  change  of  control  occurs  within  a  period  of  twelve  months  prior  to  a  Managing  Board  member's retirement.\n\nOn September 18, 2019, the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG resolved that the contracts with members of the Managing Board should not contain such right of termination in the future. This has already been taken into account in the case of contract extensions and in the case of new contracts with the newly appointed members of the Managing Board as of October 1, 2020.\n\n## 10.7 Other takeover-relevant information\n\nWe are not aware of, nor have we during the last fiscal year been notified of, any shareholder directly or indirectly holding 10% or more of the voting rights. There are no Siemens shares with special rights conferring powers of control. Shares of stock issued by Siemens AG to employees under its employee share program and/or as share-based compensation are transferred to the employees. The beneficiary employees who hold shares of employee stock may exercise their control rights in the same way as any other shareholder in accordance with applicable laws and the Articles of Association.",

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## NOTE 1 Basis of presentation\n\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements present the operations of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft with registered offices in Berlin (registry number HRB 12300) and Munich (registry number HRB 6684), Germany, and its subsidiaries (the Company or Siemens). They have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union as well as with the additional requirements set forth in Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The financial statements are in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The Consolidated Financial Statements were authorized for issue by the Managing Board on November 30, 2021. Siemens prepares and reports its Consolidated Financial Statements in euros (\u20ac). Due to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to totals provided. Siemens is a German based multinational focused technology company.\n\n## NOTE 2 Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates\n\nCertain of these accounting policies require critical accounting estimates that involve complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions, some of which may be for matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change. Such critical accounting estimates could change from period to period and have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial positions and cash flows. Critical accounting estimates could also involve estimates where Siemens reasonably could have used a different estimate in the current accounting period. Siemens cautions that future events often vary from forecasts and that estimates routinely require adjustment.\n\nCOVID-19 - Impacts of the pandemic coronavirus spread on Siemens' Consolidated Financial Statements are contingent on the further evolution of virus variants, the progress of worldwide vaccinations and the vaccines' effectiveness. Potential impacts may also result from increasingly phased out financial and non-financial measures originally taken by governments and organizations globally. Related impacts could influence fair value and carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, amount and timing of results of operations and cash flows. Effects vary  considerably  by  region  and  customer  industries.  Siemens  based  its  estimates  and  assumptions  on  existing  knowledge  and  best information available. We expect that related effects on Siemens' Consolidated Financial Statements will not reach a substantial degree.\n\nBasis of consolidation - The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Siemens AG and its subsidiaries over which the Company has control. Siemens controls an investee if it has power over the investee. In addition, Siemens is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from the involvement with the investee and Siemens is able to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of Siemens' return.\n\nBusiness combinations - Cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date  of  exchange.  Identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in  a  business  combination  (including  contingent  liabilities)  are initially measured at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. Non-controlling interests are measured at the proportional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (partial goodwill method). If there is no loss of control, transactions with non-controlling interests are accounted for as equity transactions not affecting net income. At the date control is lost, any retained equity interests are remeasured to fair value. In case of a written put option on non-controlling interests the Company assesses whether the prerequisites for the transfer of present ownership interest are fulfilled at the balance sheet date. If the Company is not the beneficial owner of the shares underlying the put option, the exercise of the put option will be assumed at each balance sheet date and treated as equity transaction between shareholders with the recognition of a purchase liability at the respective exercise price. The non-controlling interests participate in profits and losses during the reporting period.\n\nAssociates and joint ventures -  Associates  are  companies  over  which Siemens has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies (generally through direct or indirect ownership of 20% to 50% of the voting rights). Joint ventures are entities over which Siemens and one or more parties have joint control. Joint control requires unanimous consent of the parties sharing control in decision making on relevant activities.\n\nAssociates and joint ventures are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost. If the investment was retained in a transaction in which Siemens lost control of a subsidiary, the fair value of the investment represents the cost on initial recognition. Siemens' share of its associate's or joint venture's post-acquisition profits or losses is recognized in  the  Consolidated  Statements of Income, and its share of post-acquisition changes in equity that have not been recognized in the associate's or joint venture's profit or loss is recognized directly in equity. The cumulative post-acquisition changes also include effects from fair value adjustments and are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When Siemens' share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the investment, Siemens does not recognize further losses, unless it incurs obligations or makes payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture. The interest in an associate or joint venture is the carrying amount of the investment together with any long term interests that, in substance, form part of Siemens' net investment in the associate or joint venture.\n\nSiemens reviews associates and joint ventures for impairment whenever there is objective evidence that its investment is impaired, for example a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost. This includes the use of estimates and assumptions also related to observable valuation inputs that tend to be uncertain.\n\nForeign currency translation - Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, where the functional currency is other than the euro, are translated using the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period, while the Consolidated Statements of Income are translated using average exchange rates during the period. Differences arising from such translations are recognized within equity and reclassified to net income when the gain or loss on disposal of the foreign subsidiary is recognized. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are translated at average exchange rates during the period, whereas cash and cash equivalents are translated at the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period.\n\nForeign currency transaction - Transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of an entity, are recorded at that functional currency applying the spot exchange rate at the date when the underlying transactions are initially recognized. At the end of the reporting period, foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are revalued to functional currency applying the spot exchange rate prevailing at that date. Gains and losses arising from these foreign currency revaluations are recognized",

Those foreign currency-denominated transactions which are classified as non-monetary are remeasured using the historical spot exchange rate.\n\nRevenue recognition - Siemens recognizes revenue when, or as control over distinct goods or services is transferred to the customer; i.e. when the customer is able to direct the use of the transferred goods or services and obtains substantially all of the remaining benefits, provided a contract with enforceable rights and obligations exists and amongst others collectability of consideration is probable taking our customer's creditworthiness into account. Revenue is the transaction price Siemens expects to be entitled to. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur once associated uncertainties are resolved. The amount of variable consideration is calculated by either using the expected value or the most likely amount depending on which is expected to better predict the amount of variable consideration. Consideration is adjusted for the time value of money if the period between the transfer of goods or services and the receipt of payment exceeds twelve months and there is a significant financing benefit either to the customer or Siemens. If a contract contains more than one distinct good or service, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative stand-alone selling prices. If stand-alone selling prices are not observable, the Company reasonably estimates those. Revenue is recognized for each performance obligation either at a point in time or over time.\n\nSales from construction-type contracts : Revenues are recognized over time under the percentage-of-completion method, based on the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs. An expected loss on the contract is recognized as an expense immediately. Payment terms are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.\n\nThe  percentage-of-completion  method  places  considerable  importance  on  accurate  estimates  of  the  extent  of  progress  towards completion and may involve estimates on the scope of deliveries and services required to fulfill the contractually defined obligations. These significant estimates include total estimated costs, total estimated revenues, contract risks, including technical, political and regulatory risks, risks from supply chain constraints and other judgments. Under the percentage-of-completion method, changes in estimates may lead to an increase or decrease of revenue. In addition, Siemens needs to assess whether the contract is expected to continue or whether it is terminated. In determining whether the continuation or termination of a contract is expected to be the most likely scenario, all relevant facts and circumstances relating to the contract are considered on an individual basis.\n\nRevenues from services : Revenues are recognized over time on a straight-line basis or, if the performance pattern is other than straightline, as services are provided, i.e. under the percentage-of-completion method as described above. Payment terms are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.\n\nSale of goods : Revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods passes to the buyer, usually upon delivery of the goods. Invoices are issued at that point in time and are usually payable within 30 days. For licensing transactions granting the customer a right to use Siemens' intellectual property, payment terms are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.\n\nIncome from royalties : Royalties are recognized on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement.\n\nIncome from interest - Interest is recognized using the effective interest method.\n\nFunctional  costs -  In  general,  operating  expenses  by  types  are  assigned  to  the  functions  following  the  functional  area  of  the corresponding profit and cost centers. Amortization, depreciation and impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are included in functional costs depending on the use of the assets.\n\nProduct-related expenses - Provisions for estimated costs related to product warranties are recorded in line item Cost of sales at the time the related sale is recognized.\n\nResearch and development costs - Costs of research activities are expensed as incurred. Costs of development activities are capitalized when the recognition criteria in IAS 38 are met. Capitalized development costs are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses with an amortization period of generally three to ten years.\n\nEarnings per share - Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income from continuing operations, income from discontinued operations and net income, all attributable to ordinary shareholders of Siemens AG by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by assuming conversion or exercise of all potentially dilutive securities and sharebased payment plans.\n\nGoodwill - Goodwill is not amortized, instead, goodwill is tested for impairment annually, as well as whenever there are events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) which suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of a cash-generating unit or a group of cashgenerating units, generally represented by a segment. Siemens Healthineers is tested one level below the segment. This is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash-generating unit or the group of cash-generating units that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. If the carrying amount of the cashgenerating unit or the group of cash-generating units, to which the goodwill is allocated, exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss on goodwill allocated to that (group of) cash-generating unit(s) is recognized. The recoverable amount is the higher of the cashgenerating unit's or the group of cash-generating units' fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If either of these values exceeds the carrying amount, it is not always necessary to determine both values. These values are generally determined based on discounted cash flow calculations. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed in future periods.\n\nThe determination of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit or a group of cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated involves the use of estimates by management. The outcome predicted by these estimates is influenced e.g. by the successful integration of  acquired  entities,  volatility  of  capital  markets,  interest  rate  developments,  foreign  exchange  rate  fluctuations  and  the  outlook  on economic  trends.  In  determining  recoverable  amounts,  discounted  cash  flow  calculations  generally  use  five-year  projections  (in exceptional cases up to ten years) that are based on financial forecasts. Cash flow projections take into account past experience and represent management's best estimate about future developments. Cash flows after the planning period are extrapolated using individual growth rates. Key assumptions on which management has based its determination of fair value less costs to sell and value in use include",

        "page_content": "estimated growth rates and weighted average cost of capital. These estimates, including the methodology used, can have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of any goodwill impairment.\n\nOther intangible assets - The Company amortizes intangible assets with finite useful lives on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives for patents, licenses and other similar rights generally range from three to five years, except for  intangible  assets  with  finite  useful  lives  acquired  in  business  combinations.  Intangible  assets  acquired  in  business  combinations primarily consist of customer relationships and trademarks as well as technology. Useful lives in specific acquisitions ranged from four to 30 years for customer relationships and trademarks (in fiscal 2020 four to 20 years) and for technology from five to 22 years (in fiscal 2020 five to 18 years).\n\nProperty, plant and equipment - Property, plant and equipment, is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation expense is recognized using the straight-line method. The following useful lives are assumed:\n\n| Factory and office buildings    | 20 to 50 years         |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Other buildings                 | 5 to 10 years          |\n| Technical machinery & equipment | generally 10 years     |\n| Office & other equipment        | generally 5 years      |\n| Equipment leased to others      | generally 3 to 7 years |\n\nImpairment of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets - The Company reviews property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In addition, intangible assets not yet available for use are subject to an annual impairment test. Impairment testing of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets involves the use of estimates in determining the assets' recoverable amount, which can have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of any impairment.\n\nLeases - A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Further information on leases can be found in Notes 8, 13 and 16.\n\nLessor - Leases are classified as either finance or operating leases, determined based on whether substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset are transferred. If this is the case, the lease is classified as a finance lease; if not, it is an operating  lease.  Receivables  from  finance  leases  are  recognized  at  an  amount  equal  to  the  net  investment  in  the  lease.  The  assets underlying the operating leases are presented in Property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives or to their estimated residual value. Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nLessee - Siemens recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of more than twelve months if the underlying asset is not of low value. Payments for short-term and low-value leases are expensed over the lease term. Extension options are included in  the  lease  term  if  their  exercise  is  reasonably  certain.  Right-of-use  assets  are  measured  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and impairment losses adjusted for any remeasurements. Right-of-use assets are depreciated under the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the underlying assets. Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments due over the lease term, generally discounted using the incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. They are remeasured in case of modifications or reassessments of the lease.\n\nDiscontinued operations and non-current assets held for disposal - Discontinued operations are reported when a component of an entity  is  classified  as  held  for  disposal  or  has  been  disposed  of,  if  the  component  represents  a  separate  major  line  of  business  or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to disposal. A non-current asset or a disposal group is held for disposal if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction or through a distribution to owners rather than through continuing use. In the Consolidated Statements of Income and of Cash Flows, discontinued operations is reported separately from continuing operations; prior periods are presented on a comparable basis. The disclosures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements outside Note 3 relate to continuing operations or assets and liabilities not held for disposal. The determination of the fair value less costs to sell includes the use of estimates and assumptions that tend to be uncertain.\n\nIncome taxes - Tax positions are calculated taking into consideration the respective local tax laws, relevant court decisions and applicable tax  authorities'  views.  Tax  regulations  can  be  complex  and  possibly  subject  to  different  interpretations  of  tax  payers  and  local  tax authorities. Different interpretations of existing or new tax laws as a result of tax reforms or other tax legislative procedures may result in additional tax payments for prior years and are taken into account based on management's considerations. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected tax consequences of future periods attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are recognized if sufficient future  taxable  profit  is  available,  including  income  from  forecasted  operating  earnings,  the  reversal  of  existing  taxable  temporary differences  and  available  tax  planning  opportunities  that  Siemens  would  execute.  As  of  each  period-end,  Siemens  evaluates  the recoverability of deferred tax assets, based on taxable income of past periods and projected future taxable profits. As future developments are uncertain and partly beyond Siemens's control, assumptions are necessary to estimate future taxable profits as well as the period in which deferred tax assets will recover. Estimates are revised in the period in which there is sufficient evidence to revise the assumption.\n\nContract assets, contract liabilities, receivables - When either party to a contract with customers has performed, Siemens presents a contract  asset,  a  contract  liability  or  a  receivable  depending  on  the  relationship  between  Siemens'  performance  and  the  customer's payment. Contract assets and liabilities are presented as current since incurred in the normal operating cycle. Receivables are recognized when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Valuation allowances for credit risks are made for contract assets and receivables in accordance with the accounting policy for financial assets measured at amortized cost.\n\nInventories -  Inventories  are  valued  at  the  lower  of  acquisition  or  production  costs  and  net  realizable  value,  costs  being  generally determined based on an average or first-in, first-out method. Determining net realizable value of inventories involves accounting estimates for quantity, technical and price risks.\n\nDefined benefit plans -  Siemens measures the entitlements by applying the projected unit credit method. The approach reflects an actuarially calculated net present value of the future benefit entitlement for services already rendered. In determining the net present value of the future benefit entitlement for service already rendered (Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO)), the expected rates of future salary",

        "page_content": "increases and expected rates of future pension progression are considered. The assumptions used for the calculation of the DBO as of the period-end of the preceding fiscal year are used to determine the calculation of service cost and interest income and expense of the following year. Significant plans apply individual spot rates from full discount rate curves to determine service cost and interest expense. The net interest income or expense for the fiscal year will be based on the discount rate for the respective year multiplied by the net defined benefit liability (asset) at the preceding fiscal year's period-end date.\n\nService cost, past service cost and settlement gains (losses) for pensions and similar obligations as well as administration costs unrelated to the management of plan assets are allocated among functional costs. Past service cost and settlement gains (losses) are recognized immediately in profit or loss. For unfunded plans, the amount in line item Provisions for pensions and similar obligations equals the DBO. For funded plans, Siemens offsets the fair value of the plan assets with the DBO. Siemens recognizes the net amount, after adjustments for effects relating to any asset ceiling.\n\nRemeasurements comprise actuarial gains and losses as well as the difference between the return on plan assets and the amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset). They are recognized in Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes.\n\nActuarial valuations rely on key assumptions including discount rates, expected compensation increases, rate of pension progression and mortality rates. Discount rates used are determined by reference to yields on high-quality corporate bonds of appropriate duration and currency at the end of the reporting period. In case such yields are not available, discount rates are based on government bonds yields. Due to changing market, economic and social conditions, the underlying key assumptions may differ from actual developments.\n\nEntitlements resulting from plans based on asset returns from underlying assets are generally measured at the fair value of the underlying assets at period-end. If the performance of the underlying assets is lower than a guaranteed return, the DBO is measured by projecting forward the contributions at the guaranteed fixed return and discounting back to a present value.\n\nProvisions - A provision is recognized in the Statement of Financial Position when it is probable that the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are recognized at present value by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. When a contract becomes onerous, the present obligation under the contract is recognized as a provision.\n\nSignificant  estimates  are  involved  in  the  determination  of  provisions  related  to  onerous  contracts,  warranty  costs,  asset  retirement obligations, legal and regulatory proceedings as well as governmental investigations (Legal Proceedings). Siemens records a provision for onerous contracts with customers when current estimates of total estimated costs exceed estimated revenue. Onerous contracts with customers are identified by monitoring the progress of the project and updating the estimates which requires significant judgment relating to achieving certain performance standards as well as estimates involving warranty costs and estimates regarding project delays including the assessment of responsibility splits between the contract partners for these delays.\n\nLegal Proceedings often involve complex legal issues and are subject to substantial uncertainties. Accordingly, considerable judgment is part of determining whether it is probable that there is a present obligation as a result of a past event at the end of the reporting period, whether it is probable that such a Legal Proceeding will result in an outflow of resources and whether the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Internal and external counsels are generally part of the determination process. Due to new developments, it may be necessary, to record a provision for an ongoing Legal Proceeding or to adjust the amount of a previously recognized provision. Upon resolution of a Legal Proceeding, Siemens may incur charges in excess of the recorded provisions for such matters. The outcome of Legal Proceedings may have a material effect on Siemens' financial position, its results of operations and/or its cash flows.\n\nTermination benefits - Termination benefits are provided as a result of an entity's offer made in order to encourage voluntary redundancy before the regular retirement date or from an entity's decision to terminate the employment. Termination benefits in accordance with IAS 19, Employee Benefits, are recognized as a liability and an expense when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits.\n\nFinancial instruments - A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Based on their contractual cash flow characteristics and the business model they are held in, financial instruments are classified as financial assets and financial liabilities measured at cost or amortized cost, measured at fair value, loan commitments, contract assets and receivables from finance leases. Regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are accounted for at the  trade  date.  Initially,  financial  instruments  are  recognized  at  fair  value  and  net  of  transaction  costs,  if  not  categorized  at  FVTPL. Subsequently, financial assets and liabilities are measured according to the category to which they are assigned to:\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL) : a) mandatorily measured at FVTPL: Debt financial assets are measured at FVTPL if the business model they are held in is not a hold-to-collect or a hold-and-sell business model, or if their contractual cash flows do not represent solely payments of principal and interest. Equity instruments are measured at FVTPL unless the FVOCI-option is  elected.  b)  Financial  assets  designated  as  measured  at  FVTPL  are  irrevocably  designated  at  initial  recognition  if  the  designation significantly reduces accounting mismatches that would otherwise arise if assets and liabilities as well as recognizing gains (losses) were measured on different bases.\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) :  are equity instruments for which Siemens irrevocably elects to present subsequent fair value changes in OCI at initial recognition of the instrument. Unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income tax expenses, as well as gains and losses on the subsequent sale of the instruments are recognized in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes.\n\nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost : Loans, receivables and other debt instruments held in a hold-to-collect business model with contractual cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less valuation allowances for expected credit losses.\n\nValuation  allowances  are  set  up  for  expected  credit  losses,  representing  a  forward-looking  estimate  of  future  credit  losses  involving significant judgment. Expected credit loss is the gross carrying amount less collateral, multiplied by the probability of default and a factor reflecting  the  loss  in  the  event  of  default.  Valuation  allowances  are  not  recognized  when  the  gross  carrying  amount  is  sufficiently collateralized. Probabilities of default are mainly derived from internal rating grades. A simplified approach is used to assess expected credit losses from trade receivables, lease receivables and contract assets by applying their lifetime expected credit losses. The valuation",

        "page_content": "allowance for loans and other long-term debt instruments primarily held at Financial Services (SFS) is measured according to a three-stage impairment approach:\n\nStage 1 : At inception, twelve-month expected credit losses are recognized based on a twelve months probability of default.\n\nStage 2 :  If  the  credit  risk  of  a  financial  asset  increases  significantly  without being credit-impaired, lifetime expected credit losses are recognized  based  on  a  lifetime  probability  of  default.  A  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  is  determined  for  each  individual  financial instrument using internal credit ratings. A rating deterioration does not trigger a transfer into Stage 2, if the credit rating remains within the investment grade range. More than 30 days past due payments will not be transferred into Stage 2, if the delay is not credit-riskrelated.\n\nStage 3 : If the financial asset is credit-impaired, valuation allowances equal lifetime expected credit losses. A financial asset is considered credit-impaired when there is observable information about significant financial difficulties and a high vulnerability to default, however, the definition of default is not yet met. Impairment triggers include liquidity problems, a request for debt restructuring or a breach of contract. A credit-risk driven contractual modification always results in a credit-impaired financial asset.\n\nFinancial assets are written off as uncollectible if recovery appears unlikely. Generally, if the limitation period expired, when a debtor's sworn statement of affairs is received, or when the receivable is not pursued due to its minor value. Receivables are written off when bankruptcy proceedings close.\n\nA financial asset is derecognized when the rights to cash flows expire or the financial asset is transferred to another party. Significant modifications of contractual terms of a financial asset measured at amortized cost result in derecognition and recognition of a new financial asset; for insignificant modifications, the carrying amount of the financial asset is adjusted without derecognition.\n\nCash and cash equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid investments with less than three months maturity from the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are measured at cost.\n\nLoan  Commitments -  Expected  credit  losses  for  irrevocable  loan  commitments  are  determined  using  the  three-stage  impairment approach for financial assets measured at amortized cost and recognized as a liability.\n\nFinancial  liabilities -  except  for  derivative  financial  instruments,  Siemens  measures  financial  liabilities  at  amortized  cost  using  the effective interest method.\n\nDerivative financial instruments - Derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts are measured at fair value unless they are designated as hedging instruments, for which hedge accounting is applied. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized either in net income or, in the case of a cash flow hedge, in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes (applicable deferred income tax). Certain derivative instruments embedded in host contracts are also accounted for separately as derivatives.\n\nFair value hedges :  The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted by the gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk. Where an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in its fair value is recognized as a separate financial asset or liability with corresponding gain or loss recognized in net income. For hedged items carried at amortized cost, the adjustment is amortized until maturity of the hedged item. For hedged firm commitments the initial carrying amount of the assets or liabilities  that  result  from  meeting the firm commitments are adjusted to include the cumulative changes in the fair value that were previously recognized as separate financial assets or liabilities.\n\nCash flow hedges :  The  effective  portion  of  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  derivative  instruments  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges  are recognized in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, and any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in net income. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified into net income in the same periods in which the hedged item affects net income.\n\nShare-based payment - Share-based payment awards at Siemens are predominately designed as equity-settled. Fair value is measured at grant date and is expensed over the vesting period. Fair value is determined as the market price of the underlying shares, considering dividends during the vesting period the grantees are not entitled to as well as market conditions and non-vesting conditions, if applicable. Plans granting the rights to receive subsidiary shares constitute own shares and, accordingly, are accounted as equity-settled.\n\nPrior-year  information -  The  presentation  of  certain  prior-year  information  has  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  the  current  year presentation.\n\n## NOTE 3 Acquisitions, dispositions and discontinued operations\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nOn April 15, 2021, Siemens completed the acquisition of all shares in Varian Medical Systems, Inc., USA (Varian). Varian is active in the field of cancer care, with solutions especially in radiation oncology and related digital solutions and applications. The acquired business is integrated into Siemens Healthineers. Varian thus offers a good complement to Siemens Healthineers' businesses in medical imaging, laboratory diagnostics and interventional procedures. The purchase price paid in cash amounted to US$16.4 billion (\u20ac13.9 billion as of the acquisition date).  The  preliminary  purchase  price  allocation  as  of  the  acquisition  date  resulted  in  the  following  assets  and  liabilities: Cash and  cash  equivalents  \u20ac0.6  billion,  Trade  and  other  receivables  \u20ac0.6  billion,  Inventories  \u20ac0.8  billion,  various  other current assets \u20ac0.4 billion,  Goodwill  \u20ac8.0  billion,  Other  intangible  assets  \u20ac6.3 billion,  Property,  plant  and equipment \u20ac0.5 billion, miscellaneous assets \u20ac0.2 billion, Trade payables \u20ac0.2 billion, Contract liabilities \u20ac0.7 billion, Current income tax liabilities \u20ac0.2 billion, Other current liabilities \u20ac0.3 billion, Deferred tax liabilities \u20ac1.6 billion and miscellaneous liabilities \u20ac0.5 billion. Resulting intangible assets mainly relate to technologies for oncology solutions, customer relationships, and the acquired order backlog. As of the acquisition date, goodwill was allocated to the groups of cash-generating units Varian \u20ac7.5 billion and Imaging \u20ac0.5 billion in accordance with the expected synergies.  Goodwill  relates  to  inseparable  intangible  assets  such  as  synergy  effects  and  employee  know-how.  Synergies  from  the acquisition are mainly expected from broader regional coverage of the sales network, cross-selling opportunities into our existing customer base and from expanded integrated service offerings (e.g. 'Oncology-as-a-Service' program) and value partnerships, and joint product innovation. In addition, the business combination is expected to generate cost synergies in the administrative field and in procurement",

The  gross  contractual  amounts  of  Trade  and  other  receivables  is  \u20ac603  million,  of  which  \u20ac24  million  were  expected  to  be uncollectable  at  the  date  of  acquisition.  The  gross  contractual  amount  of  loans  and  bonds  receivables  is  \u20ac227  million,  of  which \u20ac207 million are probably uncollectible at the acquisition date. The acquired business contributed Revenue of \u20ac1,241 million and a net loss of \u20ac50 million for the period from the acquisition date to September 30, 2021, including earnings effects from the purchase price allocation and  integration  costs.  If  Varian  had  been  included  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  since  October  1,  2020,  Revenue  and Net income,  including  earnings  effects  from  the  purchase  price  allocation  and  integration  costs,  would  have  been  \u20ac63.6 billion  and \u20ac6.6 billion, respectively, in fiscal 2021. The purchase price allocation of Varian is preliminary as, in particular, the allocation of intangible assets including goodwill to currency areas is not finalized. Adjustments may lead to changes, such as, in intangible assets including goodwill and in deferred tax liabilities.\n\nIn August 2021, Siemens acquired all shares in Supplyframe Inc., USA (Supplyframe). Supplyframe is a design-to-source platform for the global electronics value chain. The transaction provides value to both Supplyframe's and Siemens' customers through access to both Siemens'  offerings  and  Supplyframe's  marketplace  intelligence.  The  acquired  business  is  integrated  into  Digital  Industries.  The preliminary purchase price paid in cash is \u20ac556 million as of the acquisition date. The preliminary purchase price allocation as of the acquisition  date  resulted  in  Other  intangible  assets  of  \u20ac111  million,  thereof  customer-related  intangible  assets  and  trademark  rights \u20ac83 million and technology \u20ac28 million as well as in liabilities of \u20ac87 million. Goodwill of \u20ac491 million comprises intangible assets that are not separable such as employee know-how and expected synergy effects. The acquired business contributed Revenue of \u20ac11 million and  Net  income  of \u20ac(7) million  for  the  period  from  its  acquisition  date  to  September  30, 2021,  including  earnings  effects  from  the purchase  price  allocation  and  integration  costs.  If  Supplyframe  had  been  included  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  since October 1, 2020, Revenue and Net income, including earnings effects from the purchase price allocation and integration costs, would have been \u20ac62,314 million and \u20ac6,694 million, respectively, in fiscal 2021.\n\nIn addition, Siemens closed several smaller acquisitions in fiscal 2021 and 2020 for a total purchase price of \u20ac429 million and \u20ac551 million, respectively, mainly paid in cash. The (preliminary) purchase price allocations resulted in Other intangible assets of \u20ac147 million and \u20ac263 million and Goodwill of \u20ac254 million and \u20ac298 million, respectively, which comprises intangible assets that are not separable such as employee know-how and expected synergy effects. The purchase price allocation for some of the acquired businesses is preliminary, as a detailed analysis of the assets and liabilities has not been finalized.\n\n## Dilution of the stake in Siemens Healthineers\n\nIn March 2021, Siemens Healthineers placed 53 million new shares to institutional investors, receiving gross proceeds of \u20ac2.3 billion and increasing its share capital to \u20ac1.128 billion. Siemens did not participate in the placement, thus, Siemens' stake in Siemens Healthineers decreased from 79% to 75%. The dilution is accounted for as equity transaction, which increased Non-controlling interests by \u20ac1.0 billion and Total equity attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG by \u20ac1.3 billion (mainly due to an increase in Retained earnings of \u20ac1.2 billion).\n\n## Sale of Flender GmbH\n\nIn October 2020, Siemens signed an agreement to sell 100% of its shares in Flender GmbH including Siemens' Wind Energy Generation business (Flender) to The Carlyle Group, U.S. Both businesses were previously reported under Portfolio Companies. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the businesses of Flender (the disposal group) met the criteria for classification as held for disposal as well as for discontinued operation,  and,  accordingly,  Siemens  ceased  depreciation  and  amortization  of  assets  within  the  disposal  group.  Upon  closing  of  the transaction in March 2021, Siemens no longer controls Flender. The consideration was \u20ac1.875 billion. Derecognized net assets amounted to \u20ac954 million. The results of Flender are reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Cash Flows for all periods presented:\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                              | FY 2021   | FY 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Revenue                                                         | 928       | 1,885     |\n| Expenses                                                        | (818)     | (1,710)   |\n| Disposal gain net of disposal costs                             | 885       | (5)       |\n| Income (loss) from discontinued operations before income taxes  | 995       | 170       |\n| Income taxes on ordinary activities                             | (8)       | (36)      |\n| Other income taxes                                              | (40)      | -         |\n| Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes | 946       | 134       |\n| thereof attributable to Siemens AG shareholders                 | 946       | 134       |\n\nThe carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities derecognized were as follows:",

Key assumptions on which Siemens based its determinations of the fair value less costs to sell for the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units include terminal value growth rates up to 1.7% in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively and after-tax discount rates of 5.5% to 12.0% in fiscal 2021 and 5.5% to 12.5% in fiscal 2020.\n\nTo estimate the fair value less costs to sell of the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units, cash flows were projected for the next five years (in exceptional cases up to ten years) based on past experience, actual operating results and management's best estimate about future developments as well as market assumptions. The determined fair value of the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units is assigned to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe fair value less costs to sell is mainly driven by the terminal value, which is particularly sensitive to changes in the assumptions on the terminal value growth rate and discount rate. Both assumptions are determined individually for each cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units. Discount rates are based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Siemens Financial Services' discount rate represents its specific cost of equity. The discount rates are calculated based on a risk-free rate of interest and a market risk premium. In addition, the discount rates reflect the current market assessment of the risks specific to each cash-generating unit or group of cashgenerating units by taking into account specific peer group information on beta factors, leverage and cost of debt as well as country specific premiums. The parameters for calculating the discount rates are based on external sources of information. The peer group is subject to an annual review and adjusted, if necessary. Terminal value growth rates take into consideration external macroeconomic sources of data and industry specific trends.",

As of September 30, 2021, \u20ac20.8 billion in notional amounts were issued and are outstanding (\u20ac23.2 billion as of September 30, 2020). In March 2021 the 1.75% \u20ac1.25 billion fixed-rate instrument was redeemed at face value. In September 2021, the US$ 400 million floating rate instruments were redeemed at face value. In September 2021 the 0.0% \u20ac1.0 billion fixed-rate instrument was redeemed at face value.\n\nUS$ Bonds - In September 2021, the 1.7% US$1.1 billion fixed-rate instruments were redeemed at face value. In March 2021, Siemens issued instruments totaling US$10.0 billion (\u20ac8.6 billion at September 30, 2021) in seven tranches.\n\n## Assignable and term loans\n\nAs of September 30, 2021 and 2020, five respectively two bilateral term loan facilities are outstanding (in aggregate \u20ac 1.8 billion and \u20ac0.85 billion). In fiscal 2021 three bilateral term loan facilities were newly signed: one bilateral \u20ac500 million term loan facility maturing in March 2022 with a one-year extension option; one bilateral US$150 million term loan facility (\u20ac130 million) maturing in February 2022 with a one-year extension option and one bilateral US$350 million term loan facility (\u20ac302 million) maturing in February 2022 with a oneyear extension option. One existing bilateral US$500 million term loan facility (\u20ac432 million) has a maturity until March 2024 with a oneyear extension option remaining and the second existing bilateral US$500 million term loan facility (\u20ac432 million) has a maturity until June 2024.\n\n## Commercial paper program\n\nSiemens has a US$9.0 billion (\u20ac7.8 billion and \u20ac7.7 billion as of September 30, 2021 and 2020) commercial paper program in place including US$ extendible notes capabilities as of September 30, 2021 and 2020. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, US$15 million (\u20ac13 million) and US$2.3 billion (\u20ac2.0 billion), respectively, were outstanding. Siemens' commercial papers have a maturity of generally less than 90 days. Interest rates ranged from 0.05% to 0.21% in fiscal 2021 and from 0.06% to 1.98% in fiscal 2020.\n\n## NOTE 17 Post-employment benefits\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nThe defined benefit plans open to new entrants are based predominantly on contributions made by the Company. Only to a certain extent, those  plans  are  affected  by  longevity,  inflation  and  compensation  increases  and  take  into  account  country  specific  differences.  The Company's major plans are funded with assets in segregated entities. In accordance with local laws these plans are managed in the interest of the beneficiaries by way of contractual trust agreements with each separate legal entity. The defined benefit plans cover 442,000 participants, including 178,000 actives, 84,000 deferreds with vested benefits and 180,000 retirees and surviving dependents.\n\n## Germany\n\nIn  Germany, pension benefits are provided through the following plans: BSAV (Beitragsorientierte Siemens Altersversorgung), frozen legacy  plans  as  well  as  deferred  compensation  plans.  The  majority  of  active  employees  participate  in  the  BSAV.  Those  benefits  are predominantly based on notional contributions and the return on the corresponding assets of this plan, subject to a minimum return guaranteed by the employer. At inception of the BSAV, benefits provided under the frozen legacy plans were modified to substantially eliminate the effects of compensation increases. However, the frozen plans still expose Siemens to investment risk, interest rate risk and longevity risk. The pension plans are funded via contractual trust arrangements (CTA). In Germany no legal or regulatory minimum funding requirements apply.\n\n## U.S.\n\nIn the US, the Siemens Pension Plans are sponsored, which for the most part have been frozen to new entrants and to future benefit accruals, except for interest credits on cash balance accounts. Siemens has appointed the Investment Committee as the named fiduciary for  the  management of the assets of the Plans. The Plans' assets are held in Master Trusts and the trustees of the Master Trusts are responsible for the administration of the assets of the trust, taking directions from the Investment Committee. The Plans are subject to the funding requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as amended (ERISA). There is a regulatory requirement to  maintain  a  minimum  funding  level  of  80%  in  the  defined  benefit  plans  in  order  to  avoid  benefit  restrictions.  At  their  discretion, sponsoring  employers  may  contribute  in  excess  of  this  regulatory  requirement.  Annual  contributions  are  calculated  by  independent actuaries.\n\n## U.K.\n\nPension benefits are mainly offered through the Siemens Benefit Scheme for which, until the start of retirement, an inflation increase of the majority of accrued benefits is mandatory. The required funding is determined by a funding valuation carried out every third year based on legal requirements. Due to deviating guidelines for the determination of the discount rates, the technical funding deficit is usually larger than the IFRS funding deficit. To reduce the deficit Siemens entered into an agreement with the trustees to provide annual payments of \u00a331 (\u20ac35) million until fiscal 2033. The agreement also provides for a cumulative advance payment by Siemens AG compensating the remaining annual payments at the date of early termination of the agreement due to cancellation or insolvency.\n\n## Switzerland\n\nFollowing the Swiss law of occupational benefits (BVG) each employer has to grant post-employment benefits for qualifying employees. Accordingly, Siemens in Switzerland sponsors several cash balance plans. These plans are administered by external foundations. The board of the main foundation is composed of equally many employer and employee representatives. The board of the foundation is responsible for investment policy and asset management, as well as for any changes in the plan rules and the determination of contributions to finance the benefits. The Company is required to make total contributions at least as high as the sum of the employee contributions set out in the",

Sensitivities reflect changes in the DBO solely for the assumption changed.\n\n## Asset Liability Matching Strategies\n\nAs a significant risk, the Company considers a decline in the plans' funded status due to adverse developments of plan assets and/or defined benefit obligations resulting from changing parameters. Accordingly, Siemens implemented a risk management concept aligned with the defined benefit obligations (Asset Liability Matching). Risk management is based on a worldwide defined risk threshold (Value at Risk). The concept, the Value at Risk and the asset development including the investment strategy are monitored and adjusted on an ongoing basis  under  consultation  of  senior  external  experts.  Independent  asset  managers  are  selected  based  on  quantitative  and  qualitative analyses, which include their performance and risk evaluation. Derivatives are used to reduce risks as part of risk management.",

Order related losses and risks are provided for anticipated losses and risks on uncompleted construction, sales and leasing contracts.\n\nThe Company is subject to asset retirement obligations related to certain items of property, plant and equipment. Such asset retirement obligations are primarily attributable to environmental clean-up costs (disclosed in Corporate items of the Segment information) and to costs primarily associated with the removal of leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term.\n\nEnvironmental  clean-up  costs  relate  to  remediation  and  environmental  protection  liabilities  which  have  been  accrued  based  on  the estimated costs of decommissioning the site for the production of uranium and mixed-oxide fuel elements in Hanau, Germany (Hanau facilities), as well as for a nuclear research and service center in Karlstein, Germany (Karlstein facilities). In May 2021, Siemens AG and the Federal  Republic  of  Germany  entered  into  a  public-law  contract  based  on  which  the  obligation  of  final  disposal  of  nuclear  waste  is transferred to the Federal Republic of Germany for a payment of \u20ac360 million. The contract and therefore the payment is subject to the approval of the EU commission under state-aid rules. Estimation uncertainties still relate to assumptions made to measure the obligations that remain with Siemens AG, with regard to conditioning and packaging of nuclear waste, as well as intermediate storage and transport to the final storage facility 'Schacht Konrad' or a logistics depot until year-end 2032. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the provisions total \u20ac507 million and \u20ac638 million, respectively. The decrease results primarily from the reversal of advance payments to the federal",

In connection with the settlement of share based payment awards Siemens treasury shares (at cost) were transferred to employees of \u20ac226 million in fiscal 2021 and \u20ac310 million in fiscal 2020 which decreased Capital reserve and Retained earnings by \u20ac165 million and \u20ac61 million, respectively in 2021 and by \u20ac218 million and \u20ac92 million in fiscal 2020.\n\nAs of September 30, 2021 and 2020, total authorized capital of Siemens AG is \u20ac600 million nominal issuable in installments based on various time-limited authorizations, by issuance of up to 200 million registered shares of no par value. Siemens AG's conditional capital is \u20ac420.6 million or 140.2 million shares as of September 30, 2021 and 2020. Primarily, it can be used to serve convertible bonds or warrants under warrant bonds that could or can be issued based on various time-limited authorizations approved by the respective Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nDividends paid per share were \u20ac3.50 and \u20ac3.90, respectively, in fiscal 2021 and 2020. The Managing Board and the Supervisory Board propose to distribute a dividend of \u20ac4.00 per share to holders entitled to dividends, in total representing approximately \u20ac3.2 billion in expected payments. Payment of the proposed dividend is contingent upon approval at the Shareholders' Meeting on February 10, 2022.\n\nIn November 2018, Siemens announced a share-buyback program of up to \u20ac3 billion. The program ceased in September 2021. On June 24, 2021, Siemens announced that it intends to launch a new five-year share buyback program of up to \u20ac3 billion, beginning in fiscal 2022.\n\n## NOTE 20 Additional capital disclosures\n\nA key consideration of our capital structure management is to maintain ready access to capital markets through various debt instruments and to sustain our ability to repay and service our debt obligations over time. In order to achieve this, Siemens intended to maintain an Industrial net debt divided by EBITDA (continued operations) ratio of up to 1.0 as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In line with our updated Financial Framework we target an Industrial net debt divided by EBITDA (continuing operations) ratio of up to 1.5 for fiscal 2022 and beyond. The ratio indicates the approximate number of years that would be needed to cover the Industrial net debt through Income  from  continuing  operations,  excluding  interest,  other  financial  income  (expenses),  taxes,  depreciation,  amortization  and impairments.  The  fiscal  2020  ratio  is  disclosed  as  computed  in  the  prior  year,  it  is  disclosed  before  retrospective  classification  of discontinued operation.",

Additionally, credit guarantees are issued in the course of the SFS business. Credit guarantees generally provide that in the event of default or non-payment by the primary debtor, Siemens will be required to settle such financial obligations. The maximum amount of these guarantees is equal to the outstanding balance of the credit or, in case a credit line is subject to variable utilization, the nominal amount of the credit line. These guarantees have typically residual terms of up to four years. The Company held collateral mainly through inventories and trade receivables. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, Credit guarantees include \u20ac124 million and \u20ac271 million for which Siemens holds reimbursement rights towards Siemens  Energy.  Siemens  accrued  \u20ac3  million  and  \u20ac18  million  relating  to  credit  guarantees  as  of  September  30,  2021  and  2020, respectively.\n\nFurthermore,  Siemens  issues  performance  guarantees,  which  mainly  include  performance  bonds.  In  the  event  of  non-fulfillment  of contractual obligations by the primary obligor, Siemens will be required to pay up to an agreed-upon maximum amount. These agreements typically have terms of up to ten years. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, Performance guarantees include \u20ac14,508 million and \u20ac27,425",

As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company accrued \u20ac51 million and \u20ac1 million, respectively, relating to performance guarantees.\n\nAs of September 30, 2021 and 2020, in addition to guarantees disclosed in the table above, there are contingent liabilities of \u20ac475 million and \u20ac405 million which mainly result from other guarantees, legal proceedings and from joint and several liabilities of consortia, in particular from the construction of a power plant in Finland. Other guarantees include \u20ac189 million and \u20ac261 million for which Siemens holds reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy.\n\n## NOTE 22 Legal proceedings\n\n## Proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations\n\nAs previously reported, in July 2008, Hellenic Telecommunications Organization S.A. (OTE) filed a lawsuit against Siemens AG with the district court of Munich, Germany, seeking to compel Siemens AG to disclose the outcome of its internal investigations with respect to OTE. OTE seeks to obtain information with respect to allegations of undue influence and/or acts of bribery in connection with contracts concluded between Siemens AG and OTE from calendar year 1992 to 2006. At the end of July 2010, OTE expanded its claim and requested payment of damages by Siemens AG of at least \u20ac57 million to OTE for alleged bribery payments to OTE employees. In October 2014, OTE increased its damage claim to the amount of at least \u20ac68 million. Siemens AG continues to defend itself against the expanded claim.\n\nAs previously reported, in May 2014, the Public Affairs Office (Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico) S\u00e3o Paulo initiated a lawsuit against Siemens Ltda. as well as other companies and several individuals claiming, inter alia, damages in an amount of BRL2.5 billion (approximately \u20ac399 million as of September 2021) plus adjustments for inflation and related interest in relation to train refurbishment contracts entered into between 2008 and 2011. In January 2015, the district court of S\u00e3o Paulo admitted a lawsuit of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo and two customers against Siemens Ltda., Siemens AG and other companies and individuals claiming damages in an unspecified amount. In March 2015, the district court of S\u00e3o Paulo admitted a lawsuit of the Public Affairs Office (Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico) S\u00e3o Paulo against Siemens Ltda. and other companies claiming, inter alia, damages in an amount of BRL487 million (approximately \u20ac78 million as of September 2021) plus adjustments for inflation and related interest in relation to train maintenance contracts entered into in 2000 and 2002. In September 2015, the district court of S\u00e3o Paulo admitted another lawsuit of the Public Affairs Office (Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico) S\u00e3o Paulo against Siemens Ltda. and other companies  claiming,  inter  alia,  damages  in  an  amount  of  BRL918  million  (approximately  \u20ac147  million  as  of  September  2021)  plus adjustments  for  inflation  and  related  interest  in  relation  to  train  maintenance  contracts  entered  into  in  2006  and  2007.  Siemens  is defending itself against these actions. It cannot be excluded that further significant damage claims will be brought by customers or the state against Siemens.\n\nAs previously reported, in June 2015, Siemens Ltda. appealed to the Supreme Court against a decision of a previous court to suspend Siemens Ltda. from participating in public tenders and signing contracts with public administrations in Brazil for a five year term based on alleged irregularities in calendar year 1999 and 2004 in public tenders with the Brazilian Postal authority. In June 2018, the court accepted Siemens' appeal and declared the earlier instance decision as void. In June 2021, the court referred the case back to the court of first instance. In February 2018, the Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico in Brasilia filed a lawsuit based on the same set of facts, mainly claiming the exclusion of Siemens Ltda. from public tenders for a ten year term. Siemens Ltda. is defending itself against the lawsuit. Siemens Ltda. is currently not excluded from participating in public tenders.\n\nSiemens is involved in numerous Legal Proceedings in various jurisdictions. These Legal Proceedings could result, in particular, in Siemens being subject to payment of damages and punitive damages, equitable remedies or sanctions, fines or disgorgement of profit. In individual cases this may also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits. In addition, further Legal Proceedings may be commenced or the scope of pending Legal Proceedings may be extended. Asserted claims are generally subject to interest rates.\n\nSome of these Legal Proceedings could result in adverse decisions for Siemens, which may have material effects on its business activities as well as its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nFor Legal Proceedings information required under IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets is not disclosed if the Company concludes that disclosure can be expected to seriously prejudice the outcome of the matter.",

The fair value of loans from banks and other financial indebtedness as well as other non-current financial liabilities are estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities (Level 2).\n\nThe following table allocates financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value to the three levels of the fair value hierarchy:\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                                                 | Level 1   | Level 2   | Level 3   | Sep 30, 2021 Total   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------------------|\n| Financial assets measured at fair value                                            | 917       | 2,030     | 1,085     | 4,031                |\n| Equity instruments measured at FVTPL                                               | 718       | 77        | 354       | 1,149                |\n| Equity instruments measured at FVOCI                                               | -         | 1         | 674       | 675                  |\n| Debt instruments measured at FVTPL                                                 | 198       | 1         | 57        | 256                  |\n| Derivative financial instruments                                                   | -         | 1,950     | -         | 1,950                |\n| Not designated in a hedge accounting relationship (including embedded derivatives) | -         | 1,098     | -         | 1,098                |\n| In connection with fair value hedges                                               | -         | 307       | -         | 307                  |\n| In connection with cash flow hedges                                                | -         | 545       | -         | 545                  |\n| Financial liabilities measured at fair value - Derivative financial instruments    | -         | 769       | -         | 769                  |\n| Not designated in a hedge accounting relationship (including embedded derivatives) | -         | 505       | -         | 505                  |\n| In connection with cash flow hedges                                                | -         | 263       | -         | 263                  |",

Fair value of debt instruments, is either based on prices provided by price service agencies or is estimated by discounting future cash flows using current market interest rates.\n\nFair values of derivative financial instruments are determined in accordance with the specific type of instrument. Fair values of derivative interest rate contracts are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current market interest rates and yield curves over the remaining term of the instrument. Interest rate futures are valued based on quoted market prices, if available. Fair values of foreign currency derivatives are based on forward exchange rates. Options are generally valued based on quoted market prices or based on option pricing models. No compensating effects from underlying transactions (e.g. firm commitments and forecast transactions) are considered.\n\nThe Company limits default risks resulting from derivative financial instruments by generally transacting with financial institutions with a minimum credit rating of investment grade. Based on Siemens' net risk exposure towards the counterparty, the resulting credit risk is taken into account via a credit valuation adjustment.\n\nIn  fiscal  2021,  Siemens  Advanta  acquired  equity  stakes  for  \u20ac279  million  in  cash  (Thoughtworks).  The  financial  asset  is  mandatorily measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL). The company went public in September 2021 resulting in a gain from fair value measurement including foreign currency effects of \u20ac289 million at Siemens disclosed in Corporate items of segment information and presented in Other financial income (expenses), net.\n\nAs of September 30, 2021 and 2020, Level 3 financial assets include venture capital investments of \u20ac515 million and \u20ac386 million (Next47 investments). In fiscal 2021 and 2020, new level 3 investments and purchases amounted to \u20ac522 million and \u20ac249 million, respectively. Sales of Level 3 financial assets amounted to \u20ac305 million and \u20ac327 million, respectively, in fiscal 2021 and 2020.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, a Level 3 equity investment mandatorily measured at FVTPL was merged with a public holding company in exchange for shares in the new entity, ChargePoint. The transaction resulted in a gain of \u20ac220 million derived from now available Level 1 quoted prices. The gain is disclosed in Other financial income (expenses), net and in Next47 of Corporate items. Subsequently, the investment was contributed to the Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. at fair value of \u20ac270 million.\n\nNet gains (losses) resulting from financial instruments are:\n\n|                                                                          | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                                       | 2021          | 2020          |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                                | (17)          | (168)         |\n| Loans, receivables and other debt instruments measured at amortized cost | 74            | (526)         |\n| Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost                         | 22            | 1,291         |\n| Financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL                      | 1,020         | 552           |\n\nAmounts include foreign currency gains (losses) from recognizing and measuring financial assets and liabilities.

The nominal amounts of hedging instruments by maturity are:\n\n|                                        | Sep 30, 2021     | Sep 30, 2021         | Sep 30, 2020     | Sep 30, 2020         |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                     | Up to 12  months | More than  12 months | Up to 12  months | More than  12 months |\n| Foreign currency exchange contracts    | 3,605            | 14,676               | 10,739           | 4,435                |\n| Interest rate swaps                    | 873              | 5,752                | 450              | 7,110                |\n| therein: included in cash flow hedges  | 13               | 605                  | -                | 598                  |\n| therein: included in fair value hedges | 859              | 5,147                | 450              | 6,512                |\n\nFair values of each type of derivative financial instruments reported as financial assets or financial liabilities in line items Other current financial assets (liabilities) or Other financial assets (liabilities) are:\n\n|                                                              | Sep 30, 2021   | Sep 30, 2021   | Sep 30, 2020   | Sep 30, 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                           | Asset          | Liability      | Asset          | Liability      |\n| Foreign currency exchange contracts                          | 893            | 569            | 933            | 617            |\n| therein: included in cash flow hedges                        | 544            | 231            | 231            | 106            |\n| Interest rate swaps and combined interest and currency swaps | 987            | 155            | 1,835          | 328            |\n| therein: included in cash flow hedges                        | -              | 31             | -              | 107            |\n| therein: included in fair value hedges                       | 307            | -              | 554            | -              |\n| Other (embedded derivatives, options, commodity swaps)       | 70             | 45             | 74             | 33             |\n|                                                              | 1,950          | 769            | 2,842          | 978            |\n\nOther components of equity, net of income taxes, relating to cash flow hedges reconciles as follows:\n\n|                                         | Interest  rate risk       | Foreign currency risk     | Foreign currency risk     |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                      | Cash flow  hedge  reserve | Cash flow  hedge  reserve | Cost of  hedging  reserve |\n| Balance as of October 1, 2020           | (59)                      | 133                       | 117                       |\n| Hedging gains (losses) presented in OCI | 36                        | (263)                     | 97                        |\n| Reclassification to net income          | 6                         | (12)                      | (121)                     |\n| Other                                   | -                         | 114                       | -                         |\n| Balance as of September 30, 2021        | (17)                      | (28)                      | 93                        |\n| thereof: discontinued hedge accounting  | (11)                      | (3)                       | -                         |\n\nAmounts reclassified to net income in connection with interest rate risk hedges and non-operative foreign currency hedges are presented in Other financial income (expenses), net. Reclassifications of foreign currency risk hedges with operative business purposes are presented as functional costs. Costs of hedging reserve is the forward element of forward contracts that are not designated as hedge accounting and which are amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis as the hedged item is time-period related. In fiscal 2021, \u20ac114 million in Other relate to designated foreign currency swaps to hedge risks of the highly probable purchase price payment made for the Varian acquisition. The amount was removed from the cash flow hedge reserve and included in the initial cost of Varian.\n\n## Foreign currency exchange rate risk management\n\n## Derivative financial instruments not designated in a hedging relationship\n\nThe  Company  manages  its  risks  associated  with  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  denominated  receivables,  payables,  debt,  firm commitments and forecast transactions primarily through a Company-wide portfolio approach. Under this approach the Company-wide risks are aggregated centrally, and various derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign currency exchange contracts, foreign currency swaps and options, are utilized to minimize such risks. Such a strategy does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The Company also accounts for foreign currency derivatives, which are embedded in sale and purchase contracts.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe Company's operating units apply hedge accounting to certain significant forecast transactions and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Particularly, the Company entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the risk of variability of future cash flows resulting from forecast sales and purchases as well as firm commitments. The risk mainly results from contracts denominated in US$ both from Siemens' operating units entering into long-term contracts e.g. from the project business and from the standard product business. In fiscal 2021 and 2020, the risk is hedged against the euro at an average rate of 1.2808 \u20ac/US$ and 1.2013 \u20ac/US$ (forward purchases of US$), respectively and 1.2070 \u20ac/US$ and 1.1950 \u20ac/US$ (forward sales of US$).

It factually, also turns interest into \u20ac with volume weighted average interest rates of currently about 0.3%.\n\n## Interest rate risk management\n\n## Derivative financial instruments not designated in a hedging relationship\n\nInterest rate risk management relating to the Group, excluding SFS' businesses, uses derivative financial instruments under a portfoliobased approach to manage interest risk actively relative to a benchmark. Interest rate management of the SFS and businesses remains to be managed separately, considering the term structure of SFS' financial assets and liabilities on a portfolio basis. Neither approach qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. Net cash receipts and payments in connection with interest rate swap agreements are recorded as interest expense in Other financial income (expenses), net.\n\n## Cash flow hedges of floating-rate commercial papers\n\nSiemens applies cash flow hedge accounting to a revolving portfolio of floating-rate commercial papers of nominal US$700 million. Siemens  pays  a  fixed  rate  of  interest  and  receives  a  variable  rate  of  interest,  offsetting  future  changes  in  interest  payments  of  the underlying floating-rate commercial papers. Net cash receipts and payments are recorded as interest expenses. The Company had interest rate swap contracts to receive variable rates of interest of an average of 0.13% and 0.23% as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and paid fixed rates of interest (average rate of 1.95% and 1.95%, as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively).\n\n## Fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt obligations\n\nUnder interest rate swap agreements outstanding in fiscal 2021 and 2020, the Company agreed to pay a variable rate of interest multiplied by a notional principal amount, and to receive in return an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest multiplied by the same notional principal amount. These interest rate swap agreements offset future changes in interest rates designated as hedged risk on the fair value of the underlying fixed-rate debt obligations. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the carrying amounts of \u20ac6,305 million and \u20ac6,938 million, respectively, of fixed-rate debt obligations are designated in fair value hedges, including \u20ac304 million and \u20ac540 million cumulative fair value hedge adjustments. Unamortized fair value hedge adjustments of \u20ac181 million and \u20ac220 million as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, relate to no longer applied hedge accounting. The amounts are amortized over the remaining term of the underlying debt, maturing until 2042. Carrying amount adjustments to debt of \u20ac236 million and \u20ac(123) million, respectively, in fiscal 2021 and 2020 are included in Other financial income (expenses), net; the related swap agreements resulted in gains (losses) of \u20ac(243) million and \u20ac91 million, respectively, in fiscal 2021 and 2020. Net cash receipts and payments relating to such interest rate swap agreements are recorded as interest expenses.\n\nThe Company had interest rate swap contracts to pay variable rates of interest of an average of (0.14)% and (0.13)% as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively and received fixed rates of interest (average rate of 1.50% and 1.49%, as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively). The notional amount of indebtedness hedged as of September 30, 2021 and 2020 was \u20ac6,007 million and \u20ac6,423 million, respectively. This changed 15% and 18% of the Company's underlying notes and bonds from fixed interest rates into variable interest rates as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The notional amounts of these contracts mature at varying dates based on the maturity of the underlying hedged items. The net fair value of interest rate swap contracts (excluding accrued interest) used to hedge indebtedness as of September 30, 2021 and 2020 was \u20ac277 million and \u20ac520 million, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 25 Financial risk management\n\nIncreasing  market  fluctuations  may  result  in  significant  earnings  and  cash  flow  volatility  risk  for  Siemens.  The  Company's  operating business as well as its investment and financing activities are affected particularly by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. In order to optimize the allocation of financial resources across Siemens' segments and entities, as well as to achieve its aims, Siemens identifies, analyzes and manages the associated market risks. The Company seeks to manage and control these risks primarily through its regular operating and financing activities and uses derivative financial instruments when deemed appropriate.\n\nIn  order  to  quantify  market  risks  Siemens  has  implemented  a  system  based  on  Value  at  Risk  (VaR),  which  is  also  used  for  internal management of Corporate Treasury activities. The VaR figures are calculated based on historical volatilities and correlations of various risk factors, a ten day holding period, and a 99.5% confidence level.\n\nActual results that are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income may differ  substantially  from  VaR  figures  due  to  fundamental  conceptual  differences.  While  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income  and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income are prepared in accordance with IFRS, the VaR figures are the output of a model with a purely financial perspective and represent the potential financial loss, which will not be exceeded within ten days with a probability of 99.5%. Although VaR is an important tool for measuring market risk, the assumptions on which the model is based give rise to some limitations including the following. A ten day holding period assumes that it is possible to dispose of the underlying positions within this period. This may not be valid during continuing periods of illiquid markets. A 99.5% confidence level means that there is a 0.5% statistical probability that losses could exceed the calculated VaR. The use of historical data as a basis for estimating the statistic behavior of the relevant markets and finally determining the possible range of the future outcomes on the basis of this statistic behavior may not always cover all possible scenarios, especially those of an exceptional nature.\n\nAny market sensitive instruments, including equity and interest-bearing investments that our Company's pension plans hold are not included in the following quantitative and qualitative disclosures.",

        "page_content": "## Foreign currency exchange rate risk\n\n## Transaction risk\n\nEach Siemens unit conducting businesses with international counterparties leading to future cash flows denominated in a currency other than its functional currency is exposed to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In the ordinary course of business, Siemens units are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the euro. Foreign currency exchange rate exposure is partly balanced by purchasing of goods, commodities and services in the respective currencies as well as production activities and other contributions along the value chain in the local markets.\n\nOperating  units  are  prohibited  from  borrowing  or  investing  in  foreign  currencies  on  a  speculative  basis.  Intercompany  financing  or investments of operating units are preferably carried out in their functional currency or on a hedged basis.\n\nAccording to the Company policy, Siemens units are responsible for recording, assessing and monitoring their foreign currency transaction exposure. The net foreign currency position of Siemens units serves as a central performance measure and has to be hedged within a band of at least 75% but no more than 100%.\n\nGenerally, the operating units conclude their hedging activities internally with Corporate Treasury. By applying a cost-optimizing portfolio approach, Corporate Treasury itself hedges foreign currency exchange rate risks with external counterparties and limits them.\n\nAs of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the VaR relating to foreign currency exchange rates was \u20ac39 million and \u20ac90 million. This VaR was calculated under consideration of items of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position in addition to firm commitments, which are denominated in foreign currencies, as well as foreign currency denominated cash flows from forecast transactions for the following twelve months. The decrease in the VaR resulted mainly from a lower net foreign currency position after hedging activities and a lower volatility between the U.S. dollar and the euro.\n\n## Translation risk\n\nMany Siemens units are located outside the Eurozone. Because the financial reporting currency of Siemens is the euro, the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into euro for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. To consider the effects of foreign currency translation in the risk management, the general assumption is that investments in foreign-based operations are permanent and that reinvestment is continuous. Effects from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of net asset amounts into euro are reflected in the Company's consolidated equity position.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. This risk arises whenever interest terms of financial assets and liabilities are different. In order to manage the Company's position with regard to interest rate risk, interest income and interest expenses, Corporate Treasury performs a comprehensive corporate interest rate risk management by using fixed or variable interest rates from bond issuances and derivative financial instruments when appropriate. The interest rate risk relating to the Group, excluding SFS' business, is mitigated by managing interest rate risk within an integrated Asset Liability Management approach. The interest rate risk relating to SFS' business is managed separately, considering the term structure of financial assets and liabilities. The Company's interest rate risk results primarily from funding in the U.S. dollar, British pound and euro.\n\nIf  there  are  no  conflicting  country-specific  regulations,  all  Siemens  operating  units  generally  obtain  any  required  financing  through Corporate Treasury in the form of loans or intercompany clearing accounts. The same concept is adopted for deposits of cash generated by the units.\n\nAs of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the VaR relating to the interest rate was \u20ac529 million and \u20ac424 million. The increase was driven mainly by higher interest rate volatilities for the U.S. dollar and an increase in interest rate sensitivity for the U.S. dollar related to the US$10 billion instrument issued in March 2021.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk results from the Company's inability to meet its financial liabilities. Siemens follows a deliberated financing policy that is aimed towards a balanced financing portfolio, a diversified maturity profile and a comfortable liquidity cushion. Siemens mitigates liquidity risk  by  the  implementation  of  effective  working  capital  and  cash  management,  arranged  credit  facilities  with  highly  rated  financial institutions, via a debt issuance program and via a global multi-currency commercial paper program. Liquidity risk may also be mitigated by the Siemens Bank GmbH, which increases the flexibility of depositing cash or refinancing.\n\nIn addition, Siemens constantly monitors funding options available in the capital markets, as well as trends in the availability and costs of such funding, with a view to maintaining financial flexibility and limiting repayment risks.\n\nThe following table reflects our contractually fixed pay-offs for settlement, repayments and interest. The disclosed expected undiscounted net cash outflows from derivative financial liabilities are determined based on each particular settlement date of an instrument and based on the earliest date on which Siemens could be required to pay. Cash outflows for financial liabilities (including interest) without fixed amount or timing are based on the conditions existing at September 30, 2021.",

Hence, credit risks are determined by the solvency of the debtors, the recoverability of the collaterals, the success of projects we invested in and the global economic development.\n\nThe effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk through credit evaluations and ratings is a core competency of our risk management system. In this context, Siemens has implemented a binding credit policy.\n\nSiemens maintains a Credit Risk Intelligence Unit to which numerous operating units from the Siemens Group regularly transfer business partner data as a basis for a centralized internal rating and credit limit recommendation process. Due to the identification, quantification and active management of credit risks, this increases credit risk transparency.\n\nRatings and individually defined credit limits are based on generally accepted rating methodologies, with information obtained from customers, external rating agencies, data service providers and Siemens' credit default experiences. Internal ratings consider appropriate forward-looking  information  relevant  to  the  specific  financial  instrument  like  expected  changes  in  the  debtor's  financial  position, ownership, management or operational risks, as well as broader forward-looking information, such as expected macroeconomic, industryrelated and competitive developments. The ratings also consider a country-specific risk component derived from external country credit ratings. Ratings and credit limits for financial institutions as well as Siemens' public and private customers, which are determined by internal  risk  assessment  specialists,  are  continuously  updated  and  considered  for  investments  in  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  in determining the conditions under which direct or indirect financing will be offered to customers.\n\nAn exposure is considered defaulted if the debtor is unwilling or unable to pay its credit obligations. A range of internally defined events trigger a default rating, including the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, receivables being more than 90 days past due, or a default rating by an external rating agency.\n\nTo analyze and monitor credit risks, the Company applies various systems and processes. A main element is a central IT application that processes data from operating units together with rating and default information and calculates an estimate, which may be used as a basis for individual bad debt provisions. Additionally, qualitative information is considered to particularly incorporate the latest developments.\n\nThe carrying amount is the maximum exposure to a financial asset's credit risk, without taking account of any collateral. Collateral reduces the valuation allowance to the extent it mitigates credit risk. Collateral needs to be specific, identifiable and legally enforceable to be taken into account. Those collaterals are mostly held in the portfolio of SFS.\n\nAs of September 30, 2021 and 2020, collateral of \u20ac748 million and \u20ac829 million, respectively, relate to financial assets measured at fair value.  Those  collaterals  are  provided  in  connection  with  netting  agreements  for  derivatives  providing  protection  from  the  risk  of  a counterparty's  insolvency.  As  of  September  30,  2021  and  2020,  collateral  held  for  credit-impaired  receivables  from  finance  leases amounted to \u20ac90 million and \u20ac141 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, collateral held for financial assets measured at amortized cost amounted to \u20ac3,328 million and \u20ac4,109 million, respectively, including \u20ac90 million and \u20ac141 million, respectively, for credit-impaired loans in SFS' asset finance business. Those collaterals mainly comprised property, plant and equipment. Credit risks arising from irrevocable loan commitments are equal to the expected future pay-offs resulting from these commitments.",

Contract  assets generally show similar risk characteristics as trade receivables in operating units.\n\nAmounts  above  do  not  represent  economic  credit  risk,  since  they  consider  neither  collateral  held  nor  valuation  allowances  already recognized.\n\n## Equity Price Risk\n\nSiemens' investment portfolio consists of direct and indirect investments in publicly traded companies that are classified as long term investments. These investments are monitored based on their current market value, affected primarily by fluctuations on the volatile technology-related markets worldwide. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the market value of Siemens' portfolio, which mainly consists of one investment in a publicly traded company, was \u20ac678 million and \u20ac1,055 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the VaR relating to the equity price was \u20ac105 million and \u20ac182 million.\n\n## NOTE 26 Share-based payment\n\nShare-based payment awards may be settled in newly issued shares of capital stock of Siemens AG, in treasury shares or in cash. Sharebased payment awards may forfeit if the employment of the beneficiary terminates prior to the expiration of the vesting period. In fiscal 2021 and 2020, expense from equity-settled awards on a continuing basis are \u20ac294 million and \u20ac295 million; cash-settled awards on a continuing basis resulted in gains (expenses) of \u20ac(8) million and \u20ac(26) million in fiscal 2021 and 2020. Included is expense of \u20ac127 million and \u20ac100 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, resulting from various individually immaterial plans, of which \u20ac66 million and \u20ac45 million, respectively, stem from Siemens Healthineers plans. Siemens Healthineers plans are largely similar to Siemens' plans, except for granting Siemens Healthineers AG shares.\n\n## Stock Awards\n\nThe Company grants stock awards to members of the Managing Board, members of the senior management and other eligible employees. Stock awards are subject to a restriction period of about four years and entitle the beneficiary to Siemens shares following the restriction period without payment of consideration.\n\nStock awards are tied to performance criteria. For stock awards granted in fiscal 2021 and 2020, 80% of the target amount is linked to the relative total shareholder return of Siemens compared to the total shareholder return of the MSCI World Industrials sector index (TSRTarget)  during  a  four-year  restriction  period;  the  remaining  20%  are  linked  to  a  Siemens  internal  sustainability  target  considering environmental, social and governance targets (ESG-Target). The annual target amount for stock awards up to and including tranche 2019 is linked to the share price performance of Siemens relative to the share price performance of five important competitors during the fouryear restriction period. The target attainment for each individual performance criteria ranges between 0% and 200%. For awards granted since fiscal 2019 settlement is in shares only corresponding to the actual target attainment. Awards granted prior to fiscal 2019, target outperformances in excess of 100% are settled in cash. The vesting period is four years.\n\n## Commitments to members of the Managing Board\n\nThe Managing Board's stock awards are based on criteria described above. Fair values are \u20ac12 million and \u20ac12 million, respectively, in fiscal  2021  and  2020,  calculated  by  applying  a  valuation  model.  In  fiscal  2021  and  2020,  inputs  to  that  model  include  an  expected weighted volatility of Siemens shares of 24.30% and 21.58%, respectively, and a market price of \u20ac112.70 and \u20ac116.80 per Siemens share. Expected volatility was determined by reference to historic volatilities. The model applies a risk-free interest rate of up to (0.49)% and (0.24)%  in  fiscal  2021  and  2020,  respectively,  and  an  expected  dividend  yield  of  3.10%  in  fiscal  2021  and  3.31%  in  fiscal  2020. Assumptions relating to correlations between the Siemens share price and the development of the MSCI index were derived from historic observations of share price and index changes.\n\n## Commitments to members of the senior management and other eligible employees\n\nIn fiscal 2021 and 2020, 1,975,492 and 2,688,334 equity-settled stock awards were granted relating to the TSR-Target with a fair value of \u20ac104 million and \u20ac132 million, respectively. In fiscal 2021 and 2020, 493,472 and 672,197 equity-settled stock awards were granted relating to the ESG-Target with a fair value of \u20ac48 million and \u20ac66 million, respectively.\n\nThe fair value of stock awards granted in fiscal 2021 and 2020 (TSR-related) was calculated applying a valuation model. In fiscal 2021 and 2020, inputs to that model include an expected weighted volatility of Siemens shares of 24.34% and 21.58%, respectively, and a market price of \u20ac112.36 and \u20ac116.02 per Siemens share. Expected volatility was determined by reference to historic volatilities. The model applies a risk-free interest rate of up to (0.49)% in fiscal 2021 and up to (0.26)% in fiscal 2020 and an expected dividend yield of 3.11% and 3.31% in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Assumptions relating to correlations between the Siemens share price and the development of the MSCI Index were derived from historic observations of share price and index changes.

The shares are purchased at the market price at a predetermined date in the second quarter. Plan participants receive the right to one Siemens share without payment of consideration (matching share) for every three investment shares continuously held over a period of about three years (vesting period) provided the plan participant has been continuously employed by Siemens until the end of the vesting period.\n\n## Monthly Investment Plan\n\nUnder the Monthly Investment Plan employees other than senior managers may invest a specified part of their compensation in Siemens shares on a monthly basis over a period of twelve months. Shares are purchased at market price at a predetermined date once a month. If the Managing Board decides that shares acquired under the Monthly Investment Plan are transferred to the Share Matching Plan, plan participants will receive the right to matching shares under the same conditions applying to the Share Matching Plan described above with a vesting period of about two years. The Managing Board decided that shares acquired under the tranches issued in fiscal 2020 and 2019 are transferred to the Share Matching Plan as of February 2021 and February 2020, respectively.\n\n## Base Share Program\n\nUnder the Base Share Program employees of Siemens AG and participating domestic Siemens companies may invest a fixed amount of their compensation in Siemens shares, sponsored by Siemens. The shares are bought at market price at a predetermined date in the second quarter and grant the right to receive matching shares under the same conditions applying to the Share Matching Plan described above. The fair value of the Base Share Program amounted to \u20ac25 million and \u20ac33 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Resulting Matching Shares\n\n|                                  | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   |\n|----------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                  | 2021          | 2020          |\n| Outstanding, beginning of period | 1,509,046     | 1,785,913     |\n| Granted                          | 654,483       | 874,793       |\n| Vested and fulfilled             | (624,480)     | (569,405)     |\n| Forfeited                        | (80,385)      | (122,659)     |\n| Settled                          | (69,648)      | (459,596)     |\n| Outstanding, end of period       | 1,389,016     | 1,509,046     |\n\nThe weighted average fair value of matching shares granted in fiscal 2021 and 2020 of \u20ac96.92 and \u20ac89.71 per share, respectively, was determined as the market price of Siemens shares less the present value of expected dividends; non-vesting conditions were taken into account.\n\n## Jubilee Share Program\n\nFor their 25th and 40th service anniversary eligible employees receive jubilee shares. There were 3.15 million and 3.29 million entitlements to jubilee shares outstanding as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.",

        "page_content": "## Description of reportable segments\n\nDigital Industries , offers a comprehensive product portfolio and system solutions for automation used in discrete and process industries, complemented by product lifecycle and data-driven services,\n\nSmart Infrastructure , offers products, systems, solutions, services and software to support a sustainable transition in energy generation sources, from fossil to renewable and a transition to smarter, more sustainable buildings and communities,\n\nMobility ,  combines all Siemens businesses in the area of passenger and freight transportation, including rail vehicles, rail automation systems, rail electrification systems, road traffic technology, digital solutions and related services,\n\nSiemens Healthineers develops, manufactures, and sells a diverse range of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic products and services to healthcare providers,\n\nSiemens Financial Services provides financing solutions to Siemens' customers and other companies via debt and equity investments, offering leasing, lending and working capital financing solutions and equipment, project and structured financing.\n\n## Portfolio Companies (POC)\n\nPortfolio  Companies comprise  businesses  which  deliver  a  broad  range  of  customized  and  application-specific  products,  software, solutions, systems and services for various industries including oil and gas, chemical, mining, cement, logistics, energy, marine, water and fiber.\n\n## Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nSiemens Energy Investment - includes our investment in Siemens Energy accounted for using the equity method as well as a smaller investment in connection with Siemens Energy.\n\nSiemens Real Estate (SRE) - manages the Group's real estate business portfolio, operates the properties, and is responsible for building projects and the purchase and sale of real estate; excluded is the carved-out real estate of Siemens Healthineers; in fiscal 2020 Mobility was excluded as well.\n\nCorporate items - includes corporate costs, such as group managing costs, basic research of Corporate Technology, Siemens Advanta, as well as corporate services and projects. Corporate items also include equity interests, activities generally intended for closure as well as activities remaining from divestments and discontinued operations.\n\nCentrally carried pension expense - includes the Company's pension related income (expense) not allocated to the segments, POC or Siemens Real Estate.\n\nEliminations, Corporate Treasury and other reconciling items - comprise consolidation of transactions within the segments, certain reconciliation and reclassification items as well as central financing activities. It also includes interest income and expense, such as, for example, interest not allocated to segments or POC (referred to as financing interest), interest related to central financing activities or resulting consolidation and reconciliation effects on interest.\n\n## Measurement - Segments\n\nAccounting policies for Segment information are generally the same as those used for the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment information is disclosed for continuing operations; prior year Assets are reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. For internal and segment reporting purposes intercompany lease transactions, however, are classified as operating leases by the lessor and are accounted for off-balance sheet by the lessee (except for intercompany leases with Siemens Healthineers as lessees). Intersegment transactions are based on market prices.\n\n## Revenue\n\nRevenue includes revenue from contracts with customers and revenue from leasing activities. In fiscal 2021 and 2020, lease revenue is \u20ac1,050 million and \u20ac958 million, respectively. In fiscal 2021 and 2020, Digital industries recognized \u20ac4,290 million and \u20ac4,144 million revenue,  respectively,  from  its  software  business,  Smart  Infrastructure  recognized  \u20ac5,769  million  and  \u20ac5,182  million  in  its  products business. Revenues of Mobility are mainly derived from construction-type business.\n\n## Profit\n\nSiemens' Managing Board is responsible for assessing the performance of the segments (chief operating decision maker). The Company's profitability  measure  of  the  segments  except  for  SFS  is  earnings  before  financing  interest,  certain  pension  costs,  income  taxes  and amortization expenses of intangible assets acquired in business combinations as determined by the chief operating decision maker (Profit). The major categories of items excluded from Profit are described below.\n\nFinancing  interest,  excluded  from  Profit,  is  any  interest  income  or  expense  other  than  interest  income  related  to  receivables  from customers, from cash allocated to the segments and interest expenses on payables to suppliers. Financing interest is excluded from Profit because decision-making regarding financing is typically made at the corporate level.\n\nDecisions on essential pension items are made centrally. Accordingly, Profit primarily includes amounts related to service cost of pension plans only, while all other regularly recurring pension related costs are included in reconciliations in line item Centrally carried pension expense.\n\nAmortization  expenses  of  intangible  assets  acquired  in  business  combinations  are  not  part  of  Profit.  Furthermore,  income  taxes  are excluded from Profit since income tax is subject to legal structures, which typically do not correspond to the structure of the segments. The effect of certain litigation and compliance issues is excluded from Profit, if such items are not indicative of performance. This may also",

        "page_content": "be the case for items that refer to more than one reportable segment, SRE and (or) POC or have a corporate or central character. Costs for support functions are primarily allocated to the segments.\n\n## Profit of the segment SFS\n\nIn contrast to performance measurement principles applied to other segments, interest income and expenses are included, since interest is an important source of revenue and expense of SFS.\n\n## Asset measurement principles\n\nManagement determined Assets (Net capital employed) as a measure to assess capital intensity of the segments except for SFS. Its definition corresponds to the Profit measure except for amortization expenses of intangible assets acquired in business combinations which are not part of Profit, however, the related intangible assets are included in the segments' Assets. Segment Assets is based on Total assets of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, primarily excluding intragroup financing receivables, tax related assets and assets of discontinued operations, since the corresponding positions are excluded from Profit. The remaining assets are reduced by noninterest-bearing liabilities other than tax related liabilities, e.g. trade payables, to derive Assets. In contrast, Assets of SFS is Total assets. In individual cases assets of Mobility include project-specific intercompany financing of long-term projects. Assets of Siemens Healthineers and in fiscal 2020 of Mobility include real estate, while real estate of all other segments is carried at SRE.\n\n## Orders\n\nOrders are determined principally as estimated revenue of accepted purchase orders for which enforceable rights and obligations exist as well as subsequent order value changes and adjustments, excluding letters of intent. To determine orders, Siemens considers termination rights and customer's creditworthiness.\n\nAs of September 30, 2021 and 2020, order backlog totaled \u20ac85 billion and \u20ac70 billion (continuing operations); thereof Digital Industries \u20ac7 billion and \u20ac5 billion, Smart Infrastructure \u20ac11 billion and \u20ac10 billion, Mobility \u20ac36 billion and \u20ac32 billion and Siemens Healthineers \u20ac27 billion and \u20ac18 billion. In fiscal 2022, Siemens expects to convert approximately \u20ac34 billion of the September 30, 2021 order backlog into revenue; thereof at Digital Industries approximately \u20ac6 billion, Smart Infrastructure approximately \u20ac7 billion, Mobility approximately \u20ac9 billion and Siemens Healthineers approximately \u20ac9 billion.\n\n## Free cash flow definition\n\nFree cash flow of the segments constitutes cash flows from operating activities less additions to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Except for SFS, it excludes financing interest, except for cases where interest on qualifying assets is capitalized or classified as contract costs; it also excludes income tax as well as certain other payments and proceeds. Free cash flow of SFS includes related financing interest payments and proceeds; income tax payments and proceeds of SFS are excluded. In individual cases, free cash flow of Mobility includes project-specific intercompany financing of long-term projects.\n\n## Amortization, depreciation and impairments\n\nAmortization,  depreciation  and  impairments  includes  depreciation  and  impairments  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  as  well  as amortization and impairments of intangible assets each net of reversals of impairment.\n\n## Measurement - POC and Siemens Real Estate\n\nPOC follows the measurement principles of the segments except for SFS. Siemens Real Estate applies the measurement principles of SFS.\n\n## Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Profit\n\n|                                                                     | Fiscal year   | Fiscal year   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                                  | 2021          | 2020          |\n| Siemens Energy Investment                                           | (396)         | (24)          |\n| Siemens Real Estate                                                 | 94            | 325           |\n| Corporate items                                                     | (435)         | (887)         |\n| Centrally carried pension expense                                   | (170)         | (211)         |\n| Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations | (738)         | (691)         |\n| Eliminations, Corporate Treasury and other reconciling items        | (94)          | (243)         |\n| Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements                 | (1,739)       | (1,731)       |\n\nIn fiscal 2021, Corporate items includes income of \u20ac192 million from Bentley Systems, Inc. stemming from the investment's fair value measurement before its transfer to the Siemens Pension-Trust e.V.\n\nIn fiscal 2021 and 2020, Profit of SFS includes interest income of \u20ac1,154 million and \u20ac1,242 million, respectively and interest expenses of \u20ac313 million and \u20ac436 million, respectively.",

        "page_content": "## Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report\n\n## Opinions\n\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, Berlin and Munich, and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the fiscal year from October 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021, the consolidated statements of financial position as of September 30, 2021, the consolidated statements of cash flows and changes in equity for the fiscal year from October 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including  a  summary  of  significant  accounting  policies.  In  addition,  we  have  audited  the  group  management  report  of  Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, which is combined with the management report of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, for the fiscal year from October 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the Corporate Governance Statement which is published on the website stated in the combined management report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- \u00b7 the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  comply,  in  all  material  respects,  with  the  International  Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU), and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB ['Handelsgesetzbuch': German Commercial Code] as well as with full IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as of September 30, 2021 and of its financial performance for the fiscal year from October 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021, and\n- \u00b7 the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the group management report does not cover the content of the Corporate Governance Statement referred to above.\n\nPursuant to Sec. 322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n## Basis for the opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No 537/2014, referred to subsequently as 'EU Audit Regulation') and in compliance with German Generally Accepted  Standards  for  Financial  Statement  Audits  promulgated  by  the  Institut  der  Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer  [Institute  of  Public  Auditors  in Germany] (IDW). In conducting the audit of the consolidated financial statements we also complied with International Standards on Auditing  (ISA).  Our  responsibilities  under  those  requirements,  principles  and  standards  are  further  described  in  the  'Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report' section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Art. 10 (2) f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Art. 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\n## Key audit matters in the audit of the consolidated financial statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year from October 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nBelow, we describe what we consider to be the key audit matters:\n\n## Accounting for the acquisition of Varian\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: The acquisition of Varian Medical Systems, Inc., USA (Varian), was completed on April 15, 2021. Since then, Siemens AG indirectly holds all the shares in Varian via its subsidiary Siemens Healthineers AG. The  acquisition  was  accounted  for  in  accordance  with  IFRS  3,  Business  Combinations,  on  the  basis  of  a  preliminary  purchase  price allocation. To finance the acquisition, a further capital increase was carried out at the level of Siemens Healthineers AG in fiscal year 2021 by issuing new shares, resulting in an increase of non-controlling interests in the Siemens consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, the Group issued bonds denominated in US dollars to finance the transaction. To hedge foreign currency risks in connection with the acquisition and its financing, the Group entered into hedging transactions which were designated as hedging instruments in hedging relationships.\n\nThe accounting for the acquisition, including financing and hedging of foreign currency risks, was a key audit matter due to the estimation uncertainties and judgments involved in the preliminary purchase price allocation (particularly regarding the measurement of acquired intangible assets) and due to the overall significant impact on the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group, the complexity of the transaction and the associated significant risk of material misstatement.\n\nAuditor's  response: Our  audit  procedures  in  relation  to  the  preliminary  purchase  price  allocation  included  the  assessment  of  the consideration transferred by Siemens and an evaluation of the methodology applied by the external appraiser engaged by management with respect to the identification and valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in accordance with the requirements of IFRS",

        "page_content": "3.  We  assessed  the  suitability  of  the  preliminary  external  appraisal  as  audit  evidence,  among  other  things,  through  inquiries  of management as well as of the external appraiser. With the assistance of internal valuation specialists, we also analyzed whether the assumptions and estimates (particularly growth rates, cost of capital, royalty rates and remaining useful lives) used in determining the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired (particularly the acquired customer relationships and trade names as well as technologies) and liabilities assumed correspond to general and industry-specific market expectations. In addition, we used the expertise of internal industry specialists  for  the  assessment  of  the  recognition  and  valuation  of  identified  intangible  assets  and  liabilities  assumed.  Further,  we reperformed the calculations in the valuation models and reconciled the expected future cash flows underlying the valuations with, inter alia, internal business plans. As part of our audit procedures, we also assessed the earnings effects in fiscal year 2021 resulting from the subsequent accounting for assets acquired and liabilities  assumed,  particularly  taking  into  account  the  remaining  useful  lives  of  the acquired assets. As part of our audit of the accounting for the capital increase, we compared the change in equity with the underlying resolutions of the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board of Siemens Healthineers, the register entries as well as other contractual agreements with third parties. For the bonds issued, we compared the recognized amounts with the respective underlying contractual agreements. With regard to the accounting for hedging relationships we assessed whether the requirements for hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, were satisfied based on the documentation prepared by management and the underlying contractual agreements. We also assessed the accounting for hedging relationships and reconciled the amounts with the respective line items in the consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated statement of income and consolidated statement of comprehensive income. In this context, we further assessed the methodology applied to determine the fair values of hedging instruments and the clerical accuracy of the respective calculations.\n\nFurthermore, we assessed the application of uniform accounting policies, tax effects resulting from the acquisition and the accounting for the first-time consolidation of the Varian entities in the consolidation system. In addition, we assessed the acquisition-related disclosures (including  financing  and  hedging)  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  taking  into  account  the  respective  IFRS requirements.\n\nOur audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for the acquisition of Varian.\n\nReference to related disclosures: With regard to the accounting and measurement policies applied in connection with the business combination, refer to Note 2 Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. An explanation of the transaction including the related financing and hedging transactions as well as disclosures on the preliminary purchase price allocation is included in Note 3 Acquisitions, dispositions and discontinued operations, Note 16 Debt and Note 24 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Revenue recognition on construction-type contracts\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: The Group conducts a significant portion of its business under construction-type contracts, particularly in the Mobility business. Revenue from long-term construction-type contracts is recognized in accordance with IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, generally over time under the percentage-of-completion method. We consider the accounting for construction-type contracts to be an area posing a significant risk of material misstatement (including the potential  risk  of  management  override  of  internal  controls)  and  accordingly  a  key  audit  matter,  because  management's  assessments significantly impact the determination of the extent of progress towards completion. These assessments include, in particular, the scope of deliveries and services required to fulfill contractually defined obligations, total estimated contract costs, remaining costs to completion and total estimated contract revenues, as well as contract risks including technical, political, regulatory and legal risks. Revenues, total estimated contract costs and profit recognition may deviate significantly from original estimates based on new knowledge about cost overruns and changes in project scope over the term of a construction-type contract. The effects of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) on the project business, such as delays in project execution or disruptions in supply chains as well as change in law clauses with regard to compensation for damages or contractual penalties for delays in delivery and their accounting treatment remained of key significance for our audit.\n\nAuditor's response: As part of our audit, we obtained an understanding of the Group's internally established methods, processes and control mechanisms for project management in the bid and execution phase of construction-type contracts. In this regard, we assessed the design and operating effectiveness of the accounting-related internal controls in the project business by obtaining an understanding of  business  transactions  specific  to  construction-type  contracts,  from  the  initiation  of  the  transaction  through  presentation  in  the consolidated financial statements. We also tested controls addressing the timely assessment of changes in cost estimates and the timely and complete recognition of such changes in the project calculation.\n\nAs  part  of  our  substantive  audit  procedures,  which  particularly  involved  project  reviews,  we  evaluated  management's  estimates  and assumptions based on a risk-based selection of a sample of contracts. Our sample primarily included projects that are subject to significant future uncertainties and risks, such as projects with complex safety/technical and regulatory requirements or projects with a large portion of materials and services to be provided by suppliers or consortium partners, fixed-price or turnkey projects, cross-border projects, projects in regions particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and projects with changes in cost estimates, delays and/or low or negative margins. Our audit procedures included, among others, review of the contracts and their terms and conditions including contractually agreed partial deliveries and services, termination rights, penalties for delay and breach of contract, liquidated damages as well as joint and several liability. In order to evaluate whether revenues were recognized on an accrual basis for the selected projects, we analyzed revenues attributable to the fiscal year and corresponding cost of sales to be recognized in the statement of income considering the extent of progress towards completion and examined the accounting for the associated items in the statement of financial position. Considering the requirements of IFRS 15, we also assessed the accounting for contract amendments or contractually agreed options. We further performed inquiries of project management (both commercial and technical project managers) with respect to the development of the projects including the effects of COVID-19 on project execution, the reasons for deviations between planned and actual costs, the current estimated costs to complete the projects, and management's assessments on probabilities that contract risks and claims from joint and several liability will materialize. To identify anomalies in the development of margins and other project KPIs, we also applied data analysis procedures. In designing our audit procedures, we also considered results from project audits conducted by the internal audit function. Furthermore, we obtained evidence from third parties for selected projects (e.g., project acceptance documentation, contractual terms and conditions, and lawyers' confirmations regarding alleged breaches of contract and asserted claims).",

        "page_content": "Due to the large contract volume and risk profile, our audit procedures focused on large contracts for delivery of high-speed and commuter trains.\n\nOur audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to revenue recognition on construction-type contracts.\n\nReference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for construction-type contracts,  refer  to  Note  2  Material  accounting  policies  and  critical  accounting  estimates  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial statements. With respect to contract assets and liabilities as well as provisions for order related losses and risks, refer to Note 10 Contract assets  and  liabilities,  Note  18  Provisions  and  Note  21  Commitments  and  contingencies  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial statements.\n\n## Provisions for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations as well as provisions for asset retirement obligations\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: We considered the accounting for provisions for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, including allegations of corruption and antitrust violations, and for asset retirement obligations to be a key audit matter. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and require estimates that could have a significant impact on the recognition and measurement of the respective provision and, accordingly, on assets, liabilities and financial performance. The proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations are subject to uncertainties because they involve complex legal  issues  and  accordingly,  considerable  management  judgment,  in  particular  when  determining  whether  and  in  what  amount  a provision is required to account for the risks. The uncertainties and estimates with respect to asset retirement obligations pertain especially to the estimated costs for waste treatment and packaging for final storage, for interim storage as well as transport to the final nuclear waste storage facility.\n\nAuditor's response: During our audit of the financial reporting of proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, we examined the processes implemented by Siemens for identifying, assessing and accounting for legal and regulatory proceedings. To determine what potentially significant pending legal proceedings or claims asserted are known and to assess management's estimates of the expected cash outflows, our audit procedures included inquiring of management and other persons within the Group entrusted with these matters, obtaining written statements from in-house legal counsels with respect to the assessment of estimated cash outflows and their  probability,  obtaining  confirmations  from  external  legal  advisors  and  evaluating  internal  statements  concerning  the  accounting treatment in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we examined legal consulting expense accounts for any indications of legal matters not yet considered.\n\nWe further considered alleged or substantiated non-compliance with legal provisions, official regulations and internal company policies (compliance violations) by inspecting internal and external statements on specific matters, obtaining written statements from external legal advisors, and by inquiring of the compliance organization. In this regard, among other procedures, we evaluated the conduct and results of internal investigations by inspecting internal reports and the measures taken to remediate identified weaknesses, and assessed on this basis whether management's evaluation of any risks to be accounted for in the consolidated financial statements is plausible.\n\nBased on the aforementioned uncertainties, our audit procedures with respect to asset retirement obligations focused on the remediation and environmental protection liabilities in connection with the decommissioning of the facilities in Hanau, Germany (Hanau facilities), as well as for the nuclear research and service center in Karlstein, Germany (Karlstein facilities). Our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the estimated costs for waste treatment and packaging for final storage, for interim storage as well as transport to the final nuclear waste storage facility, and the valuation methods used by drawing on the expertise of our valuation specialists. We evaluated management's assessments, particularly regarding the accounting effects of the contractually agreed transfer of the nuclear waste disposal obligation to the Federal Republic of Germany, which is still subject to the approval of the EU commission under state-aid-rules, and the expected costs to fulfill the obligations remaining with Siemens through inquiries of persons entrusted with the matter and inspections of internal and external documents.\n\nFurthermore, we evaluated the disclosures on proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations as well as on asset retirement obligations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOur audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations as well as for asset retirement obligations.\n\nReference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for provisions, refer to Note 2 Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. With respect to  proceedings  out  of  or  in  connection  with  alleged  compliance  violations,  refer  to  Note  22  Legal  proceedings.  With  respect  to  the uncertainties and estimates relating to asset retirement obligations, refer to Note 18 Provisions of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: Siemens operates in numerous countries with different local tax legislation. The accounting for uncertain tax positions as well as deferred taxes requires management to exercise considerable judgment and make estimates and assumptions, and was therefore a key audit matter. In particular, this affects the measurement and completeness of uncertain tax positions, the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the measurement and completeness of deferred tax liabilities as well as management's assessments regarding the tax implications of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAuditor's  response: With  the  assistance  of  internal  tax  specialists  who  have  knowledge  of  relevant  local  tax  law,  we  examined  the processes  installed  by  management  for  the  identification,  recognition  and  measurement  of  tax  positions.  In  the  course  of  our  audit procedures relating to uncertain tax positions, we evaluated whether management's assessment of the tax implications of significant business transactions or events in fiscal year 2021, which could result in uncertain tax positions or influence the measurement of existing uncertain tax positions, was in compliance with tax law. In particular, this includes the tax implications arising from the results of tax field audits, the acquisition or disposal of company shares, corporate (intragroup) restructuring activities and cross-border matters, such as the determination of transfer prices.",

Further, we evaluated management's assessments with respect to the prospects of success of appeal and tax court proceedings by inquiring of the employees of the Siemens tax department and by considering current tax case law.\n\nIn assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, we above all analyzed management's assumptions with respect to tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income, also in view of the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, and compared them to internal business plans. In the course of our audit procedures regarding deferred tax liabilities, we examined in particular the assumptions regarding reinvestment of subsidiaries' retained profits for an indefinite period and assessed these taking into account dividend planning.\n\nOur audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes.\n\nReference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for income taxes, refer to Note 2 Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. With respect to disclosures for deferred tax assets and liabilities, refer to Note 7 Income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for the Report of the Supervisory Board in the Annual Report 2021 within the meaning of ISA [DE] 720 (Revised).

In addition, the other information comprises parts to be included in the Annual Report, of which we received a version prior to issuing this auditor's report, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 the Responsibility Statement (to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report),\n- \u00b7 the Responsibility Statement (to the Annual Financial Statements and the Management Report),\n- \u00b7 the Five-Year Summary,\n- \u00b7 the Compensation Report,\n- \u00b7 the Report of the Supervisory Board,\n- \u00b7 Notes and forward-looking statements,\n\nbut not the consolidated financial statements and the annual financial statements, not the disclosures of the combined management report whose content is audited and not our auditor's reports thereon.\n\nOur opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information\n\n- \u00b7 is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- \u00b7 otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board for the consolidated financial statements and the group management report\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB as well as with full IFRSs as issued by the IASB, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group. In addition, management is responsible for such internal control as management has determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.  It  also  has  the  responsibility  for  disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to  going  concern.  In  addition,  management  is responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting, unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, management is responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, management is responsible for  such  arrangements  and  measures  (systems)  as  management  has  considered  necessary  to  enable  the  preparation  of  a  group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.",

        "page_content": "## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation as well as in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the IDW and in supplementary compliance with ISA will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error  and  are  considered  material  if,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional  omissions,  misrepresentations,  or  the  override  of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by management and the reasonableness of estimates made by management and related disclosures.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the  consolidated  financial  statements  present  the  underlying  transactions  and  events  in  a  manner  that  the  consolidated  financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB as well as with full IFRSs as issued by the IASB.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- \u00b7 Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by management in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by management as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable, the related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n## Other legal and regulatory requirements\n\n## Report on the assurance on the electronic rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report prepared for publication purposes in accordance with Sec. 317 (3a) HGB\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe have performed assurance work in accordance with Sec. 317 (3a) HGB to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the rendering of  the  consolidated financial statements and the group management report (hereinafter the 'ESEF documents') contained in the file SIEMENS\\_2021.zip (SHA-256 checksum: c2fee878a23005add85c87b5f4a7cf3e7883b81d2626892870c12ff3d2a977f8) and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format ('ESEF",

        "page_content": "format'). In accordance with German legal requirements, this assurance work extends only to the conversion of the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and the group management report into the ESEF format and therefore relates neither to the information contained within these renderings nor to any other information contained in the file identified above.\n\nIn our opinion, the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report contained in the file identified above and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format. Beyond this assurance opinion and our audit opinions on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the accompanying group management report for the fiscal year from October 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021 contained in the 'Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report' above, we do not express any assurance opinion on the information contained within these renderings or on the other information contained in the file identified above.\n\n## Basis for the opinion\n\nWe conducted our assurance work on the rendering, of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report contained in the file identified above in accordance with Sec. 317 (3a) HGB and the IDW Assurance Standard: Assurance on the Electronic Rendering of Financial Statements and Management Reports Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with Sec. 317 (3a) HGB (IDW AsS 410) and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised). Our responsibility in accordance therewith is further described in the 'Group auditor's responsibilities for the assurance work on the ESEF documents' section. Our audit firm applies the IDW Standard on Quality Management 1: Requirements for Quality Management in the Audit Firm (IDW QS 1).\n\n## Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board for the ESEF documents\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the ESEF documents including the electronic rendering of the consolidated financial statements  and  the  group  management  report  in  accordance  with  Sec. 328  (1)  Sentence  4  No.  1  HGB  and  for  the  tagging  of  the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Sec. 328 (1) Sentence 4 No. 2 HGB.\n\nIn  addition,  management  is  responsible  for  such  internal  control  as  it  has  determined  necessary  to  enable  the  preparation  of  ESEF documents that are free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the ESEF documents as part of the financial reporting process.\n\n## Group auditor's responsibilities for the assurance work on the ESEF documents\n\nOur objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB. We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the assurance work. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB, design and perform assurance procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain assurance evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our assurance opinion.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the assurance on the ESEF documents in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e., whether the file containing the ESEF documents meets the requirements of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the date of the financial statements, on the technical specification for this file.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate  whether  the  ESEF  documents  enable  an  XHTML  rendering  with  content  equivalent  to  the  audited  consolidated  financial statements and to the audited group management report.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate whether the tagging of the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) in accordance with the requirements of Arts. 4 and 6 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the date of the financial statements, enables an appropriate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of the XHTML rendering.\n\n## Further information pursuant to Art. 10 of the EU Audit Regulation\n\nWe were elected as group auditor by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 3, 2021. We were engaged by the Supervisory Board on February 3, 2021. We have been the group auditor of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft without interruption since the fiscal year from October 1, 2008 to September 30, 2009.\n\nWe declare that the opinions expressed in this auditor's report are consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee pursuant to Art. 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report).\n\n## Other matter - use of the auditor's report\n\nOur auditor's report must always be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited group management report as well as the assured ESEF documents. The consolidated financial statements and the group management report converted to the ESEF format - including the versions to be published in the Bundesanzeiger [German Federal Gazette] - are merely electronic renderings of the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited group management report and do not take their place. In particular, the ESEF report and our assurance opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the assured ESEF documents made available in electronic form.",

        "page_content": "## 3. Notes to Annual Financial Statements\n\n## 3.1 General Disclosures\n\nSiemens AG has registered offices in Berlin and Munich, Germany. The Company is registered in the commercial register maintained by the local courts in Berlin Charlottenburg, Germany, under the entry number HRB 12300, and in Munich, Germany, under the entry number HRB 6684.\n\nThe  Annual  Financial  Statements  of  Siemens  AG  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  regulations  set  forth  in  the  German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB) and the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, AktG). Amounts are presented in millions of euros (\u20ac million). Due to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to totals provided.\n\n## 3.2 Accounting and Measurement Principles\n\nRevenue are proceeds from selling and leasing products, providing services and granting licenses, including licensing contracts for the use of the Siemens trademark.\n\nNegative interest from financial investments is presented as a deduction in interest income , and positive interest from borrowings as a deduction in interest expenses .\n\nIntangible assets acquired for consideration are capitalized at acquisition costs and amortized on a straight-line basis over a maximum of five years or, if longer, the contractually agreed useful life. Items are amortized on a pro rata temporis basis in the year of acquisition. The capitalization option for internally generated intangible assets is not used.\n\nAcquired goodwill is generally amortized systematically over the expected useful life of five to 15 years. The expected useful life is based on the expected use of the acquired businesses and is determined in particular by economic factors such as future growth and profit expectations, synergy effects and employee base.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment : The components of production costs are described in the context of the explanations for inventories. In general, property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method. In certain cases, the declining balance method is applied, whereby a switch is made from the declining balance to the straight-line method as soon as the latter results in higher depreciation expense. Items are depreciated on a pro rata temporis basis in the year of acquisition. Low-value non-current assets that are subject to wear and tear, movable, and capable of being used independently, are expensed immediately or capitalized and fully depreciated in the year of acquisition.\n\nUseful lives of property, plant and equipment\n\n| Factory and office buildings                | 20 to 50 years      |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Other buildings                             | 5 to 10 years       |\n| Technical equipment and machines            | mostly 10 years     |\n| Other equipment, plant and office equipment | 3 to 8 years        |\n| Equipment leased to others                  | mostly 3 to 5 years |\n\nSpecial  reserve  with  an  equity  portion includes  reserves  pursuant  to  Section  6b  of  the  German  Income  Tax  Act (Einkommensteuergesetz), recognized and transferred in fiscal years prior to the transition to regulations of the German Accounting Law Modernisation Act (Bilanzrechtsmodernisierungsgesetz).\n\nFinancial assets : Impairment losses are recognized if the decline in value is presumed to be other than temporary. This applies, if objective evidence, particularly events or changes in circumstances, indicate a significant or other than temporary decline in value. In case of an impairment in prior periods, a lower recognized value may not be maintained if the reasons for the impairment do no longer exist.\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of average acquisition or production costs and daily values. Production costs comprise, in addition to direct costs, an appropriate portion of production and material overheads and depreciation of property, plant and equipment. General administration expenses, expenses for social facilities, voluntary social costs and company pension scheme costs are not capitalized. Writedowns are recorded to cover inventory risks for reduced usability and technological obsolescence as well as in the context of loss-free valuation of unbilled contracts in construction-type and service businesses.\n\nAllowances on receivables are determined on the basis of the probability of default and country risks.\n\nDeferred tax assets for differences between valuations of balance sheet line items in accordance to commercial and tax law and tax loss carryforwards are recognized if a future tax benefit is expected. Deferred tax assets are netted with deferred tax liabilities. Recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities comprise temporary differences of assets, liabilities, and deferred items of entities forming part of the Siemens AG tax group and partnerships to the extent that the recovery or settlement of the carrying amount of assets, liabilities, or deferred items result in a deductible or taxable amount in the taxable profit (loss) of Siemens AG.\n\nOffsetting of assets and of income and expenses : Siemens AG measures assets at fair value that are designated as being held exclusively to settle specified pension obligations and obligations for early retirement ('Altersteilzeit') arrangements and which cannot be accessed by other creditors. Income and expenses relating to these designated assets are offset against the expenses arising from compounding the corresponding obligations and are reported within the line item Other financial income (expenses), net.\n\nPensions and similar commitments :  Siemens AG measures its pension obligations using the settlement amount calculated with the actuarial projected unit credit method on the basis of biometric probabilities. The discount rate used corresponds to the average market interest rate for instruments with an assumed remaining maturity of 15 years as published by German Federal Reserve Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank).",

        "page_content": "Entitlements resulting from plans based on asset returns from underlying assets are generally measured at the fair value of the underlying assets at the balance sheet date. If the performance of the underlying assets is lower than a guaranteed return, the pension provision is measured by projecting forward the contributions at the guaranteed fixed return and discounting to a present value.\n\nAccording to the Act on the Improvement of Company Pensions (Gesetz zur Verbesserung der betrieblichen Altersversorgung), Siemens AG is secondarily liable for pension benefits provided under an indirect pension funding vehicle (mittelbarer Durchf\u00fchrungsweg). Siemens AG recognizes the underfunding in the item Provisions for pensions and similar commitments as far as the respective assets of the pension fund or of the pension and support fund (Pensions- und Unterst\u00fctzungskasse) do not cover the settlement amount of the respective pension obligations.\n\nOther provisions are recognized in an appropriate and sufficient amount to cover individual obligations for all identifiable risks relating to liabilities of uncertain timing and amount and for anticipated losses on onerous contracts, taking account of price and cost increases expected  to  arise  in  the  future.  Provisions  for  agreed  personnel  restructuring  measures  were  recognized  for  legal  and  constructive obligations. Significant provisions with a remaining term of more than one year are discounted using a discount rate which corresponds to  the  average  market  interest  rate  appropriate  for  the  remaining  term  of  the  obligations,  as  calculated  and  published  by  Deutsche Bundesbank.\n\nForeign currency translation : Receivables, other current assets, securities, cash and cash equivalents, provisions and liabilities (excluding advance  payments  received  on  orders)  as  well  as  commitments  and  contingencies  denominated  in  foreign  currency  are  generally measured applying the mean spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Balance Sheet line items denominated in foreign currency which are part of a valuation unit used to hedge foreign currency risk are measured using the mean spot exchange rate on the transaction date. Non-current assets and inventories acquired in foreign currency are generally measured applying the mean spot exchange rate on the transaction date.\n\nGuarantees and other commitments : Siemens AG issues parent company guarantees, i.e. guarantees to ensure performance obligations incurred from the delivery of goods or provision of services by affiliated and long-term investee companies or their parent companies. For measurement purposes, the contract amount of the secured delivery or service agreement is reduced using the straight-line method over the planned term of the delivery or service agreement, unless there are reasons for a different risk assessment and an increased liability amount  ('risk-adequate  liability  amount').  Credit  lines  included  in  the  guarantee  obligations  in  the  context  of  financing  affiliated companies are recognized at their nominal amount.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used by Siemens AG almost exclusively for hedging purposes and - if the relevant conditions are met - are aggregated with the underlying hedged item into valuation units. When a valuation unit is created, changes in values or cash flows from the hedged item and hedging contract are compared. A provision is recognized only for a negative surplus from the ineffective part  of  the  market  value  changes.  The  unrealized  gains  and  losses  from  the  effective  part  offset  each  other  completely  and  are  not recognized in the Balance Sheet or the Income Statement.\n\nClassification of items in the annual financial statements : Siemens AG aggregates individual line items of the Income Statement and Balance Sheet if the individual line item is not material for providing a true and fair view of the Company's financial position and if such an aggregation improves the clarity of the presentation. Siemens AG discloses these items separately in the notes.\n\nThe business and economic environment continues to be affected by the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) . Due to the spread of the virus, it is difficult to predict the duration and extent of the resulting impact on Siemens AG's assets, provisions, liabilities and results. However, the Company does not anticipate that COVID-19-related effects will have a material impact on the financial statements.\n\n## 3.3 Notes to the Income Statement\n\n## NOTE 1 Revenue\n\nRevenue by lines of business\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)   | Fiscal year 2021   |\n|----------------------|--------------------|\n| Digital Industry     | 8,176              |\n| Smart Infrastructure | 4,832              |\n| Other revenue        | 2,086              |\n\nRevenue by region\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                  | Fiscal year 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East | 11,507             |\n| Americas                            | 1,058              |\n| Asia, Australia                     | 2,529              |\n| Revenue                             | 15,094             |",

The additions to Shares in affiliated companies resulted primarily from the increase in the carrying amount of the shares in SPT Beteiligungen GmbH & Co. KG of \u20ac7.8 billion. This increase was due, on the one hand, from the fair value transfer of investment funds by disclosing unrealized gains of \u20ac4.8 billion, which led to a corresponding disposal in Securities with a carrying amount of \u20ac4.1 billion. On the other hand, the additions included supplemental fundings, including shares in Bentley Systems, Inc. in the amount of \u20ac1.0 billion and in ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. in the amount of \u20ac0.3 billion as well as zero-coupon receiver swaps in the amount of \u20ac0.3 billion. In connection with the contribution of the shares in Bentley Systems, Inc., there was a corresponding capital reduction at Siemens Beteiligungsverwaltung GmbH & Co. OHG in the same amount, which resulted in a disposal in Shares in affiliated companies. Also, the intragroup sale of a stake in Atecs Mannesmann GmbH of \u20ac1.1 billion and the sale of Flender GmbH of \u20ac1.0 billion to Carlyle Group Inc. were reflected in disposals in Shares in affiliated companies.\n\nDisposals of investments resulted primarily from the sale of shares in Siemens Energy AG held by Siemens Pension-Trust e.V., totaling \u20ac1.0 billion. Proceeds from the sales were also contributed to SPT Beteiligungen GmbH& Co. KG.\n\nFor the investment in Siemens Energy AG, the market price as of September 30, 2021, was around 11% below the carrying amount of \u20ac5.3 billion. However, the investment is not considered to be permanently impaired due to the unchanged expected value potential.\n\nLoans included loans to affiliated companies amounting to \u20ac3,327 (2020: \u20ac3,249) million, loans to investments amounting to \u20ac43 (2020: \u20ac0) million, and other loans amounting to \u20ac375 (2020: \u20ac312) million.\n\nTotal impairments of non-current assets were \u20ac772 (2020: \u20ac2,193) million.\n\n## NOTE 11 Inventories\n\n|                             | Sep 30,   | Sep 30,   |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| (in millions of \u20ac)          | 2021      | 2020      |\n| Raw materials and supplies  | 491       | 404       |\n| Work in progress            | 264       | 238       |\n| Finished products and goods | 253       | 280       |\n| Cost of unbilled contracts  | 856       | 874       |\n| Advance payments made       | 70        | 73        |\n| Inventories                 | 1,934     | 1,869     |\n\n## NOTE 12 Receivables and other assets\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                    | Sep 30, 2021   | thereof  maturities more than  one year   | Sep 30, 2020   | thereof  maturities more than  one year   |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Trade receivables                     | 1,696          | 40                                        | 1,442          | 69                                        |\n| Receivables from affiliated companies | 17,564         | 4,407                                     | 12,694         | 2,845                                     |\n| Other receivables and other assets    | 1,583          | 186                                       | 1,937          | 170                                       |\n| thereof from long-term investees      | 2              | -                                         | 2              | -                                         |\n| thereof other assets                  | 1,582          | 186                                       | 1,936          | 170                                       |\n| Receivables and other assets          | 20,844         | 4,632                                     | 16,074         | 3,084                                     |\n\nReceivables from affiliated companies resulted primarily from intragroup-financing activities and included trade receivables totaling \u20ac6 (2020: \u20ac31) million.\n\n## NOTE 13 Deferred tax assets\n\nDeferred tax assets resulted mainly from pension provisions and pension-related assets as well as deferred taxes of companies within the consolidated tax group. Deferred taxes from partnerships had an offsetting effect.\n\nFor the measurement of deferred taxes, a tax rate of 31.33% was applied. Deviating from this, a tax rate of 15.83% was applied for temporary differences related to assets, liabilities and prepaid/deferred items of partnerships.",

Subscription rights of existing shareholders are excluded. The new shares may exclusively be offered to employees of Siemens AG and its affiliated companies (employee shares). To the extent permitted by law, employee shares may also be issued in such a manner that the contribution to be paid on such shares is covered by that part of the annual net income which the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board may allocate to other retained earnings under Section 58 para. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act.\n- \u00b7 Further, by resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of January 30, 2019, the Managing Board is authorized to increase, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, the capital stock until January 29, 2024 by up to \u20ac510 million through the issuance of up to 170 million registered no-par value shares against cash contributions and/or contributions in kind (Authorized Capital 2019). Under certain conditions, the Managing Board is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude shareholders' subscription rights in the event of issue against contributions in kind. In the case of issue against cash payment, the shares are generally to be offered to shareholders for  subscription.  However,  the  Managing  Board  is  authorized,  with  the  consent  of  the  Supervisory  Board,  to  exclude subscription rights, firstly for any fractional amounts, secondly, to grant dilution compensation in connection with convertible bonds or bonds with warrants already issued, and thirdly, under certain further conditions, if the issue price of the new shares does not fall significantly below the stock exchange price of the company's already listed shares.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nThe following table presents the development of treasury shares:\n\n| (in number of shares)                                           | Fiscal year 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Treasury shares, beginning of fiscal year                       | 50,690,288         |\n| Share buyback                                                   | 976,346            |\n| Issuance under share-based payments and employee share programs | (4,022,053)        |\n| Treasury shares, end of fiscal year                             | 47,644,581         |\n\nSiemens AG held 47,644,581 treasury shares, equaling a nominal amount of \u20ac143 million, representing 5.6% of the capital stock.",

        "page_content": "On September 24, 2021, the share buyback announced on November 8, 2018 with a volume of up to \u20ac3 billion was completed. The share buyback, which began on December 3, 2018, was executed in the reporting period based on the authorization granted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 5, 2020. In addition to the dividend policy, the share buyback was intended to allow shareholders to continuously participate in the success of the company. In fiscal 2021, Siemens AG repurchased a total of 976,346 treasury shares under this share buyback program. This represented a nominal amount of \u20ac3 million or 0.1% of capital stock. In this reporting period, \u20ac137 million (excluding incidental transaction charges) were spent for this purpose; this represents a weighted average stock price of \u20ac140.22 per share. The purchases were made in the reporting period on 228 Xetra trading days and were carried out by a bank that had been commissioned by Siemens AG; the shares were purchased exclusively on the electronic trading platform of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Xetra). The average volume on these trading days was about 4,282 shares.\n\nIn addition, a final payment of \u20ac410 million was made to the executing bank in fiscal 2021, which led to weighted average acquisition costs of \u20ac100.42 per share in relation to the total share buyback from 2018 to 2021 of 29,385,132 shares with a buyback volume including the final payment of \u20ac2,951 million. The final payment was recognized in the balance sheet as a purchase price adjustment against other retained earnings.\n\nOn June 24, 2021, Siemens again announced a share buyback with a volume of up to \u20ac3 billion in the period from the beginning of fiscal 2022 to 2026. The share buyback, which began on November 15, 2021, will be executed based on the authorizations granted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 5, 2021. In addition to the dividend policy, the share buyback is intended to allow shareholders to continuously participate in the success of the company.\n\nThe treasury shares purchased under the share buybacks may be used for purposes of retirement, distribution to employees, members of the executive bodies of companies affiliated with Siemens and members of the Managing Board, as well as the servicing of convertible bonds with attached warrants.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, Siemens AG re-issued in total 4,022,053 treasury shares under the exclusion of subscription rights in connection with sharebased payments and employee share programs in the Group, equaling a nominal amount of \u20ac12 million and 0.5% of the capital stock. The Company received in total \u20ac203 million for 1,729,089 shares, re-issued against payment of a purchase price. Siemens AG received this amount for unrestricted use. All shares were sold as investment shares in connection with the share matching program to plan participants. In each case, the purchase price was determined on the basis of the closing rate in Xetra trading, determined on a monthly effective date. Therefore, in the reporting period, in total 1,199,097 shares related to the monthly investment plan at a weighted average share price of \u20ac130.61 per share, 158,769 shares related to the share matching plan at a weighted average share price of \u20ac134.02 per share, and 371,223 shares related to the base share program at a weighted average share price of \u20ac67.01 per share (after consideration of a 50% subsidy by the Company). The other shares re-issued during the reporting period can be primarily attributed to the servicing of stock awards granted in fiscal 2017 totaling 1,555,044 shares, to 624,480 matching shares under the share matching program for fiscal 2018, and to 113,440 jubilee shares.\n\n## Information on amounts subject to dividend payout restrictions\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                                                                                                                                     | Fiscal Year 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Amount representing the difference of the recognition of provisions and similar commitments based on average interest rates covering ten and  seven years, respectivly | 890                |\n| Amounts from the capitalization of deferred taxes                                                                                                                      | 1,243              |\n| Amounts from the capitalization of assets at fair value                                                                                                                | 38                 |\n\nThese amounts subject to dividend payout restrictions face other retained earnings in a sufficiently high amount. The unappropriated net income of \u20ac3,400 million is available for distribution.\n\n## Disclosures on shareholdings of Siemens AG\n\nAs of September 30, 2021, the following information on shareholdings subject to reporting requirements was available to the Company pursuant to Section 160 para 1 No. 8 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz):\n\nBlackRock, Inc., Wilmington, USA, notified us on April 14, 2021, that its percentage of voting rights (held either directly or indirectly) in Siemens AG amounted to 6.17% (52,408,410 voting rights) on April 9, 2021.\n\nThe State of Qatar, Doha, acting by and through the DIC Company Limited, notified us on May 10, 2012, that its percentage of voting rights (held either directly or indirectly) in Siemens AG exceeded the threshold of 3% of the voting rights in our Company on May 7, 2012 and amounted to 3.04% (27,758,338 voting rights) as per this date.\n\nThe Werner Siemens-Stiftung, Zug, Switzerland, notified us on January 21, 2008, that its percentage of voting rights (held either directly or indirectly) in Siemens AG exceeded the threshold of 3% of the voting rights in our Company on January 2, 2008 and amounted to 3.03% (27,739,285 voting rights) as per this date.\n\n## NOTE 16 Provisions for pensions and similar commitments\n\nIn Germany, Siemens AG provides pension benefits through the BSAV (Beitragsorientierte Siemens Altersversorgung), frozen legacy plans and deferred compensation plans. The majority of Siemens' active employees participate in the BSAV. The benefits are predominantly based on nominal contributions by the Company and investment returns on assets designated to that plan, subject to a minimum return guaranteed by the Company. In connection with the implementation of the BSAV, benefits provided under the frozen legacy plans were modified  to  substantially  eliminate  the  effects  of  compensation  increases.  Therefore,  valuation  assumptions  for  salary  and  pension increases including career trend are no longer significant for the pension obligation of Siemens AG. The pension benefits are funded via contractual trust arrangements (CTA). A portion of these trust assets also covers the pension obligations of other domestic subsidiaries.",

        "page_content": "Therefore, the assets do not meet the criteria for offsetting against the pension obligation and are presented as financial assets of Siemens AG.\n\nThe actuarial valuation of the settlement amount of \u20ac13,123 million as of September 30, 2021 was based, among others, on a discount rate of 1.98% and on a rate of pension progression of 1.50% per year, except for the BSAV and deferred compensation plans with 1.00% per year. The mortality tables used (Siemens Bio 2017/2021) are primarily based on data of the German Siemens population, using a set of formulas that corresponds to generally accepted actuarial standards.\n\n## NOTE 17 Other provisions\n\nThe  main  amounts  in  other  provisions  were  contributed  by  provisions  related  to  personnel  costs  of  \u20ac1,271  million,  provisions  for decontamination obligations of \u20ac496 million, and provisions for onerous contracts from derivative financial instruments amounting to \u20ac422 million.\n\nIn May 2021, Siemens AG and the Federal Republic of Germany entered into a public-law contract based on which the obligation of final disposal of nuclear waste is transferred to the Federal Republic of Germany for a payment of \u20ac360 million. The contract and therefore the payment is subject to the approval of the EU commission under state-aid rules. Estimation uncertainties still relate to assumptions made to  measure  the  obligations  that  remain  with  Siemens  AG,  with  regard  to  conditioning  and  packaging  of  nuclear  waste,  as  well  as intermediate storage and transport to the final storage facility 'Schacht Konrad' or a logistics depot until year-end 2032.\n\n## NOTE 18 Liabilities\n\n| (in million of \u20ac)                   | Sep 30,  2021   | up to 1  year   | 1 year up  to 5 years   | thereof  maturities more than  5 years   | Sep 30,  2020   | up to  1 year   | 1 year up  to 5 years   | thereof  maturities more than  5 years   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Liabilities to banks                | 501             | 501             | -

KG in preparation for the spin-off of the Siemens Energy business, which occurred on September 25, 2020. The items Obligations from guarantees and Others included guarantees and other commitments for the benefit of companies of the Siemens Energy Group totaling \u20ac0.8 billion and \u20ac12.3 billion,  respectively,  with  corresponding  full  reimbursement  rights  towards  Siemens  Energy  Global  GmbH  &  Co.  KG.  In  addition,  the position  included  indemnifications  issued  in  connection  with  dispositions  of  businesses.  Such  indemnifications,  if  customary  to  the relevant transactions, may protect the buyer from potential tax, legal and other risks in conjunction with the purchased business.\n\nWarranty obligations included obligations of Siemens AG towards affiliated companies totaling \u20ac414 million.\n\nSiemens AG only enters into guarantees and other commitments after careful consideration of the risks concerned and in general only in relation to its own business activities or those of affiliated companies as well as to business activities of companies, if it holds an investment in them or their parent companies. Based on an ongoing risk evaluation of the arrangements entered into and taking into account all information available up to the date on which the Annual Financial Statements were issued for approval, Siemens AG concluded that the relevant primary debtors are able to fulfill the underlying obligations. For this reason, Siemens AG considered it not probable that it will be called upon in conjunction with any of the guarantees and commitments described above.\n\n## NOTE 24 Financial payment obligations under lease and rental arrangements\n\nExpenses for lease and rental arrangements with third parties in which the economic ownership of the leased/rented asset was not attributable to Siemens AG and the relevant items were not recognized as assets by Siemens AG amounted to \u20ac195 million. Object of these contracts were mainly real estate and other non-current assets.\n\nPayment obligations under lease and rental arrangements amounted to \u20ac1,155 million, of which \u20ac74 million resulted from transactions with affiliated companies. Payment obligations under lease and rental arrangements due within the next fiscal year amounted to \u20ac259 million.\n\n## NOTE 25 Other financial obligations\n\nObligations for equity and debt contributions amounted to \u20ac379 million, of which \u20ac165 million related to associates.\n\nApproximately \u20ac2.2 billion were outstanding as of September 30, 2021 from an outsourcing agreement with a maturity of several years.\n\nSiemens AG has entered into a contract to pay its affiliated company Siemens Trademark GmbH & Co. KG, Germany, a running royalty for the use of the Siemens trademark rights. The fee is calculated by applying business-specific royalty rates to brand-related revenue. The contract has an indefinite duration. For fiscal 2021, the corresponding expenses amounted to \u20ac725 million. For fiscal 2022, the royalty is expected to be in the same magnitude.\n\nIn  the  course  of  its  normal  business  operations,  Siemens  AG  is  involved  in  numerous  legal  and  regulatory  proceedings  as  well  as governmental investigations (legal proceedings) in various jurisdictions.

In individual cases, this may also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits. In addition, further Legal Proceedings may be commenced or the scope of pending Legal Proceedings may be expanded. Some of these legal proceedings could result in adverse decisions for Siemens AG that may have material effects on its financial position, the results of its operations and/or its cash flows in the respective reporting period. In addition, Siemens is jointly and severally liable within consortia. As far as not recognized in the financial statements, Siemens AG did not expect any material negative effects on its financial position, the results of its operations and/or its cash flows at balance sheet date.\n\n## NOTE 26 Derivative financial instruments and valuation units\n\nAs a consequence of its global operating, investing and financing activities, Siemens AG is in particular exposed to risks resulting from changes in exchange rates and interest rates, managed in line with a proven risk management system in consideration of defined risk limits. As the parent company of the Siemens Group, Siemens AG has the central role within the group-wide management of financial market risks. To manage the risks resulting from changes in exchange rates and interest rates, Siemens uses primarily foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps, combined interest and foreign currency swaps as well as interest rate options and interest rate futures. Thereby the operating units of Siemens AG are not allowed to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The contract partners of the Company for derivative financial instruments are banks, brokers and affiliated companies. The credit rating for banks and brokers is constantly monitored.\n\nThe following table presents the notional amounts and fair values of those existing derivative financial instruments that were not included in a valuation unit at the balance sheet date:\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                        | Notional amount   | Sep 30, 2021 Fair values   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|\n| Interest rate hedging contracts           |                   |                            |\n| Interest rate swaps                       | 5,325             | 24                         |\n| Interest rate options                     | 950               | 5                          |\n| Existing derivative financial instruments | 6,275             | 30                         |\n\nThe notional amounts equal the contractual amounts of the individual derivative financial instrument which - irrespective of the nature of the concluded position (sale or purchase) - are presented on a gross basis (gross notional amounts).\n\nFair values of interest rate derivative financial instruments are determined by discounting expected future cash flows over the remaining term of the instrument using current market interest rates and yield curves. If option components are included, fair values are determined based on an option price model or quoted market prices.\n\nThe following table presents the carrying amounts, if existing, of derivative financial instruments not included in valuation units and the balance sheet line items in which these amounts were recognized.\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)                                     | Other assets   | Other  provisions   | Sep 30, 2021 Other liabilities   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Interest rate hedging contracts                        |                |                     |                                  |\n| Interest rate swaps                                    | -              | (283)               | -                                |\n| Interest rate options                                  | 1              | -                   | (10)                             |\n| Derivative financial instruments requiring recognition | 1              | (283)               | (10)                             |\n\nProvided the relevant conditions are met, derivative financial instruments are aggregated with the underlying hedged item into valuation units. Using the freezing method, the hedging transactions are not recognized in the balance sheet. The effectiveness of the valuation unit is either ensured through risk management, or is demonstrated both prospectively and retrospectively based on appropriate methods used to demonstrate effectiveness (e.g. dollar offset method, regression method, sensitivity analysis). Valuation gains and losses from derivative  financial  instruments  and  hedged  items  are  netted  for  each  valuation  unit.  A  provision  for  anticipated  losses  on  onerous contracts is recognized for the respective valuation unit in the amount of an existing loss surplus. Profit surpluses are not recognized.\n\n## Valuation unit used to hedge the foreign currency risk\n\nAccording to the Company policy, Siemens units are responsible for recording, assessing and monitoring their foreign currency transaction exposure. The net foreign currency position of the Siemens units serves as a central performance measure and has to be hedged within a band of at least 75% but no more than 100% with the Corporate Treasury of Siemens AG.\n\nThe remaining foreign currency risk after offsetting cash flows in the same currency is hedged by the Corporate Treasury of Siemens AG with external contract partners. The net foreign currency position (before hedging) of Siemens AG is combined with the offsetting foreign currency exchange contracts to a macro valuation unit. For this purpose, hedged items and hedging instruments are measured with the respective underlying discounted cash flows. For foreign currency derivative financial instruments, the determination is based on the changes in relevant forward exchange rates. The existing derivative currency hedging contracts are included in the valuation unit in their entirety  and  had  maturity  terms  until  the  year  2041.  The  cash  in-  and  outflows  from  the  foreign  currency  exchange  contracts,  firm commitments and forecast transactions are disclosed on a net basis in the following table.",

Accordingly, no provision for anticipated losses was recognized for the derivative financial instruments with negative fair values that were included in this macro valuation unit.\n\n## Valuation unit used to hedge the interest rate risk\n\nThe interest rate hedging contracts used by Siemens AG serve mainly to hedge against interest rate risks and to optimize the interest result in accordance with internal interest rate benchmarks.\n\nSiemens AG has entered into interest rate derivatives with external counterparties to hedge interest rate swaps transacted with its affiliated companies against interest rate risk. As of September 30, 2021, the interest rate swaps transacted with affiliated companies included in this macro valuation unit had a notional amount of \u20ac2,080 million and fair values of \u20ac(255) million and had maximum maturity terms until the year 2028. At balance sheet date, these underlying transactions were matched by external interest rate derivatives with fair values of \u20ac115 million, and maximum maturity terms until the year 2028. As of September 30, 2021, the negative surplus for the macro valuation unit, recorded in provisions for onerous contracts, amounted to \u20ac139 million.\n\nTo hedge receivables from affiliated companies against interest rate risk, Siemens AG has entered into interest rate derivatives with external counterparties and combined these instruments with the underlying transactions in a macro valuation unit. As of September 30, 2021, the notional amount of the receivables, which had a maximum maturity until the year 2045, amounted to \u20ac13,904 million. As of September 30, 2021, the cumulative market value changes of these receivables of \u20ac131 million were matched by offsetting interest rate derivatives with a positive net fair value of \u20ac37 million and maximum maturity terms until the year 2040, of which positive fair values were \u20ac148 million and negative fair values were \u20ac111 million.\n\nTo hedge payables to affiliated companies against interest rate risk, Siemens AG has entered into interest rate derivatives with external counterparties. The payables hedged within this micro valuation unit had a nominal volume of \u20ac2,147 million as of September 30, 2021 and maximum maturity terms until the year 2025. As of September 30, 2021, negative cumulative changes in market value of these liabilities of \u20ac101 million were matched by external interest rate derivatives with identical maturities whose market value was \u20ac109 million.\n\nThe amount of interest rate risks hedged with the valuation unit that did not lead to a provision for anticipated losses accordingly totaled \u20ac227 million.\n\n## NOTE 27 Proposal for the appropriation of net income\n\nThe Supervisory Board and the Managing Board propose the unappropriated net income of Siemens AG for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, amounting to \u20ac3,400 million to be appropriated as follows: Distribution of a dividend of \u20ac4.00 on each share of no par value entitled to the dividend, and carry-forward of the unappropriated net income for shares of no par value not entitled to the dividend.\n\n## NOTE 28 Remuneration of the members of the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board\n\n## Remuneration of the members of the Managing Board\n\nMembers  of  the  Managing  Board,  including  members  who  retired  from  the  Managing  Board  during  the  fiscal  year,  received  cash compensation of \u20ac21.4 million. The fair value of share-based compensation amounted to \u20ac11.6 million for 202,139 stock awards. The Company granted contributions under the BSAV to members of the Managing Board totaling \u20ac3.0 million.\n\nTherefore, the compensation and benefits attributable to members of the Managing Board amounted to \u20ac36.0 million in total.\n\n## Total remuneration of former members of the Managing Board\n\nFormer members of the Managing Board and their surviving dependents received a total of \u20ac30.1 million according to Section 285 para. 1 number 9b of the German Commercial Code.\n\nSiemens recognized pension provisions totaling \u20ac131.7 million for the pension entitlements to former members of the Managing Board and their surviving dependents.",

        "page_content": "## Report on the audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report\n\n## Opinions\n\nWe have audited the annual financial statements of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, Berlin and Munich, (the Company) which comprise the income statement for the fiscal year from October 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021, the balance sheet as of September 30, 2021 and notes to the financial statements, including the recognition and measurement policies presented therein. In addition, we have audited the management report of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, which is combined with the group management report, for the fiscal year from October 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the Corporate Governance Statement which is published on the website stated in the combined management report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- \u00b7 the  accompanying annual financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law applicable to business corporations and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2021 and of its financial performance for the fiscal year from October 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021 in compliance with German legally required accounting principles, and\n- \u00b7 the accompanying management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Company's position. In all material respects, this management report is consistent with the annual financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the management report does not cover the content of the Corporate Governance Statement referred to above.\n\nPursuant to Sec. 322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the annual financial statements and of the management report.\n\n## Basis for the opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No 537/2014, referred to subsequently as 'EU Audit Regulation') and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). In  conducting  the  audit  of  the  annual  financial  statements  we  also  complied  with  International  Standards  on  Auditing  (ISA).  Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report' section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional  responsibilities  in  accordance  with  these  requirements.  In  addition,  in  accordance  with  Art.  10  (2)  f)  of  the  EU  Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Art. 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the annual financial statements and on the management report.\n\n## Key audit matters in the audit of the annual financial statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual financial statements for the fiscal year from October 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the annual financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nBelow, we describe what we consider to be the key audit matters:\n\n## Impairment of non-current financial assets\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: The impairment test of non-current financial assets was a key audit matter,  as  in  particular  shares  in  affiliated  companies  and  investments  entail  a  significant  risk  of  material  misstatement  due  to  the materiality of these assets as well as the judgment involved in assessing whether there is objective evidence to indicate a lower net realizable value and permanent impairment. The valuations of non-current financial assets also depend to a large extent on the assessment of future cash inflows, particularly given the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the discount rate applied.\n\nAuditor's response: In assessing whether there was objective evidence to indicate a lower net realizable value and permanent impairment, we obtained an understanding of management's evaluation and also obtained external evidence of ratings, stock market prices, analyst assessments and observable valuation inputs in this regard.\n\nWith regard to the net realizable values calculated by management and its assessment as to whether an impairment is expected to be permanent, we examined the underlying processes related to the planning of future cash flows as well as to the calculation of net realizable value. We assessed the underlying valuation models for the determination of net realizable value in terms of methodology and reperformed the  calculations  with  the  assistance  of  internal  valuation  specialists.  We  further  obtained  explanations  from  management  regarding material value drivers of the planning, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and examined whether the budget planning reflects general and industry-specific market expectations.\n\nForecast accuracy was assessed on a sample basis using budget-to-actual comparisons of historically forecast data with the actual results, also considering the effects attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The parameters used to estimate net realizable value such as the estimated growth rates and the weighted average cost of capital rates were assessed by comparing them to publicly available market data. We also performed our own sensitivity analyses to assess the impairment risk in the case of a reasonably possible change in one of the significant assumptions.\n\nOur audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to assessing the impairment of non-current financial assets.",

        "page_content": "Reference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied for the impairment of non-current financial assets, refer to chapter 3.2 Accounting and Measurement Principles in the notes to the financial statements and with respect to write-downs and write-ups of non-current financial assets, refer to chapter 3.3 Notes to the Income Statement, Note 3 Income (loss) from investments, net as well as chapter 3.4 Notes to the Balance Sheet, Note 10 Non-current assets in the notes to the financial statements.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: We considered the accounting for other provisions, especially for legal disputes, regulatory proceedings and governmental investigations (legal proceedings) resulting from or in connection with alleged compliance violations as well as for decontamination to be a key audit matter. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and require estimates that could have a significant impact on the recognition and measurement of the respective provision and, accordingly, on assets, liabilities and financial performance. Legal proceedings resulting from or in connection with alleged compliance violations are subject to uncertainties because they involve complex legal issues and accordingly, considerable management judgment, in particular when determining whether and in what amount a provision is required to account for the risks. The uncertainties and estimates with respect to provisions for decontamination pertain especially to the estimated costs for waste treatment and packaging for final storage, for interim storage as well as transport to the final nuclear waste storage facility.\n\nAuditor's  response: During  our  audit  of  the  financial  reporting  of  legal  proceedings  resulting  from  or  in  connection  with  alleged compliance  violations,  we  examined  the  processes  implemented  by  Siemens  for  identifying,  assessing  and  accounting  for  legal  and regulatory proceedings. To determine what potentially significant pending legal proceedings or claims asserted also in connection with joint and several liability are known and to assess management's estimates of the expected cash outflows, our audit procedures included inquiring of management and other persons within the Company entrusted with these matters, obtaining written statements from inhouse legal counsels with respect to the assessment of estimated cash outflows and their probability, obtaining confirmations from external  legal  advisors  and  evaluating  internal  statements  concerning  the  accounting  treatment  in  the  annual  financial  statements. Furthermore, we examined legal consulting expense accounts for any indications of legal matters not yet considered.\n\nWe further considered alleged or substantiated non-compliance with legal provisions, official regulations and internal company policies (compliance violations) by inspecting internal and external statements on specific matters, obtaining written statements from external legal advisors, and by inquiring of the compliance organization. In this regard, among other procedures, we evaluated the conduct and results of internal investigations by inspecting internal reports and the measures taken to remediate identified weaknesses, and assessed on this basis whether management's evaluation of any risks to be accounted for in the annual financial statements is plausible.\n\nBased on the aforementioned uncertainties, our audit procedures with respect to the provisions for decontamination focused on the remediation and environmental protection liabilities in connection with the decommissioning of the facilities in Hanau, Germany (Hanau facilities), as well as for the nuclear research and service center in Karlstein, Germany (Karlstein facilities). Our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the estimated costs for waste treatment and packaging for final storage, for interim storage as well as transport to the final nuclear waste storage facility, and the valuation methods used by drawing on the expertise of our valuation specialists. We evaluated management's assessments particularly regarding the accounting effects of the contractually agreed transfer of the nuclear waste disposal obligation to the Federal Republic of Germany, which is still subject to the approval of the EU commission under state-aid rules, and the expected costs to fulfill the obligations remaining with Siemens through inquiries of persons entrusted with the matter and inspections of internal and external documents.\n\nFurthermore, we evaluated the disclosures on provisions for decontamination in the notes to the financial statements.\n\nOur audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for other provisions.\n\nReference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for other provisions, refer to chapter 3.2 Accounting and Measurement Principles in the notes to the financial statements. With respect to the legal proceedings, regulatory proceedings and governmental investigations, refer to chapter 3.5 Other Disclosures, Note 25 Other financial obligations and with respect to the uncertainties and estimates relating to the provisions for decontamination, refer to chapter 3.4 Notes to the Balance Sheet, Note 17 Other provisions in the notes to the financial statements.\n\n## Uncertain tax positions and recoverability of deferred tax assets\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: The accounting for uncertain tax positions as well as deferred taxes requires management to exercise considerable judgment and make estimates and assumptions, and was therefore a key audit matter. In particular, this affects the measurement and completeness of uncertain tax positions, the recoverability of deferred tax assets as well as management's assessments regarding the tax implications of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAuditor's response: With the assistance of internal tax specialists who have knowledge of tax law, we examined the processes installed by management for the identification, recognition and measurement of tax positions. In the course of our audit procedures relating to uncertain tax positions, we evaluated whether management's assessment of the tax implications of significant business transactions or events in fiscal year 2021, which could result in uncertain tax positions or influence the measurement of existing uncertain tax positions, was in compliance with tax law. In particular, this includes the tax implications arising from the results of tax field audits, the acquisition or disposal of company shares, corporate (intragroup) restructuring activities and cross-border matters, such as the determination of transfer prices. In order to assess measurement and completeness, we also obtained confirmations from external tax advisors. Further, we evaluated management's assessments with respect to the prospects of success of appeal and tax court proceedings by inquiring of the employees of the Siemens tax department and by considering current tax case law.\n\nIn assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, we above all analyzed management's assumptions with respect to tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income, also in view of the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, and compared them to internal business plans.\n\nOur audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for uncertain tax positions and the assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets.",

Management and the Supervisory Board are responsible for the declaration pursuant to Sec. 161 AktG ['Aktiengesetz': German Stock Corporation Act] on the Corporate Governance Code, which is part of the Corporate Governance Statement, and for the Compensation Report. In all other respects, management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Corporate Governance Statement referred to above.\n\nIn addition, the other information comprises parts to be included in the Annual Report, of which we received a version prior to issuing this auditor's report, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 the Responsibility Statement (to the annual financial statements and the management report),\n- \u00b7 the Responsibility Statement (to the consolidated financial statements and the group management report),\n- \u00b7 the Five-Year Summary,\n- \u00b7 the Compensation Report,\n- \u00b7 the Report of the Supervisory Board,\n- \u00b7 Notes and forward-looking statements,\n\nbut not the consolidated financial statements and the annual financial statements, not the disclosures of the combined management report whose content is audited and not our auditor's reports thereon.\n\nOur opinions on the annual financial statements and on the management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information, and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information\n\n- \u00b7 is materially inconsistent with the annual financial statements, with the management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- \u00b7 otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board for the annual financial statements and the management report\n\nManagement  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  of  the  annual  financial  statements  that  comply,  in  all  material  respects,  with  the requirements of German commercial law applicable to business corporations, and that the annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Company in compliance with German legally required accounting principles. In addition, management is responsible for such internal control as it, in accordance with German legally required accounting principles, has determined necessary to enable the preparation of annual financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn  preparing  the  annual  financial  statements,  management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  It  also  has  the  responsibility  for  disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to  going  concern.  In  addition,  management  is responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting, provided no actual or legal circumstances conflict therewith.\n\nFurthermore, management is responsible for the preparation of the management report that as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Company's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the annual financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, management is responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as management has considered necessary to enable the preparation of a management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the management report.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process for the preparation of the annual financial statements and of the management report.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Company's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the annual financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions on the annual financial statements and on the management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation as well as in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the IDW and in supplementary compliance with ISA will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or",

We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the annual financial statements and of the management report, whether due to  fraud  or  error,  design  and  perform  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtain  audit  evidence  that  is  sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the annual financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems of the Company.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by management and the reasonableness of estimates made by management and related disclosures.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the annual financial statements and in the management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the annual financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the annual financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Company in compliance with German legally required accounting principles.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the consistency of the management report with the annual financial statements, its conformity with German law and the view of the Company's position it provides.\n- \u00b7 Perform  audit  procedures  on  the  prospective  information  presented  by  management  in  the  management  report.  On  the  basis  of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by management as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable, the related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the annual financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n## Other legal and regulatory requirements\n\n## Report on the assurance on the electronic rendering of the annual financial statements and the management report prepared for publication purposes in accordance with Sec. 317 (3a) HGB\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe have performed assurance work in accordance with Sec. 317 (3a) HGB to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the rendering of the annual financial statements and the management report (hereinafter the 'ESEF documents') contained in the file SIEMENS\\_2021.zip (SHA-256-checksum:  c2fee878a23005add85c87b5f4a7cf3e7883b81d2626892870c12ff3d2a977f8)  and  prepared  for  publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format ('ESEF format'). In accordance with German legal requirements, this assurance work extends only to the conversion of the information contained in the annual financial statements and the management report into the ESEF format and therefore relates neither to the information contained within these renderings nor to any other information contained in the file identified above.\n\nIn our opinion, the rendering of the annual financial statements and the management report contained in the file identified above and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format. Beyond this assurance opinion and our audit opinions on the accompanying annual financial statements and the accompanying management report for the fiscal year from October 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021 contained in the 'Report on the audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report' above, we do not express any assurance opinion on the information contained within these renderings or on the other information contained in the file identified above.\n\n## Basis for the opinion\n\nWe conducted our assurance work on the rendering of the annual financial statements and the management report contained in the file identified above in accordance with Sec. 317 (3a) HGB and the IDW Assurance Standard: Assurance on the Electronic Rendering of Financial Statements and Management Reports Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with Sec. 317 (3a) HGB (IDW AsS 410) and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised).

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the assurance work. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Sec. 328 (1) HGB, design and perform assurance procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain assurance evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our assurance opinion.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the assurance on the ESEF documents in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e., whether the file containing the ESEF documents meets the requirements of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the date of the financial statements, on the technical specification for this file.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate whether the ESEF documents enable an XHTML rendering with content equivalent to the audited annual financial statements and to the audited management report.\n\n## Further information pursuant to Art. 10 of the EU Audit Regulation\n\nWe were elected as auditor by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February 3, 2021. We were engaged by the Supervisory Board on February 3, 2021. We have been the auditor of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft without interruption since the fiscal year from October 1, 2008 to September 30, 2009.\n\nWe declare that the opinions expressed in this auditor's report are consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee pursuant to Art. 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report).\n\nIn addition to the financial statement audit, we have provided to the Company or entities controlled by it the following services that are not disclosed in the annual financial statements or in the management report:\n\nIn  addition  to  auditing  the  statutory  financial  statements  of  Siemens  AG, we performed the statutory audit of Siemens' consolidated financial statements, audits of financial statements of subsidiaries of Siemens AG, reviews of interim financial statements integrated in the audit, project-based IT audits, audit services in connection with the implementation of new accounting standards as well as service organization control engagements.\n\nAudit-related  services  include  primarily  audits  of  financial  statements  as  well  as  other  attestation  services  in  connection  with  M&A activities,  attestation  services  related  to  the  sustainability  reporting,  comfort  letters  and  other  attestation  services  required  under regulatory requirements, contractually agreed or requested on a voluntary basis. Permitted tax services were rendered in connection with audit-related support for the analysis of the design of the tax compliance management system performed by Siemens.\n\n## Other matter - use of the auditor's report\n\nOur auditor's report must always be read together with the audited annual financial statements and the audited management report as well  as  the  assured  ESEF  documents.  The  annual  financial  statements  and  the  management  report  converted  to  the  ESEF  format  including the versions to be published in the Bundesanzeiger [German Federal Gazette] - are merely electronic renderings of the audited annual financial  statements and the audited management report and do not take their place. In particular, the ESEF report and our assurance opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the assured ESEF documents made available in electronic form.",

        "page_content": "## A. Fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted in retrospect\n\nThe  Managing  Board  and  the  Supervisory  Board  of Siemens AG  have  decided  to  voluntarily  implement ahead of time the new legal requirements regarding the issuance of the Compensation Report that are set out in Section /one.fitted/six.fitted/two.fitted of the German Stock Corporation Act. The emphasis of the Report continues to be on providing clear, transparent and comprehensive reporting. The Managing Board and the Supervisory Board have also decided to commission the independent auditor to con\u00ad duct a substantive audit of the Compensation Report, over and above the requirement set out in Section /one.fitted/six.fitted/two.fitted para. /three.fitted sent. /one.fitted and /two.fitted of the German Stock Corporation Act.\n\n## What did the economic and political environment look like at the start of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted?\n\nIn the fall of /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the outlook for the fiscal year ahead was anything but stable. Due to the ongoing COVID\u00ad/one.fitted/nine.fitted pandemic,  Siemens  and  its  customers  and  partners worldwide faced major challenges. In the U. S., the presi\u00ad dential election was imminent, and it wasn't clear what economic consequences the tense relations between the U. S. and China would have. There were also structural problems in Siemens' key customer sectors such as ma\u00ad chine building - due to low capacity utilization - and in the  automobile industry, which is undergoing a dramatic structural transformation. All these factors are having an impact on Siemens' business. In retrospect, we've experi\u00ad enced an exciting and a very challenging, but also a very successful fiscal year. The employees of Siemens have delivered a stellar performance in difficult times.\n\n## Changes in the Managing Board and the Compensation  Committee\n\nIn fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, there were also changes in the Managing Board. Matthias Rebellius and Judith Wiese were ap\u00ad pointed full members of the Managing Board effective October /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. Joe Kaeser left the Managing Board effective the end of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February /three.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. Klaus Helmrich left the Managing Board effective March /three.fitted/one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. The Supervisory Board is very grateful to both Mr. Kaeser and Mr. Helmrich for their many years of successful work on behalf of Siemens and for their extraordinary services to the Company.\n\nDr. Roland Busch was appointed President and CEO effec\u00ad tive the end of the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted Annual Shareholders' Meeting. He combines entrepreneurial farsightedness with a de\u00ad sire to optimally support customers in their digital and sustainable transformation. The Company is driving this transformation with technologies that add real value for customers - technologies that will continue to be crucial for Siemens in the future and of which Dr. Roland Busch has a deep and broad understanding.\n\nFollowing the scheduled departure of Werner Wenning, the previous, long\u00adserving Chairman of the Compensa\u00ad tion Committee of the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG, from the Supervisory Board and thereby also from the Compensation Committee, the Compensation Commit\u00ad tee elected Michael Diekmann to serve as its new Chair\u00ad man effective February /four.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. The Compensation Com\u00ad mittee also acquired two new members: Harald Kern, who joined the Committee in October /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, succeeding Robert  Kensbock,  who  left  the  Supervisory  Board on   September /two.fitted/five.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the  effective  date  of  the Siemens Energy spin\u00adoff, and Matthias Zachert, who joined the Committee in February /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted.",

        "page_content": "## How is the new strategy reflected in Managing Board compensation?\n\nThe Managing Board presented the new Company strat\u00ad egy for accelerated high value growth at Capital Market Day on June /two.fitted/four.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted: Siemens as a focused technology company, active in highly attractive growth markets that are the backbone of the global economy: industry, infra\u00ad structure, transportation and healthcare. The Super visory Board is convinced that this strategy positions Siemens to meet the challenges of the future. The Managing Board compensation that has been determined by the Supervi\u00ad sory Board fosters the implementation of the Company's strategic targets by providing incentives for increasing profit and capital efficiency and for cash generation.\n\nTaking into account all the changes and the existing chal\u00ad lenges, the Compensation Committee of the Supervisory Board intensively discussed the key performance indica\u00ad tors for variable compensation as well as the individual targets for Managing Board members. As a result of its decision to place the focus on the Managing Board's over\u00ad all responsibility and cross\u00adbusiness collaboration, two\u00ad thirds of the short\u00adterm variable compensation (Bonus) of all Managing Board members were determined on the basis of the same criteria. Strategic and sustainability\u00ad related aspects, which are measured on the basis of the members' individual areas of responsibility, are anchored in the remaining third of short\u00adterm variable compensa\u00ad tion, the 'individual targets.'\n\nSustainability  -  strategic  goal  and  an  expression  of Siemens' social responsibility - is also firmly anchored in the long\u00adterm variable compensation of both the Manag\u00ad ing Board and the roughly /seven.fitted,/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted other Company manag\u00ad ers worldwide. At Capital Market Day in /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, DEGREE, a framework that addresses sustainability from every angle and defines ambitious targets, was introduced. As a re\u00ad sult, the environment, society and good governance will play a significantly stronger role. The key performance indicators applied in long\u00adterm variable compensation are part of this framework (CO /two.fitted emissions and digital learning hours) and /or reflect the Company's priorities (Net Pro\u00ad moter Score as an expression of customer satisfaction).\n\n## How did Siemens perform in  fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted?\n\nDespite the challenges and the economic and pandem\u00ad ic\u00adrelated uncertainty, Siemens has achieved outstanding results. For example, the Company succeeded in main\u00ad taining its supply chains and its delivery capacity during the fiscal year and continued to be a reliable partner to its customers. These developments were reflected in the strong financial performance in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. Siemens raised its outlook several times during the fiscal year, most recently after the third quarter, and reached or ex\u00ad ceeded all the targets set for the primary measures for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. Return on capital employed (ROCE) was in double\u00addigits, and the capital structure ratio came in at /one.fitted./five.fitted. Basic EPS from net income increased /five.fitted/four.fitted % to \u20ac /seven.fitted./six.fitted/eight.fitted. In addition, free cash flow from continuing and discontin\u00ad ued operations for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted increased /two.fitted/nine.fitted % year\u00adover\u00ad year to \u20ac /eight.fitted./two.fitted billion, reaching a new high. Revenue also was higher at all industrial businesses, rising to \u20ac /six.fitted/two.fitted./three.fitted bil\u00ad lion. Siemens achieved revenue growth of /one.fitted/one.fitted./five.fitted % net of currency translation and portfolio effects and delivered net income of \u20ac /six.fitted./seven.fitted billion. Discontinued operations, largely related to the sale of Flender, contributed income of \u20ac /one.fitted./one.fitted billion in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted.\n\nIn line with the principle anchored in the compensation system - namely, that exceptional performance should be appropriately rewarded and that failure to achieve tar\u00ad gets should result in a perceptible reduction in compen\u00ad sation (the pay for performance principle) - the excellent results of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted are reflected in the Managing Board's variable compensation, which takes into account not only financial success but also environmental and social aspects. As a result, the compensation of the Man\u00ad aging Board members is also oriented toward the inter\u00ad ests of the shareholders as well as the other stakeholders of Siemens AG.",

Compensation of Managing Board members\n\n## B.1  The compensation system at a glance\n\nThe current compensation system for the members of the Managing Board of Siemens AG has been in place since fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and was endorsed by the Annual Share\u00ad holders' Meeting on February /five.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, by a majority of /nine.fitted/four.fitted./five.fitted/one.fitted %.\n\nThe compensation of the Managing Board members con\u00ad sists of fixed and variable components. Fixed compensa\u00ad tion, which is not performance\u00adbased, comprises base salary, fringe benefits and a pension benefit commit\u00ad ment. Short\u00adterm variable compensation (Bonus) and long\u00adterm variable compensation (Stock Awards) are per\u00ad formance\u00adbased compensation and thus variable.\n\nThe Share Ownership Guidelines are a further key com\u00ad ponent of the compensation system. They obligate Man\u00ad aging Board members to permanently hold Siemens shares worth a defined multiple of their base salary and to purchase additional shares in the event that the value of their shares falls below the defined amount.\n\nThe Managing Board compensation system is also sup\u00ad plemented by commitments granted in connection with the commencement and termination of appointments to the Managing Board as well as any change in the regular place of work.\n\nThe following table provides an overview of the compo\u00ad nents of the compensation system for Managing Board members, the underlying goals (including the link to the Company's strategy) and the components' concrete im\u00ad plementation in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted.\n\n## FIXED COMPENSATION\n\nCompetitive compensation in order to obtain the best candidates worldwide to develop and execute the Company 's strategy and manage its operations and in order to retain these individuals at the Company over the long term\n\n| Base salary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Fringe benefits                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Pension benefit commitment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Contractually agreed fixed annual  compensation based on a  Managing Board member's duties  and related responsibilities and his  or her experience   Payment in /one.fitted/two.fitted monthly installments                                       | amount relative to base salary, cover\u00ad   Annual contributions to the  Siemens Defined Contribution  Pension Plan (BSAV)   Newly appointed Managing Board  members as of October /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted:   fixed cash amount for free disposal   Commitment at beginning   of fiscal year                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Implementation   in compensation   system   Determination of a maximum  ing expenses incurred to the benefit  of the Managing Board member   Includes in\u00adkind compensation   and fringe benefits granted by the  Company, for example: -  Provision of a company car          |\n| President and CEO:   \u20ac /one.fitted,/seven.fitted/seven.fitted/zero.fitted,/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted  p. a.

In making this determination, the Supervisory Board has ensured that the proportion of long\u00adterm variable compensation always exceeds that of short\u00adterm variable compensation and that the proportions of the individual compensation components are within the ranges defined in the com\u00ad pensation system.\n\nComposition of total target compensation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn line with the decision not to adjust, as a rule, employee compensation worldwide in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted due to the ongo\u00ad ing COVID\u00ad/one.fitted/nine.fitted pandemic, the total target compensation of the Managing Board members was not increased except in the case of Dr. Roland Busch and is unchanged com\u00ad pared to fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. The total target compensation of Dr. Roland Busch was increased as of October /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, due to his appointment as President and CEO effec\u00ad tive the end of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February /three.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, and the related expansion of his duties already at the beginning of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted.\n\nAs in previous years, all components of the compen\u00ad sation of the position of President and CEO /one.fitted were differ\u00ad entiated.

Maximum compensation is equal to the total of the maximum amounts of all com\u00ad pensation components that can possibly be paid out to each Managing Board member for the relevant fiscal year. It is calculated by adding base salary, maximum fringe benefits, the BSAV contribution (or the amount for free disposal) as well as two times the Bonus target\n\namount and three times the Stock Awards target amount.

        "page_content": "The base salary and the BSAV contribution (or the amount for free disposal) are fixed amounts. In no case did the fringe benefits awarded to a Managing Board member exceed the maximum amount defined for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. The Bonus cap was not reached in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted.\n\nSince the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted Stock Awards tranche is not due until No\u00ad vember /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/four.fitted, compliance with the maximum limit of the Stock Awards for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted can only be finally assessed in November /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/four.fitted, when the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted Stock Awards tranche is settled. However, compliance with the maximum com\u00ad pensation for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted in accordance with Section /eight.fitted/seven.fitted a of the German Stock Corporation Act is already ensured since the maximum compensation for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted will not be exceeded even if the value of the Siemens shares transferred equals /three.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % of the Stock Awards target amount (cap).\n\nThe final assessment of compliance with the maximum compensation for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted will be included in the Com\u00ad pensation Report for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/five.fitted.\n\n## B./two.fitted./three.fitted Appropriateness of compensation\n\nThe Supervisory Board conducted the annual review of Managing Board compensation in order to determine the latter 's appropriateness and conformity with market conditions.  For  this  purpose,  the  Supervisory  Board assessed - with the assistance of an external and inde\u00ad pendent compensation consultant and in accordance with the compensation system - the compensation's level and structure relative to the companies included in the DAX /four.fitted/zero.fitted, the German blue\u00adchip stock index, and rela\u00ad tive to the companies included in the STOXX Europe /five.fitted/zero.fitted ( horizontal comparison). In the course of its review, the Supervisory Board also assessed the development of Managing Board compensation relative to the compen\u00ad sation of Senior Management and Siemens' total work\u00ad force in Germany (vertical comparison). Senior Manage\u00ad ment  comprises  executive  employees.  The  total workforce comprises Senior Management as well as the Siemens employees who are covered by collective bar\u00ad gaining agreements and those who are not. In addition\n\nto a status quo analysis, the vertical comparison took into account the development of compensation ratios over time. Since Siemens Healthineers is a separately man\u00ad aged, publicly listed company, its workforce was not in\u00ad cluded in the vertical comparison.\n\nThe appropriateness review of Managing Board com\u00ad pensation for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted has shown that the Managing Board compensation resulting from target achievement in  fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted is appropriate.\n\n## B.3  Variable compensation in  fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted\n\nVariable  compensation  is  tied  to  performance  and accounts for a significant proportion of the total compen\u00ad sation of Managing Board members. It consists of a short\u00ad term variable component (Bonus) and a long\u00adterm variable component (Stock Awards).\n\nThe performance criteria and the key performance indi\u00ad cators used to measure performance for variable com\u00ad pensation in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted are derived from the Company 's strategic goals and operational steering and are in line with the current compensation system. As a rule, all the performance criteria measure successful value creation in all its different forms, as strategically envisioned. In line with Siemens' social responsibility, sustainability is also included in the performance criteria.\n\nThe performance criteria relevant for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, the key performance indicators, the focus topics and the ex\u00ad planations of how these foster the Company's long\u00adterm development are shown in the following table.",

One financial  performance  criterion  is  assigned  to  the 'Siemens Group' dimension and another to the 'Manag\u00ad ing Board portfolio' dimension. The fulfillment of these criteria is measured on the basis of key performance indi\u00ad\n\ncators. Within the 'Individual targets' dimension, the financial performance criteria growth and liquidity can be employed as can additional non\u00adfinancial performance criteria. In the case of non\u00adfinancial performance criteria, the Supervisory Board considers the degree to which a Managing Board member has fulfilled so\u00adcalled focus topics, which comprise operations\u00adrelated aspects of the execution of the Company's strategy as well as sustain\u00ad ability\u00adrelated aspects.\n\nAt the end of the fiscal year, target achievement for the individual key performance indicators and the achieve\u00ad ment of the Managing Board members' individual tar\u00ad gets are determined and aggregated to form a weighted average. The percentage of weighted target achieve\u00ad ment multiplied by the individual target amount yields the  Bonus payout amount for the past fiscal year.

EPS is calculated by dividing income from continuing operations, income from discontinued operations and net income - all attributable to ordinary shareholders of Siemens AG - by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the fiscal year.\n\nFor both target setting and target achievement, the average EPS of three consecutive fiscal years is used. The averaged values take account of the Company's long\u00adterm performance and provide incentives for a sustainable in\u00ad crease in profit. Because of the significant change in the portfolio of Siemens AG due to the spin\u00adoff of Siemens Energy at the end of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the EPS target for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted was defined on the basis of the comparable EPS of continuing operations in the years /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/eight.fitted through /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted.

For this reason, the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG established 'profit\u00ad ability /capital efficiency' measured in terms of return on capital employed (ROCE) as the performance criterion\n\nfor the 'Managing Board portfolio' target dimension for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted for all Managing Board members. ROCE is defined as profit before interest and after tax divided by average capital employed. The target amount for ROCE is based on the budget plans. To focus on the operating performance of Siemens AG, Varian and main effects relating to the stake in Siemens Energy (profit 'Siemens Energy Investment' and asset 'Siemens Energy Invest\u00ad ment') were disregarded in target setting and in deter\u00ad mining ROCE target achievement.\n\nReturn on capital employed (ROCE): Target setting and target achievement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 'Individual targets' target dimension\n\nThe 'Individual targets' target dimension comprises two to four equally weighted individual targets, achievement of each of which may be between /zero.fitted % and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted %.\n\nWhen setting the targets for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, the Supervisory Board took into account both the shared tasks and the individual responsibilities of the Managing Board mem\u00ad bers. For this reason, the cash conversion rate (CCR) was defined as a target for all Managing Board members. The CCR reflects a company's ability to convert profit into available  cash.  For  the  President  and  CEO  and  the Managing Board members with primarily functional responsibility, the CCR target was defined on the basis of Siemens' Industrial Businesses (IB). The CCR IB is defined as the ratio of free cash flow from IB to Adjusted EBITA IB.\n\nFor the Managing Board members with business respon\u00ad sibility for Digital Industries (DI) and Smart Infrastructure (SI), the CCR targets are business\u00adspecific and defined as the ratio of free cash flow to Adjusted EBITA at each busi\u00ad ness.

A Stock Award is the claim to one share - conditional on target achievement - after the ex\u00ad piration of a defined vesting period. The vesting period is, accordingly, the term of each tranche.\n\nAt the beginning of a fiscal year, the Supervisory Board defines a target amount in euros based on /one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % target achievement for each Managing Board member. This tar\u00ad get amount is extrapolated to target achievement of /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % ('maximum allocation amount'). Stock Awards for this maximum allocation amount are then allocated to the Managing Board members. The number of Stock Awards is calculated by dividing the maximum allocation amount by the price of the Siemens share on the allocation date, less the estimated discounted dividends ('allocation price').\n\nAn approximately four\u00adyear vesting period begins with the allocation of Stock Awards, after the expiration of which Siemens shares are transferred. The beneficiary Managing Board members are not entitled to dividends during the vesting period.\n\n## Performance criteria\n\nSince fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the number of Siemens shares that is actually transferred depends /eight.fitted/zero.fitted % on the financial perfor\u00ad mance criterion 'long\u00adterm value creation,' measured on the basis of the key performance indicator 'total share\u00ad holder return' (TSR), and /two.fitted/zero.fitted % on the non\u00adfinancial per\u00ad formance criterion 'sustainability.' For measuring the 'sustainability' performance criterion, Siemens AG's per\u00ad formance in the environmental, social and governance (ESG) area is assessed on the basis of a Siemens\u00adinternal ESG / Sustainability index, the composition of which is de\u00ad termined annually by the Supervisory Board.\n\nTotal shareholder return - TSR is indicative of the perfor\u00ad mance of one share over a specified period of time - in the case of Siemens, over the approximately four\u00adyear vesting period. It takes into account changes in the share price and the dividends paid during this period. To reflect the Company's international footprint, the TSR of Siemens AG is compared at the end of the vesting period with the TSR of an international sector index, the MSCI World Industrials or a comparable successor index.\n\nTarget achievement for TSR is concretely determined by first calculating a TSR reference value for Siemens AG and a TSR reference value for the sector index. The TSR",

The fair value for the ESG component of \u20ac /nine.fitted/seven.fitted./nine.fitted/six.fitted is equal to the Xetra closing price of the Siemens share on the allocation date, less the discounted expected dividends. For the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted tranche, the allocation date in accordance with IFRS /two.fitted was December /one.fitted/four.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted (the date of communication to the Managing Board members).\n- 2 In addition to his position as a member of the Managing Board of Siemens AG, Matthias Rebellius is Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO of Siemens Schweiz AG. The  corresponding legal relationship is defined in a separate contract between Matthias Rebellius and Siemens Schweiz AG. The entire compensation he receives under the terms of his contract with Siemens Schweiz AG is deducted from his Managing Board compensation. Of the target amount reported here (based on /one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % target achievement), \u20ac /six.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted,/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted is attributable to Siemens Schweiz AG.\n- 3 As compensation for the loss of benefits granted by her former employer, the Supervisory Board allotted to Judith Wiese one\u00adtime compensation of \u20ac /one.fitted,/four.fitted/six.fitted/nine.fitted,/one.fitted/two.fitted/four.fitted (gross) in  fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted - /five.fitted/zero.fitted % in cash and the remaining /five.fitted/zero.fitted % in the form of Stock Awards from the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted tranche. Accordingly, a further /one.fitted/four.fitted,/nine.fitted/four.fitted/four.fitted Stock Awards from the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted tranche with a fair value of \u20ac /eight.fitted/five.fitted/nine.fitted,/one.fitted/one.fitted/one.fitted were allocated to Judith Wiese in November /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, based on target achievement of /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted %.\n\nConcrete target setting and the degree of target achieve\u00ad ment for the Siemens\u00adinternal ESG / Sustainability index of the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted Stock Awards tranche will be published to\u00ad gether with the degree of target achievement for the TSR in the Compensation Report for fiscal

For this reason, the number of Stock Awards from the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/eight.fitted tranche, as set out in the table, is based on a target achievement of /one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted %. Starting with the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted tranche, settlement of Stock Awards will be entirely by share transfer. For this reason, the number of Stock Awards, as set out in the table, is based on a target achievement of /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted %. At the end of the vesting period, a final number of Siemens shares to be transferred will be determined on the basis of actual target achievement and taking into account the Stock Awards cap.\n- 2 The target achievement of the Stock Awards from the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/seven.fitted tranche, which were due and settled in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, was /eight.fitted/nine.fitted %. As the Stock Awards from the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/seven.fitted tranche were allocated on the basis of /one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % target achievement, a number equivalent to this shortfall was forfeited without refund or replacement, in accordance with plan requirements.\n- 3 In addition to his position as a member of the Managing Board, Cedrik Neike served as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of Siemens Ltd. China from May /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/seven.fitted, to March /three.fitted/one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted. The reported figures include the Stock Awards allocated to Cedrik Neike by Siemens Ltd.

Until pension payments begin, members' pension accounts are credited with an annual interest payment (guaranteed interest) in January of each year. The inter\u00ad est rate is currently /zero.fitted./nine.fitted/zero.fitted %.\n\nInformation on the BSAV\n\n|                                                                                                                          | Contributions  /one.fitted                    | Contributions  /one.fitted                     | Contributions  /one.fitted                    | Service costs   according to IAS /one.fitted/nine.fittedR   | Defined benefit obligation   for all pension commitments   excluding deferred compensation  /two.fitted   | Defined benefit obligation   for all pension commitments   excluding deferred compensation  /two.fitted   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| (Amounts in \u20ac)                                                                                                           | /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted | /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted | /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted | /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted              | /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted                                                             | /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted                                                            |\n| Managing Board members   in office on September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted |                                               |                                                |                                               |                                                             |                                                                                                           |                                                                                                           |\n| Dr. Roland Busch                                                                                                         | 991,200                                       | 616,896                                        | 932,613                                       | 608,225                                                     | 8,538,765                                                                                                 | 6,566,101                                                                                                 |\n| Cedrik Neike                                                                                                             | 616,896                                       | 616,896                                        | 594,468                                       | 621,266                                                     | 4,069,811                                                                                                 | 2,938,080                                                                                                 |\n| Prof. Dr. Ralf P.

Instead of BSAV contribu\u00ad tions, the Supervisory Board awarded them for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted a fixed cash amount of \u20ac /five.fitted/five.fitted/zero.fitted,/eight.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted each for free disposal. This amount will be paid in January /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted.\n\n## B.6  Compensation awarded and due\n\n## B./six.fitted./one.fitted Active Managing Board members in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted\n\nThe following tables show the compensation awarded and due to the active members of the Managing Board in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted and fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted in accordance with Sec\u00ad tion /one.fitted/six.fitted/two.fitted, para. /one.fitted, sent. /one.fitted of the German Stock Corporation Act. As a result, they include all the amounts actually paid to individual Managing Board members in the reporting period ('awarded compensation') and /or all the compen\u00ad sation that is legally due but not yet received ('due com\u00ad pensation').\n\nThe Bonus is reported under 'Short\u00adterm variable com\u00ad pensation' as 'due compensation' since the underlying services were fully rendered by the end of each period (September /three.fitted/zero.fitted). Therefore, the Bonus payout amounts\n\nfor the reporting year are reported, although payout only occurs after the end of each reporting year, in order to make reporting transparent and comprehensible and in order to guarantee a connection between performance and compensation in the reporting period.\n\nFurthermore, in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the Stock Awards from the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/seven.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/six.fitted tranches allocated in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/seven.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/six.fitted, respectively, became due and were settled by transfer of Siemens shares. The value of Siemens shares at the time of transfer is reported under 'Long\u00adterm vari\u00ad able compensation.'\n\nIn connection with the due date and settlement of the Stock Awards for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/seven.fitted, the table also includes the additional cash payment to eligible Managing Board members as a result of the Siemens Energy spin\u00adoff. The spin\u00adoff of Siemens Energy in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted led to ad\u00ad justments in the stock\u00adbased compensation allocations agreed upon until the spin\u00adoff date. At the time when the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/seven.fitted Stock Awards became due, the Managing Board members - like all other eligible employees were, accordingly, entitled to receive an additional cash payment based on the spin\u00adoff ratio of /two.fitted:/one.fitted and on the Siemens Energy share price of \u20ac /two.fitted/two.fitted./two.fitted/zero.fitted on the date when their stock\u00adbased compensation allocations be\u00ad came due.\n\nCompensation awarded and due in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to the amounts of compensation, Section /one.fitted/six.fitted/two.fitted para. /one.fitted sent. /two.fitted No. /one.fitted of the German Stock Corporation Act requires disclosure of the relative proportion of total compensation  represented  by  all  fixed  and  variable compensation components. The relative proportions reported here refer to the compensation components 'awarded' and 'due' in the respective fiscal years in\n\naccordance with Section /one.fitted/six.fitted/two.fitted para. /one.fitted sent. /one.fitted of the German Stock Corporation Act.\n\nAlthough the service costs for Company pension plans are not to be classified as awarded and due compensa\u00ad tion, they are also reported in the following table for pur\u00ad poses of transparency.",

Due to his intra\u00adyear appointment, his Stock Awards target amount for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/seven.fitted was determined on a pro\u00adrated basis and, instead of Stock Awards, a corresponding number of Phantom Stock Awards was allocated to him in accordance with plan requirements. In contrast to Stock Awards, these Phantom Stock Awards were settled after the expiration of the vesting period by cash payment rather than by share transfer.\n- 3 In addition to his position as a member of the Managing Board, Cedrik Neike served as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of Siemens Ltd. China from May /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/seven.fitted, to March /three.fitted/one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted. The amount reported under '/two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/seven.fitted Stock Awards (vesting: /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/six.fitted - /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted)' includes the value of the Stock Awards allocated by Siemens Ltd. China. Likewise, a portion of the additional cash payment attributable to the Stock Awards allocated by Siemens Ltd. China is included under 'Cash payment Siemens Energy spin\u00adoff.' For details, see 'Trans\u00ad fer of Stock Awards in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted (/two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/seven.fitted tranche).'\n- 4 In addition to his position as a member of the Managing Board of Siemens AG, Matthias Rebellius is Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO of Siemens Schweiz AG. The corre\u00ad sponding legal relationship is defined in a separate contract between Matthias Rebellius and Siemens Schweiz AG. The entire compensation he receives under the terms of his contract with Siemens Schweiz AG is deducted from his Managing Board compensation. Of the base salary and fringe benefits reported here, \u20ac /six.fitted/one.fitted/five.fitted,/three.fitted/six.fitted/seven.fitted and \u20ac /two.fitted/nine.fitted,/five.fitted/seven.fitted/nine.fitted, respectively, were awarded and paid by Siemens Schweiz AG. Of the Bonus for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted reported here, \u20ac /eight.fitted/five.fitted/nine.fitted,/eight.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted (corresponding to CHF/nine.fitted/three.fitted/one.fitted,/one.fitted/six.fitted/five.fitted and converted into euros as of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted) will be paid by Siemens Schweiz AG. Furthermore, employer contributions to pension plans paid by Siemens Schweiz AG are deducted from the amount for free disposal.",

Compensation of Supervisory  Board   members\n\nThe rules for Supervisory Board compensation for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted were approved by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on January /two.fitted/eight.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/four.fitted, and have been in effect since fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/four.fitted. They are set out in Section /one.fitted/seven.fitted of the Articles of Association of Siemens AG in the version applicable for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. Supervisory Board compensation consists entirely of fixed compensation; it reflects the responsibil\u00ad ities and scope of the work of the Supervisory Board members. The Chairman and Deputy Chairs of the Super\u00ad visory Board as well as the chairs and members of the Audit Committee, the Chairman's Committee, the Com\u00ad pensation Committee, the Compliance Committee and\n\nthe  Innovation and Finance Committee receive additional compensation. The compensation authorized by the Arti\u00ad cles of Association for work in the Compliance Committee was no longer paid in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted since the Compliance Committee was reintegrated into the Audit Committee and the duties of the Compliance Committee were trans\u00ad ferred to the Audit Committee effective October /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted.\n\nUnder the rules for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, the members of the Super\u00ad visory Board receive an annual base compensation, and the members of the Supervisory Board committees re\u00ad ceive additional compensation for their committee work.\n\nCompensation of members of the Supervisory Board and its committees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCompensation for any work on the Chairman's Commit\u00ad tee is deducted from compensation for work on the Com\u00ad pensation Committee.\n\nIf a Supervisory Board member is absent from any Super\u00ad visory Board meetings, one\u00adthird of the aggregate com\u00ad pensation due to that member is reduced by the percent\u00ad age of Supervisory Board meetings he or she does not attend in relation to the total number of Supervisory Board meetings held during the fiscal year. In the event of changes in the composition of the Supervisory Board or its committees, compensation is paid on a pro\u00adrated basis, rounding up to the next full month.\n\nIn addition, the members of the Supervisory Board re\u00ad ceive \u20ac /one.fitted,/five.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted for each meeting of the Supervisory Board and its committees they attend.\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board are reimbursed for out\u00adof\u00adpocket expenses incurred in connection with their duties and for any value\u00adadded tax to be paid on their compensation. For the performance of his duties, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board is also entitled to an office with secretarial support and the use of a car service. No loans or advances from the Company are pro\u00ad vided to members of the Supervisory Board.",

Comparative information on profit  development and annual change in compensation\n\nThe following table shows, in accordance with Sec\u00ad tion /one.fitted/six.fitted/two.fitted para. /one.fitted sent. /two.fitted No. /two.fitted of the German Stock Corpo\u00ad ration Act, Siemens' profit development, the annual change in the Managing Board and Supervisory Board members' compensation and the annual change in aver\u00ad age employee compensation on a full\u00adtime equivalent basis over the last five fiscal years.\n\nProfit development is presented on the basis of the Siemens Group's key performance indicators revenue, comparable revenue growth and earnings per share. The latter is also one of the financial targets for the short\u00ad term variable compensation (Bonus) of the Managing Board and thus has a significant influence on the amount of the compensation of the Managing Board members. In accordance with Section /two.fitted/seven.fitted/five.fitted para. /three.fitted  No. /one.fitted/six.fitted of the German Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch , HGB), the devel\u00ad opment of the net income of Siemens AG is also shown.\n\nThe compensation awarded and due to the Managing Board and Supervisory Board members in each fiscal year is presented in accordance with Section /one.fitted/six.fitted/two.fitted para. /one.fitted sent. /one.fitted of the German Stock Corporation Act.\n\nThe presentation of average employee compensation is based on the size of the workforce, including trainees, employed by Siemens in Germany. In fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, this workforce comprised on average /seven.fitted/one.fitted,/eight.fitted/three.fitted/eight.fitted employees (full\u00adtime  equivalent).  By  way  of  comparison,  the Siemens Group had about /two.fitted/four.fitted/one.fitted,/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted employees and train\u00ad ees worldwide as of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. The figures exclude the workforce of Siemens Healthineers, which is not included in the presentation since it is a separately managed, publicly listed company.\n\nAverage employee compensation comprises the person\u00ad nel costs for wages and salaries, fringe benefits, employer contributions to social insurance and any short\u00adterm variable compensation components attributable to the fiscal year. For compensation in connection with share plans, the amounts received in the fiscal year are taken into account. Therefore, employee compensation is also equivalent, in principle, to awarded and due compensa\u00ad tion within the meaning of Section /one.fitted/six.fitted/two.fitted para. /one.fitted sent. /one.fitted of the German Stock Corporation Act and thus in line with Managing Board and Supervisory Board compensation.",

We have not audited the content of disclosures regarding appropriateness and marketability of the compensation in chapter B./two.fitted./three.fitted APPROPRIATENESS OF THE COMPENSATION that is beyond the scope of Sec. /one.fitted/six.fitted/two.fitted AktG.\n\n## Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board\n\nManagement and the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG are responsible for the preparation of the Compensation Report and the related disclosures in compliance with the requirements of Sec. /one.fitted/six.fitted/two.fitted AktG. In addition, management and the Supervisory Board are responsible for such inter\u00ad nal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of a Compensation Report and the related disclosures that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Auditor's responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on this Com\u00ad pensation Report and the related disclosures based on our audit. We conducted our audit in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial State\u00ad ment Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschafts\u00ad pr\u00fcfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Those standards require that we comply with ethical re\u00ad quirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Compensation Report and the related disclosures are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing audit procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts in the Compensation Report and the related disclosures. The audit procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Compensation Report and the related disclosures, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk as\u00ad sessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the preparation of the Compensation Report and the related disclosures in order to plan and perform audit procedures that are appropriate under the given circum\u00ad stances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the Supervisory Board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Com\u00ad pensation Report and the related disclosures.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is suffi\u00ad cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, the Compensation Report for the fiscal year from October /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted to September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted and the re\u00ad lated disclosures comply, in all material respects, with the financial reporting provisions of Sec. /one.fitted/six.fitted/two.fitted AktG. Our opin\u00ad ion on the Compensation Report does not cover the con\u00ad tent of the abovementioned disclosures in the Compen\u00ad sation Report that is beyond the scope of Sec. /one.fitted/six.fitted/two.fitted AktG.\n\n## Other matter - formal audit of the Compensation Report\n\nThe audit of the content of the Compensation Report de\u00ad scribed in this auditor 's report comprises the formal audit of the Compensation Report required by Sec. /one.fitted/six.fitted/two.fitted (/three.fitted) AktG and the issue of a report on this audit. As we are issuing an unqualified opinion on the audit of the content of the Compensation Report, this also includes the opinion that the disclosures pursuant to Sec. /one.fitted/six.fitted/two.fitted (/one.fitted) and (/two.fitted) AktG are made in the Compensation Report in all material respects.",

        "page_content": "## Report of the Supervisory Board\n\nBerlin and Munich, December /two.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted\n\n## Dear Shareholders,\n\nFiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted was Siemens AG's first year as a newly positioned, focused technology company. It was also the first  year  for  the  Company's  new  Managing  Board team.  Together with his Managing Board colleagues, Dr.  Roland Busch pursued clear strategic objectives and positioned Siemens' operations for faster growth. As planned, Dr. Busch succeeded Joe Kaeser as President and CEO at the conclusion of the ordinary Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February /three.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted.\n\nThis move - intensively promoted by the Supervisory Board - successfully concluded Siemens' strategic, structural  and  personnel  realignment,  which  provided  a strong foundation for the outstanding achievements of the Company's roughly /three.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted,/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted employees in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. Despite the uncertainties due to the ongoing COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted pandemic, Siemens AG seized the opportunities provided by the economic recovery and the accelerated drive toward digitalization and sustainability that is transforming its key markets. The broad-based growth and high profitability achieved by the Company's businesses are impressive and speak for themselves. Siemens proved that sustainable technologies designed to benefit society are already a model for success.\n\nIn close dialogue with the Supervisory Board, the new management team also succeeded in further accelerating business and technological innovation. The extensive introduction of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)  offerings by Siemens' industry software business is an excellent example of this success. In addition, the Companywide DEGREE program intensified the focus of all Siemens businesses on ambitious sustainability targets - targets for environmental and social sustainability and good governance even further.\n\nIn fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, the Supervisory Board performed in full the duties assigned to it by law, the Siemens Articles of Association and the Bylaws for the Supervisory Board. On the\n\nbasis of detailed written and oral reports provided by the Managing Board, we monitored the Managing Board and advised it on the management of the Company. In my capacity as Chairman of the Supervisory Board, I regularly exchanged information with the President and CEO and the other Managing Board members. As a result, the Supervisory Board was always kept up to date on projected business policies, Company planning -  including financial, investment and personnel planning - and the Company's profitability and business operations as well as on the state of Siemens AG and the Siemens Group. We were directly involved at an early stage in all decisions of fundamental importance to the Company and discussed these decisions with the Managing Board intensively and in detail. To the extent that Supervisory Board approval of the decisions and measures of Company management was required by law, the Siemens Articles of Association or our Bylaws, the members of the Supervisory Board - prepared in some cases by the Supervisory Board's committees - issued such approval after intensive review and discussion. The relevant Managing Board members informed us - within the limits of the applicable legal framework - about critically important measures and decisions at the Company's equity investments.\n\nA special focus of our activities in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted was the Company's further strategic development after the successful spin-off and subsequent public listing of Siemens Energy. At our meetings and in additional informational sessions, we concerned ourselves intensively with the goals and priorities of Siemens' businesses and with the Managing Board's technology and personnel strategy. In this connection, we focused our attention on innovation, digitalization and the related opportunities for growth. Together with the Managing Board, we discussed the markets, trends and growth fields. The sustainability strategy of Siemens AG was another focus of our work in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted.",

In addition, we concerned ourselves, as occasion required, with acquisition and divestment projects and with risks to the Company. We received regular reports from the Managing Board regarding the impact on Siemens of the COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted pandemic. In addition, we met regularly in closed sessions without the Managing Board in attendance. In these sessions, we dealt with agenda items that concerned either the Managing Board itself or internal Supervisory Board matters.\n\nAt  an  extraordinary  meeting  on  October /two.fitted/nine.fitted,  /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, we   approved  the  Managing  Board's  decision  to  sell Flender GmbH, a producer of mechanical and electrical drive systems, to The Carlyle Group, U.

On a recommendation by the Compensation Committee, we also defined the Managing Board members' compensation for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted on the basis of calculated target achievement. An internal review confirmed the appropriateness of this compensation. We had already defined the performance criteria for the Managing Board's variable compensation for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted at our meeting on September /two.fitted/two.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. On this basis and on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, we made a decision on target setting for Managing Board compensation for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted at our meeting on November /one.fitted/one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. At this meeting, we also approved a Managing Board decision on financing measures.\n\nOn December /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, we discussed the financial statements  and  the  Combined  Management  Report  for Siemens AG and the Siemens Group as of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the Annual Report for /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted - including the Report of the Supervisory Board, corporate governance reporting\n\nand the Compensation Report - and the agenda for the ordinary Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February /three.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. On the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, we also made a further decision regarding the target setting for Managing Board compensation for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. In addition, we concerned ourselves with the annual reporting of the Chief Compliance Officer and the Cybersecurity Officer.\n\nAt our meeting on February /two.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, the Managing Board reported on the Company's current business and financial position following the conclusion of the first quarter.\n\nThe regular terms of office of three shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board, who had been reelected early to five-year terms of office by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on January /two.fitted/six.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/six.fitted, ended at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February /three.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. Three shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board were elected for new, four-year terms of office - that is, for the electoral period /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted to /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/five.fitted - by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February /three.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. The constituent meeting of the Supervisory Board took place immediately after the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February /three.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. At this Supervisory Board meeting, Jim Hagemann Snabe was  reelected  Chairman  of  the  Supervisory  Board.

The Audit Committee discussed the dividend proposal in detail at its meeting on November /nine.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. It discussed the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG, the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Siemens Group and the Combined Management Report in detail at its meeting on December /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. In this context, the Audit Committee concerned itself, in particular, with the key audit matters described in the independent auditors' respective opinions, including the audit procedures implemented. The Audit Committee's review also covered the non-financial information for Siemens AG and the Siemens Group that is included in the Combined Management Report. The audit reports prepared by the independent auditors were distributed to all members of the Supervisory Board and comprehensively reviewed at the Supervisory Board meeting on December /two.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, in the presence of the independent auditors, who reported on the scope, focal points and main findings of their audit, addressing, in particular, key audit matters and the audit procedures implemented. No major weaknesses in the Company's internal control or risk management systems were reported. At this meeting, the Managing Board explained the financial statements of Siemens AG and the Siemens Group as well as the Company's risk management system.\n\nThe Supervisory Board concurs with the results of the audit. Following the definitive findings of the Audit Committee's examination and our own examination, we have no objections. The Managing Board prepared the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG and the Consolidated  Financial  Statements  of  the  Siemens  Group. We approved the Annual Financial Statements and the Consolidated Financial Statements. In view of our approval, the financial statements are accepted as submitted. We endorsed the Managing Board's proposal that the net income available for distribution be used to pay out a dividend of \u20ac /four.fitted./zero.fitted/zero.fitted per share entitled to a dividend and that the amount of net income attributable to shares of stock not entitled to receive a dividend for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted be carried forward.\n\n## Changes in the composition of the Supervisory and Managing Boards\n\nMatthias Rebellius and Judith Wiese have been full members  of  the  Managing  Board  since  October /one.fitted,  /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted.

Klaus  Helmrich  left  the  Managing  Board  effective March /three.fitted/one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. Joe Kaeser worked for Siemens for more than /four.fitted/zero.fitted years. For seven years, he headed the Company as President and CEO. Klaus Helmrich retired at the expiration of his term of office after nine years on the Managing Board and /three.fitted/five.fitted years at the Company. The Supervisory Board would like to thank both Mr. Kaeser and Mr. Helmrich for their many years of successful work on behalf of Siemens and their extraordinary services to the Company. We would especially like to thank Joe Kaeser, who shaped the Company as few others have done and left behind a strong foundation for future generations.\n\nRobert Kensbock left the Supervisory Board on September /two.fitted/five.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the effective date of the spin-off of Siemens Energy. In a decision of October /one.fitted/six.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the Charlottenburg District Court appointed Tobias B\u00e4umler to succeed Mr. Kensbock as an employee representative on the Supervisory Board for the remainder of Mr. Kensbock's term of office.\n\nDr. Nicola Leibinger-Kamm\u00fcller and Werner Wenning left the Supervisory Board at the end of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February /three.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, when their terms of office as shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board expired. We thanked Dr. Nicola LeibingerKamm\u00fcller and Werner Wenning for their many years of trust-based cooperation and for their professional commitment and contribution to the Company's success. We are especially grateful to Mr. Wenning, who, as Second Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board and Chairman of the Compensation Committee, decisively shaped the Supervisory Board's work over a period of many years.\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting reelected Jim  Hagemann Snabe, whose regular term of office also expired at the end of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February /three.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, to a four-year term of office as shareholder representative on the Supervisory Board,",

The convening of a share\u00ad holders' meeting - even taking into account the short\u00ad ened time limits stipulated in the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act ( Wertpapiererwerbs\u00ad und \u00dcbernahmegesetz, Wp\u00dcG) - is an organizational chal\u00ad lenge for large publicly listed companies. It appears doubtful whether the associated effort is justified also in cases where no relevant decisions by the sharehold\u00ad ers' meeting are intended. Therefore, extraordinary shareholders' meetings shall be convened only in appro\u00ad priate cases.\n\nAccording to the suggestion in D./eight.fitted sent. /two.fitted, participation by telephone or video conference in the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees should not be the rule. At Siemens AG, participation in meetings is, as a rule, in person. Participation by telephone takes place only in exceptional cases. Due to the special circumstances",

The Managing Board has established an appropriate and effective internal control system and risk management system. It also ensures that the Company adheres to stat\u00ad utory requirements, official regulations and internal Company policies and works to achieve compliance with these provisions and policies within the Siemens Group. The Managing Board has established a comprehensive compliance management system. Protection is offered to employees and third parties who provide informa\u00ad tion on unlawful behavior within the Company. Details on the compliance management system are available on the Siemens Global Website at WWW.SIEMENS.COM/ SUSTAINABILITYINFORMATION .\n\nThe Supervisory Board has issued Bylaws for the Manag\u00ad ing Board that contain the assignment of different port\u00ad folios and the rules for cooperation both within the Man\u00ad aging Board and between the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board as well as rules for the so\u00adcalled Equity Investments. In accordance with these Bylaws, the Man\u00ad aging Board is divided into the portfolio of the President and CEO and a variety of Managing Board portfolios. The Managing Board members responsible for the individual Managing Board portfolios are defined in a business as\u00ad signment plan that is determined by the Supervisory Board. As the Managing Board member with responsibility for the People & Organization portfolio, the Labor Director ( Arbeitsdirektor ) is appointed in accordance with the re\u00ad quirements of Section /three.fitted/three.fitted of the German Codetermina\u00ad tion Act ( Mitbestimmungsgesetz, MitbestG). While the first\u00adtime appointment of Managing Board members is not, as a rule, to exceed a period of three years, an assess\u00ad ment is to be made in each individual case in order to determine what period of appointment is deemed appro\u00ad priate within the legally permissible period. This matter is explained in greater detail in Section /one.fitted of this Corporate Governance Statement.\n\nAs a rule, the portfolio assigned to an individual member is that member's own responsibility. Activities and trans\u00ad actions in a particular Managing Board portfolio that are considered to be extraordinarily important for the Com\u00ad pany or associated with an extraordinary economic risk require the prior consent of the full Managing Board. The same applies to activities and transactions for which the President and CEO or another member of the Managing\n\nBoard demands a prior decision by the Managing Board. The President and CEO is responsible for the coordina\u00ad tion of all Managing Board portfolios.

The Managing Board informs the Supervisory Board regularly, compre\u00ad hensively and without delay on all issues of importance to the entire Company with regard to strategy, planning, business development, financial position, results of oper\u00ad ations, compliance and entrepreneurial risks. At regular intervals, the Managing Board also discusses the status of strategy implementation with the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe members of the Managing Board are subject to a com\u00ad prehensive prohibition on competitive activity for the pe\u00ad riod of their employment at Siemens AG. They are commit\u00ad ted to serving the interest of the Company. When making their decisions, they may not be guided by personal inter\u00ad ests, nor may they exploit for their own advantage busi\u00ad ness opportunities offered to the Company. Managing Board members may engage in secondary activities - in particular, supervisory board positions outside the Siemens Group - only with the approval of the Chairman's Commit\u00ad tee of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board is re\u00ad sponsible for decisions regarding any adjustments to Man\u00ad aging Board compensation that are necessary in order to take account of compensation for secondary activities. Every Managing Board member is under an obligation to disclose conflicts of interest without delay to the Chairman or Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board and to inform the other members of the Managing Board thereof.\n\n## EQUITY AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE MANAGING BOARD\n\nIn fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, the Managing Board had one committee, the Equity and Compensation Committee.

It ap\u00ad proves the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG as well as the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Siemens Group, based on the results of the preliminary\n\nreview conducted by the Audit Committee and taking into account the reports of the independent auditors. The Supervisory Board approves the Managing Board's proposal for the appropriation of net income and the Re\u00ad port of the Supervisory Board to the Annual Sharehold\u00ad ers' Meeting. The Supervisory Board is jointly responsible with the Managing Board for the preparation of the Com\u00ad pensation Report. In addition, the Company's adherence to statutory provisions, official regulations and internal Company policies (compliance) are monitored by the Supervisory Board and /or the Audit Committee. The Super\u00ad visory Board also appoints the members of the Managing Board and determines each member's portfolios. The Supervisory Board approves - on the basis of a proposal by the Compensation Committee - the compensation system for Managing Board members and defines their concrete compensation in accordance with this system. It sets the individual targets for the variable compensa\u00ad tion and the total compensation of each individual Man\u00ad aging Board member, reviews the appropriateness of to\u00ad tal compensation and regularly reviews the Managing Board compensation system.

The Supervisory Board also meets regularly without the Managing Board in attendance. Every Supervisory Board member must disclose conflicts of interest to the Supervisory Board. Information regarding conflicts of in\u00ad terest that may have arisen and their handling is provided in the Report of the Supervisory Board. Special informa\u00ad tional (onboarding) events are held in order to familiarize new Supervisory Board members with the Company's business model and the structures of the Siemens Group.

Diversity concept for the Managing Board and long\u00adterm succession planning\n\nIn September /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/eight.fitted, the Supervisory Board approved the following diversity concept for the composition of the Managing Board:\n\n' The goal is to achieve a composition that is as diverse as possible and comprises individuals who comple\u00ad ment one another in a Managing Board that provides strong leadership as well as to ensure that, as a group, the members of the Managing Board have all the knowhow and skills that are considered essential in view of Siemens' activities.\n\nWhen selecting members of the Managing Board, the Supervisory Board pays close attention to candidates' personal suitability, integrity, convincing leadership qualities, international experience, expertise in their prospective areas of responsibility, achievements to date and knowledge of the Company as well as their ability to adjust business models and processes in a changing world. Diversity with respect to such charac\u00ad teristics as age and gender as well as professional and educational background is an important selection cri\u00ad terion for appointments to Managing Board positions. When selecting members of the Managing Board, the Supervisory Board also gives special consideration to the following factors:\n\n- In addition to the expertise and management and leadership experience required for their specific tasks, the Managing Board members shall have the broadest possible range of knowledge and experi\u00ad ence and the widest possible educational and pro\u00ad fessional backgrounds.",

The Supervisory Board has established as a target that - until June /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted - /two.fitted/five.fitted % of the Managing Board positions are to be held by women.\n- It is considered helpful if different age groups are represented on the Managing Board. In accordance with the recommendation of the Code, the Super\u00ad visory Board has defined an age limit for the mem\u00ad bers of the Managing Board. In keeping with this limit, the members of the Managing Board are, as a rule, to be not older than /six.fitted/three.fitted years of age.\n\nWhen making an appointment to a specific Manag\u00ad ing Board position, the decisive factor is always the Company's best interest, taking into consideration all circumstances in the individual case.'\n\n## Implementation of the diversity concept for the Managing Board in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted\n\nThe diversity concept for the Managing Board is imple\u00ad mented as part of the process for making appointments to the Managing Board. When selecting candidates and / or making proposals for the appointment of Managing Board members, the Supervisory Board and /or the Chair\u00ad man's Committee of the Supervisory Board take into ac\u00ad count the requirements defined in the diversity concept for the Managing Board.\n\nIn its current composition, the Managing Board fulfills all the requirements of the diversity concept. The Managing Board members have a broad range of knowledge, expe\u00ad rience and educational and professional backgrounds as well as international experience. The Managing Board has all the knowledge and experience that is considered es\u00ad sential in view of Siemens' activities. As a group, the Man\u00ad aging Board has experience in the business areas that are important for Siemens - in particular, in the  industry, en\u00ad ergy, healthcare and infrastructure sectors - as well as many years of experience in technology (including infor\u00ad mation technology and digitalization), research and devel\u00ad opment, procurement, manufacturing and sales, finance, law (including compliance) and human resources.\n\nIn the summer of /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the Supervisory Board appointed Judith Wiese and Matthias Rebellius to the Managing Board as of October /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, taking into account the diver\u00ad sity concept and the Company's best interest. In the course of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, Joe Kaeser and Klaus Helmrich left the Managing Board at the completion of their regular terms of office. The target for June /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, continues to apply. The appropriate consideration of women is a key component of long\u00adterm succession planning for the Managing Board. Different age groups are represented on the Managing Board. No Managing Board member is currently older than /six.fitted/three.fitted years of age.\n\n## Long-term succession planning for the Managing Board\n\nJointly with the Managing Board and with the support of the Chairman's Committee, the Supervisory Board conducts long\u00adterm succession planning for the Managing Board. In its long\u00adterm succession planning, the Supervisory Board takes into account the target it has defined for the propor\u00ad tion of women on the Managing Board and the criteria set out in the diversity concept it has approved for the Manag\u00ad ing Board's composition as well as the requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act, the Code and the Bylaws for the Chairman's Committee. Considering the concrete qual\u00ad ification requirements and the above\u00admentioned criteria, the Chairman's Committee prepares an ideal profile, on the basis of which it compiles a shortlist of the available candi\u00ad dates. Structured interviews are then conducted with these candidates. After the interviews, a proposal is submitted to the Super visory Board for approval. When developing the profile of requirements and selecting candidates, the Super\u00ad visory Board and the Chairman's Committee are supported, if necessary, by external consultants.",

Objectives regarding the Supervisory Board's composition as well as the profile of required skills and expertise and the diversity concept for the Super\u00ad visory Board\n\nIn September /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, the Supervisory Board approved changes to the objectives for its composition including the profile of required skills and expertise and the diver\u00ad sity concept:\n\n' The  composition  of  the  Supervisory  Board  of Siemens AG shall be such that the Supervisory Board's ability to effectively monitor and advise the Managing Board is ensured. In this connection, mutually comple\u00ad mentary collaboration among members with a wide range of personal and professional backgrounds and diversity with regard to internationality, age and gen\u00ad der are considered helpful.\n\n## Profile of required skills and expertise\n\nThe candidates proposed for election to the Super\u00ad visory Board shall have the knowledge, skills and ex\u00ad perience necessary to carry out the functions of a Super visory Board member in a multinational com\u00ad pany oriented toward the capital markets and to safe\u00ad guard the reputation of Siemens in public. In particu\u00ad lar, care shall be taken with regard to the personality, integrity, commitment and professionalism of the in\u00ad dividuals proposed for election.\n\nThe goal is to ensure that, in the Supervisory Board, as a group, all the knowhow and experience is available that is considered essential in view of Siemens' activi\u00ad ties. This includes, for instance, knowledge and expe\u00ad rience in the areas of technology (including informa\u00ad tion technology and digitalization), procurement, manufacturing  and  sales,  finance,  law  (including compliance) and human resources. In addition, the members of the Supervisory Board shall collectively have knowledge and experience in the business areas that are important for Siemens, in particular, in the areas of industry, energy, healthcare and infrastruc\u00ad ture. As a group, the members of the Supervisory Board are to be familiar with the sector in which the Company operates. In accordance with the German Stock Corporation Act, at least one member of the\n\nSupervisory Board must have knowledge and exper\u00ad tise in the area of accounting, and at least one addi\u00ad tional member of the Supervisory Board must have knowledge and expertise in the area of financial state\u00ad ments. These two Supervisory Board members shall be independent. At least one member of the Super\u00ad visory Board shall have specific knowledge and expe\u00ad rience in applying accounting principles and internal control processes. This member shall, in addition, be familiar with the auditing of financial statements and independent. In particular, the Supervisory Board shall also include members who have leadership expe\u00ad rience as senior executives or members of a super\u00ad visory board (or comparable body) at a major com\u00ad pany with international operations.\n\nWhen a new member is to be appointed, a review shall be performed to determine which of the areas of ex\u00ad pertise deemed desirable for the Supervisory Board are to be strengthened.\n\n## Internationality\n\nTaking the Company's international orientation into account, care shall be taken to ensure that the Super\u00ad visory Board has an adequate number of members with extensive international experience. The goal is to make sure that the present considerable share of Su\u00ad pervisory Board members with extensive international experience is maintained.\n\n## Diversity\n\nWith regard to the composition of the Supervisory Board, attention shall be paid to achieving sufficient diversity. Not only is appropriate consideration to be given to women. Diversity of cultural heritage and a wide range of educational and professional back\u00ad grounds, experiences and ways of thinking are also to be promoted. When considering possible candidates for new elections or for filling Supervisory Board posi\u00ad tions that have become vacant, the Supervisory Board shall give appropriate consideration to diversity at an early stage in the selection process.\n\nIn accordance with the German Stock Corporation Act, the Supervisory Board is composed of at least /three.fitted/zero.fitted % women and at least /three.fitted/zero.fitted % men. The Nominating Committee shall continue to include at least one fe\u00ad male member.",

More than half of the shareholder representatives shall be independent of the Company and its Managing Board. Substantial and not merely temporary - conflicts of interest are to be avoided.\n\nNo more than two former members of the Managing Board of Siemens AG shall belong to the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board members shall have sufficient time to exercise their mandates with the necessary regularity and diligence.\n\n## Limits on age and on length of membership\n\nIn compliance with the age limit stipulated by the Super visory Board in its Bylaws, only individuals who are no older than /seven.fitted/zero.fitted years of age shall, as a rule, be nominated for election to the Supervisory Board. Nominations shall take into account the regular limit established by the Supervisory Board, which restricts membership on the Supervisory Board to a maximum of three full terms of office.

The Super\u00ad visory Board and the Nominating Committee have re\u00ad cently taken the objectives - including the profile of re\u00ad quired skills and expertise and the diversity concept - into consideration in the nominations of three shareholder representatives to be elected by the Annual Shareholders'\n\nMeeting in /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. As an additional criterion, the Super\u00ad visory Board takes into account expertise in the area of sustainability.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is of the opinion that, with its cur\u00ad rent composition, it meets the objectives for its composi\u00ad tion and fulfills the profile of required skills and expertise as well as the diversity concept. The Supervisory Board members have the specialist and personal qualifications considered necessary. As a group, they are familiar with the sector in which the Company operates and have the knowledge, skills and experience essential for Siemens. A considerable number of Supervisory Board members are engaged in international activities and /or have many years of international experience. Appropriate consider\u00ad ation has been given to diversity in the Supervisory Board. In fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, the Supervisory Board had seven female members, of whom three are shareholder representatives and four are employee representatives. As a result, /three.fitted/five.fitted % of the Supervisory Board members are women. Dr. Nathalie von Siemens is a member of the Nominating Committee.\n\nIn the estimation of the shareholder representatives, the Supervisory Board now has at least nine independent shareholder representatives - namely, Dr. Werner Brandt, Beno\u00eet  Potier,  Dr.\u00adIng. Dr.\u00adIng. E. h.  Norbert  Reithofer, Kasper R\u00f8rsted, Baroness Nemat Shafik, Dr. Nathalie von Siemens, Jim Hagemann Snabe, Grazia Vittadini and Matthias Zachert - and thus an appropriate number of members who are independent in the meaning of the Code. The regulations establishing limits on age and re\u00ad stricting membership in the Supervisory Board to three full terms of office are complied with.\n\n## 8.  Share transactions by members of the Managing and Supervisory Boards\n\nPursuant to Article /one.fitted/nine.fitted of EU Regulation No. /five.fitted/nine.fitted/six.fitted / /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/four.fitted of the European Parliament and Council of April /one.fitted/six.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/four.fitted, on market abuse (Market Abuse Regulation), members of the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board are legally required to disclose all transactions conducted on their own account relating to the shares or debt instru\u00ad ments of Siemens AG or to the derivatives or financial instruments linked thereto if the total value of such transactions entered into by a board member or any closely associated person in any calendar year reaches or",

Annual Shareholders' Meeting and investor relations\n\nShareholders exercise their rights at the Annual Share\u00ad holders'  Meeting.  An  ordinary  Annual  Shareholders' Meeting normally takes place within the first five months of each fiscal year. The Annual Shareholders' Meeting de\u00ad cides, among other things, on the appropriation of net income, the ratification of the acts of the members of the Managing and Supervisory Boards, and the appointment of the independent auditors. Amendments to the Articles of Association and measures that change the Company's capital stock are approved at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and implemented by the Managing Board. The Managing Board facilitates shareholder participation in this meeting through electronic communications - in particular, via the Internet - and enables shareholders who are unable to attend the meeting to vote by proxy. Proxies can also be reached during the Annual Sharehold\u00ad ers' Meeting. Furthermore, shareholders may exercise their right to vote in writing or by means of electronic communications (absentee voting). The Managing Board may enable shareholders to participate in the Annual Shareholders' Meeting without the need to be present at the venue and without a proxy and to exercise some or all of their rights fully or partially by means of electronic communications. The Company enables shareholders to follow the entire Annual Shareholders' Meeting via the Internet. Shareholders may submit motions regarding the proposals of the Managing and Supervisory Boards and may contest decisions of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.

        "page_content": "This document contains statements related to our future business and financial performance and future events or developments involving Siemens that may constitute forward-looking statements. These statements may be identified by words such as 'expect,' 'look forward to,' 'anticipate,' 'intend,' 'plan,' 'believe,' 'seek,' 'estimate,' 'will,' 'project' or words of similar meaning. We may also make forwardlooking statements in other reports, in prospectuses, in presentations, in material delivered to shareholders and in press releases. In addition, our representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on the current expectations and certain assumptions of Siemens' management, of which many are beyond Siemens' control. These are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and factors, including, but not limited to, those described in disclosures, in particular in the chapter Report on expected developments and associated material opportunities and risks in the Annual Report. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, events of force majeure, such as pandemics, occur or should underlying expectations including future events occur at a later date or not at all or assumptions prove incorrect, actual results, performance or achievements of Siemens may (negatively or  positively)  vary  materially  from  those  described  explicitly  or  implicitly  in  the  relevant  forward-looking  statement.  Siemens  neither intends, nor assumes any obligation, to update or revise these forward-looking statements in light of developments which differ from those anticipated.\n\nThis document includes - in the applicable financial reporting framework not clearly defined - supplemental financial measures that are or may be alternative performance measures (non-GAAP-measures). These supplemental financial measures should not be viewed in isolation or as alternatives to measures of Siemens' net assets and financial positions or results of operations as presented in accordance with  the  applicable  financial  reporting  framework  in  its  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Other  companies  that  report  or  describe similarly titled alternative performance measures may calculate them differently.\n\nDue  to  rounding,  numbers  presented  throughout  this  and  other  documents  may  not  add  up  precisely  to  the  totals  provided  and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.\n\nThis document is an English language translation of the German document. In case of discrepancies, the German language document is the sole authoritative and universally valid version.\n\nFor technical reasons, there may be differences between the accounting records appearing in this document and those published pursuant to legal requirements.\n\nThe Sustainability Report 2021 which reports on Sustainability and Citizenship at Siemens is available at: siemens.com/investor/en/",
