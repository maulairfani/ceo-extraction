        "page_content": "MESSAGE TO OUR SHAREOWNERS*\n\nDEAR SHAREOWNERS,\n\n2021 was a pivotal year for PPL. We took bold steps to transform our company for long-term growth and success, to address challenges that have impacted PPL from a shareowner return perspective and to improve total shareowner return while building on our core strengths. At the same time, we leaned forward on our clean energy strategy, committed to a net-zero future, and delivered outstanding results for our customers and communities. The end result is a new, U.S.-focused PPL - stronger, more agile and better positioned to drive sustainable value for all stakeholders.\n\nThis year's letter highlights our 2021 transition and the progress we've made as we focus on creating the utilities of the future today - customer-first, people-driven and technology-enabled to drive an a/f.ffordable, reliable clean energy transition.\n\n## REPOSITIONING PPL FOR FUTURE SUCCESS.\n\nOver the past year, we took significant steps to strategically reposition PPL for future success. Our goals at the outset of our strategic pivot were clear:\n\n- \u00b7 Simplify our business mix.\n- \u00b7 Narrow our focus to high-performing, U.S. rate-regulated utilities.\n- \u00b7 Strengthen our balance sheet.\n- \u00b7 Enhance long-term earnings growth and predictability.\n- \u00b7 Improve long-term value for our customers and shareowners.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, we announced agreements in March 2021 to sell our U.K. utility business, Western Power Distribution (WPD), to National Grid plc for \u00a37.8 billion and, in a separate transaction, to acquire National Grid's Rhode Island utility business, The Narragansett Electric Company (Narragansett Electric), for $3.8 billion. We closed on the WPD sale in June, achieving exceptional value of nearly $11 billion. In addition, we've received all of the necessary regulatory approvals to acquire Narragansett Electric and are now working diligently through state appeals processes. We will close as soon as circumstances permit. Throughout 2021, we also took steps to strategically allocate the\n\nWPD sale proceeds to support PPL's future growth prospects and long-term shareowner value. This included reducing PPL's outstanding debt by $3.5 billion; identifying over $1 billion of additional capital investments in our U.S. utilities; and returning $1.4 billion to shareowners via share repurchases and additional dividends. The result of our strategic repositioning will be a new PPL that\n\nis built for the future, with a plan that delivers competitive long-term earnings per share and dividend growth, significant investment opportunities to drive a clean energy future, and a balance sheet capable of fueling growth for the foreseeable future with no equity needs. In summary, we're setting up PPL to deliver premier growth while continuing to provide highly reliable service, award-winning customer satisfaction and industry-leading grid innovation. *Letter dated as of April 4, 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVincent Sorgi President and Chief Executive O/f.fficer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCraig A. Rogerson Independent Chair of the Board\n\n## DELIVERING ESSENTIAL ENERGY AND EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE.\n\nAt PPL, we view operational excellence as a competitive advantage, and a key pillar of our corporate strategy is to achieve industry-leading performance in safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and operational e/f.fficiency.\n\nAs we advanced this strategic objective in 2021, we delivered strong results. We maintained transmission and distribution reliability, as well as generation availability, that was among the best in the industry despite some of the worst storm seasons experienced in our service territories. We responded quickly and e/f.ffectively to that severe weather, including devastating tornadoes in Kentucky and the remnants of Hurricane Ida in Pennsylvania.\n\nWe maintained a/f.ffordable energy rates below regional averages, improved safety performance enterprise-wide, and executed more than $2 billion in infrastructure improvements in our U.S. operations to build smarter, more dynamic and more resilient energy networks. In the process, we again achieved award-winning customer satisfaction. Both PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities ranked highest in their respective regions and segments for residential and business customer satisfaction. Both were named most-trusted utility brands by Escalent following an independent survey of customers at the nation's 140 largest utilities. Moving forward, we have no intention of resting on our laurels.\n\nOur goal, as always, is to deploy advanced technologies to drive continuous improvement in system resiliency, reliability and e/f.fficiency. COMMITTING TO NET-ZERO AND\n\n## DRIVING A RESPONSIBLE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION. A key component of repositioning PPL for the future is moving\n\nforward on our broad-based clean energy strategy, which centers on decarbonizing our generation, positioning the grid as an enabler of clean energy resources, driving digital innovation, investing in research and development to enable new clean energy technologies, and decarbonizing our non-generation operations.\n\nPPL CORPORATION 2021 ANNUAL REPORT          I",

        "page_content": "- In pursuit of this strategy in 2021, we:\n- \u00b7 Set a new goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. \u00b7 Accelerated our interim emissions reduction targets to 70%\n- by 2035 and 80% by 2040. \u00b7 Announced more than $50 million in new investments to drive\n- clean energy research and development. \u00b7 Launched a partnership to study carbon capture at natural gas\n- combined-cycle power plants. \u00b7 Reached agreements to provide an additional 125 MW of solar power to Kentucky customers.\n- \u00b7 Joined a national coalition to support greater adoption of electric vehicles.\n- \u00b7 Linked executive compensation to climate-related goals.\n\nBeyond these e/f.fforts, we published our latest climate assessment report in November. The report highlighted the risks and opportunities associated with climate change; evaluated potential future emissions under multiple scenarios, including one consistent with the U.S. commitments to the Paris Agreement; and outlined our strategy to enable a responsible clean energy transition. In October, we also completed our triennial Kentucky Integrated Resource Plan, which projected a significant increase in renewable energy additions in the 15-year planning horizon compared to our prior plan.\n\nAs we work toward our clean energy goals, we're proud of the progress we've made - reducing our emissions nearly 60% since 2010 - and we're pleased with the momentum we generated in 2021. However, we recognize it will take continued dedication, ideas and innovation to reach our net-zero goals, and that's our focus.\n\nWe continue to economically transition our Kentucky coal-fired generation and are committing not to burn unabated coal by 2050. We're transitioning the Kentucky /f.lleet to cleaner energy sources, with expected retirements of at least 2,000 MW of coal-fired power plants by 2035, including at least 1,000 MW by 2028. We are reviewing our generation plans for opportunities to further advance /f.lleet decarbonization while maintaining reliability and a/f.ffordability. In addition, we're creating advanced, clean-energy-enabling grids. Working together with our industry, our customers and other stakeholders, we're optimistic that we will achieve a net-zero future. PARTNERING TO BUILD STRONGER\n\n## COMMUNITIES IN THE AREAS WE SERVE. At PPL, our mission includes providing safe, a/f.ffordable, reliable\n\nand sustainable energy to our customers, but the impact we make extends beyond the energy we provide. In 2021, our companies and foundations contributed more than\n\n$12 million to improve education; foster diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI); promote sustainable communities; and support programs that strengthen the communities we serve. Together with our employees and retirees, we raised more than $7 million to support United Way and partner agencies in the work they do to improve lives.\n\nII          PPL CORPORATION 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n\nWhen tornadoes damaged Kentucky homes, businesses and power lines, we responded swi/f.ttly, deploying more than 600 employees and contractors to restore power as quickly and safely as possible and providing immediate financial support to\n\nassist families and businesses. And throughout the year, we worked to lead by example on DEI. This included strengthening diversity within our leadership ranks, our overall workforce and our board; expanding support for social justice and equity initiatives; enhancing supplier diversity; and creating new opportunities through business resource groups for employees of all backgrounds and experiences to collaborate, share perspectives and contribute to PPL's success. As a result of our strong commitment to DEI, we were named a best place to work for LGBTQ equality and disability inclusion and a top utility for workforce diversity.\n\n## MOVING FORWARD WITH CONFIDENCE. DRIVING SUSTAINABLE VALUE FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS.\n\nAs we set our sights on continued growth and execution, we are focused on economically and sustainably transitioning to cleaner energy sources. As we've done for years, we continue to invest in advanced grid automation. Our past investments have supported our strong reliability performance and e/f.fficiency, and we believe the best is yet to come. In addition, we're using data analytics to prevent outages while operating more e/f.fficiently. And we're continuing to incorporate advanced technology to enable widespread connection of renewable energy while preserving power quality and reliability.\n\nThis has been our playbook over the past decade in Pennsylvania. It has resulted in significantly improved customer satisfaction, 27% fewer outages per customer, and one of the nation's smartest and most advanced energy networks - all while keeping operating and maintenance costs /f.llat.\n\nWe believe this proven operating model di/f.fferentiates PPL and is the key to delivering an a/f.ffordable clean energy transition. Our strategy is to replicate this success across our portfolio, including in Rhode Island upon completion of the Narragansett Electric acquisition. We believe we are uniquely qualified to help Rhode Island achieve its ambitious clean energy goals, which include 100% renewable energy by 2030 and net-zero economy-wide carbon emissions by 2050. In summary, we're proud of what our team of talented\n\nemployees accomplished in 2021 as we laid a foundation for growth and success and returned $2.3 billion to shareowners through dividends and share purchases. We're excited about the opportunity we have to shape our energy future and drive long-term value for all stakeholders. And we're thankful for your investment in PPL and for the trust you've placed in us. Sincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIndependent Chair of the Board\n\nPresident and Chief Executive O/f.fficer",

The sale of the U.K. utility business, which substantially represented PPL's U.K. Regulated segment as reported in prior years, was completed on June 14, 2021, pursuant to a share purchase agreement entered into on March 17, 2021. As a result, PPL determined segment information for the U.K. Regulated segment would no longer be provided beginning with the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## (PPL Electric, LG&E and KU)\n\nPPL Electric has two operating segments, distribution and transmission, which are aggregated into a single reportable segment. LG&E and KU are individually single operating and reportable segments.\n\n## Kentucky Regulated Segment (PPL)\n\nThe Kentucky Regulated segment consists primarily of the regulated electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations conducted by LG&E and KU, as well as LG&E's regulated distribution and sale of natural gas. In addition, the Kentucky Regulated segment includes certain financing and other costs at LKE.\n\n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nLG&E and KU are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Kentucky and, in\n\nKU's case, also Virginia. LG&E also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in Kentucky. LG&E provides electricity service to approximately 429,000 customers in Louisville and adjacent areas in Kentucky, covering approximately 700 square miles in nine counties and provides natural gas service to approximately 333,000 customers in its electricity service area and eight additional counties in Kentucky. KU provides electric service to approximately 538,000 customers in 77 counties in central, southeastern and western Kentucky and approximately 28,000 customers in five counties in southwestern Virginia,\n\n2",

        "page_content": "covering approximately 4,800 non-contiguous square miles. KU also sells wholesale electricity to two municipalities in\n\nKentucky under load following contracts. See Note 3 to the Financial Statements for revenue information.\n\nFranchises and Licenses\n\nLG&E and KU provide electricity delivery service, and LG&E provides natural gas distribution service, in their respective service territories pursuant to certain franchises, licenses, statutory service areas, easements and other rights or permissions\n\ngranted by state legislatures, cities or municipalities or other entities.\n\nCompetition\n\nThere are currently no other electric public utilities operating within the electricity service areas of LG&E and KU. From time to time, bills are introduced into the Kentucky General Assembly which seek to authorize, promote or mandate increased distributed generation, customer choice or other developments. Neither the Kentucky General Assembly nor the KPSC has adopted or approved a plan or timetable for retail electric industry competition in Kentucky. The nature or timing of legislative or regulatory actions, if any, regarding industry restructuring and their impact on LG&E and KU, which may be significant, cannot currently be predicted. Virginia, formerly a deregulated jurisdiction, has enacted legislation that implemented a hybrid model of cost-based regulation. KU's operations in Virginia have been and remain regulated.\n\nAlternative energy sources such as electricity, oil, propane and other fuels indirectly impact LG&E's natural gas revenues. Marketers may also compete to sell natural gas to certain large end-users. LG&E's natural gas tariffs include gas price passthrough mechanisms relating to its sale of natural gas as a commodity. Therefore, customer natural gas purchases from alternative suppliers do not generally impact LG&E's profitability. Some large industrial and commercial customers, however, may physically bypass LG&E's facilities and seek delivery service directly from interstate pipelines or other natural gas distribution systems.\n\n## Power Supply\n\nAt December 31, 2021, LG&E owned generating capacity of 2,760 MW and KU owned generating capacity of 4,775 MW.\n\nThe system capacity of LG&E's and KU's owned generation is based upon several factors, including the operating experience and physical condition of the units, and may be revised periodically to reflect changes in circumstances.\n\nDuring 2021, LG&E's and KU's power plants generated the following amounts of electricity:\n\nGWh\n\n| Fuel Source   | KU          | KU     |\n|---------------|-------------|--------|\n| Coal          | LG&E 10,297 | 14,718 |\n| Gas           | 1,395       | 4,382  |\n| Hydro         | 263         | 89     |\n| Solar         | 7           | 12     |\n| Total (a)     | 11,962      | 19,201 |\n\n(a)\n\nThis generation represents increases for LG&E and KU of 4% and 5% from 2020 output.\n\nThe majority of LG&E's and KU's generated electricity was used to supply their retail customer bases.\n\nLG&E and KU jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their customers. When\n\nLG&E has excess generation capacity after serving its own customers and its generation cost is lower than that of KU, KU purchases electricity from LG&E and vice versa.\n\nDue to environmental requirements and energy efficiency measures, as of December 31, 2021, LG&E and KU have retired\n\n3 approximately 1,200 MW of coal-fired generation plants since 2010.",

        "page_content": "LG&E and KU received approval from the KPSC to develop a 4 MW Solar Share facility to service a Solar Share program. The Solar Share program is a voluntary program that allows customers to subscribe capacity in the Solar Share facility. Construction commences, in 500-kilowatt phases, when subscription is complete. Construction of four 500-kilowatt phases was completed as of December 31, 2021. The subscription for the fifth 500-kilowatt phase was completed with construction expected to be completed in 2022. LG&E and KU continue to market the program and have started receiving subscriptions for the sixth 500-\n\nkilowatt phase.\n\nOn January 23, 2020, LG&E and KU applied to the KPSC for approval of arrangements relating to the purchase of 100 MW of solar power in connection with the Green Tariff option established in the 2018 Kentucky base rate cases. Pursuant to the agreements, LG&E and KU would purchase the initial 20 years of output of a proposed third-party solar generation facility and resell the bulk of the power as renewable energy to two large industrial customers and use the remaining power for other customers. The generation facility is currently expected to be operational in the second quarter of 2023. On May 8, 2020, the KPSC issued an order approving LG&E's and KU's applications with certain modifications. LG&E and KU requested reconsideration of limited portions of the KPSC's Order and on December 16, 2020, the KPSC amended their original order. PPL, LG&E and KU do not anticipate that these arrangements will have a significant impact on their results of operations or financial condition.\n\nOn October 6, 2021, LG&E and KU entered into an agreement to purchase the initial 20 years of output of a proposed 125 MW third-party solar generation facility in connection with the Green Tariff option established in the 2018 Kentucky base rate cases. Pursuant to the agreements, LG&E and KU would purchase output of the facility and resell power as renewable energy to certain large customers. The generation facility is currently expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2024. PPL, LG&E and KU do not anticipate that this agreement will have a significant impact on their results of operations or financial condition.\n\n## Fuel Supply\n\nCoal and natural gas are expected to be the predominant fuels used by LG&E and KU for generation for the foreseeable future. Natural gas used for generation is primarily purchased using contractual arrangements separate from LG&E's natural gas distribution operations. Natural gas and oil are also used for intermediate and peaking capacity and flame stabilization in coalfired boilers.\n\nFuel inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units. Reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by several factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues, high or low river level events, lock outages and other supplier or transporter operating or financial difficulties.\n\nLG&E and KU have entered into coal supply agreements with various suppliers for coal deliveries through 2026 and augment their coal supply agreements with spot market purchases, as needed.\n\nFor their existing units, LG&E and KU expect, for the foreseeable future, to purchase most of their coal from western\n\nKentucky, southern Indiana, southern Illinois, northern West Virginia and western Pennsylvania. LG&E and KU continue to purchase certain quantities of ultra-low sulfur content coal from Wyoming for blending at Trimble County Unit 2. Coal is delivered to the generating plants primarily by barge and rail.\n\nTo enhance the reliability of natural gas supply, LG&E and KU have secured firm long-term pipeline transport capacity services\n\nwith contracts of various durations through 2024 on the interstate pipeline serving Cane Run Unit 7. This pipeline also serves the six simple cycle combustion turbine units located at the Trimble County site as well as two other simple cycle units at the Paddy's Run site. For the seven simple cycle combustion turbines at the E.W. Brown facility, no firm long-term pipeline transport capacity has been purchased due to the facility's connection to two interstate pipelines and some of the units having dual fuel capability.\n\n4",

The bulk of\n\nthe natural gas fuel remains purchased on the spot market.\n\n(PPL and LG&E)\n\nNatural Gas Distribution Supply\n\nFive underground natural gas storage fields, with a current working natural gas capacity of approximately 15 billion cubic feet (Bcf), are used to provide natural gas service to LG&E's firm sales customers. Natural gas is stored during the summer season for withdrawal during the following winter heating season. Without this storage capacity, LG&E would need to purchase additional natural gas and pipeline transportation services during winter months when customer demand increases and the prices for natural gas supply and transportation services are expected to be higher. At December 31, 2021, LG&E had 12 Bcf of natural gas stored underground with a carrying value of $54 million.\n\nLG&E folio of supply arrangements of varying durations and terms that provide competitively priced natural gas designed to meet its firm sales obligations. These natural gas supply arrangements include pricing provisions that are marketresponsive. In tandem with pipeline transportation services, these natural gas supplies provide the reliability and flexibility necessary to serve LG&E's natural gas customers.\n\nLG&E purchases natural gas supply transportation services from two pipelines. LG&E has contracts with one pipeline that are subject to termination by LG&E between 2023 and 2026. Total winter season capacity under these contracts is 184,900 MMBtu/day and summer season capacity is 60,000 MMBtu/day. With this same pipeline, LG&E also has another contract for pipeline capacity through 2026 for 60,000 MMBtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons. LG&E has a single contract with a second pipeline with a total capacity of 20,000 MMBtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons that expires in 2023.\n\nLG&E expects to purchase natural gas supplies for its gas distribution operations from onshore producing regions in South Texas, East Texas, North Louisiana and Arkansas, as well as gas originating in the Marcellus and Utica production areas.\n\n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\n## Transmission\n\nLG&E and KU contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority to act as their transmission reliability coordinator and contract with TranServ International, Inc. to act as their independent transmission organization.\n\nRates\n\nLG&E is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC and FERC, and KU is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC, FERC and VSCC. LG&E and KU operate under a FERC-approved open access transmission tariff.\n\nLG&E's and KU's Kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and\n\nshort-term debt) including adjustments for certain net investments and costs recovered separately through other means. As such, LG&E and KU generally earn a return on regulatory assets in Kentucky.\n\nKU's Virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less accumulated\n\ndeferred income taxes and miscellaneous deductions). As all regulatory assets and liabilities, except for regulatory assets and liabilities related to the levelized fuel factor, accumulated deferred income taxes, pension and postretirement benefits, and AROs related to certain CCR impoundments, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of Virginia base rates, no return is earned on the related assets.\n\n5",

PPL Electric also provides electricity to retail customers in this territory as a PLR under the Customer Choice Act. See Note 3 to the Financial Statements for revenue information.\n\n## Franchise, Licenses and Other Regulations\n\nPPL Electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its service area as a result of grants by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in corporate charters to PPL Electric and companies which it has succeeded, and as a result of certification by the PUC. PPL Electric is granted the right to enter the streets and highways by the Commonwealth subject to certain conditions. In general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the Commonwealth.\n\n## Competition\n\nPursuant to authorizations from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the PUC, PPL Electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service area. Accordingly, PPL Electric does not face competition in its electricity distribution business. Pursuant to the Customer Choice Act, generation of electricity is a competitive business in Pennsylvania, and PPL Electric does not own or operate any generation facilities.\n\nThe PPL Electric transmission business, operating under a FERC-approved PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff, is subject to competition pursuant to FERC Order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent PJM transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within PJM.\n\nRates and Regulation\n\nTransmission\n\nPPL Electric's transmission facilities are within PJM, which operates the electricity transmission network and electric energy\n\nmarket in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the U.S.\n\nPJM serves as a FERC-approved Regional Transmission Operator (RTO) to promote greater participation and competition in\n\n6 the region it serves. In addition to operating the electricity transmission network, PJM also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services.

Electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets and to receive their share of transmission revenues, but the RTO directs the control and operation of the\n\ntransmission facilities. Certain types of transmission investments are subject to competitive processes outlined in the PJM tariff.\n\nAs a transmission owner, PPL Electric's transmission revenues are recovered through PJM and billed in accordance with a FERC-approved Open Access Transmission Tariff that allows recovery of incurred transmission costs, a return on transmissionrelated plant and an automatic annual update based on a formula-based rate recovery mechanism. Under this formula, rates are put into effect in June of each year based upon prior year actual expenditures and current year forecasted capital additions. Rates are then adjusted the following year to reflect actual annual expenses and capital additions, as reported in PPL Electric's annual FERC Form 1, filed under the FERC's Uniform System of Accounts. Any difference between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual expenditures incurred for that year is recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. Any change in the prior year PPL zonal peak load billing factor applied on January 1 of each year will result in an increase or decrease in revenue until the next annual rate update is effective on June 1 of that same year.\n\nAs a PLR, PPL Electric also purchases transmission services from PJM. See \"PLR\" below.\n\nSee \"Financial and Operational Developments\" in \"Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on rate mechanisms and regulatory matters.\n\n## Distribution\n\nPPL Electric's distribution base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus a cash working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions). All regulatory assets and liabilities, except accumulated deferred income taxes, are excluded from the return on rate base. Therefore, no return is earned on the related assets unless specifically provided for by the PUC. Currently, PPL Electric's Smart Meter rider and the DSIC are the only riders authorized to earn a return. Certain operating expenses are also included in PPL Electric's distribution base rates including wages and benefits, other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and taxes.\n\nPennsylvania's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) requires electricity distribution companies and electricity generation suppliers to obtain from alternative energy resources a portion of the electricity sold to retail customers in Pennsylvania. Under the default service procurement plans approved by the PUC, PPL Electric purchases all of the alternative energy generation supply it needs to comply with the AEPS.\n\nAct 129 created an energy efficiency and conservation program, a demand side management program, smart metering technology requirements, new PLR generation supply procurement rules, remedies for market misconduct and changes to the existing AEPS.\n\nAct 11 authorizes the PUC to approve two specific ratemaking mechanisms: the use of a fully projected future test year in base rate proceedings and, subject to certain conditions, the use of a DSIC. Such alternative ratemaking procedures and mechanisms provide opportunity for accelerated cost-recovery and, therefore, are important to PPL Electric as it is in a period of significant capital investment to maintain and enhance the reliability of its delivery system, including the replacement of aging assets. PPL Electric utilized the fully projected future test year mechanism in its 2015 base rate proceeding. PPL has had the ability to utilize the DSIC recovery mechanism since July 2013.\n\nSee Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on rate mechanisms and legislative and regulatory matters.\n\nPLR\n\nThe Customer Choice Act requires electric distribution companies, including PPL Electric, or an alternative supplier approved\n\n7 by the PUC, to act as a PLR of electricity supply for customers who do not choose to shop for supply with a competitive",

In 2021, the following average percentages of PPL Electric's customer load were provided by competitive suppliers: 39% of residential, 79% of small commercial and industrial and 98% of large commercial and industrial customers. The PUC continues to favor\n\nexpanding the competitive market for electricity.\n\nPPL Electric's electricity generation costs are established based upon the results of a competitive solicitation process. On December 17, 2020, the PUC approved PPL Electric's default service plan for the period June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2025, which includes a total of eight solicitations for electricity supply held semiannually in April and October. The first two auctions of the plan were completed in 2021. This plan also includes eight solicitations for alternative energy credits held semiannually in January and July. Through January 2022, two alternative energy credit solicitations have been completed. All contracts from previous default service plans concluded on or before November 30, 2021.\n\nPursuant to the plans, PPL Electric contracts for all of the electricity supply for residential, commercial and industrial customers who elect to take default service from PPL Electric. These solicitations contain a mix of products including 5-year block energy contracts for residential customers, 6- and 12-month fixed-price load-following contracts for residential and small commercial and industrial customers, 12-month real-time pricing contracts for large commercial and industrial customers, and alternative energy credit contracts for residential, commercial and industrial customers. These contracts fulfill PPL Electric's obligation to provide customer electricity supply as a PLR.\n\nNumerous alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in PPL Electric's service area. As the cost of generation supply is a pass-through cost for PPL Electric, its financial results are not impacted if its customers purchase electricity supply from these alternative suppliers.\n\n## Corporate and Other (PPL)\n\nPPL Services provides PPL subsidiaries with administrative, management and support services. The costs of these services are charged directly to the respective recipients for the services provided or indirectly charged to applicable recipients based on an average of the recipients' relative invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees or a ratio of overall direct and indirect costs.\n\nPPL Capital Funding provides financing for the operations of PPL and certain subsidiaries. PPL's growth in rate-regulated businesses provides the organization with an enhanced corporate level financing alternative, through PPL Capital Funding, that enables PPL to cost effectively support targeted credit profiles across all of PPL's rated companies. As a result, PPL utilizes PPL Capital Funding as a source of capital in financings, in addition to continued direct financing by certain operating subsidiaries.\n\nUnlike PPL Services, PPL Capital Funding's costs are not generally charged to PPL subsidiaries. Costs are charged directly to PPL. However, PPL Capital Funding participated significantly in the financing for the acquisition of LKE and certain associated financing costs were allocated to the Kentucky Regulated Segment. Prior to 2021, the associated financing costs, as well as the financing costs associated with prior issuances of certain other PPL Capital Funding securities, were assigned to the appropriate segments for purposes of PPL management's assessment of segment performance. In 2021, corporate level financing costs are no longer allocated to the reportable segments. The financing costs associated primarily with PPL Capital Funding's securities issuances, with certain exceptions, have not been directly assigned or allocated to any segment.\n\nThe financial results of Safari Energy are also reported within Corporate and Other.\n\n8",

The EPA and other federal agencies with jurisdiction over environmental matters have issued numerous environmental regulations relating to air, water and waste that directly affect the electric power industry. Due to these environmental issues, it may be necessary for the Registrants to modify or cease certain operations or operation of certain facilities to comply with statutes, regulations and other requirements of regulatory bodies or courts. In addition, legal challenges to environmental permits or rules add uncertainty to estimating future costs of complying with such permits and rules. The Biden administration is currently undertaking changes in a wide range of environmental programs.\n\nSee 'Legal Matters' in Note 14 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of environmental commitments and contingencies. See \"Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures\" in \"Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for information on projected environmental capital expenditures for 2022 through 2024.\n\nLG&E and KU are entitled to recover, through the ECR mechanism, certain costs of complying with the Clean Air Act, as amended, and other federal, state and local environmental requirements applicable to coal combustion wastes and by-products from coal-fired generating facilities upon KPSC review. Costs not covered by the ECR mechanism for LG&E and KU and all such costs for PPL Electric are subject to rate recovery at the discretion of the companies' respective state regulatory authorities, or the FERC, if applicable. Because PPL Electric does not own any generating plants, it has less exposure to related environmental compliance costs. The Registrants can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future proceedings before regulatory authorities.\n\nAir\n\n## NAAQS (PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nThe Clean Air Act has a significant impact on the operation of fossil fuel generation plants. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA periodically to establish and review National Ambient Air Quality Standards, known as NAAQS, for six pollutants: carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone (contributed to by nitrogen oxide emissions), particulate matter and sulfur dioxide. In December 2020, the EPA released final actions keeping the existing NAAQS standard for particulate matter and ozone without change, but the EPA is currently reconsidering those decisions. PPL, LG&E, and KU are unable to predict the outcome of future evaluations by the EPA and the states with respect to the NAAQS standards.\n\nApplicable regulations require each state to identify areas within its boundaries that fail to meet the NAAQS, (known as nonattainment areas), and develop a state implementation plan to achieve and maintain compliance. States that are found to contribute significantly to another state's nonattainment with ozone standards are required to establish \"good neighbor\" state implementation plans. In addition, for attainment of ozone and fine particulates standards, certain states, including Kentucky, are subject to a regional EPA program known as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR).\n\nIn January 2018, the EPA designated Jefferson County, Kentucky (Louisville) as being in nonattainment with the existing 2015\n\nozone standard. In 2020 and 2021, LG&E entered into agreements with the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District for temporary nitrogen oxide emission limits at LG&E's Mill Creek Station during those years to facilitate compliance with the ozone standard. If Jefferson County is unable to demonstrate attainment within the specified timeframes, it may be 'bumped up' to the moderate nonattainment classification and thus subject to additional requirements including requirements for installation of reasonably available control technology on coal-fired generating units. Compliance with such requirements may require installation of additional pollution controls or other compliance actions. LG&E is unable to determine the impact on operations until certain compliance determinations are made by the EPA and Kentucky.\n\n9",

        "page_content": "In April 2021, the EPA published final revisions to the CSAPR providing for reductions in ozone season nitrogen oxide emissions for 2021 and subsequent years from sources in 12 states, including Kentucky. Additionally, the EPA reversed its previous approval of the Kentucky State Implementation Plan with respect to these requirements. The CSAPR revisions are aimed at ensuring compliance with the 2008 ozone NAAQS, so additional nitrogen oxide emission reductions could potentially be required for compliance with the revised 2015 ozone NAAQS. PPL, LG&E and KU do not currently expect the impact of the CSAPR revisions on operations to be material. Pursuant to the President's executive order, the EPA is currently reconsidering its previous determinations made in December 2020 to retain the existing NAAQS for ozone and particulate\n\nmatter without change, with final determinations by the EPA expected in 2022 for particulate matter and 2023 for ozone.\n\nPPL, LG&E, and KU are unable to predict future emission reductions that may be required by future federal rules or state implementation actions. Compliance with the NAAQS, CSAPR and related requirements may require installation of additional pollution controls or other compliance actions, inclusive of retirements, the costs of which PPL, LG&E and KU believe would be subject to rate recovery.\n\n## Climate Change (All Registrants)\n\nThere is continuing world-wide attention focused on issues related to climate change. In 2015, 195 nations, including the U.S., signed the Paris Agreement on Climate, establishing non-binding targets to reduce GHG emissions from both developed and developing nations. In 2017, President Trump announced a U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, effective November 2020. In January 2021, the Biden presidential administration initiated the process to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which was completed in February 2021. The Biden administration also issued executive orders directing agencies to conduct a general review of regulations and executive actions relating to the environment and reestablished a framework for considering the social cost of carbon as part of certain agency cost-benefit analyses for new regulations . The Biden administration is exploring wide-ranging efforts to address climate change. Recent government actions and policy developments, including the President's announced goal of a carbon free electricity sector by 2035, and targeting net-zero emissions for the federal government by 2050, could have significant impacts on PPL's business operations, products, and services. Certain of the efforts announced by the Biden administration are preliminary or ongoing in nature. Additionally, there are ongoing efforts by various state and local governments to assess potential changes to legislation, rules, policies, directives, and other requirements applicable to greenhouse gas emissions. PPL, LG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of ongoing developments.\n\nPPL has adopted a goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which includes continuing to retire coal-fired generation and investing in research and innovation that will help to achieve this goal, while maintaining reliable and affordable energy in our service territories. The net-zero goal relates to direct and indirect carbon emissions consistent with Greenhouse Gas Protocol guidance and referenced by the EPA Center for Corporate Climate Leadership. Through 2020, PPL has reduced carbon emissions nearly 60% from 2010 levels and is targeting a 70% reduction from 2010 levels by 2035 and an 80% reduction by 2040.\n\nPPL is also aware of the various risks associated with climate change, including increased frequency and severity of severe weather. To address these risks, PPL continues to work to advance the grid and improve the Company's equipment to help mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events and improve reliability.\n\n## The EPA's Affordable Clean Energy Rule ( PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nIn July 2019, the EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan and finalized the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule which gives states\n\nbroad latitude to establish emission guidelines providing for plant-specific efficiency upgrades or \"heat-rate improvements\" to reduce GHG emissions per unit of electricity generated. Various entities filed petitions for review and petitions for reconsideration. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court issued an opinion finding that the EPA had erroneously repealed the Clean Power Plan. The D.C Circuit Court's opinion also vacated and remanded the ACE Rule to the EPA. On October 29, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court granted review of the D.C. Circuit Court's ruling. PPL, LG&E, and KU cannot predict the outcome of the pending litigation and regulatory proceedings or changes that may be pursued by the Biden administration, but believe that the costs would be subject to rate recovery.\n\n10",

These requirements could impose significant costs for LG&E and KU, which are expected to be subject to rate recovery.\n\n## Clean Water Act Jurisdiction\n\nEnvironmental groups and others have claimed that discharges to groundwater from leaking CCR impoundments at power plants are subject to Clean Water Act permitting. On April 12, 2019, the EPA released regulatory clarification finding that Clean Water Act jurisdiction does not cover such discharges to groundwater. On January 23, 2020, the EPA announced a final rule modifying the jurisdictional scope of the Clean Water Act. The announced rule revises the definition of the \"Waters of the United States,\" including a revision to exclude groundwater from the definition. In April 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling that Clean Water Act jurisdiction may apply to certain discharges to groundwater that result in the functional equivalent of a direct discharge to navigable waters. PPL, LG&E, and KU are unaware of any unpermitted releases from their facilities that are subject to Clean Water Act jurisdiction, but future regulatory developments and judicial rulings could potentially subject certain releases from CCR impoundments and landfills to additional permitting and remediation requirements, which could impose substantial costs. Any associated costs are expected to be subject to rate recovery. PPL, LG&E and KU are unable to predict the outcome or financial impact of future regulatory proceedings and litigation.\n\n## Waters of the United States\n\nPPL, LG&E, and KU are subject to permitting and mitigation requirements for certain construction activities that impact 'Waters of the United States.' On April 21, 2020, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a final rule revising the definition of 'Waters of the United Status' to exclude jurisdiction over certain surface waters. On August 30, 2021, a U.S. District Court in Arizona vacated and remanded the rule. On December 7, 2021, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed to repeal the rule and restore the definition of 'Waters of the United States' that was in place prior to 2015. On January 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court granted review of a case raising the issue of the appropriate scope of the definition of 'Waters of the United States' under the Clean Water Act. PPL, LG&E and KU are unable to predict the outcome of current or future litigation or regulatory proceedings, but do not expect a material impact on operations.\n\n## Superfund and Other Remediation\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nFrom time to time, PPL's subsidiaries undertake testing, monitoring or remedial action in response to spills or other releases at\n\nvarious on-site and off-site locations, negotiate with the EPA and state and local agencies regarding actions necessary to comply with applicable requirements, negotiate with property owners and other third parties alleging impacts from PPL's operations and undertake similar actions necessary to resolve environmental matters that arise in the course of normal operations. Based on analyses to date, resolution of these environmental matters is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on the operations of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU.\n\n11",

The frequency of these attempted intrusions has increased in recent years and the sources, motivations and techniques of attack continue to evolve and change rapidly. PPL has adopted a variety of measures to monitor and address cyber-related risks and continues to implement and explore additional cybersecurity measures. Cybersecurity and the effectiveness of PPL's cybersecurity strategy are regular topics of discussion at Board of Directors meetings. PPL's strategy for managing cyber-related risks is risk-based and, where appropriate, integrated within PPL's enterprise risk management processes. PPL's Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who reports directly to the Chief Operating Officer, leads a dedicated cybersecurity team and is responsible for the design, implementation, and execution of cyber-risk management strategy. In addition, among other things, the CISO and the cybersecurity team actively monitor the Registrants' systems, regularly review policies, compliance, regulations and best practices, perform penetration testing, conduct incident response exercises and internal ethical phishing campaigns, and provide training and communication across the organization to strengthen secure behavior and foster a culture of security. The cybersecurity team also routinely participates in industry-wide programs to further information sharing, intelligence gathering, and unity of effort in responding to potential or actual attacks. In addition, PPL has a formal internal policy and procedures for communicating cybersecurity incidents on an enterprise-wide basis.\n\nIn addition to these enterprise-wide initiatives, PPL's Kentucky and Pennsylvania operations are subject to extensive and rigorous mandatory cybersecurity requirements that are developed and enforced by NERC and approved by the FERC to protect grid security and reliability. LG&E is also subject to certain security directives related to cybersecurity issued by the Department of Homeland Security's Transportation Security Administration in 2021. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information on these directives. Finally, PPL purchases insurance to protect against a wide range of costs that could be incurred in connection with cyber-related incidents. There can be no assurance, however, that these efforts will be effective to prevent interruption of services or other damage to the Registrants' businesses or operations or that PPL's insurance coverage will cover all costs incurred in connection with any cyber-related incident.\n\n13",

In Kentucky, the KPSC has adopted a series of regulatory mechanisms (ECR, DSM, GLT, fuel adjustment clause, and gas supply clause) and recovery on construction work-in-progress that reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. In Pennsylvania, the FERC transmission formula rate, DSIC mechanism, Smart Meter Rider and other recovery mechanisms operate to reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of and a return on, as appropriate, prudently\n\nincurred costs.\n\nIn March 2021, PPL entered into definitive agreements that strategically reposition the company as a U.S.-based energy company focused on building the utilities of the future. These transactions are intended to strengthen PPL's credit metrics, enhance long-term earnings growth and predictability, and provide the company with greater financial flexibility to invest in sustainable energy solutions. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements, and the \"Sale of the U.K. Utility Business\" and \"Share Purchase Agreement to Acquire Narragansett Electric\" discussions in \"Financial and Operational Developments\" below for additional information.\n\n## Financial and Operational Developments\n\n(PPL)\n\n## Sale of the U.K. Utility Business\n\nOn March 17, 2021, PPL WPD Limited (WPD Limited) entered into a share purchase agreement (WPD SPA) to sell PPL's U.K. utility business to National Grid Holdings One plc (National Grid U.K.), a subsidiary of National Grid plc. Pursuant to the WPD SPA, National Grid U.K. would acquire 100% of the issued share capital of PPL WPD Investments Limited (WPD Investments) for \u00a37.8 billion in cash. WPD Limited would also receive an additional amount of \u00a3548,000 for each day during the period from January 1, 2021 to the closing date if the dividends usually declared by WPD Investments to WPD Limited were not paid for that period.\n\nOn June 14, 2021, the sale of the U.K. utility business was completed. The transaction resulted in cash proceeds of $10.7 billion inclusive of foreign currency hedges executed by PPL. PPL received net proceeds, after taxes and fees, of $10.4 billion, resulting in a pre-tax loss on sale of $1.6 billion. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the sale of the U.K. utility business.\n\nWPD Limited and National Grid U.K. each made customary representations and warranties in the WPD SPA. National Grid U.K., at its expense, purchased warranty and indemnity insurance. WPD Limited agreed to indemnify National Grid U.K. for certain tax related matters. See Note 11 to the Financial Statements for additional information. PPL has not had and will not have any significant involvement with the U.K. utility business after completion of the sale.\n\n## Share Purchase Agreement to Acquire Narragansett Electric\n\nOn March 17, 2021, PPL and its subsidiary, PPL Energy Holdings, entered into a share purchase agreement (Narragansett SPA)\n\nwith National Grid USA (National Grid U.S.), a subsidiary of National Grid plc, to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Narragansett Electric for approximately $3.8 billion in cash. On May 3, 2021, an Assignment and Assumption Agreement was entered into by PPL, PPL Energy Holdings, PPL Rhode Island Holdings and National Grid U.S. whereby certain interests of PPL Energy Holdings in the Narragansett SPA were assigned to and assumed by PPL Rhode Island Holdings. Pursuant to that Assignment and Assumption Agreement, PPL Rhode Island Holdings became the purchasing entity under the Narragansett SPA. The acquisition is expected to be funded with proceeds from the sale of the U.K. utility business. PPL has agreed to guarantee all obligations of PPL Energy Holdings and PPL Rhode Island Holdings under the Narragansett SPA and the related Assignment and Assumption Agreement.\n\n15",

To date, several required regulatory approvals or waivers have been received, though the order granting the waiver by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities is subject to a pending appeal. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding the current status of this appeal. PPL anticipates receiving a final order from the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers with respect to the acquisition by March 2022. The regulatory approvals remain subject to any applicable appeal periods. The consummation of the transaction is not subject to a financing\n\ncondition.\n\nSee Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the Narragansett SPA.\n\n## Debt Redemption\n\nPPL Capital Funding paid $3.883 billion to tender and/or redeem an aggregate total of $3.484 billion of outstanding debt during 2021, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of $395 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. See \"Long Term Debt\" in Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Share Repurchases\n\nPPL's Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of up to $3 billion of PPL common shares. During 2021, PPL repurchased 34.8 million shares at a cost of $1.0 billion. See \"Equity Securities\" in Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## LKE Debt Redemption\n\nOn July 1, 2021, LKE redeemed, at par, its $250 million 4.375% Senior Notes due 2021 and on July 9, 2021, LKE filed a Form 15 with the SEC to suspend its duty to file reports under sections 13 and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a result, beginning with the June 30, 2021 Form 10-Q, LKE was no longer reported as a Registrant.\n\n## U.K. Corporation Tax Rate Change\n\nIn 2021, the U.K. Finance Act 2021 increased the U.K. corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. The primary impact of the corporation tax rate increase was an increase in deferred tax liabilities of the U.K. utility business, which was sold on June 14, 2021, and a corresponding deferred tax expense of $383 million, which was recognized in continuing operations in the second quarter of 2021.\n\n## Regulatory Requirements\n\n( All Registrants)\n\nThe Registrants cannot predict the impact that future regulatory requirements may have on their financial condition or results of\n\noperations.\n\n16",

        "page_content": "Environmental Considerations for Coal-Fired Generation\n\n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nThe businesses of LG&E and KU are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those pertaining to CCRs, GHG, and ELGs. See Notes 7, 14 and 20 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these significant environmental matters. These and other environmental requirements led PPL, LG&E and KU to retire approximately 1,200 MW of coal-fired generating plants in Kentucky since 2010. As part of the long-term generation planning process, LG&E and KU evaluate a range of factors including the impact of potential stricter environmental regulations, fuel price scenarios, the cost of replacement generation, continued operations and major maintenance costs and the risk of major equipment failures in determining when to retire generation assets. As a result of environmental requirements and aging infrastructure, LG&E anticipates retiring two older coal-fired units at the Mill Creek Plant and KU anticipates retiring one coalfired unit at the E.W. Brown plant. Mill Creek Unit 1 has 300 MW of capacity and is expected to be retired in 2024. Mill Creek Unit 2 and E.W. Brown Unit 3 have capacities of 297 MW and 412 MW and are expected to be retired in 2028. LG&E and KU anticipate earning recovery of and return on any remaining net book value of these assets through the Retired Asset Recovery (RAR) rider. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information related to the RAR rider.\n\n## PPL Electric Transmission Formula Rate Return on Equity (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nOn May 21, 2020, PP&L Industrial Customer Alliance (PPLICA) filed a complaint with the FERC alleging that PPL Electric's base return on equity (ROE) of 11.18% used to determine PPL Electric's formula transmission rate was unjust and unreasonable.\n\nOnAugust 20, 2021, PPL Electric entered into a settlement agreement (the Settlement) with PPLICA and all other parties, including intervenors, with respect to the complaint filed by PPLICA on May 21, 2020.\n\n## The key aspects of the Settlement include:\n\n- \u00b7 changes to PPL Electric's base ROE:\n- \u00b7 beginning as of May 21, 2020 and continuing through May 31, 2022, the ROE shall be 9.90%;\n- \u00b7 beginning on June 1, 2022 and continuing through May 31, 2023, the ROE shall be 9.95%;\n- \u00b7 beginning on June 1, 2023, the ROE shall be 10.00%, which shall continue in effect unless and until changed as permitted by the terms of the Settlement;\n- \u00b7 changes the equity component of PPL Electric's capital structure to be the lower of (i) PPL Electric's actual equity component, calculated in accordance with the formula rate template, or (ii) 56.00%;\n- \u00b7 allows modification of the current rate year of June 1 to May 31 to a calendar year of January 1 to December 31; and\n- \u00b7 allows modification of the current formula rate based on a historic test year to a projected test year.\n\nIn 2021, PPL Electric recorded a revenue reduction of $78 million ($55 million after-tax), of which $73 million ($52 million after-tax) represents revenue subject to refund for the period May 21, 2020 through November 30, 2021. The reduction recorded includes $28 million ($20 million after-tax) related to the period from May 21, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The $73 million of revenue to be refunded will be returned to customers from January 1, 2022 through May 31, 2022 and is based on the difference between charges that were calculated using the ROE in effect at the time and charges calculated using the revised ROE provided for the Settlement, plus interest at the FERC interest rate.\n\nThe FERC approved the Settlement on November 5, 2021. Interim rates reflecting the agreed-to-base ROE in the Settlement\n\nwere effective December 1, 2021.\n\nFERC Transmission Rate Filing\n\n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nIn 2018, LG&E and KU applied to the FERC requesting elimination of certain on-going credits to a sub-set of transmission\n\n17 customers relating to the 1998 merger of LG&E's and KU's parent entities and the 2006 withdrawal of LG&E and KU from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc.

The amounts at issue are generally waivers or credits granted to a limited number of Kentucky municipalities for either certain LG&E and KU or MISO transmission charges incurred for transmission service received. In 2019, the FERC granted LG&E's and KU's request to remove the ongoing credits, conditioned upon the implementation by LG&E and KU of a transition mechanism for certain existing power supply arrangements, which was subsequently filed, modified, and approved by the FERC in 2020 and 2021. In 2020, LG&E and KU and other parties filed appeals with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals regarding FERC's orders on the elimination of the mitigation and required transition mechanism. Oral arguments in the appellate proceeding occurred on February 14, 2022. LG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of the respective appellate and FERC proceedings. LG&E and KU currently receive recovery of the waivers and credits provided through other rate mechanisms and such rate recovery would be anticipated to be adjusted consistent with potential changes or terminations of the waivers and credits, as such become\n\neffective.\n\n## Rate Case Proceedings\n\n( PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nOn November 25, 2020, LG&E and KU filed requests with the KPSC for an increase in annual electricity and gas revenues of approximately $331 million ($131 million and $170 million in electricity revenues at LG&E and KU and $30 million in gas revenues at LG&E). The revenue increases represented an increase of 11.6% and 10.4% in electricity revenues at LG&E and KU, and an increase of 8.3% in gas revenues at LG&E. In recognition of the economic impact of COVID-19, LG&E and KU requested approval of a one-year billing credit which will credit customers approximately $53 million ($41 million at LG&E and $12 million at KU). The billing credit represents the return to customers of certain regulatory liabilities on LG&E's and KU's Balance Sheets and serves to partially mitigate the rate increases during the first year in which the new rates are in effect.\n\nLG&E's and KU's applications also included a request for a CPCN to deploy Advanced Metering Infrastructure across LG&E's and KU's service territories in Kentucky.\n\nThe applications were based on a forecasted test year of July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022 and requested an authorized return on equity of 10.0%.\n\nOnApril 19, 2021, LG&E and KU entered into an agreement with all intervening parties to the proceedings resolving all matters in their applications, with the explicit exception of LG&E's and KU's net metering proposals.\n\nOn June 30, 2021 and December 6, 2021, the KPSC issued orders approving the proposed agreement filed in April 2021, with certain modifications. The orders provided for increases in annual revenues of $207 million ($74 million and $110 million in electricity revenues at LG&E and KU and $23 million in gas revenues at LG&E) based on an authorized return on equity of 9.425%. The orders grant an authorized 9.35% return on equity for the ECR and GLT mechanisms and do not modify the requested one-year billing credit. The orders approved the CPCN to deploy Advanced Metering Infrastructure and provide regulatory asset treatment for the remaining net book value of legacy meters upon full implementation of the Advanced Metering Infrastructure program. The orders also approved the establishment of a Retired Asset Recovery (RAR) rider to provide for recovery of and return on the remaining investment in certain electric generating units upon their retirement over a ten-year period following retirement. In respect of the RAR rider, LG&E and KU continue to use currently approved depreciation rates for Mill Creek Units 1 and 2 and Brown Unit 3. The orders also approved a four-year \"stay out\" commitment from LG&E and KU to refrain from effective base rate increases before July 1, 2025, subject to certain exceptions. On September 24, 2021, the KPSC issued orders providing adjustments to previous net metering proposals. These adjustments did not impact the annual revenue increases.\n\n18",

PPL believes that Earnings from Ongoing Operations is useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management's view of PPL's earnings performance as another criterion in making investment decisions. In addition, PPL's management uses Earnings from Ongoing Operations in measuring achievement of certain corporate performance goals, including targets for certain executive incentive compensation. Other companies may use different measures to present financial performance.\n\nEarnings from Ongoing Operations is adjusted for the impact of special items. Special items are presented in the financial tables on an after-tax basis with the related income taxes on special items separately disclosed. Income taxes on special items, when applicable, are calculated based on the statutory tax rate of the entity where the activity is recorded. Special items may include items such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Gains and losses on sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business.\n- \u00b7 Impairment charges.\n- \u00b7 Significant workforce reduction and other restructuring effects.\n- \u00b7 Acquisition and divestiture-related adjustments.\n- \u00b7 Significant losses on early extinguishment of debt.\n- \u00b7 Other charges or credits that are, in management's view, non-recurring or otherwise not reflective of the company's ongoing operations.\n\nPPL's Earnings from Ongoing Operations by reportable segment were as follows:\n\nChange\n\n|                                  | 2021   | 2020    | 2021 vs. 2020   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|---------|-----------------|\n| Kentucky Regulated               | $ 465  | 423 $   | 42              |\n| Pennsylvania Regulated           | 465    | 498     | (33)            |\n| Corporate and Other (a)          | (124)  | (147) $ | 23              |\n| Earnings from Ongoing Operations | $ 806  | 774     | 32              |\n\nSee \"Reconciliation of Earnings from Ongoing Operations\" below for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to Net Income.\n\n## Kentucky Regulated Segment\n\nThe Kentucky Regulated segment consists primarily of LG&E's and KU's regulated electricity generation, transmission and\n\ndistribution operations, as well as LG&E's regulated distribution and sale of natural gas.\n\nNet Income and Earnings from Ongoing Operations include the following results:\n\n23",

See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional\n\n(j)\n\nThe amounts for 2020 have been adjusted for certain costs that were previously included in the U.K. Regulated segment.\n\n## Adjusted Gross Margins\n\nManagement also utilizes the following non-GAAP financial measures as indicators of performance for its businesses.\n\n- \u00b7 \"Kentucky Adjusted Gross Margins\" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations of the Kentucky Regulated segment, as well as the Kentucky Regulated segment's distribution and sale of natural gas. In calculating this measure, fuel, energy purchases and certain variable costs of production (recorded in \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the Statements of Income) are deducted from operating revenues. In addition, certain other expenses, recorded in \"Other operation and maintenance\", \"Depreciation\" and \"Taxes, other than income\" on the Statements of Income, associated with approved cost recovery mechanisms are offset against the recovery of those expenses, which are included in revenues. These mechanisms allow for direct recovery of these expenses and, in some cases, returns on capital investments and performance incentives. As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from electricity and gas operations.\n- \u00b7 \"Pennsylvania Adjusted Gross Margins\" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity transmission and distribution operations of the Pennsylvania Regulated segment. In calculating this measure, utility revenues and expenses associated with approved recovery mechanisms, including energy provided as a PLR, are offset with minimal impact on earnings. Costs associated with these mechanisms are recorded in \"Energy purchases,\" \"Other operation and maintenance,\" (which are primarily Act 129, Storm Damage and Universal Service program costs), \"Depreciation\" (which is primarily related to the Act 129 Smart Meter program) and \"Taxes, other than income,\" (which is primarily gross receipts tax) on the Statements of Income. This measure represents the net revenues from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment's electricity delivery operations.\n\nThese measures are not intended to replace \"Operating Income,\" which is determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of overall operating performance. Other companies may use different measures to analyze and report their results of operations. Management believes these measures provide additional useful criteria to make investment decisions. These performance measures are used, in conjunction with other information, by senior management and PPL's Board of Directors to manage operations and analyze actual results compared with budget.\n\n27",

The environmental and gas cost recoveries added to base rates were the result of the transfer of certain ECR and GLT expenses into base rates as a result of the 2020 Kentucky rate case. This transfer results in depreciation and other operation and maintenance expenses associated with the ECR and GLT programs being excluded from margins in the second half of 2021, while the recovery of such costs remain in Kentucky Gross Margins through base rates.\n\n## Pennsylvania Adjusted Gross Margins\n\n## Distribution\n\nDistribution Adjusted Gross Margins increased in 2021 compared with 2020. Higher sales volumes of $13 million were partially offset by $8 million of lower returns on distribution system improvement capital investments.\n\n## Transmission\n\nTransmission Adjusted Gross Margins decreased in 2021 compared with 2020, primarily due to a $28 million decrease as a\n\nresult of a lower PPL zonal peak load billing factor and a $50 million decrease due to a reduction in the transmission formula rate return on equity. Partially offsetting these unfavorable items was $48 million of returns on additional transmission capital investments focused on replacing aging infrastructure and improving reliability and $20 million return of related depreciation expense. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the transmission formula rate return on equity reduction.\n\nReconciliation of Adjusted Gross Margins\n\nThe following tables contain the components from the Statement of Income that are included in the non-GAAP financial\n\nmeasures and a reconciliation to PPL's \"Operating Income\" for the years ended December 31:\n\n28",

The actual amount repurchased will depend on various factors, including PPL's share price, market conditions, and the determination of other uses for the proceeds from the sale of the U.K. utility business, including for incremental capital expenditures. PPL may purchase shares on each trading day subject to market conditions and principles of best execution.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, PPL repurchased 34.8 million shares at a cost of $1.0 billion. Commission fees incurred, which have been included in the cost of repurchases above, were insignificant through December 31, 2021.\n\nSee Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## ATM Program\n\nIn February 2018, PPL entered into an equity distribution agreement, pursuant to which PPL may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $1.0 billion of its common stock through an at-the-market offering program, including a forward sales component. The compensation paid to the selling agents by PPL may be up to 2% of the gross offering proceeds of the shares. There were no issuances under the ATM program for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The ATM program expired in February 2021.\n\n## Forecasted Sources of Cash\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nThe Registrants expect to continue to have adequate liquidity available from operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, credit facilities and commercial paper issuances to meet their requirements with respect to their contractual obligations and anticipated capital expenditures. Additionally, subject to market conditions, the Registrants and their subsidiaries may access the capital markets, and PPL Electric, LG&E and KU anticipate receiving equity contributions from their parent or member in 2022.\n\n## Credit Facilities\n\nThe Registrants maintain credit facilities to enhance liquidity, provide credit support and provide a backstop to commercial paper programs.

For the period 2023 through 2024, PPL currently anticipates capital expenditures of approximately $3.7 to $4.2 billion, with approximately $1.7 to $1.9 billion at PPL Electric Utilities, approximately $0.85 to $0.95 billion each at KU and LG&E (including approximately $73 million at KU and $46 million at LG&E expected to be covered by ECR plans), and the remainder in corporate and other, including investments in renewables, subject to market conditions. These later investments are anticipated to be spread approximately evenly over the two years in the period.\n\nCapital expenditure plans are revised periodically to reflect changes in operational, market and regulatory conditions. The\n\ncapital expenditure plans discussed in this section do not include anticipated capital expenditures with respect to Narragansett Electric. PPL expects to update its capital expenditure plans to include Narragansett Electric upon completion of the acquisition. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the pending Narragansett Electric acquisition.\n\nContractual Obligations\n\nThe Registrants have assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the ordinary course of conducting business.

Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors and\n\nwill depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements and other factors.\n\nSubject to certain exceptions, PPL may not declare or pay any cash dividend or distribution on its capital stock during any period in which PPL Capital Funding defers interest payments on its 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes due 2067.

Certain of the credit facilities of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU include minimum debt covenant ratios that could effectively restrict the payment of dividends or distributions.\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nSee Note 8 to the Financial Statements for these and other restrictions related to distributions on capital interests for the Registrants and their subsidiaries.\n\n## Purchase or Redemption of Debt Securities\n\nThe Registrants will continue to evaluate outstanding debt securities and may decide to purchase or redeem these securities in open market or privately negotiated transactions, in exchange transactions or otherwise, depending upon prevailing market conditions, available cash and other factors, and may be commenced or suspended at any time. The amounts involved may be material.\n\n## Rating Agency Actions\n\nMoody's and S&P periodically review the credit ratings of the debt of the Registrants and their subsidiaries. Based on their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions or ratings affirmations.\n\nA credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues. The credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries are based on information provided by the Registrants and other sources. The ratings of Moody's and S&P are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of the Registrants or their subsidiaries. Such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities.\n\nThe credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries affect their liquidity, access to capital markets and cost of borrowing under their credit facilities. A downgrade in the Registrants' or their subsidiaries' credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. The Registrants and their subsidiaries have no credit rating triggers that would result in the reduction of access to capital markets or the acceleration of maturity dates of outstanding debt.\n\nThe following table sets forth the Registrants' and their subsidiaries' credit ratings for outstanding debt securities or commercial\n\npaper programs as of December 31, 2021.\n\n38",

See Note 18 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of \"Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features,\" including a discussion of the potential additional collateral requirements for PPL and LG&E for derivative contracts in a net liability position at December 31, 2021.\n\n## Guarantees for Subsidiaries (PPL)\n\nPPL guarantees certain consolidated affiliate financing arrangements. Some of the guarantees contain financial and other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict the consolidated affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements, accelerate maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated affiliates' ability to enter into certain transactions. At this time, PPL believes that these covenants will not limit access to relevant funding sources. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information about guarantees.\n\n## Other Contingent Obligations (All Registrants)\n\nThe Registrants have entered into certain agreements that may contingently require payment to a guaranteed or indemnified party. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these agreements.\n\n## Risk Management\n\n## Market Risk\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nSee Notes 1, 17 and 18 to the Financial Statements for information about the Registrants' risk management objectives, valuation techniques and accounting designations.\n\nThe forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future, assuming certain adverse\n\nmarket conditions and model assumptions.

The Registrants maintain credit policies and procedures with respect to counterparty credit (including requirements that counterparties maintain specified credit ratings) and require other assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit risk. However, the Registrants, as applicable, have concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities, financial institutions and energy marketing and trading companies. These concentrations may impact the Registrants' overall exposure to credit risk, positively or negatively, as counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions.\n\n## (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nIn January 2017, the PUC issued a Final Order approving PPL Electric's default service plan for the period June 2017 through May 2021, which included a total of eight semi-annual solicitations for electricity supply. Additionally, on December 17, 2020, the PUC approved PPL Electric's default service plan for the period of June 2021 through May 2025, which includes a total of eight solicitations for electricity supply held semiannually in April and October. The new plan also includes eight solicitations for alternative energy credits held semiannually in January and July with the first solicitation being in July 2021 and the final solicitation being in January 2025.\n\nUnder the standard Supply Master Agreement (the Agreement) for the competitive solicitation process, PPL Electric requires all suppliers to post collateral if their credit exposure exceeds an established credit limit. In the event a supplier defaults on its obligation, PPL Electric would be required to seek replacement power in the market. All incremental costs incurred by PPL Electric would be recoverable from customers in future rates. At December 31, 2021, most of the successful bidders under all of the solicitations had an investment grade credit rating from S&P and were not required to post collateral under the Agreement. A small portion of bidders were required to post an insignificant amount of collateral under the Agreement. There is no instance under the Agreement in which PPL Electric is required to post collateral to its suppliers.\n\nSee Note 18 to the Financial Statements for additional information on credit risk.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation (PPL)\n\nThe value of the British pound sterling fluctuates in relation to the U.S. dollar. In 2021, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of $495 million, which primarily reflected an $856 million increase to PP&E, a $151 million increase to goodwill and a $36 million increase to other net assets, partially offset by a $467 million increase to long-term debt, a $61 million increase to deferred income taxes and a $20 million increase to long-term debt due within one year. In 2020, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of $267 million, which reflected a $433 million increase to PP&E and a $76 million increase to goodwill partially offset by a $214 million increase to long-term debt and a $28 million increase to other net liabilities. In 2019, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of $106 million, which reflected a $181 million increase to PP&E, $34 million increase to goodwill and $12 million decrease to other net liabilities partially offset by a $121 million increase to long-term debt.\n\nAs a result of the sale of the U.K. utility business on June 14, 2021, accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $786\n\nmillion were removed from PPL's Balance Sheets and realized as a component of 'Income (Loss) from Discontinued\n\n42",

See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information on related party transactions for PPL Electric, LG&E and\n\nKU.\n\n## Acquisitions, Development and Divestitures\n\nThe Registrants from time to time evaluate opportunities for potential acquisitions, divestitures, and development projects. Development projects are reexamined based on market conditions and other factors to determine whether to proceed with, modify or terminate the projects. Any resulting transactions may impact future financial results. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the sale of the U.K. utility business and the share purchase agreement to acquire Narragansett Electric.\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\n## Environmental Matters\n\nExtensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to the Registrants' air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, as well as other aspects of the Registrants' businesses. The costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted with certainty but could be significant. In addition, costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws or regulations, or similar rules, are expanded or changed. Costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or other restrictions. Many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the costs for their products or their demand for the Registrants' services. Increased capital and operating costs are expected to be subject to rate recovery. The Registrants can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future environmental or rate proceedings before regulatory authorities.\n\nSee \"Legal Matters\" in Note 14 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the more significant environmental claims. See \"Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures\" in \"Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for information on projected environmental capital expenditures for 2022 through 2024. See Note 20 to the Financial Statements for information related to the impacts of CCRs on AROs. See \"Business - Environmental Matters\" for additional information.\n\nSustainability\n\nIncreasing attention has been focused on a broad range of corporate activities under the heading of 'sustainability', which has\n\nresulted in a significant increase in the number of requests from interested parties for information on sustainability topics. These parties range from investor groups focused on environmental, social, governance and other matters to non-investors concerned with a variety of public policy matters. Often the scope of the information sought is very broad and not necessarily relevant to an issuer's business or industry. As a result, a number of private groups have proposed to standardize the subject matter constituting sustainability, either generally or by industry. Those efforts remain ongoing. In addition, certain of these private groups have advocated that the SEC promulgate regulations requiring specific sustainability reporting under the Securities\n\n43",

With respect to other sustainability topics that PPL deems relevant to investors but that are not required to be reported under applicable securities law and SEC regulation, PPL will continue each spring to publish its annual sustainability report including tracking reductions related to the company's goal to reduce carbon emissions and post that report on its corporate website at www.pplweb.com and on www.pplsustainability.com. Neither the information in such annual sustainability report nor the information at such websites is incorporated in this Form 10-K by reference, and it should not be considered a part of this Form 10-K. In preparing its sustainability report, PPL is guided by the framework established by the Global Reporting Initiative, which identifies environmental, social, governance and other subject matter categories.

The following accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of the reported financial condition or results of operations and require management to make estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the Financial Statements (these accounting policies are also discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements). Senior management has reviewed with PPL's Audit Committee these critical accounting policies, the following disclosures regarding their application, and the estimates and assumptions regarding them.\n\nDefined Benefits\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nCertain of the Registrants and/or their subsidiaries sponsor or participate in certain qualified funded and non-qualified unfunded\n\ndefined benefit pension plans and both funded and unfunded other postretirement benefit plans.

        "page_content": "PPL Services\n\nS\n\nP\n\nLKE\n\nP\n\nP\n\nManagement makes certain assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. As such, annual net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings or regulatory assets and liabilities based on estimated results. Any differences between actual and estimated results are recorded in AOCI or, in the case of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU, regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates. These amounts in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized to income over future periods. The significant assumptions are:\n\n- \u00b7 Discount Rate - In selecting the discount rates for defined benefit plans, the plan sponsors start with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for their plans. The plan-specific cash flows are matched against the coupons and expected maturity values of Aa-rated non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds that could be purchased for a hypothetical settlement portfolio. The plan sponsors then use the single discount rate derived from matching the discounted benefit payment stream to the market value of the selected bond portfolio.\n- \u00b7 Expected Return on Plan Assets - The expected long-term rates of return for pension and other postretirement benefits are based on management's projections using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class. Each plan's specific current and expected asset allocations are also considered in developing a reasonable return assumption.\n- \u00b7 Rate of Compensation Increase - Management projects employees' annual pay increases, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement. In selecting a rate of compensation increase, plan sponsors consider past experience, the potential impact of movements in inflation rates and expectations of ongoing compensation practices.\n\nSee Note 12 to the Financial Statements for details of the assumptions selected for pension and other postretirement benefits. A variance in the assumptions could significantly impact accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities.\n\nThe following tables reflect changes in certain assumptions based on the Registrants' primary defined benefit plans. The inverse of this change would have the opposite impact on accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities. The sensitivities below reflect an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption.\n\nIncrease\n\n| Actuarial assumption           | (Decrease)   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------|\n| Discount Rate                  | (0.25%)      |\n| Expected Return on Plan Assets | (0.25%)      |\n| Rate of Compensation Increase  | 0.25 %       |\n\n45",

On a quarterly basis, uncertain tax positions are reassessed by considering information known as of the reporting date. Based on management's assessment of new information, a tax benefit may subsequently be recognized for a previously unrecognized tax position, a previously recognized tax position may be derecognized, or the benefit of a previously recognized tax position may be remeasured. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.\n\nThe need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also requires significant management judgment. Valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset. Management considers several factors in assessing the expected realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Any tax planning strategy utilized in this assessment must meet the recognition and measurement criteria utilized to account for an uncertain tax position. When evaluating the need for valuation allowances, the uncertainty posed by political risk on such factors is also considered by management. The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.\n\nThe TCJA included new provisions requiring that certain income, referred to as global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI),\n\nearned by certain foreign subsidiaries be included in the gross income of their U.S. shareholder. The FASB allows an accounting policy election regarding the timing of inclusion of GILTI in an entity's financial statements. The election may be either to record deferred taxes for expected GILTI in future periods or record such taxes as a current-period expense when incurred. PPL has elected to record the tax effect of expected GILTI inclusions and thus, records deferred taxes relating to such inclusions. PPL does not expect to generate GILTI income following the disposition of U.K. utilities business.\n\nSee Note 6 to the Financial Statements for income tax disclosures.\n\n46",

        "page_content": "Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nPPL Electric, LG&E and KU are subject to cost-based rate regulation. As a result, the effects of regulatory actions are required to be reflected in the financial statements. Assets and liabilities are recorded that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under GAAP for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in regulated customer rates. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. In certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose.\n\nManagement continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders to the Registrants and other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. Based on this continual assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery. This assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels and is subject to change in the future. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the regulatory asset would be written-off. Additionally, the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of recovery of regulatory assets.\n\nSee Note 7 to the Financial Statements for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities recorded at December 31, 2021 and 2020, as well as additional information on those regulatory assets and liabilities. All regulatory assets are either currently being recovered under specific rate orders, represent amounts that are expected to be recovered in future rates or benefit future periods based upon established regulatory practices.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment\n\n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The reporting units of PPL include the Kentucky Regulated segment reporting unit and the LKE reporting unit. LG&E and KU are individually single operating and reportable segments and each are single reporting units. A goodwill impairment test is performed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the reporting unit may be greater than the reporting unit's fair value. Additionally, goodwill is tested for impairment after a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed of.\n\nThe fair value of a reporting unit is compared with the carrying value and an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit.\n\nPPL, for its Kentucky Regulated segment and LKE reporting units, and individually LG&E and KU may elect either to initially\n\nmake a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill or to bypass the qualitative evaluation and test goodwill for impairment using a quantitative test. See \"Long-Lived and Intangible Assets - Asset Impairment (Excluding Investments)\" in Note 1 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of goodwill impairment tests. See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for information on goodwill balances at December 31, 2021.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, PPL, for its Kentucky Regulated segment and LKE reporting units, and individually, LG&E and\n\nKU, elected to perform qualitative step zero evaluations for their annual goodwill impairment tests, as of October 1, 2021. Based on these evaluations, management concluded it was not \"more likely than not\" that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their carrying values. As such, quantitative impairment tests were not performed.\n\n47",

        "page_content": "(PPL)\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, PPL elected to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test in conjunction with the annual goodwill impairment assessment for the Distributed Energy Resources reporting unit, which has a goodwill balance of $53 million at December 31, 2021. The test did not indicate impairment of the reporting unit. See Note 1 to the Financial Statements\n\nfor additional information.\n\nManagement used both discounted cash flows and market multiples, which required significant assumptions, to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows include discount and growth rates and projected operating and capital cash flows. Projected operating and capital cash flows are based on internal business plans, which assume the occurrence of certain future events. Significant assumptions used in the market multiples include sector market performance and comparable transactions. A high degree of judgment is required to develop estimates related to fair value conclusions. A decrease in the forecasted cash flows of 10%, an increase in the discount rate of 10%, or a 10% decrease in the market multiples would not have resulted in an impairment of goodwill for the Distributed Energy Resources reporting unit as of October 1, 2021, however, it is possible that an impairment charge could occur in future periods if any of the assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting unit are negatively impacted.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations (LG&E and KU)\n\nARO liabilities are required to be recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. Initial obligations are measured at estimated fair value. An ARO must be recognized when incurred if the fair value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated. An equivalent amount is recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and amortized to expense over the asset's useful life.\n\nIn determining AROs, management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value. Fair value is developed using an expected present value technique based on assumptions of market participants that consider estimated retirement costs in current period dollars, inflated to the anticipated retirement date and discounted back to the date the ARO was incurred. Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the fair value of AROs could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements. Estimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the ARO and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the ARO estimate. Any change to the capitalized asset is generally amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset.\n\nSee 'Long-Lived and Intangible Assets - Asset Retirement Obligations' in Note 1, Note 7 and Note 20 to the Financial Statements for additional information on AROs.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the total recorded balances and information on the most significant recorded AROs were as follows.\n\nMost Significant AROs\n\n|      |              | Total Amount   | Total Amount   | Total Amount                                       |\n|------|--------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| LG&E | ARO Recorded | Recorded 66    | %ofTotal 79    | Description Ponds, landfills and natural gas mains |\n| KU   | 84 105       | $ 80           | 76             | Ponds and landfills                                |\n\nThe most significant assumptions surrounding AROs are the forecasted retirement costs (including settlement dates and the\n\ntiming of cash flows), discount and inflation rates. At December 31, 2021, a 10% increase to retirement cost would increase these ARO liabilities by $13 million at LG&E and $23 million at KU. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase these ARO liabilities by $4 million at LG&E and $1 million at KU and a 0.25% increase in the inflation rate would increase these ARO liabilities by $4 million at LG&E. There would be no significant change to the annual depreciation expense of the ARO asset or the annual accretion expense of the ARO liability as a result of these changes in assumptions.\n\n48",

For LG&E and KU, such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of deliveries to customers since the date of the last reading of their meters. The unbilled revenue estimates reflect consideration of factors including daily load models, estimated usage for each customer class, the effect of current and different rate schedules, the meter read schedule, the billing schedule, actual weather data, and, where applicable, the impact of weather normalization or other regulatory provisions of rate structures.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 18, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities - Impact of Rate Regulation on Various Account Balances and Disclosures - Refer to\n\n## Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements\n\nCritical Audit Matter Description\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, PPL Corporation owns and operates three cost-based rate-regulated utilities\n\n50 for which rates are set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC), the Virginia State Corporation Commission (VSCC), and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) to enable the regulated utilities to recover the costs of providing electric or gas services, as applicable, and to provide a reasonable return",

        "page_content": "to shareholders. Base rates are generally established based on a future test period. As a result, the financial statements are subject to the accounting for certain types of regulation as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles and reflect the effects of regulatory actions. Regulatory assets are recognized for the effect of transactions or events where future recovery of underlying costs is probable in regulated customer rates. The effect of such accounting is to defer certain or qualifying costs that would otherwise currently be charged to expense. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. The accounting for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities is based on specific ratemaking decisions or precedent for each transaction or event as prescribed by the FERC, KPSC, VSCC, and PUC. The accounting for the economics of rate-regulation also impacts other financial statement line items, including regulated utility plant, operating revenues, depreciation, and income taxes and impacts multiple note disclosures. As of December 31, 2021, PPL Corporation had a recorded regulatory assets balance of $1,300 million and regulatory liabilities balance of $2,604 million.\n\nPPL Corporation's regulated utilities' rates are subject to cost-based rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. Rates are established based on an analysis of the costs incurred and the regulated utility's capital structure and must be approved by one or more federal or state regulatory commissions, including the FERC, KPSC, VSCC, and PUC. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate earned on invested capital, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The FERC, KPSC, VSCC, and PUC regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and an adequate return on capital investments. Decisions to be made by the FERC, KPSC, VSCC, and PUC in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. While PPL Corporation's utilities have indicated that they expect to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the FERC, KPSC, VSCC, or PUC will not approve full recovery of such costs or approve recovery on a timely basis in future regulatory decisions.\n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management in continually assessing whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors, such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders, and the status of any pending legislation. Auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate-setting process due to its inherent complexities.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the FERC, KPSC, VSCC, and PUC included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the effectiveness of management's internal controls over evaluating the likelihood of recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets. We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the recognition of amounts as regulated utility plant, regulatory assets or liabilities, operating revenues, depreciation, income taxes, and note disclosures.

        "page_content": "REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLICACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the Shareowners and the Board of Directors of PPL Corporation\n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of PPL Corporation and subsidiaries (the 'Company') as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal\n\nControl - Integrated Framework (2013)\n\nissued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, of the Company and our report dated February 18, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\n\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\n\nParsippany, New Jersey\n\nFebruary 18, 2022\n\n53",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nGeneral\n\nCapitalized terms and abbreviations appearing in the combined notes to financial statements are defined in the glossary. Dollars are in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted. The specific Registrant to which disclosures are applicable is identified in parenthetical headings in italics above the applicable disclosure or within the applicable disclosure for each Registrants' related activities and disclosures. Within combined disclosures, amounts are disclosed for any Registrant when significant.\n\n## Business and Consolidation\n\n(PPL)\n\nPPL is a utility holding company that, through its regulated subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in: 1) the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and the distribution and sale of natural gas, primarily in Kentucky; and 2) the transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Pennsylvania. Headquartered in Allentown, PA, PPL's principal subsidiaries are LKE (including its principal subsidiaries, LG&E and KU) and PPL Electric. PPL's corporate level financing subsidiary is PPL Capital Funding.\n\nOn March 17, 2021, PPL WPD Limited entered into a share purchase agreement to sell PPL's U.K. utility business, which substantially represented PPL's U.K. Regulated segment, to a subsidiary of National Grid plc. The sale was completed on June 14, 2021. The results of operations of the U.K. utility business are classified as Discontinued Operations on PPL's Statements of Income. The assets and liabilities of the U.K. utility business as of December 31, 2020 are classified as assets and liabilities held for sale on PPL's Balance Sheets. PPL has elected to separately report the cash flows of continuing and discontinued operations on the Statements of Cash Flows. Unless otherwise noted, the notes to these financial statements exclude amounts related to discontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale for all periods presented. See Note 9 for additional information.\n\nOn July 1, 2021, LKE redeemed, at par, its $250 million 4.375% Senior Notes due 2021 and on July 9, 2021, LKE filed a Form 15 with the SEC to suspend its duty to file reports under sections 13 and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a result, beginning with the June 30, 2021 Form 10-Q, LKE was no longer reported as a Registrant.\n\n## (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nPPL Electric is a cost-based rate-regulated utility subsidiary of PPL. PPL Electric's principal business is the transmission and\n\ndistribution of electricity to serve retail customers in its franchised territory in eastern and central Pennsylvania and the regulated supply of electricity to retail customers in that territory as a PLR.\n\n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nLG&E and KU are engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity. LG&E also engages in the\n\ndistribution and sale of natural gas. LG&E and KU maintain their separate identities and serve customers in Kentucky under their respective names. KU also serves customers in Virginia under the Old Dominion Power name.\n\n61",

        "page_content": "(All Registrants)\n\nThe financial statements of the Registrants include each company's own accounts as well as the accounts of all entities in which the company has a controlling financial interest. Entities for which a controlling financial interest is not demonstrated through voting interests are evaluated based on accounting guidance for Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). The Registrants consolidate a VIE when they are determined to have a controlling interest in the VIE and, as a result, are the primary beneficiary of the entity.\n\nAmounts consolidated under the VIE guidance are not material to the Registrants.\n\nAll significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\n\nThe financial statements of PPL, LG&E and KU include their share of any undivided interests in jointly owned facilities, as well as their share of the related operating costs of those facilities. See Note 13 for additional information.\n\n## Regulation\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nPPL Electric, LG&E and KU are cost-based rate-regulated utilities for which rates are set by regulators to enable PPL Electric, LG&E and KU to recover the costs of providing electric or gas service, as applicable, and to provide a reasonable return to shareholders. Base rates are generally established based on a future test period. As a result, the financial statements are subject to the accounting for certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP and reflect the effects of regulatory actions. Regulatory assets are recognized for the effect of transactions or events where future recovery of underlying costs is probable in regulated customer rates. The effect of such accounting is to defer certain or qualifying costs that would otherwise currently be charged to expense. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. In certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover expected future costs, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose. The accounting for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities is based on specific ratemaking decisions or precedent for each transaction or event as prescribed by the FERC or the applicable state regulatory commissions. See Note 7 for additional details regarding regulatory matters.\n\n## Accounting Records\n\nThe system of accounts for domestic regulated entities is maintained in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts prescribed by the FERC and adopted by the applicable state regulatory commissions.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nLoss Accruals\n\nPotential losses are accrued when (1) information is available that indicates it is \"probable\" that a loss has been incurred, given\n\nthe likelihood of uncertain future events and (2) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting guidance defines \"probable\" as cases in which \"the future event or events are likely to occur.\" The Registrants continuously assess potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, regulatory penalties and other events. Loss accruals for environmental remediation are discounted when appropriate.\n\nThe accrual of contingencies that might result in gains is not recorded, unless realization is assured.\n\n62",

Sharebased payment awards that provide recipients a non-forfeitable right to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered\n\nparticipating securities.\n\nPrice Risk Management\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nInterest rate contracts are used to hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of debt instruments and to hedge exposure to variability in expected cash flows associated with existing floating-rate debt instruments or forecasted fixed-rate issuances of debt. Foreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign currency exposures. Similar derivatives may receive different accounting treatment, depending on management's intended use and documentation.\n\nCertain contracts may not meet the definition of a derivative because they lack a notional amount or a net settlement provision. In cases where there is no net settlement provision, markets are periodically assessed to determine whether market mechanisms have evolved to facilitate net settlement. Certain derivative contracts may be excluded from the requirements of derivative accounting treatment because the NPNS has been elected. These contracts are accounted for using accrual accounting. Contracts that have been classified as derivative contracts are reflected on the balance sheets at fair value. The portion of derivative positions that deliver within a year are included in \"Current Assets\" and \"Current Liabilities,\" while the portion of derivative positions that deliver beyond a year are recorded in \"Other Noncurrent Assets\" and \"Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities.\"\n\nCash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments are included as a component of operating, investing or financing activities on the Statements of Cash Flows, depending on the classification of the hedged items.\n\nPPL and its subsidiaries have elected not to offset net derivative positions against the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) under master netting arrangements.\n\n## (PPL)\n\nProcesses exist that allow for subsequent review and validation of contract information as it relates to interest rate derivatives and foreign currency derivatives. The accounting department provides the treasury department with guidelines on appropriate accounting classifications for various contract types and strategies. Examples of accounting guidelines provided to the treasury department staff include, but are not limited to:\n\n\u00b7\n\nTransactions to lock in an interest rate prior to a debt issuance can be designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent the\n\n\u00b7\n\nCross-currency transactions to hedge interest and principal repayments can be designated as cash flow hedges.\n\n\u00b7\n\nTransactions to hedge fluctuations in the fair value of existing debt can be designated as fair value hedges.\n\n\u00b7\n\nTransactions to hedge the value of a net investment of foreign operations can be designated as net investment hedges.\n\n\u00b7\n\nDerivative transactions that do not qualify for cash flow or net investment hedge treatment are marked to fair value through\n\n- earnings. As such, these transactions reduce earnings volatility due solely to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\n63\n\n- forecasted debt issuances remain probable of occurring.",

These transactions generally include the effect of interest rate swaps that are\n\nincluded in customer rates.\n\n(PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nTo meet its obligation as a PLR to its customers, PPL Electric has entered into certain contracts that meet the definition of a derivative. However, NPNS has been elected for these contracts.\n\nSee Notes 17 and 18 for additional information on derivatives.\n\n## Revenue (All Registrants)\n\nOperating revenues are primarily recorded based on energy deliveries through the end of each calendar month. Unbilled retail revenues result because customers' bills are rendered throughout the month, rather than bills being rendered at the end of the month. For LG&E and KU, unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying an estimate of unbilled kWh or Mcf by the estimated average cents per kWh or Mcf. Any difference between estimated and actual revenues is adjusted the following month when the previous unbilled estimate is reversed and actual billings occur. For PPL Electric, unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying the actual unbilled volumes by the price per tariff.\n\nPPL Electric's, LG&E's and KU's base rates are determined based on cost of service. Some regulators have also authorized the use of additional alternative revenue programs, which enable PPL Electric, LG&E and KU to adjust future rates based on past activities or completed events. Revenues from alternative revenue programs are recognized when the specific events permitting future billings have occurred. Revenues from alternative revenue programs are required to be presented separately from revenues from contracts with customers. These amounts are, however, presented as revenues from contracts with customers, with an offsetting adjustment to alternative revenue program revenue, when they are billed to customers in future periods. See Note 3 for additional information.\n\n## Financing and Other Receivables\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nAccounts receivable are reported on the Balance Sheets at the gross outstanding amount adjusted for an allowance for doubtful accounts. Financing receivables include accounts receivable, with the exception of those items within accounts receivable that are not subject to the credit loss model.\n\nFinancing receivable collectibility is evaluated using a current expected credit loss model, consisting of a combination of\n\nfactors, including past due status based on contractual terms, trends in write-offs and the age of the receivable. Specific events, such as bankruptcies, are also considered when applicable. Adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made when necessary based on the results of analysis, the aging of receivables and historical and industry trends. The Registrants periodically evaluate the impact of observable external factors on the collectibility of the financing receivables to determine if adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts should be made based on current conditions or reasonable and supportable forecasts. Accounts receivable are written off in the period in which the receivable is deemed uncollectible.\n\n64",

Generally, the most significant fair value measurements relate to price risk management assets and liabilities, investments in securities in defined benefit plans, and cash and cash equivalents. PPL and its subsidiaries use, as appropriate, a market approach (generally, data from market transactions), an income approach (generally, present value techniques and option-pricing models) and/or a cost approach (generally, replacement cost) to measure the fair value of an asset or liability. These valuation approaches incorporate inputs such as observable, independent market data and/or unobservable data that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to price an asset or liability. These inputs may incorporate, as applicable, certain risks such as nonperformance risk, which includes credit risk.\n\nThe Registrants classify fair value measurements within one of three levels in the fair value hierarchy. The level assigned to a fair value measurement is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n\n\u00b7\n\nLevel 2\n\n- inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for\n\n\u00b7\n\nLevel 3\n\n- unobservable inputs that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use\n\n- to measure the asset or liability at fair value.\n\nAssessing the significance of a particular input requires judgment that considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

Costs incurred to obtain an initial license and renew or extend terms of licenses are capitalized as intangible assets.\n\nWhen determining the useful life of an intangible asset, including intangible assets that are renewed or extended, PPL and its subsidiaries consider:\n\n- \u00b7 the expected use of the asset;\n- \u00b7 the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life of the intangible asset may relate;\n- \u00b7 legal, regulatory, or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life;\n- \u00b7 the company's historical experience as evidence of its ability to support renewal or extension;\n- \u00b7 the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors; and,\n- \u00b7 the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset.\n\n## Asset Impairment (Excluding Investments)\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nThe Registrants review long-lived assets that are subject to depreciation or amortization, including finite-lived intangibles, for\n\nimpairment when events or circumstances indicate carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\n\nA long-lived asset classified as held and used is impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the\n\nundiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If impaired, the asset's carrying value is written down to its fair value.\n\nA long-lived asset classified as held for sale is impaired when the carrying amount of the asset (disposal group) exceeds its fair\n\nvalue less cost to sell. If impaired, the asset's (disposal group's) carrying value is written down to its fair value less cost to sell.\n\nPPL, LG&E and KU review goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently when events or\n\n68 circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may be greater than the unit's fair value.

        "page_content": "goodwill must be tested for impairment in circumstances when a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be\n\ndisposed. PPL's, LG&E's and KU's reporting units are primarily at the operating segment level.\n\nPPL, for its Kentucky Regulated segment and LKE reporting units, and individually LG&E and KU may elect either to initially make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill or to bypass the qualitative evaluation and test goodwill for impairment using a quantitative test. If the qualitative evaluation (referred to as step zero) is elected and the assessment results in a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is not necessary. However, the quantitative impairment test is required if management concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount based on the step zero assessment. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, PPL, for its Kentucky Regulated segment and LKE reporting units, and individually, LG&E and KU, elected to perform qualitative step zero evaluations for their annual goodwill impairment tests, as of October 1, 2021. Based on these evaluations, management concluded it was not \"more likely than not\" that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their carrying values. As such, quantitative impairment tests were not performed.\n\n(PPL)\n\nDuring the three month-period ended June 30, 2021, Safari Energy determined that the carrying value of its solar panel inventory would not be fully recoverable due to a decrease in the net realizable value of the modules. The decrease was due primarily to the combination of the three following factors: (1) a continued decrease in the fair value of the modules on hand due to more efficient modules being available on the market, (2) the federal government's extension of certain investment tax credits which make modules on the open market eligible for those credits at higher levels of credits and (3) an increase in commodity prices for materials used in various types of solar projects, all of which place pressure on the economics of those projects, making the cost of Safari's solar panels uncompetitive. As a result, Safari Energy recorded a loss of $37 million ($28 million after-tax) in June 2021 to record the solar panels at fair value. The loss was recorded to \"Other operation and maintenance\" expense on the Statement of Income. Solar panel inventories of $32 million are included in \"Other noncurrent assets\" on PPL's Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021.\n\nPPL considered whether the events and circumstances that led to the impairment of Safari Energy's solar panels would more likely than not reduce the fair value of PPL's Distributed Energy Resources reporting unit below its carrying amount. Based on PPL's assessment, a quantitative impairment test was not required as of June 30, 2021.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, PPL elected to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test in conjunction with the annual goodwill impairment assessment for the Distributed Energy Resources reporting unit. The test did not indicate impairment of the reporting unit , however, it is possible that an impairment charge could occur in future periods if any of the assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting unit are negatively impacted.\n\n(\n\nPPL, LG&E and KU\n\n)\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n\nPPL and its subsidiaries record liabilities to reflect various legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets.\n\n69 Initially, this obligation is measured at fair value and offset with an increase in the value of the capitalized asset, which is depreciated over the asset's useful life. Until the obligation is settled, the liability is increased through the recognition of accretion expense classified within \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the Statements of Income to reflect changes in the obligation due to the passage of time. For LG&E and KU, all ARO accretion and depreciation expenses are reclassified as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. ARO regulatory assets associated with certain CCR projects are amortized to expense in accordance with regulatory approvals. For other AROs, deferred accretion and depreciation expense is recovered through cost of removal.",

        "page_content": "Estimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the ARO and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the latest estimate of the ARO. Any change to the capitalized asset, positive or negative, is generally amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset. See\n\nNote 7 and Note 20 for additional information on AROs.\n\nCompensation and Benefits\n\nDefined Benefits\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nCertain PPL subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. An asset or liability is recorded to recognize the funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to AOCI or, for LG&E, KU and PPL Electric, to regulatory assets or liabilities. Consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit plans is fully recognized on the Balance Sheets.\n\nThe expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets, which is calculated by rolling forward the prior year market-related value with contributions, disbursements and long-term expected return on investments. One-fifth of the difference between the actual value and the expected value is added (or subtracted if negative) to the expected value to determine the new market-related value.\n\nPPL uses an accelerated amortization method for the recognition of gains and losses for its defined benefit pension plans. Under the accelerated method, actuarial gains and losses in excess of 30% of the plan's projected benefit obligation are amortized on a straight-line basis over one-half of the required amortization period. Actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the plan's projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets and less than 30% of the plan's projected benefit obligation are amortized on a straight-line basis over the full required amortization period.\n\nSee Note 7 for a discussion of the regulatory treatment of defined benefit costs and Note 12 for a discussion of defined benefits.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nPPL has several stock-based compensation plans for purposes of granting stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units to certain employees as well as stock units and restricted stock units to directors. PPL grants most stockbased awards in the first quarter of each year. PPL and its subsidiaries recognize compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the fair value method. Forfeitures of awards are recognized when they occur. See Note 11 for a discussion of stockbased compensation. All awards are recorded as equity or a liability on the Balance Sheets. Stock-based compensation is primarily included in \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the Statements of Income. Stock-based compensation expense for PPL Electric includes an allocation of PPL Services' expense.\n\nTaxes\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nPPL and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return.\n\nSignificant management judgment is required in developing the Registrants' provision for income taxes, primarily due to the\n\nuncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets.\n\nThe Registrants use a two-step process to evaluate tax positions. The first step requires an entity to determine whether, based on\n\n70 the technical merits supporting a particular tax position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance) that the tax",

        "page_content": "position will be sustained. This determination assumes that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position. The second step requires an entity to recognize in its financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion. The benefit recognized is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of realization upon settlement that exceeds 50%. Unrecognized tax benefits are classified as current to the extent management expects to settle the uncertain tax position by payment or receipt of cash within one year of the reporting date. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements of the Registrants in future\n\nperiods. At December 31, 2021, no significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits were projected over the next 12 months.\n\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net future tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and their basis for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effects of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.\n\nThe Registrants record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not to be realized. The need for valuation allowances requires significant management judgment. If the Registrants determine that they are able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of recorded net deferred tax assets, adjustments to the valuation allowances increase income by reducing tax expense in the period that such determination is made. Likewise, if the Registrants determine that they are not able to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances would decrease income by increasing tax expense in the period that such determination is made. The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future .\n\nThe Registrants defer investment tax credits when the credits are generated and amortize the deferred amounts over the average lives of the related assets.\n\nThe Registrants recognize tax-related interest and penalties in \"Income Taxes\" on their Statements of Income.\n\nThe Registrants use the portfolio approach method of accounting for deferred taxes related to pre-tax OCI transactions. The portfolio approach involves a strict period-by-period cumulative incremental allocation of income taxes to the change in income and losses reflected in OCI. Under this approach, the net cumulative tax effect is ignored. The net change in unrealized gains and losses recorded in AOCI under this approach would be eliminated only on the date the investment portfolio is classified as held for sale or is liquidated.\n\nSee Note 6 to the Financial Statements for income tax disclosures.\n\nThe provision for the Registrants' deferred income taxes related to regulatory assets and liabilities is based upon the ratemaking principles reflected in rates established by relevant regulators. The difference in the provision for deferred income taxes for regulatory assets and liabilities and the amount that otherwise would be recorded under GAAP is deferred and included on the Balance Sheets in noncurrent \"Regulatory assets\" or \"Regulatory liabilities.\"\n\n(PPL Electric, LG&E and KU)\n\nThe income tax provision for PPL Electric, LG&E and KU is calculated in accordance with an intercompany tax sharing\n\nagreement, which provides that taxable income be calculated as if PPL Electric, LG&E, KU and any domestic subsidiaries each filed a separate return. Tax benefits are not shared between companies. The entity that generates a tax benefit is the entity that is entitled to the tax benefit. The effect of PPL filing a consolidated tax return is taken into account in the settlement of current taxes and the recognition of deferred taxes.\n\n71",

PPL's segments are segmented by geographic location.\n\nThe Kentucky Regulated segment consists primarily of LG&E's and KU's regulated electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations, as well as LG&E's regulated distribution and sale of natural gas.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Regulated segment includes the regulated electricity transmission and distribution operations of PPL Electric.\n\n\"Corporate and Other\" primarily includes financing costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments, certain other unallocated costs, as well as the financial results of Safari Energy, which is presented to reconcile segment information to PPL's consolidated results. For the periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, these amounts have been adjusted for certain costs that were previously included in the U.K. Regulated segment.\n\nOn March 17, 2021, PPL WPD Limited entered into a share purchase agreement to sell PPL's U.K. utility business, which substantially represented PPL's U.K. Regulated segment. As a result, PPL determined segment information for the U.K. Regulated segment would no longer be provided beginning with the March 31, 2021 Form 10-Q.

LG&E and KU are individually single operating and reportable segments.\n\n## 3. Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nThe following is a description of the principal activities from which the Registrants and PPL's segments generate their revenues.\n\n## (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\n## Pennsylvania Regulated Segment Revenue\n\nThe Pennsylvania Regulated Segment generates substantially all of its revenues from contracts with customers from PPL Electric's tariff-based distribution and transmission of electricity.\n\n## Distribution Revenue\n\nPPL Electric provides distribution services to residential, commercial, industrial, municipal and governmental end users of energy. PPL Electric satisfies its performance obligation to its distribution customers and revenue is recognized over-time as electricity is delivered and simultaneously consumed by the customer. The amount of revenue recognized is the volume of electricity delivered during the period multiplied by the price per tariff, plus a monthly fixed charge. This method of recognition fairly presents PPL Electric's transfer of electric service to the customer as the calculation is based on actual volumes, and the price per tariff and the monthly fixed charge are set by the PUC. Customers are typically billed monthly and outstanding amounts are normally due within 21 days of the date of the bill.\n\nDistribution customers are \"at will\" customers of PPL Electric with no term contract and no minimum purchase commitment.\n\nPerformance obligations are limited to the service requested and received to date. Accordingly, there is no unsatisfied performance obligation associated with PPL Electric's retail account contracts.\n\n75",

        "page_content": "Transmission Revenue\n\nPPL Electric generates transmission revenues from a FERC-approved PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff. An annual revenue requirement for PPL Electric to provide transmission services is calculated using a formula-based rate. This revenue requirement is converted into a daily rate (dollars per day). PPL Electric satisfies its performance obligation to provide transmission services and revenue is recognized over-time as transmission services are provided and consumed. This method of recognition fairly presents PPL Electric's transfer of transmission services as the daily rate is set by a FERC approved formula-\n\nbased rate. PJM remits payment on a weekly basis.\n\nPPL Electric's agreement to provide transmission services contains no minimum purchase commitment. The performance obligation is limited to the service requested and received to date. Accordingly, PPL Electric has no unsatisfied performance obligations.\n\n## (PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\n## Kentucky Regulated Segment Revenue\n\nThe Kentucky Regulated Segment generates substantially all of its revenues from contracts with customers from LG&E's and KU's regulated tariff-based sales of electricity and LG&E's regulated tariff-based sales of natural gas.\n\nLG&E and KU are engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Kentucky and, in KU's case, Virginia. LG&E also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in Kentucky. Revenue from these activities is generated from tariffs approved by applicable regulatory authorities including the FERC, KPSC and VSCC. LG&E and KU satisfy their performance obligations upon LG&E's and KU's delivery of electricity and LG&E's delivery of natural gas to customers. This revenue is recognized over-time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by LG&E and KU. The amount of revenue recognized is the billed volume of electricity or natural gas delivered multiplied by a tariff rate perunit of energy, plus any applicable fixed charges or additional regulatory mechanisms. Customers are billed monthly and outstanding amounts are typically due within 22 days of the date of the bill. Additionally, unbilled revenues are recognized as a result of customers' bills rendered throughout the month, rather than bills being rendered at the end of the month. Unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying an estimate of unbilled kWh or Mcf delivered but not yet billed by the estimated average cents per kWh or Mcf. Any difference between estimated and actual revenues is adjusted the following month when the previous unbilled estimate is reversed and actual billings occur. This method of recognition fairly presents LG&E's and KU's transfer of electricity and LG&E's transfer of natural gas to the customer as the amount recognized is based on actual and estimated volumes delivered and the tariff rate per-unit of energy and any applicable fixed charges or regulatory mechanisms as set by the respective regulatory body.\n\nLG&E's and KU's customers generally have no minimum purchase commitment. Performance obligations are limited to the service requested and received to date. Accordingly, there is no unsatisfied performance obligation associated with these customers.\n\n76",

Earnings Per Share\n\n(PPL)\n\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing income available to PPL common shareowners by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing income available to PPL common shareowners by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, increased by incremental shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive non-participating securities were converted to common shares as calculated using the Treasury Stock Method. Incremental non-participating securities that have a dilutive impact are detailed in the table below. These securities also included the remaining shares of PPL common stock forward sale agreements, which were settled in 2019. The forward sale agreements were dilutive under the Treasury Stock Method to the extent the average stock price of PPL's common shares exceeded the forward sale price prescribed in the agreements.\n\n80",

The primary component of such outside basis differences is ordinarily accumulated unremitted earnings. In anticipation of the WPD sale, indefinite reinvestment of accumulated unremitted earnings of WPD was no longer relevant and, in the first quarter of 2021, PPL recorded a deferred tax liability reflecting the expected tax cost associated with the realization of the outside book-tax basis difference in the investment in WPD. In the second quarter of 2021, following completion of the WPD sale, that deferred tax was recorded to current tax expense.\n\nDetails of the components of income tax expense, a reconciliation of federal income taxes derived from statutory tax rates applied to \"Income Before Income Taxes\" to income taxes for reporting purposes, and details of \"Taxes, other than income\" were as follows:\n\n|                                                                                             | 2021    | 2020      | 2019      |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------|-----------|\n| Income Tax Expense (Benefit)                                                                |         |           |           |\n| Current - Federal                                                                           | $ (1) $ | (8) $ 24  | (10)      |\n| Current - State                                                                             | 36      |           | 19        |\n| Current - Foreign                                                                           | (1)     | (2)       | -         |\n| Total Current Expense (Benefit)                                                             | 34      | 14        | 9         |\n| Deferred - Federal                                                                          | 28      | 135 94    | 141       |\n| Deferred - State                                                                            | 105     |           | 76        |\n| Deferred - Foreign (a)                                                                      | 383     | 101       | (14)      |\n| Total Deferred Expense (Benefit), excluding operating loss carryforwards                    | 516     | 330       | 203       |\n| Amortization of investment tax credit Tax expense (benefit) of operating loss carryforwards | (3)     | (3)       | (3)       |\n| Deferred - Federal                                                                          | 12      | 6         | 7         |\n| Deferred - State                                                                            | (56)    |           |           |\n| Total Tax Expense (Benefit) of Operating Loss Carryforwards                                 | (44)    | (33) (27) | (33) (26) |\n| Total income tax expense (benefit)                                                          | 503 $   | $         |           |\n|                                                                                             | $       | 314       | 183       |\n| Total income tax expense (benefit) - State                                                  | 85      | 85        | 62        |\n| Total income tax expense (benefit) - Foreign                                                | 382     | 99        | (14)      |\n| Total income tax expense (benefit)                                                          | $ 503 $ | 314 $     | 183       |\n\n(a)\n\nIn 2021, the U.K. Finance Act 2021 increased the U.K. corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023.

Utility Rate Regulation\n\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nPPL, PPL Electric, LG&E and KU reflect the effects of regulatory actions in the financial statements for their cost-based rateregulated utility operations. Regulatory assets and liabilities are classified as current if, upon initial recognition, the entire\n\namount related to an item will be recovered or refunded within a year of the balance sheet date.\n\n## (PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nLG&E is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC and FERC, and KU is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC, FERC and VSCC.\n\nLG&E's and KU's Kentucky base rates are calculated based on recovery of costs as well as a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including adjustments for certain net investments and costs recovered separately through other means. As such, LG&E and KU generally earn a return on regulatory assets.\n\n## (PPL and KU)\n\nKU's Virginia base rates are calculated based on recovery of costs as well as a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less accumulated deferred income taxes and miscellaneous deductions). As all regulatory assets and liabilities, except for regulatory assets and liabilities related to the levelized fuel factor, accumulated deferred income taxes, pension and postretirement benefits, and AROs related to certain CCR impoundments, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of Virginia base rates, no return is earned on the related assets.\n\nKU's rates to municipal customers for wholesale power requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a formula rate that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less accumulated deferred income taxes and miscellaneous deductions). As all regulatory assets and liabilities, except accumulated deferred income taxes, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates, no return is earned on the related assets.\n\n## (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nPPL Electric's distribution base rates are calculated based on recovery of costs as well as a return on distribution rate base (net utility plant plus a working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions). PPL Electric's transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a FERC tariff that allows for recovery of transmission costs incurred, a return on transmission-related rate base (net utility plant plus a working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions) and an automatic annual update. See \"Transmission Formula Rate\" below for additional information on this tariff. All regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from distribution and transmission return on investment calculations; therefore, generally no return is earned on PPL Electric's regulatory assets.\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nThe following table provides information about the regulatory assets and liabilities of cost-based rate-regulated utility\n\noperations at December 31:\n\n89",

Specific developments with respect to certain of these regulatory assets and liabilities are discussed in \"Regulatory Matters.\"\n\nDefined Benefit Plans\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nDefined benefit plan regulatory assets and liabilities represent prior service cost and net actuarial gains and losses that will be\n\nrecovered in defined benefit plans expense through future base rates based upon established regulatory practices and, generally, are amortized over the average remaining service lives of plan participants. These regulatory assets and liabilities are adjusted at least annually or whenever the funded status of defined benefit plans is remeasured.\n\n91",

        "page_content": "(PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nAs a result of previous rate case settlements and orders, the difference between pension cost calculated in accordance with LG&E's and KU's pension accounting policy and pension cost calculated using a 15-year amortization period for actuarial gains and losses and settlements are recorded as a regulatory asset. As of December 31, 2021, the balances were $98 million for PPL, $54 million for LG&E and $44 million for KU. As of December 31, 2020, the balances were $79 million for PPL, $44 million\n\nfor LG&E and $35 million for KU.\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nStorm Costs\n\nPPL Electric, LG&E and KU have the ability to request from the PUC, KPSC and VSCC, as applicable, the authority to treat expenses related to specific extraordinary storms as a regulatory asset and defer such costs for regulatory accounting and reporting purposes. Once such authority is granted, LG&E and KU can request recovery of those expenses in a base rate case and begin amortizing the costs when recovery starts. PPL Electric can recover qualifying expenses caused by major storm events, as defined in its retail tariff, over three years through the Storm Damage Expense Rider commencing in the application year after the storm occurred. Storm costs incurred in PPL Electric's territory from a March 2018 storm were amortized through 2021. LG&E's and KU's regulatory assets for storm costs are being amortized through various dates ending in 2031.\n\n## Unamortized Loss on Debt\n\nUnamortized loss on reacquired debt represents losses on long-term debt refinanced, reacquired or redeemed that have been deferred and will be amortized and recovered over either the original life of the extinguished debt or the life of the replacement debt (in the case of refinancing). Such costs are being amortized through 2029 for PPL Electric, through 2042 for KU, and through 2044 for LG&E.\n\n## Accumulated Cost of Removal of Utility Plant\n\nLG&E and KU charge costs of removal through depreciation expense with an offsetting credit to a regulatory liability. The regulatory liability is relieved as costs are incurred.\n\nPPL Electric does not accrue for costs of removal. When costs of removal are incurred, PPL Electric records the costs as a regulatory asset. Such deferral is included in rates and amortized over the subsequent five-year period.\n\n## Net Deferred Taxes\n\nRegulatory liabilities associated with net deferred taxes represent the future revenue impact from the adjustment of deferred income taxes required primarily for excess deferred taxes and unamortized investment tax credits, largely a result of the TCJA enacted in 2017.\n\n(PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nGeneration Supply Charge (GSC)\n\nThe GSC is a cost recovery mechanism that permits PPL Electric to recover costs incurred to provide generation supply to PLR\n\ncustomers who receive basic generation supply service. The recovery includes charges for generation supply, as well as administration of the acquisition process. In addition, the GSC contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from prior periods is refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent rate filing period.\n\n92",

        "page_content": "Transmission Service Charge (TSC)\n\nPPL Electric is charged by PJM for transmission service-related costs applicable to its PLR customers. PPL Electric passes these costs on to customers, who receive basic generation supply service through the PUC-approved TSC cost recovery mechanism. The TSC contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from customers is either\n\nrefunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent year.\n\nTransmission Formula Rate\n\nPPL Electric's transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a FERC-approved Open Access Transmission Tariff that utilizes a formula-based rate recovery mechanism. Under this formula, rates are put into effect in June of each year based upon prior year actual expenditures and current year forecasted capital additions. Rates are then adjusted the following year to reflect actual annual expenses and capital additions, as reported in PPL Electric's annual FERC Form 1, filed under the FERC's Uniform System of Accounts. Any difference between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual expenditures incurred for that year is recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability.\n\n## Storm Damage Expense Rider (SDER)\n\nThe SDER is a reconcilable automatic adjustment clause under which PPL Electric annually will compare actual storm costs to storm costs allowed in base rates and refund or recover any differences from customers. In the 2015 rate case settlement approved by the PUC in November 2015, it was determined that reportable storm damage expenses to be recovered annually through base rates will be set at $20 million. The SDER will recover from or refund to customers the applicable expenses from reportable storms as compared to the $20 million recovered annually through base rates.\n\n## Act 129 Compliance Rider\n\nIn compliance with Pennsylvania's Act 129 of 2008 and implementing regulations, PPL Electric is currently in Phase IV of the energy efficiency and conservation plan which was approved in March 2021. Phase IV allows PPL Electric to recover the maximum $313 million over the five-year period, June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2026. The plan includes programs intended to reduce electricity consumption. The recoverable costs include direct and indirect charges, including design and development costs, general and administrative costs and applicable state evaluator costs. The rates are applied to customers who receive distribution service through the Act 129 Compliance Rider. The actual Phase IV program costs are reconcilable after each 12 month period, and any over- or under-recovery from customers will be refunded or recovered over the next rate filing period. PPL Electric's Act 129 Phase III plan ended May 31, 2021 and any over-or under-recovery from customers related to Phase III will be refunded or recovered over the next rate filing period.\n\n## Smart Meter Rider (SMR)\n\nAct 129 requires each electric distribution company (EDC) with more than 100,000 customers to have a PUC approved Smart Meter Technology Procurement and Installation Plan (SMP). As of December 31, 2019, PPL Electric replaced substantially all of its old meters with meters that meet the Act 129 requirements under its SMP. In accordance with Act 129, EDCs are able to recover the costs and earn a return on capital of providing smart metering technology. PPL Electric uses the SMR to recover the costs to implement its SMP. The SMR is a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from prior years is refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent quarters.\n\nUniversal Service Rider (USR)\n\nThe USR provides for recovery of costs associated with universal service programs, OnTrack and Winter Relief Assistance\n\nProgram (WRAP), provided by PPL Electric to residential customers. OnTrack is a special payment program for low-income households and WRAP provides low-income customers a means to reduce electric bills through energy saving methods. The\n\n93",

        "page_content": "USR rate is applied to residential customers who receive distribution service. The actual program costs are reconcilable, and\n\nany over- or under-recovery from customers will be refunded or recovered annually in the subsequent year.\n\nTCJA Customer Refund\n\nAs a result of the reduced U.S federal corporate income tax rate as enacted by the TCJA, the PUC ruled that these tax benefits should be refunded to customers. Timing differences between the recognition of these tax benefits and the refund of the benefit to the customer creates a regulatory liability. PPL Electric's liability is being credited back to distribution customers through a temporary negative surcharge and remains in place until PPL Electric files and the PUC approves new base rates. The TCJA is\n\nreconcilable, and any over- or under-recovery from customers will be refunded or recovered annually in the subsequent year.\n\n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\n## Environmental Cost Recovery\n\nKentucky law permits LG&E and KU to recover the costs, including a return of operating expenses and a return of and on capital invested, of complying with the Clean Air Act and those federal, state or local environmental requirements, which apply to coal combustion wastes and by-products from coal-fired electricity generating facilities. The KPSC requires reviews of the past operations of the environmental surcharge for six-month and two-year billing periods to evaluate the related charges, credits and rates of return, as well as to provide for the roll-in of ECR amounts to base rates each two-year period. The KPSC has authorized return on equity of 9.35% for existing approved ECR projects. The ECR regulatory asset or liability represents the amount that has been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and is typically recovered or refunded within 12 months.\n\n## Fuel Adjustment Clauses\n\nLG&E's and KU's retail electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause, whereby variances in power purchases and the cost of fuel to generate electricity, including transportation costs, from the costs embedded in base rates are adjusted in LG&E's and KU's rates. The KPSC requires formal reviews at six-month intervals to examine past fuel adjustments and at two-year intervals to review past operations of the fuel adjustment clause and, to the extent appropriate, may conduct public hearings and reestablish the fuel charge included in base rates. The regulatory assets or liabilities represent the amounts that have been underor over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and are typically recovered within 12 months.\n\nKU also employs a levelized fuel factor mechanism for Virginia customers using an average fuel cost factor based primarily on projected fuel costs and load for the fuel year (12 months ending March 31). The Virginia levelized fuel factor allows fuel recovery based on projected fuel costs for the fuel year plus an adjustment for any under- or over-recovery of fuel expenses from the prior fuel year. The regulatory assets or liabilities represent the amounts that have been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and are typically recovered or refunded within 12 months.\n\n## Economic Relief Billing Credit\n\nThe Economic Relief Billing Credit represents regulatory liabilities to be returned to customers through June 30, 2022, as\n\nagreed to in the Kentucky rate case in recognition of the economic impact of COVID-19. See \"Regulatory Matters - Kentucky Activities - Rate Case Proceedings\" below for additional information .\n\nAROs\n\nAs discussed in Note 1, for LG&E and KU, all ARO accretion and depreciation expenses are reclassified as a regulatory asset\n\nor regulatory liability. ARO regulatory assets associated with certain CCR projects are amortized to expense in accordance with regulatory approvals. For other AROs, deferred accretion and depreciation expense is recovered through cost of removal.\n\n94",

        "page_content": "Power Purchase Agreement - OVEC\n\nAs a result of purchase accounting associated with PPL's acquisition of LG&E and KU, the fair values of the OVEC power purchase agreement were recorded on the balance sheets of LG&E and KU with offsets to regulatory liabilities. The regulatory liabilities are being amortized using the units-of-production method until March 2026, the expiration date of the agreement at the date of the acquisition. LG&E's and KU's customer rates continue to reflect the original contracts. See Notes 14 and 19 for\n\nadditional discussion of the power purchase agreement.\n\nInterest Rate Swaps\n\nLG&E's unrealized gains and losses are recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities until they are realized as interest expense. Interest expense from existing swaps is realized and recovered over the terms of the associated debt, which matures in\n\n2033.\n\n## Terminated Interest Rate Swaps\n\nNet realized gains and losses on all interest rate swaps are recovered through regulated rates. As such, any gains and losses on these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or liabilities and are primarily recognized in \"Interest Expense\" on the Statements of Income over the life of the associated debt.\n\n## Plant Outage Costs\n\nFrom July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2021, plant outage costs in Kentucky were normalized for ratemaking purposes based on an average level of expenses. Plant outage expenses that were greater or less than the average will be collected from or returned to customers, through future base rates. Effective July 1, 2021 under-recovered plant outage costs are being amortized through 2029 for LG&E and KU.\n\n## Gas Supply Clause (PPL and LG&E)\n\nLG&E's natural gas rates contain a gas supply clause, whereby the expected cost of natural gas supply and variances between actual and expected costs and customer usage from prior periods are adjusted quarterly in LG&E's rates, subject to approval by the KPSC. The gas supply clause also includes a separate natural gas procurement incentive mechanism, which allows LG&E's rates to be adjusted annually to share savings between the actual cost of gas purchases and market indices, with the shareholders and the customers during each performance-based rate year (12 months ending October 31). The regulatory assets or liabilities represent the total amounts that have been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanisms and are typically recovered or refunded within 18 months.\n\n## Regulatory Matters\n\nKentucky Activities\n\n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nRate Case Proceedings\n\nOn November 25, 2020, LG&E and KU filed requests with the KPSC for an increase in annual electricity and gas revenues of\n\napproximately $331 million ($131 million and $170 million in electricity revenues at LG&E and KU and $30 million in gas revenues at LG&E). The revenue increases represented an increase of 11.6% and 10.4% in electricity revenues at LG&E and KU, and an increase of 8.3% in gas revenues at LG&E. In recognition of the economic impact of COVID-19, LG&E and KU requested approval of a one-year billing credit which will credit customers approximately $53 million ($41 million at LG&E and $12 million at KU). The billing credit represents the return to customers of certain regulatory liabilities on LG&E's and KU's Balance Sheets and serves to partially mitigate the rate increases during the first year in which the new rates are in effect.\n\n95",

        "page_content": "LG&E's and KU's applications also included a request for a CPCN to deploy Advanced Metering Infrastructure across LG&E's\n\nand KU's service territories in Kentucky.\n\nThe applications were based on a forecasted test year of July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022 and requested an authorized return\n\non equity of 10.0%.\n\nOnApril 19, 2021, LG&E and KU entered into an agreement with all intervening parties to the proceedings resolving all\n\nmatters in their applications, with the explicit exception of LG&E's and KU's net metering proposals.\n\nOn June 30, 2021 and December 6, 2021, the KPSC issued orders approving the proposed agreement filed in April 2021, with certain modifications. The orders provided for increases in annual revenues of $207 million ($74 million and $110 million in electricity revenues at LG&E and KU and $23 million in gas revenues at LG&E) based on an authorized return on equity of 9.425%. The orders grant an authorized 9.35% return on equity for the ECR and GLT mechanisms and do not modify the requested one-year billing credit. The orders approved the CPCN to deploy Advanced Metering Infrastructure and provide regulatory asset treatment for the remaining net book value of legacy meters upon full implementation of the Advanced Metering Infrastructure program. The orders also approved the establishment of a Retired Asset Recovery (RAR) rider to provide for recovery of and return on the remaining investment in certain electric generating units upon their retirement over a ten-year period following retirement. In respect of the RAR rider, LG&E and KU continue to use currently approved depreciation rates for Mill Creek Units 1 and 2 and Brown Unit 3. The orders also approved a four-year \"stay out\" commitment from LG&E and KU to refrain from effective base rate increases before July 1, 2025, subject to certain exceptions. On September 24, 2021, the KPSC issued orders providing adjustments to previous net metering proposals. These adjustments did not impact the annual revenue increases.\n\n## Pennsylvania Activities (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\n## Act 129\n\nAct 129 requires Pennsylvania Electric Distribution Companies (EDCs) to meet, by specified dates, specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand. EDCs not meeting the requirements of Act 129 are subject to significant penalties. PPL Electric filed with the PUC its Act 129 Phase IV Energy Efficiency and Conservation Plan on November 30, 2020, for the five-year period starting June 1, 2021 and ending on May 31, 2026. PPL Electric's Phase IV Act 129 Plan was approved by the PUC at its March 25, 2021, public meeting.\n\nAct 129 also requires EDCs to act as a default service provider (DSP), which provides electricity generation supply service to customers pursuant to a PUC-approved default service procurement plan. A DSP is able to recover the costs associated with its default service procurement plan.\n\n## Federal Matters\n\nPPL Electric Transmission Formula Rate Return on Equity\n\n(PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nOn May 21, 2020, PP&L Industrial Customer Alliance (PPLICA) filed a complaint with the FERC alleging that PPL Electric's\n\nbase return on equity (ROE) of 11.18% used to determine PPL Electric's formula transmission rate was unjust and unreasonable.\n\nOnAugust 20, 2021, PPL Electric entered into a settlement agreement (the Settlement) with PPLICA and all other parties,\n\nincluding intervenors, with respect to the complaint filed by PPLICA on May 21, 2020.\n\nThe key aspects of the Settlement include:\n\n## \u00b7 changes to PPL Electric's base ROE:\n\n- \u00b7\n\nbeginning as of May 21, 2020 and continuing through May 31, 2022, the ROE shall be 9.90%;\n\n- 96",

The reduction recorded includes $28 million ($20 million after-tax) related to the period from May 21, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The $73 million of revenue to be refunded will be returned to customers from January 1, 2022 through May 31, 2022 and is based on the difference between charges that were calculated using the ROE in effect at the time and charges calculated using the revised ROE provided for the Settlement, plus interest at the FERC interest rate.\n\nThe FERC approved the Settlement on November 5, 2021. Interim rates reflecting the agreed-to-base ROE in the Settlement were effective December 1, 2021.\n\n## (PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\n## FERC Transmission Rate Filing\n\nIn 2018, LG&E and KU applied to the FERC requesting elimination of certain on-going credits to a sub-set of transmission customers relating to the 1998 merger of LG&E's and KU's parent entities and the 2006 withdrawal of LG&E and KU from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO), a regional transmission operator and energy market. The application sought termination of LG&E's and KU's commitment to provide certain Kentucky municipalities mitigation for certain horizontal market power concerns arising out of the 1998 LG&E and KU merger and 2006 MISO withdrawal. The amounts at issue are generally waivers or credits granted to a limited number of Kentucky municipalities for either certain LG&E and KU or MISO transmission charges incurred for transmission service received. In 2019, the FERC granted LG&E's and KU's request to remove the ongoing credits, conditioned upon the implementation by LG&E and KU of a transition mechanism for certain existing power supply arrangements, which was subsequently filed, modified, and approved by the FERC in 2020 and 2021. In 2020, LG&E and KU and other parties filed appeals with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals regarding FERC's orders on the elimination of the mitigation and required transition mechanism. Oral arguments in the appellate proceeding occurred on February 14, 2022. LG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of the respective appellate and FERC proceedings. LG&E and KU currently receive recovery of the waivers and credits provided through other rate mechanisms and such rate recovery would be anticipated to be adjusted consistent with potential changes or terminations of the waivers and credits, as such become effective.\n\nOther\n\n## Purchase of Receivables Program\n\n(PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nIn accordance with a PUC-approved purchase of accounts receivable program, PPL Electric purchases certain accounts\n\nreceivable from alternative electricity suppliers at a discount, which reflects a provision for uncollectible accounts. The alternative electricity suppliers have no continuing involvement or interest in the purchased accounts receivable. Accounts receivable that are acquired are initially recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, PPL Electric purchased $1.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of accounts receivable from alternative suppliers.\n\n97",

Accordingly, creditors of these subsidiaries may not satisfy their debts from the assets of PPL Electric (or its other subsidiaries) absent a specific contractual undertaking by PPL Electric or any such other subsidiary to pay such creditors or as required by applicable law or regulation.\n\n(PPL)\n\n## Equity Securities\n\n## Share Repurchases\n\nIn August 2021, PPL's Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of up to $3 billion of PPL common shares. The actual amount repurchased will depend on various factors, including PPL's share price, market conditions, and the determination of other uses for the proceeds from the sale of the U.K. utility business, including for incremental capital expenditures. PPL may purchase shares on each trading day subject to market conditions and principles of best execution.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, PPL repurchased 34.8 million shares at a cost of $1.0 billion. Commission fees incurred, which have been included in the cost of repurchases above, were insignificant through December 31, 2021.\n\n## ATM Program\n\nIn February 2018, PPL entered into an equity distribution agreement, pursuant to which PPL may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $1.0 billion of its common stock through an at-the-market offering program, including a forward sales component. The compensation paid to the selling agents by PPL may be up to 2% of the gross offering proceeds of the shares. There were no issuances under the ATM program for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The ATM program expired in February 2021.\n\n## Distributions and Related Restrictions\n\nIn November 2021, PPL declared its quarterly common stock dividend, payable January 3, 2022, at 41.50 cents per share (equivalent to $1.66 per annum). On February 18, 2022, PPL announced a quarterly common stock dividend of 20.00 cents per share, payable April 1, 2022, to shareowners of record as of March 10, 2022. Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements and other factors.\n\nNeither PPL Capital Funding nor PPL may declare or pay any cash dividend or distribution on its capital stock during any\n\nperiod in which PPL Capital Funding defers interest payments on its 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes due 2067. At December 31, 2021, no interest payments were deferred.\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nPPL relies on dividends or loans from its subsidiaries to fund PPL's dividends to its common shareholders. The net assets of\n\n103 certain PPL subsidiaries are subject to legal restrictions. LG&E, KU and PPL Electric are subject to Section 305(a) of the Federal Power Act, which makes it unlawful for a public utility to make or pay a dividend from any funds \"properly included in capital account.\" The meaning of this limitation has never been clarified under the Federal Power Act.

        "page_content": "Electric believe, however, that this statutory restriction, as applied to their circumstances, would not be construed or applied by the FERC to prohibit the payment from retained earnings of dividends that are not excessive and are for lawful and legitimate business purposes. In February 2012, LG&E and KU petitioned the FERC requesting authorization to pay dividends in the future based on retained earnings balances calculated without giving effect to the impact of purchase accounting adjustments for PPL's 2010 acquisition of LG&E and KU. In May 2012, the FERC approved the petitions with the further condition that each utility may not pay dividends if such payment would cause its adjusted equity ratio to fall below 30% of total capitalization. Accordingly, at December 31, 2021, net assets of $1.4 billion for LG&E and $1.9 billion for KU were restricted for purposes of paying dividends to LKE, and net assets of $1.7 billion for LG&E and $2.0 billion for KU were available for payment of dividends to LKE. LG&E and KU believe they will not be required to change their current dividend practices as a result of the foregoing requirement. In addition, under Virginia law, KU is prohibited from making loans to affiliates without the prior approval of the VSCC. There are no comparable statutes under Kentucky law applicable to LG&E and KU, or under Pennsylvania law applicable to PPL Electric. However, orders from the KPSC require LG&E and KU to obtain prior consent or approval before lending amounts to PPL.\n\n## 9. Acquisitions, Development and Divestitures\n\n(PPL)\n\n## Discontinued Operations\n\n## Sale of the U.K. Utility Business\n\nOn March 17, 2021, PPL WPD Limited (WPD Limited) entered into a share purchase agreement (WPD SPA) to sell PPL's U.K. utility business to National Grid Holdings One plc (National Grid U.K.), a subsidiary of National Grid plc. Pursuant to the WPD SPA, National Grid U.K. would acquire 100% of the issued share capital of PPL WPD Investments Limited (WPD Investments) for \u00a37.8 billion in cash. WPD Limited would also receive an additional amount of \u00a3548,000 for each day during the period from January 1, 2021 to the closing date if the dividends usually declared by WPD Investments to WPD Limited were not paid for that period.\n\nOn June 14, 2021, the sale of the U.K. utility business was completed. The transaction resulted in cash proceeds of $10.7 billion inclusive of foreign currency hedges executed by PPL. PPL received net proceeds, after taxes and fees, of $10.4 billion.\n\nWPD Limited and National Grid U.K. each made customary representations and warranties in the WPD SPA. National Grid U.K., at its expense, purchased warranty and indemnity insurance. WPD Limited agreed to indemnify National Grid U.K. for certain tax related matters. See Note 14 for additional information. PPL has not had and will not have any significant involvement with the U.K. utility business after completion of the sale.\n\n## Loss on Sale\n\nThe following table summarizes the pre-tax loss recorded upon completion of the sale.\n\nLoss on sale\n\n| Sales proceeds, net of realized foreign currency hedge losses (a)   | for the year ended December 31, 2021 $ 10,732   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Unrealized foreign currency hedge losses recognized in 2020         | 125                                             |\n| Less: Costs to sell (b)                                             | 69                                              |\n| Less: Carrying value (c)                                            | 12,397                                          |\n| Loss on sale                                                        | $ (1,609)                                       |\n\n(a)\n\nIncludes the fixed and additional consideration of \u00a37,881 million specified in the WPD SPA, converted at a spot rate of $1.4107 per GBP, offset by",

        "page_content": "Acquisitions\n\nShare Purchase Agreement to Acquire Narragansett Electric\n\nOn March 17, 2021, PPL and its subsidiary, PPL Energy Holdings, entered into a share purchase agreement (Narragansett SPA) with National Grid USA (National Grid U.S.), a subsidiary of National Grid plc, to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Narragansett Electric for approximately $3.8 billion in cash. On May 3, 2021, an Assignment and Assumption Agreement was entered into by PPL, PPL Energy Holdings, PPL Rhode Island Holdings and National Grid U.S. whereby certain interests of PPL Energy Holdings in the Narragansett SPA were assigned to and assumed by PPL Rhode Island Holdings. Pursuant to that Assignment and Assumption Agreement, PPL Rhode Island Holdings became the purchasing entity under the Narragansett SPA. The acquisition is expected to be funded with proceeds from the sale of the U.K. utility business. PPL has agreed to guarantee all obligations of PPL Energy Holdings and PPL Rhode Island Holdings under the Narragansett SPA and the related Assignment and Assumption Agreement.\n\nThe closing of the acquisition is subject to the receipt of certain U.S. regulatory approvals or waivers, including, among others, authorizations or waivers from the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and the FERC, as well as review under the Hart-ScottRodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other customary conditions to closing, including the execution and delivery of certain related transaction documents. The waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, with respect to the acquisition, expired on June 2, 2021. On July 14, 2021, the FCC consented to the Transfer of Control Application for the transfer of control of certain communications licenses held by Narragansett Electric from National Grid U.S. to PPL. On July 16, 2021, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (MDPU) granted a waiver of jurisdiction with respect to the acquisition, finding that the acquisition would not adversely impact Massachusetts ratepayers. On December 3, 2021, the MPDU denied the request by the Attorney General of Massachusetts (AG) to stay the order granting the waiver, and on December 31, 2021, the AG then moved for the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) to stay the final MDPU order. That request remains pending. If a stay is issued, PPL would not be able to close the acquisition until any stay is lifted or the appeal is resolved. On September 23, 2021, the FERC issued an order authorizing, as consistent with the public interest, the disposition of jurisdictional facilities that will result in PPL Rhode Island Holdings, LLC, acquiring 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Narragansett Electric. The regulatory approvals remain subject to any applicable appeal periods. PPL anticipates receiving a final order from the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers with respect to the acquisition by March 2022, however, no assurance can be given as to ultimate outcome of that review or the timing of any final decision.\n\nPPL Energy Holdings and PPL Rhode Island Holdings and National Grid U.S. have each made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Narragansett SPA, including, among others, customary indemnification provisions and covenants by National Grid U.S. to conduct the Narragansett Electric business in the ordinary course between the execution of the Narragansett SPA and the closing of the acquisition. The consummation of the transaction is not subject to a financing condition.\n\nIn connection with the acquisition, National Grid U.S. and one or more of its subsidiaries and Narragansett Electric will enter\n\ninto a transition services agreement, pursuant to which National Grid U.S. and/or one or more of its affiliates will agree to provide certain transition services to Narragansett Electric and its affiliates to facilitate the operation of Narragansett Electric following the consummation of the acquisition and the transition of operations to PPL, as agreed upon in the Narragansett SPA.\n\n10.

Renewal options are included in the lease term if it is reasonably certain the Registrants will exercise those options. Periods for which the Registrants are reasonably certain not to exercise termination options are also included in the lease term. The Registrants have certain agreements with lease and non-lease components, such as office space leases, which\n\nare generally accounted for separately.\n\nLG&E and KU have entered into various operating leases primarily for office space, vehicles and railcars. The leases generally have fixed payments with expiration dates ranging from 2022 to 2033, some of which have options to extend the leases from\n\none year to ten years and some have options to terminate at LG&E's and KU's discretion.\n\nPPL has also entered into various operating leases primarily for office and warehouse space. These leases generally have fixed payments with expiration dates ranging from 2024 through 2030.\n\nPPL Electric also has operating leases which do not have a significant impact to its operations.\n\n## Short-term Leases\n\nShort-term leases are leases with a term that is 12 months or less and do not include a purchase option or option to extend the initial term of the lease to greater than 12 months that the Registrants are reasonably certain to exercise. The Registrants have made an accounting policy election to not recognize the right-of-use asset and the lease liability arising from leases classified as short-term. Expenses related to short-term leases are included in the tables below.\n\n## Discount Rate\n\nThe discount rate for a lease is the rate implicit in the lease unless that rate cannot be readily determined. In that case, the Registrants are required to use their incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate the Registrants would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis over a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.\n\nThe Registrants receive secured borrowing rates from financial institutions based on their applicable credit profiles. The Registrants use the secured rate which corresponds with the term of the applicable lease.\n\n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\n## Lessee Transactions\n\nThe following table provides the components of lease cost for the Registrants' operating leases for the years ended December 31:\n\n107",

Performance units represent a target number of shares (Target Award) of PPL's common stock that the recipient would receive upon PPL's attainment of the applicable performance goal. Performance is determined based on TSR during a three-year performance period. At the end of the period, payout is determined by comparing PPL's performance to the TSR of the companies included in the PHLX Utility Sector Index. Awards are payable on a graduated basis based on thresholds that measure PPL's performance relative to peers that comprise the applicable index on which each year's awards are measured. Awards can be paid up to 200% of the Target Award or forfeited with no payout if performance is below a minimum established performance threshold.

Under the plan provisions, TSR performance units are subject to forfeiture upon termination of employment other than retirement, one year or more from\n\ncommencement of the performance period, disability or death of an employee.\n\nThe fair value of TSR performance units granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over a one-year period, the minimum vesting period required for an employee to be entitled to payout of the awards with no proration. For employees who are not retirement-eligible, compensation expense is recognized over the shorter of the three-year performance period or the period until the employee is retirement-eligible, with a minimum vesting and recognition period of one-year. If an employee retires before the one-year vesting period, the performance units are forfeited. Performance units vest on a pro rata basis, in certain situations, as defined by each of the Plans.\n\nThe fair value of each performance unit granted was estimated using a Monte Carlo pricing model that considers stock beta, a risk-free interest rate, expected stock volatility and expected life. The stock beta was calculated comparing the risk of the individual securities to the average risk of the companies in the index group. The risk-free interest rate reflects the yield on a U.S. Treasury bond commensurate with the expected life of the performance unit. Volatility over the expected term of the performance unit is calculated using daily stock price observations for PPL and all companies in the index group and is evaluated with consideration given to prior periods that may need to be excluded based on events not likely to recur that had impacted PPL and the companies in the index group. PPL uses a mix of historic and implied volatility to value awards.\n\nThe weighted-average assumptions used in the model were:\n\n|                           | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|---------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Expected stock volatility | 27.81%  | 15.64%  | 17.57%  |\n| Expected life             | 3 years | 3 years | 3 years |\n\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of TSR performance units granted was:\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n| PPL          |   $ 32.44 |   $ 37.63 $ |   35.83 |\n|--------------|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| PPL Electric |     32.92 |       38.64 |   35.68 |\n\nTSR performance unit activity for 2021 was:\n\nWeighted-\n\n| PPL                                    | TSR Performance Units   |   Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|                                        | 626,254 $               |                                     36.98 |\n| Nonvested, beginning of period Granted | 306,009                 |                                     32.44 |\n| Vested                                 | (53,340)                |                                     34.47 |\n| Forfeited (a)                          | (245,150)               |                                     37.75 |\n| Nonvested, end of period               | 633,773                 |                                     34.68 |\n| Nonvested, beginning of period         | 61,807 $                |                                     37.44 |\n| Transfer between registrants           | (53,663)                |                                     37.42 |\n| Granted                                | 10,010                  |                                     32.92 |\n| Forfeited (a)                          | (2,800)                 |                                     38.47 |\n| Nonvested, end of period               | 15,354                  |                                     34.36 |\n\n(a)\n\nPrimarily related to the forfeiture of 2018 domestic performance units as performance during the period was below the minimum established performance\n\n111",

See Note 9 for additional information on the sale of the U.K. utility business. No TSR\n\nperformance units vested for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Amounts for PPL Electric are insignificant.\n\nPerformance Units - Return on Equity\n\nBeginning in 2017, PPL changed its executive compensation mix to add performance units based on achievement of a corporate Return on Equity (ROE). ROE performance units are intended to further align compensation with the company's strategy and\n\nreward for future corporate performance.\n\nPayout of these performance units will be based on the calculated average of the annual corporate ROE for each year of the three-year performance period for PPL Corporation. In light of the transformational nature of the potential sale of the U.K. utility business in 2021, PPL's ROE-based performance units issued for 2021 were based on a one-year performance period from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021; however, these units retained the three year vesting schedule and other characteristics. ROE performance units represent a target number of shares (Target Award) of PPL's common stock that the recipient would receive upon PPL's attainment of the applicable ROE performance goal. ROE performance units can be paid up to 200% of the Target Award or forfeited with no payout if performance is below a minimum established performance threshold. Dividends payable during the performance cycle accumulate and are converted into additional performance units and are payable in shares of PPL common stock upon completion of the performance period based on the Compensation Committee's determination of achievement of the performance goals. Under the plan provisions, these performance units are subject to forfeiture upon termination of employment other than retirement, disability or death of an employee.\n\nThe fair value of each ROE performance unit is based on the closing price of PPL Common Stock on the date of grant. The fair value of ROE performance units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period or through the date at which the employee reaches retirement eligibility. The fair value awards granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized as compensation expense immediately upon the date of grant. As these awards are based on performance conditions, the level of attainment is monitored each reporting period and compensation expense is adjusted based on the expected attainment level.\n\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of ROE performance units granted was:\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n| PPL          |   $ 30.08 |   34.95 |   30.89 |\n|--------------|-----------|---------|---------|\n| PPL Electric |     29.39 |   35.59 |   30.76 |\n\nROE performance unit activity for 2021 was:\n\nWeighted-\n\n| PPL                                    | ROE Performance Unit   |   Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|                                        | 728,664 $              |                                     32.81 |\n| Nonvested, beginning of period Granted | 572,571                |                                     30.08 |\n| Vested                                 | (570,722)              |                                     32.02 |\n| Forfeited                              | (8,160)                |                                     30.44 |\n| Nonvested, end of period               | 722,353                |                                     31.28 |\n| Nonvested, beginning of period         | 61,807 $               |                                     33.01 |\n| Transfer between registrants           | (53,663)               |                                     33    |\n| Granted                                | 12,895                 |                                     29.39 |\n| Vested                                 | (5,685)                |                                     32.27 |\n| Nonvested, end of period               | 15,354                 |                                     30.27 |\n\n112",

The Master Trust benefits from a wide diversification of asset types, investment fund strategies and external investment fund\n\nmanagers, and therefore has no significant concentration of risk.\n\nThe investment policy of the Master Trust outlines investment objectives and defines the responsibilities of the EBPB, external investment managers, investment advisor and trustee and custodian. The investment policy is reviewed annually by PPL's\n\nBoard of Directors.\n\nThe EBPB created a risk management framework around the trust assets and pension liabilities. This framework considers the trust assets as being composed of three sub-portfolios: growth, immunizing and liquidity portfolios. The growth portfolio is comprised of investments that generate a return at a reasonable risk, including equity securities, certain debt securities and alternative investments. The immunizing portfolio consists of debt securities, generally with long durations, and derivative positions. The immunizing portfolio is designed to offset a portion of the change in the pension liabilities due to changes in interest rates. The liquidity portfolio consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents.\n\nTarget allocation ranges have been developed for each portfolio based on input from external consultants with a goal of limiting funded status volatility. The EBPB monitors the investments in each portfolio, and seeks to obtain a target portfolio that emphasizes reduction of risk of loss from market volatility. In pursuing that goal, the EBPB establishes revised guidelines from time to time. EBPB investment guidelines as of the end of 2021 are presented below.\n\nThe asset allocation for the trust and the target allocation by portfolio at December 31 are as follows:\n\n|                           | Percentage of trust assets   | Percentage of trust assets   |                              |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                           | 2021                         | 2020                         | 2021 Target Asset Allocation |\n| Growth Portfolio          | 55 %                         | 56 %                         | 55 %                         |\n| Equity securities         | 32 %                         | 34 %                         |                              |\n| Debt securities (a)       | 13 %                         | 13 %                         |                              |\n| Alternative investments   | 10 %                         | 9 %                          |                              |\n| Immunizing Portfolio      | 43 %                         | 43 %                         | 43 %                         |\n| Debt securities (a)       | 35 %                         | 33 %                         |                              |\n| Derivatives               | 8 %                          | 10 %                         | 2 %                          |\n| Liquidity Portfolio Total | 2 %                          | 1 %                          |                              |\n|                           | 100 %                        | 100 %                        | 100 %                        |\n\n(PPL)\n\nThe fair value of net assets in the Master Trust by asset class and level within the fair value hierarchy was:\n\nDecember 31, 2021\n\nDecember 31, 2020\n\n|                                                    | Fair Value Measurements Using Level 1 Level 2 Level 3   | Fair Value Measurements Using Level 1 Level 2 Level 3   | Fair Value Measurements Using Level 1 Level 2 Level 3   | Fair Value Measurements Using Level 1 Level 2 Level 3   | Fair Value Measurements Using Level 1 Level 2 Level 3   | Fair Value Measurements Using Level 1 Level 2 Level 3   | Fair Value Measurements Using Level 1 Level 2 Level 3   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| PPLServices Corporation Master Trust               |                                                         |                                                         |                                                         |                                                         |                                                         |                                                         |                                                         |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                          | 266 $                                                   | 266                                                     | $ -

The fair value measurements of equity securities (excluding commingled funds), which are generally classified as Level 1, are based on quoted prices in active markets. These securities represent actively and passively managed investments that are managed against various equity indices.\n\nInvestments in commingled equity and debt funds are categorized as equity securities. Investments in commingled equity funds\n\ninclude funds that invest in U.S. and international equity securities. Investments in commingled debt funds include funds that invest in a diversified portfolio of emerging market debt obligations, as well as funds that invest in investment grade longduration fixed-income securities.\n\nThe fair value measurements of debt securities are generally based on evaluations that reflect observable market information,\n\n121 such as actual trade information for identical securities or for similar securities, adjusted for observable differences. The fair value of debt securities is generally measured using a market approach, including the use of pricing models, which incorporate observable inputs. Common inputs include benchmark yields, relevant trade data, broker/dealer bid/ask prices, benchmark securities and credit valuation adjustments. When necessary, the fair value of debt securities is measured using the income approach, which incorporates similar observable inputs as well as payment data, future predicted cash flows, collateral",

        "page_content": "performance and new issue data. For the Master Trust, these securities represent investments in securities issued by U.S. Treasury and U.S. government sponsored agencies; investments securitized by residential mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other pooled loans; investments in investment grade and non-investment grade bonds issued by U.S. companies across\n\nseveral industries; investments in debt securities issued by foreign governments and corporations.\n\nInvestments in real estate represent an investment in a partnership whose purpose is to manage investments in core U.S. real estate properties diversified geographically and across major property types (e.g., office, industrial, retail, etc.). The strategy is focused on properties with high occupancy rates with quality tenants. This results in a focus on high income and stable cash flows with appreciation being a secondary factor. Core real estate generally has a lower degree of leverage when compared with more speculative real estate investing strategies. The partnership has limitations on the amounts that may be redeemed based on available cash to fund redemptions. Additionally, the general partner may decline to accept redemptions when necessary to avoid adverse consequences for the partnership, including legal and tax implications, among others. The fair value of the investment is based upon a partnership unit value.\n\nInvestments in private equity represent interests in partnerships in multiple early-stage venture capital funds and private equity fund of funds that use a number of diverse investment strategies. The partnerships have limited lives of at least 10 years, after which liquidating distributions will be received. Prior to the end of each partnership's life, the investment cannot be redeemed with the partnership; however, the interest may be sold to other parties, subject to the general partner's approval. At December 31, 2021, the Master Trust had unfunded commitments of $111 million that may be required during the lives of the partnerships. Fair value is based on an ownership interest in partners' capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed.\n\nInvestments in limited partnerships include Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) funds. The Master Trust received notice that the TALF funds are liquidating in an orderly manner and distributing capital back to the partners. Therefore, the Master Trust has no unfunded commitment related to the TALF funds. Fair value of the funds is based on an ownership interest in partners' capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed.\n\nInvestments in hedge funds represent investments in a fund of hedge funds. Hedge funds seek a return utilizing a number of diverse investment strategies. The strategies, when combined aim to reduce volatility and risk while attempting to deliver positive returns under most market conditions. Major investment strategies for the fund of hedge funds include long/short equity, tactical trading, event driven, and relative value. Shares may be redeemed with 45 days prior written notice. The fund is subject to short term lockups and other restrictions. The fair value for the fund has been estimated using the net asset value per share.\n\nThe fair value measurements of derivative instruments utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar contracts or market-corroborated inputs. In certain instances, these instruments may be valued using models, including standard option valuation models and standard industry models. These securities primarily represent investments in treasury futures, total return swaps, interest rate swaps and swaptions (the option to enter into an interest rate swap), which are valued based on quoted prices, changes in the value of the underlying exposure or on the swap details, such as swap curves, notional amount, index and term of index, reset frequency, volatility and payer/receiver credit ratings.\n\nIn 2019, obligations underlying an investment in an immediate participation guaranteed group annuity contract, classified as\n\nLevel 3, were assumed by the insurance company, with a residual amount remaining in the general account of the insurer that was paid into the master trust or distributed to participants in 2020.\n\nPlan Assets - Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\nThe investment strategy with respect to other postretirement benefit obligations is to fund VEBA trusts and/or 401(h) accounts\n\n122 with voluntary contributions and to invest in a tax efficient manner. Excluding the 401(h) accounts included in the Master Trust, other postretirement benefit plans are invested in a mix of assets for long-term growth with an objective of earning returns that provide liquidity as required for benefit payments. These plans benefit from diversification of asset types, investment fund",

PPL expects to make approximately $10 million of benefit payments under these plans in 2022.\n\nPPL is not required to make contributions to its other postretirement benefit plans but has historically funded these plans in amounts equal to the postretirement benefit costs recognized. Continuation of this past practice would cause PPL to contribute $22 million to its other postretirement benefit plans in 2022.\n\nThe following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid by the plans and the following federal subsidy payments are expected to be received by PPL.\n\n|           |         | Other Postretirement   | Other Postretirement     |\n|-----------|---------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n|           | Pension | Benefit Payment        | Expected Federal Subsidy |\n| 2022      | 207     | 44 $                   | 1                        |\n| 2023      | 207     | 42                     | -                        |\n| 2024      | 204     | 41                     | -                        |\n| 2025      | 204     | 40                     | - -                      |\n| 2026      | 202     | 38                     |                          |\n| 2027-2030 | 946     | 176                    | 1                        |\n\n## Savings Plans (All Registrants)\n\nSubstantially all employees of PPL's subsidiaries are eligible to participate in deferred savings plans (401(k)s).

        "page_content": "In September 2013, one of PPL's former subsidiaries, PPL Montana entered into an agreement to sell its hydroelectric generating facilities. In June 2014, PPL and PPL Energy Supply, the parent company of PPL Montana, entered into various definitive agreements with affiliates of Riverstone to spin off PPL Energy Supply and ultimately combine it with Riverstone's competitive power generation businesses to form a stand-alone company named Talen Energy. In November 2014, after executing the spinoff agreements but prior to the closing of the spinoff transaction, PPL Montana closed the sale of its hydroelectric generating facilities. Subsequently, on June 1, 2015, the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply was completed. Following the spinoff transaction, PPL had no continuing ownership interest in or control of PPL Energy Supply. In connection with the spinoff transaction, PPL Montana became Talen Montana, LLC (Talen Montana), a subsidiary of Talen Energy. Talen Energy Marketing also became a subsidiary of Talen Energy as a result of the June 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply. Talen Energy has owned and operated both Talen Montana and Talen Energy Marketing since the spinoff. At the time of the spinoff, affiliates of Riverstone acquired a 35% ownership interest in Talen Energy. Riverstone subsequently acquired the remaining interests in Talen Energy in a take private transaction in December 2016.\n\n## Talen Montana Retirement Plan and Talen Energy Marketing, LLC, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. PPL Corporation et al.\n\nOn October 29, 2018, Talen Montana Retirement Plan and Talen Energy Marketing filed a putative class action complaint on behalf of current and contingent creditors of Talen Montana who allegedly suffered harm or allegedly will suffer reasonably foreseeable harm as a result of the November 2014 distribution of proceeds from the sale of then-PPL Montana's hydroelectric generating facilities. The action was filed in the Sixteenth Judicial District of the State of Montana, Rosebud County, against PPL and certain of its affiliates and current and former officers and directors (Talen Putative Class Action). Plaintiff asserts claims for, among other things, fraudulent transfer, both actual and constructive; recovery against subsequent transferees; civil conspiracy; aiding and abetting tortious conduct; and unjust enrichment. Plaintiff is seeking avoidance of the purportedly fraudulent transfer, unspecified damages, including punitive damages, the imposition of a constructive trust, and other relief. In December 2018, PPL removed the Talen Putative Class Action from the Sixteenth Judicial District of the State of Montana to the United States District Court for the District of Montana, Billings Division (MT Federal Court). In January 2019, the plaintiff moved to remand the Talen Putative Class Action back to state court, and dismissed without prejudice all current and former PPL Corporation directors from the case. In September 2019, the MT Federal Court granted plaintiff's motion to remand the case back to state court. Although, the PPL defendants petitioned the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to grant an appeal of the remand decision, in November 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied that request and in December 2019, Talen Montana Retirement Plan filed a Second Amended Complaint in the Sixteenth Judicial District of the State of Montana, Rosebud County, which removed Talen Energy Marketing as a plaintiff. In January 2020, PPL defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint or, in the alternative, to stay the proceedings pending the resolution of the below mentioned Delaware Action. The Court held a hearing on June 24, 2020 regarding the motions. On September 11, 2020, the Court granted PPL defendants' alternative Motion for a Stay of the proceedings.\n\n## PPL Corporation et al. vs. Riverstone Holdings LLC, Talen Energy Corporation et al.\n\n127 On November 30, 2018, PPL, certain PPL affiliates, and certain current and former officers and directors (PPL plaintiffs) filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware seeking various forms of relief against Riverstone, Talen Energy and certain of their affiliates (Delaware Action), in response to and as part of the defense strategy for an action filed by Talen Montana, LLC (the Talen Direct Action, since dismissed) and the Talen Putative Class Action described above (together, the Montana Actions) originally filed in Montana state court in October 2018. In the complaint, the PPL plaintiffs ask the Delaware Court of Chancery for declaratory and injunctive relief. This includes a declaratory judgment that, under the separation agreement governing the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, all related claims that arise must be heard in Delaware; that the statute of limitations in Delaware and the spinoff agreement bar these claims at this time; that PPL is not liable for the claims in either the Talen Direct Action or the Talen Putative Class Action as PPL Montana was solvent at all relevant times; and that the separation agreement requires that Talen Energy indemnify PPL for all losses arising from the debts of Talen Montana, among other things. PPL's complaint also seeks damages against Riverstone for interfering with the separation agreement and against Riverstone affiliates for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The complaint was subsequently amended on January 11, 2019 and March 20, 2019, to include, among other things, claims related to indemnification with",

        "page_content": "respect to the Montana Actions, request a declaration that the Montana Actions are time-barred under the spinoff agreements, and allege additional facts to support the tortious interference claim. In April 2019, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint. In July 2019, the Court heard oral arguments from the parties regarding the motions to dismiss, and in October 2019, the Delaware Court of Chancery issued an opinion sustaining all of the PPL plaintiffs' claims except for the claim for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. As a result of the dismissal of the Talen Direct Action in December 2019, in January 2020, Talen Energy filed a new motion to dismiss five of the remaining eight claims in the amended complaint. The Court heard oral argument on the motion to dismiss on May 28, 2020, and on June 22, 2020, issued an opinion denying the motion in its entirety. Discovery is proceeding, and the parties have filed certain motions and cross-motions for summary judgment, which are not yet scheduled for hearing. The trial was previously scheduled for February 2022, but has been rescheduled for July 2022.\n\nWith respect to each of the Talen-related matters described above, PPL believes that the 2014 distribution of proceeds was made in compliance with all applicable laws and that PPL Montana was solvent at all relevant times. Additionally, the agreements entered into in connection with the spinoff, which PPL and affiliates of Talen Energy and Riverstone negotiated and executed prior to the 2014 distribution, directly address the treatment of the proceeds from the sale of PPL Montana's hydroelectric generating facilities; in those agreements, Talen Energy and Riverstone definitively agreed that PPL was entitled to retain the proceeds.\n\nPPL believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims made in the Talen Putative Class Action and intends to continue to vigorously defend against this action. The Talen Putative Class Action was stayed at an early stage of litigation. While the Delaware Action is progressing, at this time PPL cannot predict the outcome of either of these matters or estimate the range of possible losses, if any, that PPL might incur as a result of the claims, although they could be material.\n\n## Cane Run Environmental Claims (PPL and LG&E)\n\nIn December 2013, six residents, on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, filed a class action complaint against LG&E and PPL in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky (U.S. District Court) alleging violations of the Clean Air Act, RCRA, and common law claims of nuisance, trespass and negligence. In July 2014, the U.S. District Court dismissed the RCRA claims and all but one Clean Air Act claim, but declined to dismiss the common law tort claims. In February 2017, the U.S. District Court dismissed PPL as a defendant and dismissed the final federal claim against LG&E, and in April 2017, issued an Order declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction on the state law claims dismissing the case in its entirety. In June 2017, the plaintiffs filed a class action complaint in Jefferson County, Kentucky Circuit Court, against LG&E alleging state law nuisance, negligence and trespass tort claims. The plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages for alleged property damage due to purported plant emissions on behalf of a class of residents within one to three miles of the plant. On January 8, 2020, the Jefferson Circuit Court issued an order denying the plaintiffs' request for class certification. On January 14, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the Kentucky Court of Appeals. On December 11, 2020, the Court of Appeals issued an order affirming the lower court's denial of class certification. In December 2020, plaintiffs filed a petition for discretionary review with the Kentucky Supreme Court. On April 20, 2021, the Kentucky Supreme Court denied further review of the lower court order. The case was remanded to the Jefferson Circuit Court for the claims of the three remaining petitioners. Settlements with two of the three remaining petitioners were reached with none of the settlements having or expected to have a significant impact on LG&E's operations or financial condition.\n\nE.W. Brown Environmental Claims\n\n(PPL and KU)\n\nIn July 2017, the Kentucky Waterways Alliance and the Sierra Club filed a citizen suit complaint against KU in the U.S. District\n\n128 Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky (U.S. District Court) alleging discharges at the E.W. Brown plant in violation of the Clean Water Act and the plant's water discharge permit and alleging contamination that may present an imminent and substantial endangerment in violation of the RCRA. The plaintiffs' suit relates to prior notices of intent to file a citizen suit submitted in October and November 2015 and October 2016. These plaintiffs sought injunctive relief ordering KU to take all actions necessary to comply with the Clean Water Act and RCRA, including ceasing the discharges in question, abating effects associated with prior discharges and eliminating the alleged imminent and substantial endangerment. These plaintiffs also",

In December 2017, the U.S. District Court issued an Order dismissing the Clean Water Act and RCRA complaints against KU in their entirety. In January 2018, the plaintiffs appealed the dismissal Order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. In September 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued its ruling affirming the lower court's decision to dismiss the Clean Water Act claims but reversing its dismissal of the RCRA claims against KU and remanding the latter to the U.S. District Court. In January 2019, KU filed an answer to plaintiffs' complaint in the U.S. District Court. In May 2021, the U.S. District Court issued an order granting KU's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case. In June 2021, the plaintiffs appealed the district court's order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. In September 2021, the parties entered into a settlement agreement, providing for\n\ndismissal of the appellate proceedings and release of other claims.\n\nKU is undertaking extensive remedial measures at the E.W. Brown plant including closure of the former ash pond, implementation of a groundwater remedial action plan and performance of a corrective action plan including aquatic study of adjacent surface waters and risk assessment. The aquatic study and risk assessment are being undertaken pursuant to a 2017 agreed Order with the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet (KEEC). KU conducted sampling of Herrington Lake in 2017 and 2018. In June 2019, KU submitted to the KEEC the required aquatic study and risk assessment, conducted by an independent third-party consultant, finding that discharges from the E.W. Brown plant have not had any significant impact on Herrington Lake and that the water in the lake is safe for recreational use and meets safe drinking water standards. On May 31, 2021, the KEEC approved the report and released a response to public comments. On August 6, 2021, KU submitted a Supplemental Remedial Alternatives Analysis (SRAA) report to the KEEC that outlines proposed additional fish, water, and sediment testing. KU has submitted a response to the KEEC's comments and expects to undertake the proposed testing in the spring of 2022.\n\n## Air (PPL and LG&E)\n\n## Sulfuric Acid Mist Emissions\n\nIn June 2016, the EPA issued a notice of violation under the Clean Air Act alleging that LG&E violated applicable rules relating to sulfuric acid mist emissions at its Mill Creek plant. The notice alleges failure to install proper controls, failure to operate the facility consistent with good air pollution control practice and causing emissions exceeding applicable requirements or constituting a nuisance or endangerment. LG&E believes it has complied with applicable regulations during the relevant time period. On July 31, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice and Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky alleging violations specified in the EPA notice of violation and seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. In October 2020, LG&E filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In December 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District filed an amended complaint. In February 2021, LG&E filed a renewed motion to dismiss regarding the amended complaint. In September 2021, the parties reached a tentative agreement providing for dismissal of the court action, the payment by LG&E of a penalty amount and performance of a supplemental environmental project (SEP). The parties have entered a Consent Decree, which is awaiting approval from the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. PPL and LG&E are unable to predict the final outcome of this matter but do not believe the matter, including the agreed penalty and SEP, will have a significant impact on LG&E's operations or financial condition.\n\nWater/Waste\n\n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nELGs\n\nIn 2015, the EPA finalized ELGs for wastewater discharge permits for new and existing steam electricity generating facilities.\n\n129 These guidelines require deployment of additional control technologies providing physical, chemical and biological treatment and mandate operational changes including \"no discharge\" requirements for certain wastewaters. The implementation date for individual generating stations was to be determined by the states on a case-by-case basis according to criteria provided by the EPA. Legal challenges to the final rule were consolidated before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. In April 2017, the EPA announced that it would grant petitions for reconsideration of the rule. In September 2017, the EPA issued a rule to",

        "page_content": "postpone the compliance date for certain requirements. On October 13, 2020, the EPA published final revisions to its best available technology standards for certain wastewaters and potential extensions to compliance dates (the Reconsideration Rule). The rule is expected to be implemented by the states or applicable permitting authorities in the course of their normal permitting activities. LG&E and KU are currently implementing responsive compliance strategies and schedules. Certain aspects of these compliance plans and estimates relate to developments in state water quality standards, which are separate from the ELG rule or its implementation. Certain costs are included in the Registrants' capital plans and expected to be recovered from customers through rate recovery mechanisms, but additional costs and recovery will depend on further regulatory developments at the state level. In August 2021, the EPA published a notice of rulemaking announcing that it will propose revisions to the Reconsideration Rule and determine \"whether more stringent limitations and standards are appropriate.\" Compliance with the Reconsideration Rule is required during the pendency of the rulemaking process.\n\nCCRs\n\nIn 2015, the EPA issued a final rule governing management of CCRs which include fly ash, bottom ash and sulfur dioxide scrubber wastes. The CCR Rule imposes extensive new requirements for certain CCR impoundments and landfills, including public notifications, location restrictions, design and operating standards, groundwater monitoring and corrective action requirements, and closure and post-closure care requirements, and specifies restrictions relating to the beneficial use of CCRs. In July 2018, the EPA issued a final rule extending the deadline for closure of certain impoundments and adopting other substantive changes. In August 2018, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated and remanded portions of the CCR Rule. In December 2019, the EPA addressed the deficiencies identified by the court and proposed amendments to change the closure deadline. In August 2020, the EPA published a final rule extending the deadline to initiate closure to April 11, 2021, while providing for certain extensions. The EPA is conducting ongoing rulemaking actions regarding various other amendments to the rule. Certain ongoing legal challenges to various provisions of the CCR Rule have been held in abeyance pending review by the EPA pursuant to the President's executive order. PPL, LG&E, and KU are monitoring the EPA's ongoing efforts to refine and implement the regulatory program under the CCR Rule. In January 2022, the EPA issued several proposed regulatory determinations, facility notifications, and public announcements which indicate increased scrutiny by the EPA to determine the adequacy of measures taken by facility owners and operators to achieve closure of CCR surface impoundments and landfills. In particular, the agency indicated that it will focus on certain practices which it views as posing a threat of continuing groundwater contamination. Future guidance, regulatory determinations, rulemakings, and other developments could potentially require revisions to current LG&E and KU compliance plans including additional monitoring and remediation at surface impoundments and landfills, the cost of which could be substantial. PPL, LG&E and KU are unable to predict the outcome of the ongoing litigation, rulemaking, and regulatory determinations or potential impacts on current LG&E and KU compliance plans. The Registrants are currently finalizing closure plans and schedules.\n\nIn January 2017, Kentucky issued a new state rule relating to CCR management, effective May 2017, aimed at reflecting the requirements of the federal CCR rule. As a result of a subsequent legal challenge, in January 2018, the Franklin County, Kentucky Circuit Court issued an opinion invalidating certain procedural elements of the rule. LG&E and KU presently operate their facilities under continuing permits authorized under the former program and do not currently anticipate material impacts as a result of the judicial ruling. Associated costs are expected to be subject to rate recovery.\n\nLG&E and KU received KPSC approval for a compliance plan providing for the closure of impoundments at the Mill Creek,\n\nTrimble County, E.W. Brown, and Ghent stations, and construction of process water management facilities at those plants. In addition to the foregoing measures required for compliance with the federal CCR rule, KU also received KPSC approval for its plans to close impoundments at the retired Green River, Pineville and Tyrone plants to comply with applicable state law. As of April 2021, LG&E and KU have commenced closure of all of the subject impoundments and have completed closure of some of their smaller impoundments. LG&E and KU generally expect to complete impoundment closures within five years of commencement, although a longer period may be required to complete closure of some facilities. Associated costs are expected to be subject to rate recovery.\n\nIn connection with the final CCR rule, LG&E and KU recorded adjustments to existing AROs beginning in 2015 and continue\n\n130 to record adjustments as required. See Note 20 for additional information. Further changes to AROs, current capital plans or",

Costs relating to this rule are expected to be subject to rate recovery.\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nSuperfund and Other Remediation\n\nPPL Electric, LG&E and KU are potentially responsible for investigating and remediating contamination under the federal Superfund program and similar state programs. Actions are under way at certain sites including former coal gas manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania and Kentucky previously owned or operated by, or currently owned by predecessors or affiliates of, PPL Electric, LG&E and KU. PPL Electric is potentially responsible for a share of clean-up costs at certain sites including the Columbia Gas Plant site and the Brodhead site. Cleanup actions have been or are being undertaken at these sites as requested by governmental agencies, the costs of which have not been and are not expected to be significant to PPL Electric.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, PPL Electric had a recorded liability of $10 million representing its best estimate of the probable loss incurred to remediate the sites identified above. Depending on the outcome of investigations at identified sites where investigations have not begun or been completed, or developments at sites for which information is incomplete, additional costs of remediation could be incurred. PPL Electric, LG&E and KU lack sufficient information about such additional sites to estimate any potential liability or range of reasonably possible losses, if any, related to these sites. Such costs, however, are not currently expected to be significant.\n\nThe EPA is evaluating the risks associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and naphthalene, chemical by-products of coal gas manufacturing. As a result, individual states may establish stricter standards for water quality and soil cleanup, that could require several PPL subsidiaries to take more extensive assessment and remedial actions at former coal gas manufacturing plants. The Registrants cannot reasonably estimate a range of possible losses, if any, related to these matters.\n\n## Regulatory Issues\n\nSee Note 7 for information on regulatory matters related to utility rate regulation.\n\n## Electricity - Reliability Standards\n\nThe NERC is responsible for establishing and enforcing mandatory reliability standards (Reliability Standards) regarding the bulk electric system in North America. The FERC oversees this process and independently enforces the Reliability Standards.\n\nThe Reliability Standards have the force and effect of law and apply to certain users of the bulk electric system, including electric utility companies, generators and marketers. Under the Federal Power Act, the FERC may assess civil penalties for certain violations.\n\nPPL Electric, LG&E and KU monitor their compliance with the Reliability Standards and self-report or self-log potential\n\nviolations of applicable reliability requirements whenever identified, and submit accompanying mitigation plans, as required. The resolution of a small number of potential violations is pending. Penalties incurred to date have not been significant. Any Regional Reliability Entity determination concerning the resolution of violations of the Reliability Standards remains subject to the approval of the NERC and the FERC.\n\nIn the course of implementing their programs to ensure compliance with the Reliability Standards by those PPL affiliates\n\nsubject to the standards, certain other instances of potential non-compliance may be identified from time to time. The Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters, and an estimate or range of possible losses cannot be determined.\n\n131",

The first security directive required notified owners/operators to implement cybersecurity incident reporting to the DHS, designate a cybersecurity coordinator, and perform a gap assessment of current entity cybersecurity practices against certain voluntary TSA security guidelines and report relevant results and proposed mitigation to applicable DHS agencies.

OVEC and other entities challenged the contract rejection, the bankruptcy plan confirmation and regulatory aspects of the plan in various forums. In May 2020, OVEC and the relevant sponsor announced a settlement resolving all disputed matters in the bankruptcy and other proceedings, including providing that the sponsor will withdraw its request to reject the power\n\npurchase agreement. The settlement was implemented in July 2020.\n\nThe Registrants provide other miscellaneous guarantees through contracts entered into in the normal course of business. These guarantees are primarily in the form of indemnification or warranties related to services or equipment and vary in duration. The amounts of these guarantees often are not explicitly stated, and the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such guarantees cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, no significant payments have been made with respect to these types of guarantees and the probability of payment/performance under these guarantees is remote.\n\nPPL, on behalf of itself and certain of its subsidiaries, maintains insurance that covers liability assumed under contract for bodily injury and property damage. The coverage provides maximum aggregate coverage of $225 million. This insurance may be applicable to obligations under certain of these contractual arrangements.\n\n## Risks and Uncertainties (All Registrants)\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the U.S. and global economies and continues to present challenges to businesses, communities, workforces, markets and increasingly to supply chains. In the U.S. and throughout the world, governmental authorities have taken actions to contain the spread of the virus and mitigate known or foreseeable impacts. In the Registrants' service territories, mitigation measures have included quarantines, stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, reduced operations or closures of businesses, schools and governmental agencies, and executive, legislative or regulatory actions to address health or other pandemic-related concerns. Many restrictions that had been imposed have been lifted but may be reenacted in the future. These actions have the potential to adversely impact the Registrants' business and operations, especially if these measures remain in effect for a prolonged period of time.\n\nTo date, there has been no material impact on the Registrants' operations, financial condition, liquidity or on their supply chain as a result of COVID-19; however, the duration and severity of the outbreak and its ultimate effects on the global economy, the financial markets, or the Registrants' workforce, customers and suppliers are uncertain. A protracted slowdown of broad sectors of the economy, prolonged or pervasive restrictions on businesses and their workforces, or significant changes in legislation or regulatory policy to address the COVID-19 pandemic all present significant risks to the Registrants. These or other unpredictable events resulting from the pandemic could reduce customer demand for electricity and gas, impact the Registrants' employees and supply chains, result in an increase in certain costs, delay payments or increase bad debts, or result in changes in the fair value of their assets and liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect the Registrants' business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\n\n## 15. Related Party Transactions\n\n## Wholesale Sales and Purchases (LG&E and KU)\n\nLG&E and KU jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail customers. When\n\nLG&E has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail customers and its generation cost is lower than that of KU, KU purchases electricity from LG&E and vice versa. These transactions are reflected in the Statements of Income as \"Electric revenue from affiliate\" and \"Energy purchases from affiliate\" and are recorded at a price equal to the seller's fuel cost plus any split savings. Savings realized from such intercompany transactions are shared equally between both companies. The volume of energy each company has to sell to the other is dependent on its retail customers' needs and its available generation.\n\nSupport Costs\n\n(PPL Electric, LG&E and KU)\n\nPPL Services, PPL EU Services, prior to its merger into PPL Services as of December 31, 2021, and LKS provide the\n\n133 Registrants and each other with administrative, management and support services.

General costs that cannot be directly attributed to a specific entity are allocated and charged to the respective recipients as indirect support costs. PPL Services and PPL EU Services use a three-factor methodology that includes the applicable recipients' invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees to allocate indirect costs. PPL Services may also use a ratio of overall direct and indirect costs or a weighted average cost ratio. LKS bases its indirect allocations on the subsidiaries' number of employees, total assets, revenues, number of customers and/or other statistical information.

Billings between LG&E and KU relate to labor and overheads associated with union and hourly employees performing work for the other company, charges related to jointly-owned generating units and other miscellaneous charges. Tax settlements between PPL and LG&E and KU are reimbursed through LKS.\n\n## Intercompany Borrowings\n\n## (PPL Electric)\n\nPPL Energy Funding maintains a $1,200 million revolving line of credit with a PPL Electric subsidiary. At December 31, 2021, PPL Energy Funding had borrowings outstanding in the amount of $499 million. This balance is reflected in \"Notes receivable from affiliate\" on the PPL Electric balance sheet. No balance was outstanding at December 31, 2020. The interest rates on borrowings are equal to one-month LIBOR plus a spread. Interest income is reflected in \"Interest Income from Affiliate\" on the Income Statements.\n\n## (LG&E)\n\nLG&E participates in an intercompany money pool agreement whereby LKE and/or KU make available to LG&E funds up to the difference between LG&E's FERC borrowing limit and LG&E's commercial paper limit at an interest rate based on the lower of a market index of commercial paper issues and two additional rate options based on LIBOR. LG&E's money pool borrowing limit is $325 million. At December 31, 2021, LG&E had borrowings outstanding from LKE in the amount of $324 million. This balance is reflected in \"Notes payable with affiliates\" on the LG&E balance sheets. No balances were outstanding at December 31, 2020.\n\n(KU)\n\nKU participates in an intercompany money pool agreement whereby LKE and/or LG&E make available to KU funds up to the\n\ndifference between KU's FERC borrowing limit and KU's commercial paper limit at an interest rate based on the lower of a market index of commercial paper issues and two additional rate options based on LIBOR. KU's money pool borrowing limit is $300 million. At December 31, 2021, KU had borrowings outstanding from LKE in the amount of $294 million. This balance is reflected in \"Notes payable with affiliates\" on the KU balance sheets. No balances were outstanding at December 31, 2020.\n\n134",

Based on PPL Electric's participation in PPL's Other Postretirement Benefit plan, PPL Electric was allocated a portion of the excess funds from PPL Services. These funds have been recorded as an intercompany receivable on the Balance Sheets. The receivable balance decreases as PPL Electric pays incurred medical claims and is reimbursed by PPL Services. The intercompany receivable balance associated with these funds was $11 million as of December 31, 2021, of which $10 million was reflected in \"Accounts receivable from affiliates\" and $1 million was reflected in \"Other noncurrent assets\" on the Balance Sheets. The intercompany receivable balance associated with these funds was $22 million as of December 31, 2020, of which $10 million was reflected in \"Accounts receivable from affiliates\" and $12 million was reflected in \"Other noncurrent assets\" on the Balance Sheets.\n\n## Other (PPL Electric, LG&E and KU)\n\nSee Note 1 for discussions regarding the intercompany tax sharing agreement (for PPL Electric, LG&E and KU) and intercompany allocations of stock-based compensation expense (for PPL Electric).

Fair Value Measurements\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). A market approach (generally, data from market transactions), an income approach (generally, present value techniques and option-pricing models), and/or a cost approach (generally, replacement cost) are used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability, as appropriate. These valuation approaches incorporate inputs such as observable, independent market data and/or unobservable data that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to price an asset or liability. These inputs may incorporate, as applicable, certain risks such as nonperformance risk, which includes credit risk. The fair value of a group of financial assets and liabilities is measured on a net basis. See Note 1 for information on the levels in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Recurring Fair Value Measurements\n\nThe assets and liabilities measured at fair value were:\n\n|                                            | December 31, 2021 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3   | December 31, 2021 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3   | December 31, 2021 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3   | December 31, 2021 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3   | December 31, 2020 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3   | December 31, 2020 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3   | December 31, 2020 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3   | December 31, 2020 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|                                            | Total                                       |                                             |                                             |                                             | Total                                       |                                             |                                             |                                             |\n| PPL                                        |                                             |                                             |                                             |                                             |                                             |                                             |                                             |                                             |\n| Assets                                     |                                             |                                             |                                             |                                             |                                             |                                             |                                             |                                             |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                  | $ 3,571                                     | $ 3,571                                     | $ -

In 2018, PPL received a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS permitting a transfer of excess funds from the PPL Bargaining Unit Retiree Health Plan VEBA to a new subaccount within the VEBA to be used to pay medical claims of active bargaining unit employees. The funds are invested primarily in commingled debt and equity funds measured at NAV and are classified as investments in equity securities. Changes in the fair value of the funds are recorded to the Statement of Income.\n\n## Price Risk Management Assets/Liabilities - Interest Rate Swaps/Foreign Currency Contracts/Cross-Currency Swaps (PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nTo manage interest rate risk, PPL, LG&E and KU use interest rate contracts such as forward-starting swaps, floating-to-fixed swaps and fixed-to-floating swaps. To manage foreign currency exchange risk, PPL uses foreign currency contracts such as forwards, options, and cross-currency swaps that contain characteristics of both interest rate and foreign currency contracts. An income approach is used to measure the fair value of these contracts, utilizing readily observable inputs, such as forward interest rates (e.g., LIBOR and government security rates) and forward foreign currency exchange rates (e.g., GBP), as well as inputs that may not be observable, such as credit valuation adjustments. In certain cases, market information cannot practicably be obtained to value credit risk and therefore internal models are relied upon. These models use projected probabilities of default and estimated recovery rates based on historical observances. When the credit valuation adjustment is significant to the overall valuation, the contracts are classified as Level 3.\n\n## Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value (All Registrants)\n\nThe carrying amounts of long-term debt on the Balance Sheets and their estimated fair values are set forth below. Long-term debt is classified as Level 2.

        "page_content": "18. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n\nRisk Management Objectives\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nPPL has a risk management policy approved by the Board of Directors to manage market risk associated with commodities, interest rates on debt issuances and foreign exchange (including price, liquidity and volumetric risk) and credit risk (including non-performance risk and payment default risk). The Risk Management Committee, comprised of senior management and chaired by the Senior Director-Risk Management, oversees the risk management function. Key risk control activities designed to ensure compliance with the risk policy and detailed programs include, but are not limited to, credit review and approval, validation of transactions, verification of risk and transaction limits, value-at-risk analyses (VaR, a statistical model that attempts to estimate the value of potential loss over a given holding period under normal market conditions at a given confidence level) and the coordination and reporting of the Enterprise Risk Management program.\n\n## Market Risk\n\nMarket risk includes the potential loss that may be incurred as a result of price changes associated with a particular financial or commodity instrument as well as market liquidity and volumetric risks. Forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps and structured transactions are utilized as part of risk management strategies to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Many of these contracts meet the definition of a derivative. All derivatives are recognized on the Balance Sheets at their fair value, unless NPNS is elected.\n\nThe following summarizes the market risks that affect PPL and its subsidiaries.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\n- \u00b7 PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk associated with forecasted fixed-rate and existing floating-rate debt issuances. Prior to the sale of the U.K. utility business on June 14, 2021, PPL and WPD held over-the-counter cross currency swaps to limit exposure to market fluctuations on interest and principal payments from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. PPL and LG&E utilize over-the-counter interest rate swaps to limit exposure to market fluctuations on floating-rate debt. PPL, LG&E and KU utilize forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge changes in benchmark interest rates, when appropriate, in connection with future debt issuances.\n- \u00b7 PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk associated with debt securities and derivatives held by defined benefit plans. This risk is significantly mitigated to the extent that the plans are sponsored at, or sponsored on behalf of, the regulated domestic utilities and, prior to the sale of the U.K. utility business on June 14, 2021, for certain plans at WPD due to the recovery methods in place.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk\n\n(PPL)\n\n\u00b7\n\nPPL was exposed to foreign currency exchange risk primarily associated with its investments in and earnings of U.K.\n\n- affiliates.\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nCommodity Price Risk\n\nPPL is exposed to commodity price risk through its domestic subsidiaries as described below.\n\n138",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 PPL Electric is required to purchase electricity to fulfill its obligation as a PLR. Potential commodity price risk is insignificant and mitigated through its PUC-approved cost recovery mechanism and full-requirement supply agreements to\n- serve its PLR customers which transfer the risk to energy suppliers. \u00b7 LG&E's and KU's rates include certain mechanisms for fuel, fuel-related expenses and energy purchases. In addition, LG&E's rates include a mechanism for natural gas supply expenses. These mechanisms generally provide for timely\n\nrecovery of market price fluctuations associated with these expenses.\n\nVolumetric Risk\n\nVolumetric risk is the risk related to the changes in volume of retail sales due to weather, economic conditions or other factors. PPL is exposed to volumetric risk through its subsidiaries as described below.\n\n- \u00b7 WPD was exposed to volumetric risk which was significantly mitigated as a result of the method of regulation in the U.K. \u00b7 PPL Electric, LG&E and KU are exposed to volumetric risk on retail sales, mainly due to weather and other economic conditions for which there is limited mitigation between rate cases.\n\n## Equity Securities Price Risk\n\n- \u00b7 PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to equity securities price risk associated with the fair value of the defined benefit plans' assets. This risk is significantly mitigated due to the recovery methods in place.\n- \u00b7 PPL is exposed to equity securities price risk from future stock sales and/or purchases.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk is the potential loss that may be incurred due to a counterparty's non-performance.\n\nPPL is exposed to credit risk from \"in-the-money\" transactions with counterparties, as well as additional credit risk through certain of its subsidiaries, as discussed below.\n\nIn the event a supplier of PPL Electric, LG&E or KU defaults on its obligation, those Registrants would be required to seek replacement power or replacement fuel in the market. In general, subject to regulatory review or other processes, appropriate incremental costs incurred by these entities would be recoverable from customers through applicable rate mechanisms, thereby mitigating the financial risk for these entities.\n\nPPL and its subsidiaries have credit policies in place to manage credit risk, including the use of an established credit approval process, daily monitoring of counterparty positions and the use of master netting agreements or provisions. These agreements generally include credit mitigation provisions, such as margin, prepayment or collateral requirements. PPL and its subsidiaries may request additional credit assurance, in certain circumstances, in the event that the counterparties' credit ratings fall below investment grade, their tangible net worth falls below specified percentages or their exposures exceed an established credit limit.\n\nMaster Netting Arrangements\n\n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nNet derivative positions on the balance sheets are not offset against the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the\n\nobligation to return cash collateral (a payable) under master netting arrangements.\n\nPPL had no obligation and an immaterial obligation to return cash collateral under master netting arrangements at\n\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nPPL had no obligation to post cash collateral under master netting arrangements at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n139",

A variety of financial derivative instruments are utilized to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolios, adjust the duration of the debt portfolios and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. Risk limits under PPL's risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolio due to changes in benchmark interest rates. In addition, the interest rate risk of certain subsidiaries is potentially mitigated as a result of the existing regulatory framework or the timing of rate cases.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges (PPL)\n\nInterest rate risks include exposure to adverse interest rate movements for outstanding variable rate debt and for future anticipated financings. Financial interest rate swap contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges may be entered into to hedge floating interest rate risk associated with both existing and anticipated debt issuances. PPL had no such contracts at December 31, 2021.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, PPL had no aggregate notional value in cross-currency interest rate swap contracts. In March 2021, $500 million of WPD's U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes were repaid prior to maturity and $500 million notional value of cross-currency interest rate swap contracts matured.\n\nCash flow hedges are discontinued if it is no longer probable that the original forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period and any amounts previously recorded in AOCI are reclassified into earnings once it is determined that the hedged transaction is not probable of occurring.\n\nFor 2021, 2020 and 2019, PPL had no cash flow hedges reclassified into earnings associated with discontinued cash flow hedges.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the amount of accumulated net unrecognized after-tax gains (losses) on qualifying derivatives expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months is insignificant. Amounts are reclassified as the hedged interest expense is recorded.\n\nEconomic Activity\n\n(PPL and LG&E)\n\nLG&E enters into interest rate swap contracts that economically hedge interest payments. Because realized gains and losses\n\nfrom the swaps, including terminated swap contracts, are recoverable through regulated rates, any subsequent changes in fair value of these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or liabilities until they are realized as interest expense. Realized gains and losses are recognized in \"Interest Expense\" on the Statements of Income at the time the underlying hedged interest expense is recorded. At December 31, 2021, LG&E held contracts with a notional amount of $64 million that mature in 2033.\n\n140",

PPL has adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, including firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, anticipated transactions, including the sale of its U.K utility business and net investments. In\n\naddition, PPL entered into financial instruments to protect against foreign currency translation risk of expected GBP earnings.\n\n## Net Investment Hedges\n\nPPL entered into foreign currency contracts on behalf of a subsidiary to protect the value of a portion of its net investment in WPD. There were no contracts outstanding at December 31, 2021.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, PPL had $33 million of accumulated net investment hedge after tax gains (losses) that were included in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of AOCI. The remaining balance was transferred out of AOCI and realized in discontinued operations as a result of the sale of the U.K. utility business.\n\n## Economic Activity\n\nPPL entered into foreign currency contracts on behalf of subsidiaries to economically hedge foreign-denominated anticipated earnings and anticipated transactions, including the sale of its U.K. utility business.\n\n## Accounting and Reporting\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nAll derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on the Balance Sheet as an asset or liability unless the Normal Purchase Normal Sale scope exception (NPNS) is elected. NPNS contracts include certain full-requirement purchase contracts and other physical purchase contracts. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as NPNS are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met and designated as such, except for the changes in fair values of LG&E's interest rate swaps that are recognized as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities.

Most of these features would require the transfer of additional collateral or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract if the applicable credit rating were to fall below investment grade. Some of these features also would allow the counterparty to require additional collateral upon each downgrade in credit rating at levels that remain above investment grade. In either case, if the applicable credit rating were to fall below investment grade, and assuming no assignment to an investment grade affiliate were allowed, most of these credit contingent features require either immediate payment of the net liability as a termination payment or immediate and ongoing full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions.\n\nAdditionally, certain derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features that require adequate assurance of performance be provided if the other party has reasonable concerns regarding the performance of PPL's, LG&E's and KU's obligations under the contracts. A counterparty demanding adequate assurance could require a transfer of additional collateral or other security, including letters of credit, cash and guarantees from a creditworthy entity. This would typically involve negotiations among the parties. However, amounts disclosed below represent assumed immediate payment or immediate and ongoing full collateralization for derivative instruments in net liability positions with \"adequate assurance\" features.\n\n(PPL)\n\nAt December 31, 2021, there were no derivative contracts in a net liability position that contain credit risk-related contingent\n\nfeatures, collateral posted on those positions and the related effect of a decrease in credit ratings below investment grade.\n\n19. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill\n\n(PPL)\n\nGoodwill for the Kentucky Regulated segment was $662 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Goodwill for Corporate and\n\nOther was $53 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020. There were no accumulated impairment losses related to goodwill.\n\n145",

Asset Retirement Obligations\n\n(PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nPPL Electric has identified legal retirement obligations for the retirement of certain transmission assets that could not be reasonably estimated due to indeterminable settlement dates. These assets are located on rights-of-way that allow the grantor to require PPL Electric to relocate or remove the assets. Since this option is at the discretion of the grantor of the right-of-way, PPL Electric is unable to determine when these events may occur.\n\n## (PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nPPL's, LG&E's and KU's ARO liabilities are primarily related to CCR closure costs. See Note 14 for information on the CCR rule. LG&E also has AROs related to natural gas mains and wells. LG&E's and KU's transmission and distribution lines largely operate under perpetual property easement agreements, which do not generally require restoration upon removal of the property. Therefore, no material AROs are recorded for transmission and distribution assets. For LG&E and KU, all ARO accretion and depreciation expenses are reclassified as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. ARO regulatory assets associated with certain CCR projects are amortized to expense in accordance with regulatory approvals. For other AROs, deferred accretion and depreciation expense is recovered through cost of removal.\n\nThe changes in the carrying amounts of AROs were as follows:\n\nPPL\n\nLG&E\n\nKU\n\n|                                                         |          |          | 2020    | 2020    | 2020       | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|---------|---------|------------|--------|\n|                                                         | 2021     | 2020     | 2021    |         | 2021       |        |\n| ARO at beginning of period Accretion                    | $ 182 16 | $ 215 15 | $ 67 5  | 73 5    | 115 $ 11   | 142 10 |\n|                                                         | 56       | 40       |         |         | 16         | 27     |\n| Changes in estimated timing or cost Obligations settled | (65)     | (88)     | 40 (28) | 13 (24) |            |        |\n| ARO at end of period                                    | 189      | 182      | 84      | 67      | (37) 105 $ | (64)   |\n|                                                         | $        | $        | $       |         |            | 115    |\n\n## 21.

PPL's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to PPL's management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal\n\nfinancial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in \"Internal Control - Integrated Framework\" (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in \"Internal Control - Integrated Framework\" (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective December 31, 2021. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm.\n\n150",
