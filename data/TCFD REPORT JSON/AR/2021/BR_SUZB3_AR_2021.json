More and more, Suzano is positioning itself in the group that wants to participate and lead the construction of a positive world for people and for the planet. To do that, the company decided to put innovation at the service of sustainability. Innovability is the natural calling of our company, a business that is inspired by the trees we plant and driven by solutions from renewable sources.\n\nSuzano pursues innovability in everything it does. In 2021, the company took important steps in this direction, for example, through its strategies for the development of bio-oil, an alternative to fossil fuels made from eucalyptus biomass, and through the joint venture with Spinnova to produce textile fiber made from pulp. Innovability is also manifested in the way the company outlines its investment strategies, such as in the Cerrado Project, which is on its way to becoming a benchmark in ecodesign and local development, and in the fact that it continues to be one of the largest global issuers of sustainability-linked bonds.\n\nWhile facing one of the most complex and urgent global problems we have ever faced, the climate crisis, Suzano made a public commitment to be part of the solution and took a stand at COP26 in favor of incorporating carbon costs into the global economy. Also, as global leaders in the pulp\n\nInnovability is the natural calling of our company - a business inspired by the trees we plant and driven by solutions created from renewable resources.\n\nand paper sector, we understand that we can help Brazil take a leading position on the world stage. Therefore, we strive to be more vocal and organize and engage more and more institutions and people to stand behind this agenda.\n\nIn the social arena, despite the challenges brought by the pandemic, we continue to expand our social performance through initiatives to create work and generate income, while developing strategies and metrics to address the issue of poverty in a systemic and structured way.\n\nIn a young, almost 100-year-old company, none of these initiatives would be possible without the courage to deal with what I consider to be a significant collective challenge: a change of mindset. In this journey, our solid corporate governance helps our senior leadership-and, consequently, all areas of our business-to further embrace and become more responsible for sustainability. Year after year, our organization's virtuous circle reflects our advances in governance, which includes an independent and increasingly diverse Board of Directors. Our Sustainability Committee and Strategy & Innovation Committee, for example, which are made up primarily of independent board members that are market references in their areas of activity and have different backgrounds, are currently major catalysts for the transformations undertaken by Suzano. They add different perspectives and point out trends to help us increasingly see beyond business as usual, which will meaningfully accelerate the company's\n\nevolution throughout this decade. Although governance has been a key driver in our company for many years, our commitment to achieving its highest standards is ongoing, cross cutting and long-term, serving as a guide for all of our business practices, from the Board of Directors to the frontline of our operations.\n\nAs a company that values business ambidexterity, all initiatives described in this report are anchored in our business strategy (which includes a long-term vision that considers a horizon of 10 to 15 years) and in excellence in the delivery of our results in the short term ( learn more in the chapter Suzano ). Our strategy is fully aligned with our Commitments to Renewing Life, reflecting our recognition that 'it is only good for us if it is good for the world', and with our ongoing commitment to remain an efficient and profitable company.\n\nTo make all this happen, we rely on our 36,000 direct and indirect employees, who are committed to making a difference in the daily lives of the people who consume our products and, most of all, to staying focused on generating and sharing value with our different stakeholders.\n\nStrongly-yet-gently, we will continue to invest in efficiency and in the growth of our current business, while also exploring new opportunities to renew life inspired by trees, as a way of sowing a positive future for all.\n\nDavid Feffer\n\nChairman of Suzano's Board of Directors",

MESSAGES L et t er f r om the CE O GRI 1 0 2-1 4\n\n## A C ompany C ommitt ed T O SOCI E T Y\n\nI would like to start this message by first thanking Suzano's more than 36,000 employees and contractors for another year dedicated to our forestry, industrial, laboratory and logistics operations and our administrative areas.\n\nAll our people had to adapt their lives to a new reality, whether working remotely or adopting new health and safety practices in operational areas. In an unstable environment, threatened by the pandemic, we managed to impact more than 2 billion people worldwide, who use our products and services daily. Thanks to the high level of commitment and competence of each employee, Suzano was proud to celebrate a year of excellent performance in 2021.\n\nWe believe that successful companies are those that can find convergence between efficiency, sustainability and transformation. In light of that, our participation in COP26 is an important demonstration of our commitment to being part of the evolution of society. We left the conference optimistic about the progress made by each country in their commitments in this area. Among the initiatives discussed at COP26 that I would like to highlight is the approval of the regulated carbon market.\n\nWe know that our planted trees and the preservation of native forests are part of the solution to the climate crisis. In a growing trend, our raw materials will replace nonrenewable resources. To this end, we will offer new products that, by design, are developed considering performance, competitiveness and sustainability throughout the value chain. A good example of this in 2021 was the announcement of a joint venture with\n\nSpinnova. Together, in our mill under construction in Finland, we will produce sustainable fibers from our planted and certified eucalyptus and the pulp we already manufacture for use in paper-unlike any other fiber currently used in the textile industry. In addition to producing lower CO2 emissions and using less water, the production process of this fiber does not use any fossil materials that could generate microplastics.\n\nWe also understand that we have an important challenge regarding our commitment to lift 200,000 people out of poverty in the areas where we operate. In 2021, we made progress in the pursuit of this target, but we know that the pandemic has highlighted social inequalities in Brazil, with a serious impact on communities. To overcome this challenge, we are expanding partnerships and further increasing our focus on the social initiatives coordinated by Suzano. We understand that this is our role.\n\nIt is extremely important to continue to invest in the production of competitive raw materials and, from there, in disruptive alternatives that can lead us to a better future. In this context, the regulated carbon market is also a key instrument for financing the decarbonization of the global economy. And our company, which has been increasingly vocal on issues that impact the world, has actively contributed to accelerating this process.\n\nWe believe that solutions to climate change, the loss of biodiversity and other systemic challenges of the 2030 Agenda cannot be reached by just one company or a small group of organizations. The response to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) involves more than 7 billion people. In other words, this is not a competition agenda-it is an agenda in which everyone wins, or everyone loses.\n\nWe are proud to belong to an industry that positively impacts Brazil and the planet. But there is more to be done by Suzano, as it continues to fulfill its purpose of renewing life inspired by trees . In 2020, we made a set of public commitments, in line with the SDGs, to be fulfilled by 2030. We will produce more clean energy in our operations and advance our efforts to reduce our carbon emissions (including those indirectly linked to our activities). We will continue to evolve on issues such as biodiversity conservation, waste and water management and, not least, diversity and inclusion, especially with regard to women, Black people, LGBTQIAP+ and people with disabilities, since we must give everyone the opportunity to have better representation and rise within the company.\n\nAll these initiatives earned us 15th place in the ranking of the top global companies recognized for their sustainability commitments and practices, according to the 25th GlobeScan / SustainAbility Leaders Survey, conducted by GlobeScan and The SustainAbility Institute by ERM.\n\nWe have many opportunities to be leaders in the process of transforming society. For this to happen, our daily behavior must reflect the changes we want to see in the world. Like any company, we have challenges. However, they will not be barriers to our performance as a company that is committed to the transformation of society. That is why, to deliver the best results as a company, we are committed to engaging other people, entities, governments and companies in this transformation agenda through innovation. This is what you will see on the next pages of our 2021 Annual Report.\n\nWalter Schalka CEO of Suzano",

There is no specific chapter dedicated to investors. However, since the topics of interest for this group are also cross cutting, they are detailed, in particular, in the chapter Suzano .\n\nSeeking to reflect the best practices of transparency to stakeholders, this report is prepared in accordance with the standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI, Core option) and follows the principles of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), which drive the communication of value creation, with focus and conciseness, and seek to ensure a balance between the positive and negative aspects of the issues reported.\n\nIn addition, this report is organized in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)-17 global goals established by the United Nations (UN) that are part of the 2030 Agenda.\n\nThe Annual Report is part of an information hub that also includes our Sustainability Center (formerly known as the Indicators Center). In it, we publish a comprehensive set of indicators that are based on frameworks of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) 1 for the Pulp and Paper Products, Forestry Management,\n\n8\n\nand Containers and Packaging industries, and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 2 , and are inspired by the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics 3 .\n\nIn addition to the Annual Report in PDF, we also have a strategic summary that includes two infographics.\n\n## MATERIALITY\n\nIn accordance with the mandatory guidelines established by the GRI and IIRC methodologies, Suzano's materiality is the intersection of topics that are relevant to the business from the perspective of our stakeholders and the analysis of the impacts related to these topics. In 2021, the materiality matrix was updated, according to the following steps:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThroughout this document, you will find links and 'learn more' features to give you access to additional information included in our Sustainability Center and other websites and platforms, to enhance your browsing experience and expand your knowledge about Suzano.\n\n## 1 Identification\n\nAnalysis of internal and external documents, including relevant and benchmark studies and surveys about the industry.\n\n## 2 Prioritization\n\nInterviews with five company leaders/executives and external stakeholders and sectoral studies to identify impacts on the industry conducted by relevant organizations, such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), in addition to documents from IFC, WWF and TNC.\n\n## 3 Analysis\n\nIn the analysis and weighting, the perceptions of each stakeholder, as well as the topics identified, received the weights recommended by the methodology, producing a matrix with internal and external perspectives.\n\n## 4 Validation of results\n\nValidation of the list of topics by the Sustainability area and leaders, and definition of level of detail and boundaries established for each topic, according to the methodological recommendation.\n\nIt is important to mention that the process of updating Suzano's materiality took into account the most current concepts related to dynamic materiality and double materiality.\n\nKeep reading to learn about the list of material topics for Suzano:",

Together, native forests and eucalyptus plantations directly  contribute to the removal and storage of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from the air, preservation of biodiversity  and regulation of the hydrological cycle, among other benefits. At the same time, the company has  industrial and logistics activities that are highly intensive in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  This places great responsibility on the company to mitigate and adapt to climate change, as it works with  governments, civil society and other private entities to address this challenge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Be increasingly  climate positive   Emissions            | Forestry | Industry                                                                                         | Supply of wood  and other inputs                                                                 | Transport and  Logistics                                                                         | Marketing and  Customers                                                                         | Resale and   End Consumers               |\n| Biodiversity      | connected to the deforestation of the Atlantic Forest, a biodiversity hotspot, and also pose a risk to other  biomes, even though most companies no longer work with deforested areas. Other impacts on biodiversity  may include: loss of habitat; fragmentation of biomes by anthropic actions; scaring away and trampling the  fauna; changes in native vegetation; loss of individual flora species; microclimate and landscape alteration. On the other hand, in addition to lumber production, forests provide valuable ecosystem services, including  carbon sequestration, wildlife habitat, water purification and storage, soil formation and recreational  opportunities. Protecting or enhancing ecosystem services within managed forests could mitigate  reputation, demand and operational risks related to the potential negative environmental impacts of  forestry. | Conservation  of Biodiversity Water in the  Forest Waste | Forestry | Industry                                                                                         | Supply of wood  and other inputs                                                                 | Transport and  Logistics                                                                         | Marketing and  Customers                                                                         | Resale and   End Consumers               |\n| Land  development | Conflicts with communities, including both indigenous and traditional peoples, can affect a company's  ability to operate in certain regions, result in regulatory action, and impact the brand.

Process  water typically contains dissolved organic compounds and other solids, underscoring the importance of its  treatment. Water availability is an important consideration for the industry, as shortages can result in higher  supply costs, supply interruptions or tension with local users. Scarcity can be even more critical when it comes  to forest areas, since it can reduce forest productivity or even create conflicts with neighboring communities.  Because of its productivity, eucalyptus converts a large amount of water resources into biomass in a relatively                                                                                       | Water in   the Forest Water in  Industry                 | Forestry | Industry                                                                                         | Supply of wood  and other inputs                                                                 | Logistics Transport and  Logistics                                                               | Customers Marketing and  Customers                                                               | End Consumers Resale and   End Consumers |\n\n11\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Human rights include the right to life and liberty, freedom of opinion  and expression, the right to work and education, and others. In the case of Suzano and forestry companies, which occupy large tracts of land with eucalyptus or pine  monoculture, the right of access to natural resources and land, especially of traditional communities or  communities that live off the land, can be violated. In addition, forced and/or compulsory labor and child  labor can still be found on eucalyptus plantations in Brazil, particularly in those where eucalyptus is used for | Diversity and  Inclusion Water in the  Forest | Forestry | Industry Supply of wood  and other inputs                                          | Transport and  Logistics | Marketing and  Customers | Resale and   End Consumers |       |\n\n## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\n## Supplier Management\n\n## Innovability\n\nFor Suzano, diversity, equity and inclusion are not only a duty, but also a business strategy. In a diverse and inclusive environment, employees are more involved, creative and collaborative, and the rates of attraction and retention of new talent increase significantly. The topic must also be considered in all company practices, including while dealing with local communities, managing its suppliers or developing new products. Among the negative impacts of unproper management of this topic, we can include operational costs, reputational risks and contribution to increased social inequality. On the positive side, proper management of this topic can lead to gender and racial equality, and the inclusion of historically excluded people. In the context of a country like Brazil, the fight against machismo, racism and various forms of discrimination includes promoting and valuing these minorities in the workplace as well.\n\nThe traceability of a product is an important feature to ensure that, if there is a quality problem, it is easily traceable, enabling recall. For the forestry sector, having the assurance (by a certifier) that the forest from which the raw material comes is being exploited in compliance with the law and correctly from an ecological, social and economic standpoint, differentiates the product of similar ones and adds value. Among the impacts of properly managing this topic, we can include brand protection; quality control; added value to the final product; the production of forest products in a sustainable way; as well as the cascading of good practices through the chain of custody. On the negative side, impacts may include operational costs and/or remediation costs; non-compliance with legislation; loss of biodiversity; contamination of water resources and violations of human rights.\n\nContinuous investment in technology and a culture of innovation that drives the development of solutions for the biggest challenges that society faces (enabling the transition to the bioeconomy) are central elements of this topic, in addition to adding greater competitive advantage. The addition of sustainability to this topic reflects the ability of an organization to innovate in a sustainable way and to leverage sustainability as a pathway for innovation, new business and differentiation. At Suzano, innovability is directly linked to its ambition to be a regenerative company that wants productivity to be part of its chain, from end to end; create a competitive advantage based on customer needs and new ways of using and applying its inputs; and seeks new businesses, solutions and products from trees, for a more renewable future.\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\nWater in\n\n| the Forest   |          |          | Supply of wood   | Transport and   | Marketing and   |\n|--------------|----------|----------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Water in     | Forestry | Industry | and other inputs | Logistics       | Customers       |\n| Industry     |          |          |                  |                 |                 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSupply of wood\n\nand other inputs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nForestry\n\nIndustry\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWaste\n\nProducts from\n\nRenewable\n\nSources\n\nEnergy\n\nMarketing and\n\nCustomers\n\nResale and\n\nEnd Consumers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTransport and\n\nLogistics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nForestry\n\nIndustry\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSupply of wood\n\nand other inputs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTransport and\n\nLogistics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMarketing and\n\nCustomers\n\nResale and\n\nEnd Consumers\n\n<!-- image -->",

They inspire our purpose of renewing life inspired by trees and the 15 long-term goals the company calls Commitments to Renewing Life -made, also, as a way to address some of the main challenges facing the world in the 21 st century.\n\nSuzano is a global leader in its industry. It has an installed production capacity of 10.9 million tonnes of pulp per year, exports to more than 100 countries and, through its products, participates in the lives of more than 2 billion people around the world. Given this magnitude, it is natural for the company to assume a leading role in the most relevant discussions for society and the planet. And innovability is an attribute for which Suzano wants to be recognized, based on its main asset: its areas\n\nof eucalyptus plantations and of native forests set aside for conservation.\n\nThis concept is anchored in one of our organization's cultural pillars ('It is only good for Suzano if it is good for the world'), a value that has influenced all business decisions since 2019, when the company defined its Cultural Drivers . Innovability is reflected not only in the way the company develops projects and processes, but in the governance established to address this issue. Currently, the advisory committees within Suzano's Board of Directors include a Sustainability and a Strategy & Innovation committee. Together, the two bodies establish convergent agendas, following the principle of 'and' rather than 'or'. In other words, through the activities of these groups and the management of indicators of quantity, quality and speed of transformation, the agendas of the future are kept alive in the company's everyday activities, ensuring that short-term needs do not prevent Suzano from thinking in the long term and reaching its next evolutionary level.\n\nInnovation is the 'how' of our journey. We want to be a company that exudes this attribute and is focused not only on the co-creation of solutions developed from planted trees, to support a low carbon economy, but also on the way we work with all our stakeholders-in social projects and environmental issues, initiatives with suppliers or in the way we access the financial market. Today, this concept is at the core of every\n\nSuzano initiative. Throughout the chapters of this report, you will learn about dozens of projects, of different scales and maturity levels, that, for example, aim to leverage the potential of eucalyptus to replace plastics and other fossil-derived products, apply microfibrillated cellulose technology in textile production or contribute to the creation of a regulated carbon market that can help countries address the effects of climate change.\n\nCurrently, 70% of our Research and Development portfolio is made up of shortand medium-term projects-that is, projects that will be implemented in up to five years. We have the ambition to offer solutions that are still under development, such as new applications for lignin, nanocellulose, biocomposites and bio-oil. Our mission is to make these applications viable, through feasible processes. The remaining 30% of our portfolio requires five years or more and the participation of other value chains to be developed.\n\nWe remain firmly on the path of transformation, although the company still has a long way to go in partnership with startups, universities, associations, research centers, customers, governments and other companies in Brazil and abroad. This is part of a strong effort to change mindsets, promote collaboration and share knowledge that will help us drive the evolution we want to see at Suzano and in society, for the sake of a better world.",

These are the steps that will need to be taken in the next five years to ensure the company's success. The ambitions that translate the avenues to be pursued are:\n\nOn the third level of our strategy are the medium-term battles that will support the achievement of our ambitions and include specific initiatives for each major avenue.

In 2021, the company created a department to manage our strategy, business, relationships and future in the country, with the goal of ensuring a strong presence for the company, as well as expanding the offering of nature-based solutions and connections with different stakeholders, including academy, the government and civil society, among other local players.\n\nCurrently, the Asian market accounts for between 40% and 50% of Suzano's revenue. This includes China, the country with the highest annual demand and consumption of pulp. Therefore, there is an opportunity to increase the share of hardwood fiber in this market and also in the manufacturing processes followed by our current customers, since some of them use a mix of fibers in their paper production that includes not only hardwood pulp but also softwood pulp and recycled fiber.\n\nSuzano positions itself as a platform that offers multiple solutions to support China in its transition to a low carbon economy. In this sense, there are other business opportunities with the introduction of new solutions by the company that are not yet offered in the country, such as microfibrillated cellulose, or MFC (which can be used as an additive for special papers and cosmetics), as well as the possibility to offer energy products (through bio-oil produced from planted forests) and carbon credits. China currently faces a significant decarbonization challenge-approximately 65% of the country's energy matrix is made up of fossil fuels.",

Therefore, our long-term strategic vision combines the competitiveness of our business with sustainable development.\n\nIn 2021, Suzano advanced important aspects of its sustainability governance. The company expanded the discussions of the Sustainability Committee, which\n\nis linked to the Board of Directors, coordinated by the Chairman of the Board and has five independent members. The group discussed trends, studies and future market analyses, among other topics, making this an increasingly strategic space for discussion. The impacts of the Cerrado project were also extensively analyzed by the committee.\n\nIn addition, we created the Strategic Forum on ESG Commitments and Indices, which happens three times a year to monitor and discuss performance, risks and opportunities related to the Commitments to Renewing Life and to analyze our progress regarding ESG indices. This forum follows a cross-cutting approach, with people from different levels, including members of the Executive Committee, assuming responsibility for all of the company's sustainability efforts.\n\nWe also have Commitment Working Groups (WGs) to manage our long-term goals. Made up of employees from different levels and areas, these groups monitor the quantitative and qualitative indicators, the main projects, advances and the interconnection between the Commitments. In 2021, the WGs met monthly. This governance helps the company address sustainability in a cross-cutting manner.\n\nFROM 2030 TO 2025 GRI 103-1, 103-2\n\nUnderstanding the urgency of developing efficient measures to mitigate climate change, we expanded the debate on this issue at Suzano to explore what else we could do, since we recognize that we are part of the solution. One of the concrete measures was to announce the acceleration, from 2030 to 2025, of our commitment to remove 40 million tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere.\n\nIn addition, throughout the year, we emphasized that, for Suzano, 2050 is now. Therefore, we need to act in a meaningful way and engage companies, industries and governments to move forward with us in the implementation of strong measures that can ensure that the increase in global temperature will not exceed 1.5 \u00baC.

Considering our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and the removals originating from our planted and conserved forests, we reached a balance of 15,200,312 tonnes of CO 2 e removed from the atmosphere in 2020 and 8,896,257 tonnes of CO 2 e in 2021 2 . It is expected that there will be a variation in our removal capacity over time, primarily due to dynamics related to forest management and the volume of available wood.\n\nThere was an increase in scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of 11.4% in 2021, which leads to a 0.1995 tCO 2 e/t indicator. The increase in relation to 2020 was due to production increase, but also to an increase in the consumption of fossil fuels in industrial operations, as a result of occasional problems in boilers and a retrofit seeking a better use of biomass in the future and an increase in mobile emissions due to the expansion of forestry operations. Also in Brazil, we had an increase in the emission factor of the energy purchased from the National Interconnected System (SIN in Portuguese acronym). However, the indicator is still within the expected range.\n\n## Baseline:\n\n2\n\n0 (2020\n\n)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProgress against the baseline: 60.2%\n\n## Baseline:\n\n0.2133 tCO 2 e/tonne (2015 5,6 )\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProgress against the baseline: 43.06%\n\n## Baseline: 0 (2019 7 )\n\nProgress against the baseline: 0.3%\n\n## Status\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nadvanced progress\n\n## Status\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprogress as expected\n\n## Status\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprogress as expected\n\nWe will continue to expand our base of native and eucalyptus forests, while working to ensure high forest productivity. In addition, Suzano will also work to reduce the intensity of its scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by reducing the consumption of materials that generate greenhouse gases throughout our operations.\n\nWe will continue to participate in a pilot project of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol of a new guide on how companies account for and report their emissions and removals from land use (Land Sector and Removals Guidance 3 ), in addition to following the evolution of other methodologies, such as Science Based Target: Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) 4 .\n\nMotivated by the significant progress toward the target in recent years, Suzano is reviewing its methodological bases to expand its ambition, both related to its own emissions reduction and to that of the value chain. In this sense, in 2021 we joined global initiatives and commitments that support the decarbonization of the economy, such as the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi), Climate Action 100+ and Race to Zero. Learn more in the chapter Planet of this report.\n\nWe will continue advancing the families of products already launched, such as Bluecup\u00ae and Loop\u00ae, in addition to complementing our portfolio with products that will be developed in the coming years. The construction of our plant in Finland, in partnership with Spinnova, will enable the large-scale use of microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) by the textile industry. We will continue to explore the potential of lignin as an alternative to fossil-based inputs in high-performance industrial applications. In addition, we will deepen our potential market analysis, studies and strategic partnership negotiations for the commercialization of bio-oil, a renewable fuel produced from eucalyptus.\n\n- 6.  All the information necessary to set the target was extracted from the greenhouse gas inventories of the former companies Suzano Papel e Celulose and Fibria.\n- 7.  The scope of this target includes the accumulated sales of products from renewable sources from 2020 through 2030. This does not mean that Suzano had not offered products from renewable sources before 2020. It just means that, for the purpose of this target, we started to calculate and account for our product offering in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRemove 40 million tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere by 2025 1\n\nReduce the intensity of scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 15% per tonne of production by 2030\n\nOffer 10 million tonnes of products from renewable sources that can replace plastic and other petroleum-based products, by 2030\n\nIn 2021, we offered approximately 32,000 tonnes of products from renewable sources. This result was driven by high demand in the packaging market. We advanced the Bluecup Bio\u00ae and Loop\u00ae lines, developed the Greenbag\u00ae and Greenpack\u00ae papers, and a paper for cardboard liner and fluting medium. We started selling lignin produced at the Limeira unit. In addition, we announced a joint venture with Spinnova and the construction of a plant for the production of textile fiber from microfibrillated cellulose.\n\n- 1. The deadline was brought forward from 2030 to 2025 in the understanding that this is an emergency. Learn more in the chapter Suzano.\n- 2.  Suzano has removed carbon from the atmosphere in previous years, but for the purpose of this target, removals will be counted from 2020 onwards.\n- 3.

Watersheds that are considered critical are subject to water unavailability due to natural characteristics (such as climate and soil type) and type of land use (such as pastures, agricultural crops, etc.). Suzano is focusing on hydrographic basins that are significantly occupied by the company (equal to or greater than 30%), to ensure that forest management practices can have an effect and produce the best results to reverse the criticality of these basins and consequent water unavailability.\n- 9.  At the time this target was set, in 2019, we still did not have data for the entire year.

On the other hand, we were impacted by the shutdown of one of the turbogenerators at the Imperatriz unit in the first half of the year, which significantly affected the total volume of energy exports. The turbogenerator operation was stabilized in early 2022. Despite that, we exported 189 MWm of renewable energy.\n\nIn 2021, we focused on establishing a governance model to enable structured and transparent execution. We collected information to feed our georeferenced database, to understand the characteristics of the regions within the ecological corridors and determine the main variables to guide the development of action plans. We created metrics to determine priority conservation areas to be connected, considering the best paths and the optimization of resources in the creation of corridors that will support the improvement of biodiversity in these regions. We redesigned the paths of the corridors, seeking the most effective routes to increase the connectivity of the fragments. The process also included interviews with rural landowners in the areas through which the corridors will pass, to devise effective engagement strategies. In addition, we mapped the institutions and leaders of these locations to identify ongoing restoration and sustainable development initiatives, to strengthen the relationship with these stakeholders and identify opportunities for synergy in the development of social and environmental activities.\n\n## Baseline: 214 MWm (2018 12 )\n\nProgress against the baseline: 0%\n\nBaseline: in study\n\n## Status\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprogress below expected\n\nWe will continue to work on the development of projects aimed at increasing the availability of steam for energy generation, including improving the performance of our turbines and optimizing thermal consumption, in addition to promoting initiatives to reduce energy consumption. We will also implement modernization projects in some of our industrial units, both to optimize energy consumption and to increase the amount of energy generated.\n\nOur goal is to prepare executive projects for the corridors, seek partners and funders, engage stakeholders within the areas where they are located, initiate management activities along the corridors and monitor human pressures and the risk of forest fires in these locations.",

In 2021, our Board of Directors was supported by the Supervisory Board, the Executive Committee and six other advisory committees, including the Sustainability and Strategy & Innovation Committees.\n\nThe Board is frequently evaluated and has the support of Suzano's Executive Committee, which shares responsibilities on social and environmental issues that are relevant to the business. All members of the Executive Committee have at least one sustainability goal linked to their variable compensation\n\n(representing at least 10% of their short-term variable compensation).\n\nIn 2021, the Board of Directors had ten members, including seven independent directors, as listed below:\n\n- \\_ Ana Paula Pessoa (board member)\n- \\_ Claudio Thomaz Lobo Sonder (vice-chairman)\n- \\_ Daniel Feffer (vice-chairman)\n- \\_ David Feffer (chairman)\n- \\_ Helio Lima Magalh\u00e3es (board member)\n- \\_ Maria Priscila Rodini Vansetti Machado (board member)\n- \\_ Nildemar Secches (board member)\n- \\_ Paulo Rogerio Caffarelli (board member)\n- \\_ Rodrigo Calvo Galindo (board member)\n- \\_ Rodrigo Kede de Freitas Lima (board member)\n\nAracruz unit (state of Esp\u00edrito Santo).

This process includes three main lines of action: integrated risk management, compliance and ombudsman.\n\nWe have an Integrated Risk Management Policy , that applies to all areas.\n\nThe analysis of risks considers the following impact parameters: financial, health and safety, environmental, social, cultural, image and reputation, organizational climate and legal, according to levels of probability (very likely, probable, possible and remote).\n\nPeriodically, the Risk area conducts an enterprise risk management (ERM) process, which, through workshops and interviews with the main executives, reassesses the company's main risks and the opportunity to map new ones. Those classified as priorities according to the methodology are periodically reported to the Executive Committee, the Statutory Audit Committee and the Board of Directors, ensuring proper supervision.\n\nIt is worth noting that, in 2021, the Executive Board and the members of the Board of Directors were trained in risk management and crisis management. The company also trained key employees who work directly in the management of risks and crises in our locations.\n\nPaper Machine 1, Limeira unit (state of S\u00e3o Paulo).

In 2021, the company restructured the Information Security area. Its mission is to mitigate and prevent vulnerabilities to ensure cyber security and the protection of assets, especially information and personal data, providing confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity and legality, to reduce the risks that may impact the business.\n\n## \\_ ETHICAL CONDUCT AND MANAGEMENT\n\nThe company has a Code of Conduct, an Ombudsman Policy, a Disciplinary Measures Policy and Rules for the Conduct Committee, which are all instruments to guide the ethical management of the business and establish the guidelines of the company's governance process. These documents address compliance with legal and regulatory provisions that apply to each area and the Ombudsman Channel, and the appropriate regulations, including specific procedures and confidentiality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \\_ CODE OF CONDUCT\n\nOur Code of Conduct includes the six ethical principles that guide our everyday behaviors, focusing on the quality of our relationships, products and services. We are committed to transparency, equity, accountability and corporate responsibility, as well as to ensuring human rights within our operations.\n\nThe Code of Conduct and mandatory training on it were updated in 2021, according to our bylaws. The revised document, available in English, Mandarin, Portuguese and Spanish, establishes guidelines and principles related to the General Data Protection Law, medical and health measures in times of epidemics and pandemics, integrity, equality and relationships with suppliers. In addition, it includes new information on sustainability and harassment, among other issues.

These documents formalize the anti-corruption guidelines that must be followed by all employees in their daily activities, as well as in our relationships with business partners.\n\nThe Social and Environmental Investments and Donations Policy establishes the flow that must be followed and the levels of approval for donations, sponsorships and cooperation agreements.

In 2020, the company issued its first bond based on the SLB Principles, becoming the second company in the world and the first in the Americas to issue a bond of this kind. In 2021, Suzano issued two additional sustainability-linked bonds that, for the first time, were linked to something other than an environmental or social target: a diversity, equity and inclusion target.\n\nThe two targets set by Suzano for the bond issued in June were a 12.4% reduction in the volume of water withdrawn for industrial operations, from 29.8 m\u00b3/tonne in 2018 to 26.1 m\u00b3/tonne by 2026, and an increase in the percentage of women in leadership positions\n\n(manager and above), from 16% in 2019 to 30% by 2025. Both targets are in line with our Commitments to Renewing Life.\n\nThis US$1 billion bond, maturing in 2032, has a 3.28% yield and a 3.125% coupon per annum, and marked the first time a Latin American company linked a diversity and inclusion target to a SLB.\n\nIn September 2021, the company issued another SLB linked to the same commitments and maturing in 2028. The funding attracted a total demand of US$3.4 billion, or 6.8 times the size of the transaction, completed with the issuance of US$500 million in international bonds. The bond issued will have a 2.5% coupon per annum. The total return to investors, of 2.7% per year, is the lowest rate in history for a bond with a seven-year term issued by a Brazilian company.\n\nThis bond is structured such that if the company fails to reach the proposed targets, the interest rate for the remuneration of investors will be increased by 12.5 basis points for each target not reached by the deadline, up to an additional 25 basis points.\n\nIn addition to the SLBs, in February 2021 Suzano signed an export prepayment agreement in the form of a Sustainability Linked-Loan (SLL) in the amount of US$1.57 billion, at LIBOR plus 1.15% per annum and an average term of 60 months, with final maturity on March 8, 2027. This transaction has environmental performance indicators associated with targets for reducing the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions and industrial water withdrawal.\n\nThe funding attracted a total of\n\nUS$3.4 billion, or 6.8 times the size of the transaction, completed with\n\nthe issuance of US$500 million in international bonds.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo learn more about the bonds based on the SLB Principles issued by Suzano, read the SPO and Framework .",

The meeting was also an excellent opportunity for the company to announce a new Commitment to Renewing Life related to biodiversity : connecting, by 2030, half a million hectares of priority areas for conservation in the Cerrado, Atlantic Forest and Amazon biomes. The meeting was also broadcast live to different stakeholders, including company employees via Workplace.\n\nYear after year, we seek to expand the ways we communicate with our audiences, including via our social media accounts, our various online platforms or, whenever possible, face-toface discussions facilitated by the company to continuously strengthen our internal and external connections.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe event was attended by Suzano leaders and mediated by Pavan Sukhdev, a specialist with global influence and extensive experience in innovative solutions that promote sustainability.

The collaborative spirit that has been experienced since the beginning of the pandemic was essential for the company to do well during this time. Determined to overcome this crisis together, we continued to implement projects to improve the mental health and quality of life of everyone in the organization.\n\nTo improve our approach to health from a global perspective, we created opportunities to enable more active listening and to allow our employees and their families to relax. We reinforced dialogue during these times of remote work and made the topic of corporate happiness a priority on the agenda of our leaders, since we believe that 'the better new'-the way we started referring to the post-pandemic world-can, indeed, be better than before.\n\n## EMOTIONAL STRENGTH\n\nThe new work-from-home model adopted by our employees in administrative functions required adjustments in the routine of our teams. The same was true for operational workers, who, because Suzano's activities are considered essential, continued to work in person and without interruption in our operations, following all health and safety protocols. Whenever necessary, employees with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 were put on leave, which created a temporary work overload for other people in their team-a fact that was also taken into account by the company.\n\nSuzano understands that the creation of long-term value depends on constant dialogue with its stakeholders.

Photo: M\u00e1rcio Schimming.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, we created a working group focused on corporate happiness and we are increasingly investing in training on humanized leadership. As part of this effort, we invited Tal Ben-Shahar, a Harvard professor of Positive Psychology and a Columbia professor of Happiness Studies, to give a lecture that helped our executive and functional directors understand what happiness is and how to incorporate it into the company.\n\nWe also launched the Ecoa platform ('Echo' platform), a learning ecosystem in the area of health and safety, through which we guide leaders on how to build bonds of trust within the organization, as well as other behavior aspects that are relevant to the company and our leadership. We remain dedicated to initiatives to improve the\n\nquality of life of our employees, who still face the stress and pressure caused by COVID-19. Among them, we continue to offer medical and psychological support for employees and their families, in addition to facilitating physical and mindfulness activities, among other well-being initiatives.\n\n## \\_ WE ARE PLURAL\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I), a topic that began to be addressed by the company in 2016 in an organic and voluntary way, became more formally structured through the Plural program.\n\nPlural seeks to ensure that employees are respected and can express their uniqueness, to\n\nincrease representation and to encourage universal participation in five areas: generations, LGBTQIAP+, Black people, women, and people with disabilities.\n\nIn 2021, the program included several internal activities within the diversity, equity and inclusion agenda, such as training for executives and employees; surveys; virtual meetings with influencers and experts; employer branding initiatives to attract talent; and networking with executives with an active profile on LinkedIn.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, the target related to the inclusion of women in leadership positions (managers and above) is an indicator in two sustainability-linked bonds.\n\nTo fulfill our commitments, we have been working on the three axes described to the right:\n\nEvili da Cunha Silva, Processes and Quality engineering trainee, Imperatriz unit (state of Maranh\u00e3o).

In 2021, 55% of the people hired for our Internship program were women, 50% were Black and 13% were LGBTQIAP+. For our Trainee program, 60% of the people hired were women, 37% were Black, 30% were LGBTQIAP+ and 3% were people with disabilities.\n\nENGAGEMENT/ RETENTION\n\nWe launched a survey to measure how inclusive our environment is ( learn more below ) and hosted lectures on LGBTQIAP+ rights, racism and careers for people with disabilities. We also held discussions with executives and hosted events to celebrate dates and months that are important to each affinity group, reaching more than 40,000 people.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe trained women and people with disabilities for our industrial and forestry operations, and provided technology training for Black employees through the Afrodev program ( click here to learn more ). In 2021, our training program also included diversity, equity and inclusion (for 100% of the People and Management team); racial literacy (for Suzano's directors); how to self-declare in racial and ethnic terms; and the launch of a permanent self-declaration. Finally, we approved a program, called Elos D+ , to accelerate the career of women and/or Black employees, which will include approximately 350 participants starting in 2022.",

In addition to the activities in the attraction/hiring, development and engagement/retention axes previously mentioned, other initiatives during the year included:\n\n\\_ Women: endorsement of the Mulher 360 Movement ('Women 360' Movement) and the Mulher Florestal Network ('Forestry Women' Network); monitoring of the representation of women at each stage of selection processes; and literacy and engagement activities; The company made significant progress with regard to the number of women in leadership positions (functional managers and above): from 15.8% in 2019 to 22.5% at the end of 2021.\n\n\\_ Black people: proactive identification of Black talent in the market for future leadership positions at Suzano; sponsorship of the Yes to Racial Equality Forum; support for the Yes to Quota campaign; and celebration of Black Culture month, which included an external virtual live event on Afrofuturism. Considering just our Commitment to Renewing Life, which focus only on functional management positions and above, the increase was 21%, from 71 Black managers and directors to 86 in December 2021. According to these number, Black people currently occupy 19.7% of senior leadership positions at Suzano.\n\n22.5% OF OUR SENIOR LEADERSHIP ROLES ARE OCCUPIED BY WOMEN\n\n31% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF BLACK PEOPLE working as supervisors, In 2021, we had a\n\ncoordinators, managers\n\nand directors\n\n\\_LGBTQIAP+: endorsement of Pride Skill (an initiative by Procter & Gamble to encourage people to add 'pride' to their list of professional skills); start of a project to adapt bathrooms in the units; a survey on inclusion in our international offices; development of training content; and internal and external activities. We aim to have a 100% inclusive environment, in which people can feel welcomed, respected and safe to be who they really are within the organization. We achieved positive results with regard to the degree of inclusion of this group, which was confirmed by an internal survey ( see results on the next page ).\n\n\\_Generations: revitalization of the affinity group; hiring of a specialized consultant to create the strategic plan for the year; increased discussion on the topic of happiness connected to generations; launch of the web series Hiring 40+, in partnership with Infojobs and Hub40+; and meetings and events to promote education on ageism.\n\nNatani Martins Silva, Logistics assistant, at the Aparecida do Taboado (state of Mato Grosso do Sul) Intermodal Terminal.

The study, developed by GlobeScan, was conducted by the company in partnership with Goldenberg Diversity and Inclusion Consulting. The objective was to measure the degree of inclusion perceived by our employees with regards to three pillars: governance, culture and experience.\n\nIn 2021, we conducted two rounds of survey, covering all company employees. Our samples included 10% of the total number of employees in our international offices and 30% in Brazil.\n\nThe results of this pioneering initiative enabled us to identify the perceptions regarding inclusion in the work environment, not only in the pillars previously mentioned, but also with regard to Suzano's five DE&I focus areas, as well as per location, job category and other variables. Based on the results, we identified priorities that\n\nwere addressed throughout the year, through activities linked especially to careers, a common pain point for all affinity groups.\n\nSince our long-term commitments include ensuring a 100% inclusive environment for LGBTQIAP+ and people with disabilities, here are the results of a survey that measured how inclusive our company is regarding these groups:\n\n## LGBTQIAP+\n\n92.4% in February\n\n92.6%\n\nin August\n\n## People with disabilities\n\n- 91% in August\n- 91.8% in February\n\n## \\_ STANDARDS\n\n| Employees, by functional category 1 GRI 102-8   | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Administrative                                  | 3,222  | 2,998  | 3,349  |\n| Consultant                                      | 595    | 612    | 706    |\n| Coordinator                                     | 304    | 300    | 361    |\n| Director                                        | 20     | 17     | 21     |\n| Executive Director                              | 12     | 11     | 13     |\n| Specialist                                      | 78     | 47     | 61     |\n| Executive Manager                               | 92     | 95     | 117    |\n| Functional Manager                              | 289    | 294    | 326    |\n| Operational                                     | 8,978  | 10,208 | 11,341 |\n| Supervisor                                      | 307    | 327    | 401    |\n| Chairperson                                     | 1      | 1      | 1      |\n| Total                                           | 13,898 | 14,910 | 16,697 |\n\n- 1.

We executed 99% of the activities that had been planned for the year (totaling 691 initiatives), as follows:\n\n- \\_ 100% of the activities planned for the Paper industrial units, ports and distribution centers\n- \\_ 99% of the activities planned for the Forestry and Pulp industrial units \\_ 98% of the activities planned for the Consumer Goods industrial units\n\nThe Cuidar program follows the Hearts & Minds methodology, developed by the Energy Institute, which introduces dimensions in occupational safety to guide the creation of effective actions. Following this methodology, we carry out assessments of the maturity of the company's safety culture in all sites and our progress is monitored by an internal\n\n## SITUATIONS REPORTED\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nteam together with an external consultant. In 2021, the results of this evaluation showed an  8.77% improvement compared to the previous year. This progress demonstrates that this culture continues to evolve as a value that is part of our routine.\n\nWe invest in technology and promote a collaborative management model through which all employees and contractors may report situations that deviate from our standards and that must be dealt with by the leader of the responsible area. The measures taken are monitored through the Safety Management Indicator (SMI), which is reported monthly to all levels of Suzano.\n\nWe strive to avoid accidents and have a robust structure to evaluate incidents, which ensures that the measures we take are effective.\n\nSuzano's operational units have structured safety committees that are divided into smaller subcommittees that work in discussions, analyzes and implementations related to health and safety\n\nand in the activities carried out by the Internal Commission for Accident Prevention (CIPA, for its initials in Portuguese).\n\nIn 2021, we had three fatalities involving outsourced workers within Suzano's forestry operations. We deeply regret these incidents. Together with the companies responsible for hiring these employees, we offered our support to their families. Each case was extensively analyzed and, based on these assessments, we revised processes and behaviors to incorporate improvements and to ensure that we have even stricter procedures aimed at the safety of our employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVisit our Sustainability Center to learn more.\n\n## 2021 RESULTS\n\nWe had a 19% improvement in the indicators used to assess our safety tools.\n\nSMI: 89% , COMPARED TO 82% IN 2020\n\nSafety Quality Indicator (SQI): 91% , COMPARED TO 86% IN 2020\n\nOverall Safety Indicator (average between\n\nSMI and SQI) 91% , COMPARED TO 84% IN 2020\n\n| Suzano's safety indicators                      | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| IGS (Safety Management Indicator)               | 89%    | 82%    | 89%    |\n| IQS (Safety Quality Indicator)                  | 90%    | 86%    | 91%    |\n| IS (Safety Indicator - average of IGS and IQS)\u00b9 | n/a    | 84%    | 91%    |\n\n- 1.

Continuing with the initiatives implemented in 2020, we offered to our employees an online counseling platform completely free of charge. We also concluded the development of our Faz Bem Suzano app ('Good for You Suzano' app), which contains resources aimed at promoting and preserving physical and mental health. At the same time, we continued to host virtual events that discussed issues such as quality of life, mental health and physical health.\n\nIn addition, to stress the fact that we must take care of ourselves inside and outside our work environment, we developed an initiative called Cuidar em Todo Lugar ('Caring Everywhere'). Through videos, games, lectures and other activities, we want to promote discussions and reflections among friends and family members.\n\nLayara Oliveira, Communications analyst (left), Deborah Zaine do Nascimento Felipe de Carvalho, Drying Machine operator (center), and Vin\u00edcius Ferreira Mendes (right), Logistics analyst, Imperatriz unit (state of Maranh\u00e3o). Photo: M\u00e1rcio Schimming.\n\n## \\_ Voluntariar Program\n\nThe Voluntariar program ('Volunteer' program), which has been in place for more than two decades, aims to strengthen Suzano's relationship with neighboring communities by encouraging employees, service providers, family members and partners to participate in volunteer initiatives supported by the company. These initiatives aim to foster social participation and drive positive changes in society through collaborative work to promote education, sustainability, diversity and inclusion.\n\nThe Voluntariar program offers several opportunities to participate in initiatives such as Contributing to the Future and JA Startup, among others. Another important example is the Formare Project ('Educating' Project), which since 2005 has prepared young people in situations of social vulnerability for the job market (in partnership with the Iochpe Foundation). In 2021, we expanded Formare to two additional Suzano units (Aracruz and Tr\u00eas Lagoas), bringing the total to five units\n\n## MINIMIZING THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC\n\nIn 2021, Suzano continued to share guidelines and preventive health and safety measures to fight COVID-19, to protect employees and their families, service providers and society as a whole.\n\nOur short-term initiatives included our support to vaccinate 100% of our employees; the purchase of oximeters to be loaned to employees who tested positive for COVID-19, as recommended by the occupational health areas of each unit; the continuity of remote work for employees whose activities do not require their physical presence; periodic reinforcement of safety and health measures; free online psychological support; and other measures.\n\nIn 2021, we had 2,757 cases and 20 deaths from COVID-19 among our employees, which we deeply regret.\n\nFocused on the long term, we have a group that brings together employees from different areas of the company and that continued to discuss cultural and behavioral changes caused by the pandemic. These changes can serve as input to help develop future scenarios, activities and solutions and identify progress made in people management.\n\nFor more information on all our initiatives in the fight against the pandemic, visit our Suzano Against the Coronavirus page.\n\nIn other chapters, such as Government and Organized Civil Society , Communities and Suppliers, you will find initiatives implemented to minimize the effects of the pandemic in other parts of Suzano's value chain.\n\ninvolved (in addition to the new ones, the Suzano, Mucuri and Imperatriz units already participated in the project). As a result, Suzano is one of the companies with the highest number of Formare Schools in Brazil, training 100 young people a year and reinforcing our commitment to diversity and people development. In 2021, the five classes included 52% of women and 65% of Black people.\n\nAligned with the company's strategy, and as part of our Commitments to Renewing Life and our Cultural Drivers, the Voluntariar program achieved the following results in 2021:\n\n- \\_ 1,736 volunteers\n- \\_ 10% engagement, considering the total number\n- of employees (58% men and 42% women)\n- \\_ 34% leadership engagement (managers, executives and directors)\n- \\_ 7,347 volunteer hours\n- \\_ 42 participating units, from 14 regions (13 Brazilian states and Switzerland) \\_ 14,890 people benefited (directly and indirectly)\n\nEmployees",

Learn more about Suzano's work in digital transformation.\n\n## AGILITY\n\nThe agile transformation movement, started in 2019, is gaining importance and relevance every day. The company ended 2021 with more than 80 squads, located across more than 15 areas, working in the agile model. A survey conducted in December showed that 96% of the teams feel happier and more satisfied when working on agile methods, 95% increased their focus on achieving their deliverables and 84% improved the quality of their deliverables.\n\nThe company's priority is to create an agile transformation movement that is organic, as a way to increase its breadth, depth and continuity.\n\nWe ended 2021 with a community of more than\n\n1,200 people engaged in agility efforts and more than 30 agility ambassadors distributed throughout Suzano units in Brazil and international offices.\n\n## DESIGN\n\nWe established design as a creative approach to solving complex problems at Suzano and also as a way to foster an innovation mental model based on the concepts of empathy, customer-centricity, collaboration and experimentation.\n\nThroughout the year, we held more than 30 co-creation workshops including different areas. One of the best examples of user experience projects was the ideation of the Forest Control Tower, a hub that integrates and centralizes information from forestry operations to guide agile and data-driven decision making. Learn more about the Tower in the Planet chapter .\n\nTo spread the culture of innovation, the Design team also led programs, such as REIMAGINE! And DigitalLabs, which impacted more than 2,500 people in 2021.\n\nRilari Machado de Castro and Jonathan Silva Alves, Forestry Control Tower operators, Imperatriz unit (state of Maranh\u00e3o).

To that end, the area held events such as pitch days, lectures by entrepreneurs and meetings in which startups presented successful case studies from other industries.\n\nWe developed programs to facilitate increased participation of Suzano employees in open innovation initiatives and implemented a mentoring program for startups, which created closer connections with company executives. All our efforts led us to be recognized as a top 10 company in the 2021 100 Open Corps general ranking and the top company in the Pulp and Paper category in the 100 Open Startups ranking.\n\n## DIGITAL CLUSTER\n\nOur digital transformation strategy resulted in an increase in the number of data scientists and engineers working at Suzano. The solutions created generated more than R$80 million in cash for the company, which, added to the Open Innovation results, totaled approximately R$110 million in 2021.\n\n## DIGITAL ACADEMY\n\nThe Digital Academy was created to train Suzano employees in the subjects of data science, agility and innovation using the Project Base Learning method, which includes concepts that people learn and apply to solve real business challenges.\n\nIn 2021, the Digital Academy trained more than 110 people, of whom 18 started new digital careers as data scientists, 'agilists' or open innovation consultants.\n\nWe concluded the first class of Afrodev , a program for training and hiring Black people for the area of web development and data science ( learn more by clicking here ).\n\nOUR EVOLUTION IN THE LAST TWO YEARS\n\n900+ startups evaluated in the last 18 months\n\n40+\n\nopen innovation initiatives across Suzano's production chain in areas such as Forestry, Industrial, Logistics and SG&A\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nproof of concept (PoC) projects and 10 scaled projects\n\n9\n\n50+ open innovation\n\nambassadors\n\n26 entrepreneurs/startups and mentors in the Mentoring program",

As a result, our average price was much better than in 2020. On the demand side, one of the key factors that impacted pulp prices was the good performance of paper segments in all regions. On the other hand, pulp supply to the market was directly affected by logistical issues throughout the global supply chain due to a lack of shipping containers, the closing of ports in China and delays in the delivery of ships.\n\nFor Suzano, with sales over 10.6 million tonnes of pulp in 2021, it was no different. However, despite these challenges, the company guaranteed the supply to its customers and managed to achieve an EBITDA growth of more than 57%. Thanks to a strong strategy, our supply chain avoided supply interruptions to our customers and maintained the company's high level of service.\n\nThe year also brought increased opportunities to engage in projects for the application of our fibers with strong sustainability attributes. More and more, customers in the United States and European countries value suppliers who are benchmarks in sustainability and can offer more than good prices and reliable supply. In 2021, we were able to engage with partners who are interested in working together to develop environmental and social solutions, and advanced discussions on, for example, how to help them develop products that use raw materials from renewable sources and may contribute to replace products from fossil sources. We know that this trend will be increasingly important, and we will have to face great challenges, including the pursuit of technology and new materials, for example. However, we believe that this is the way to plant a better future.\n\n## EUCAFLUFF\u00ae IN EVOLUTION\n\nAfter years of research and the growing acceptance of Eucafluff\u00ae by global customers in Asia, Brazil, Europe and the United States, Suzano introduced the most evolved version of the product at INDEXTM, the world's leading nonwovens event. Held in Geneva, Switzerland, in October, the event proved to be an opportunity for the company to reaffirm the significant competitiveness of this product developed from eucalyptus fiber.\n\nEucafluff\u00ae is the world's first bleached eucalyptus kraft fluff pulp and is used in disposable absorbent and personal care products such as infant and adult diapers and sanitary pads. In the path toward innovability, this product has important advantages in terms of environmental footprint (which were confirmed by a life cycle analysis reviewed by KPMG that compared it to the pine fluff produced in the southeastern United States). Eucafluff\u00ae has been a successful product for Suzano and the company intends to explore new growth opportunities in the coming years.\n\n## \\_ PAPER AND PACKAGING\n\n## PAPER AND ITS POSSIBILITIES\n\nSuzano has important competitive advantages: a portfolio that includes many options for several different applications and a unique distribution model that keeps us close to our 35,000 customers in Brazil and to our national salesforce of more than 300 people.\n\nWhile paying attention to new opportunities, the future of the paper market and the challenges that came with the pandemic, Suzano's Paper and Packaging Unit continued to work on innovability and product diversification. In addition to the paper for specific segments previously mentioned, we have special paper options for medication package insert, bags (Greenbag\u00ae) and flexible packaging (Greenpack\u00ae), among others.\n\nOne of our commitments is to offer, by 2030, 10 million tonnes of products from renewable sources, developed from eucalyptus biomass, which can replace materials from fossil sources. As part of the solution to this challenge, we have partnered with several companies.\n\nIn 2021, our main partnerships\n\n## PARTNERSHIPS\n\nincluded:\n\n\\_BOB'S AND COCA-COLA: Suzano started to supply Bluecup Bio\u00ae paperboard for cups to Bob's restaurants in S\u00e3o Paulo and the Federal District, as part of the Coca-Cola Alphabet campaign. Bluecup Bio\u00ae is the first Brazilian paperboard for cups made from a renewable and plastic-free source.\n\n\\_i FOOD: This partnership aims to reduce the use of plastic items in food deliveries to make them more sustainable. One of these solutions is Greenbag\u00ae, a paper used in the production of bags in partnership with Papeltec Embalagens Ltda. Suzano and iFood also teamed up to launch the Packaging of the Future challenge, in June 2021, to support the development of sustainable and plastic-free packaging for the food delivery sector.\n\n## \\_AMBEV, COLGATE-PALMOLIVE AND AMBIPAR:\n\nThis partnership aims to promote a circular economy through a waste collection and recycling project that includes a contract with Triciclo, a company of the Ambipar Group. Created in 2021, the collection sites, which have been located in Makro stores in S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo (since October) and Guarulhos (since November), will be available for 12 months.\n\n## \\_JOHNSON & JOHNSON CONSUMER HEALTH:\n\nThis partnership resulted in the creation of new packaging, now made of paper, for the Sempre Livre\u00ae Adapt Plus Eco sanitary pads, which have 50% less plastic (compared to the regular Sempre Livre\u00ae Adapt Plus version). This packaging is made with Suzano's\n\nflexible paper, Greenpack\u00ae. Through this pilot project, the product is currently available in Carrefour stores (Northeast, Midwest, South and Southeast regions) and RaiaDrogasil drugstores (North, Northeast and Southeast regions).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPhoto: promotional.\n\nCustomers  73",

For this to happen, Suzano is making one of the largest private investments in the country, totaling R$19.3 billion, and transforming the Ribas do Rio Pardo community, in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, a town with 25,000 people located 100 kilometers from the state capital, Campo Grande.\n\nWITH THIS NEW UNIT , Suzano will have the largest single-line pulp plant in the world, characterized by high competitiveness and eco-efficiency. The Cerrado project, named after its geographic location, reinforces our relevance in the production of hardwood fiber through successful projects, in addition to enabling a lower cash production cost that is very difficult to replicate, especially due to its scale. This project reflects two of our five strategic business avenues, namely 'Be best-in-class in total pulp cost' and 'Maintain relevance in pulp through good projects'.

Continue reading to learn about our progress during the year.\n\n## MULTIPLE PORTFOLIO\n\nThe biggest challenge in the use of paper in items such as straws and cups, for example, is to ensure that it has similar functionality to plastic. To do that, we have developed a portfolio of multiple barriers-biodegradable and recyclable chemicals that, when applied to the paper's surface, provides\n\nsealability attributes (resistance to moisture, steam and oxygen), making the paper much more competitive from a technical standpoint.\n\nIn 2021, Suzano perfected the application of barriers for cold liquid in Bluecup Bio\u00ae, a line of biodegradable, compostable and renewable-source paperboard for cups that is now regularly sold at Bob's restaurant stores. We have also made progress with regard to our solution for hot liquids, which will be tested by one of our major customers in 2022.\n\nThe progress in the development of barriers became possible because Suzano mapped its ecosystem (internal resources and partnerships with research centers, startups and local and global customers) to identify the available knowledge, establish connections and, thereby, find co-created solutions.\n\nFinishing Will, Limeira unit (state of S\u00e3o Paulo).

Although Suzano does not participate in this segment, the company produced, during the year, a specific uncoated paper for the segment of sheets and cardboard boxes as a way of addressing the shortage of scraps faced by manufacturers in this sector.\n\nThis product was developed by the company in just 60 days and became the highest selling innovation product in our history. This experience has been celebrated as an excellent example of envisioning an opportunity, combined with a clear understanding of what the market needs and quick adaptation to deliver the solution.\n\n## \\_ CONSUMER GOODS\n\n## PROMISING SCENARIO AND NEW PRODUCTS IN THE MARKET\n\nDespite the challenges faced since 2020, which included high input prices in the international market, Suzano's Consumer Goods Unit achieved very positive results in 2021. In March, we inaugurated a plant in Cachoeiro do Itapemirim dedicated entirely to the production of consumer goods. With capacity to produce 30,000 tonnes of toilet paper per year (which is equivalent to 15,000 bales or 1 million rolls per day), the unit is responsible for converting tissue paper that is produced at the Mucuri plant into two- and three-ply Mimmo\u00ae and two-ply Max Pure\u00ae toilet papers.\n\nResponsible for a 30% increase in Suzano's finished product capacity, the new unit primarily serves the markets in the Southeast region. Mimmo\u00ae Three-Ply Padded toilet paper is a new product launched together with the startup of the new plant. In the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo, in just six months, Mimmo\u00ae Three-Ply reached\n\nSales promoter Rosemiria Gon\u00e7alves de Freitas, in a Perim Supermarket (state of Esp\u00edrito Santo), with Mimmo\u00ae Triple Ply toilet paper.

Since 2020, there has been a surge in demand for this type of paper throughout Brazil, requiring the company to reorganize its plants and business model to quickly respond to the new needs of its customers.\n\nIn 2021, our products increased their participation among large customers (supermarkets, hypermarkets and wholesalers in Brazil). The company's sales volume and revenue also grew significantly. According to data from Nielsen 1 , in 2021, the toilet paper market in Brazil grew 6% in value over 2020. Suzano's growth in this market was 16%. In the last two months of the year, the company's market share reached 11.2%, its highest in history, and\n\ngrew 2.9 percentage points compared to the last two months of 2020, the highest growth among all manufacturers.\n\nAs a result of the Consumer Goods Unit's strategy, in 2021 Suzano was in 45% 2 of the Top 100 Food Retail Customers in Brazil, an increase of 10 percentage points compared to 2020. These retail chains where the company's products are sold account for 71% of the combined revenue of the top 100 companies.

They are:\n\n- \\_Efficient trees\n- \\_Biomaterials\n- \\_Eco-efficiency and preservation \\_Evolution and new paper applications \\_Industrial evolution for pulp \\_Genetics for efficiency\n\nThe objective is to broaden our perspectives regarding potential changes in the business environment and discuss the company's short-, medium- and long-term strategic options.\n\n## PROGRESS AT FUTURAGENE\n\nFuturaGene, Suzano' Biotechnology Division and a leader in plant genetic development aimed at increasing the productivity and sustainability of the global forestry sector, obtained a firstever approval for the commercial use of a new herbicide-tolerant genetically modified eucalyptus variety. The technology was evaluated and approved by the National Technical Commission on Biosafety (CTNBio, for its initials in Portuguese) after multiyear safety analyses in the laboratory, greehouses and in the field, which demonstrated its biosafety in humans, animals and the environment.\n\nJ\u00e9ssica Fernanda Fonseca Fernandes, R&D technician, FuturaGene. Photo: Juarez Godoy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe new eucalyptus is tolerant to the herbicide glyphosate, which is used in forestry to fight weed competition, thus allowing more modern and efficient control of weeds that compete with eucalyptus, especially in the early stages of plantation development. This technology aims to optimize and potentially reduce overall chemical usage and improve working conditions. Conventional tree breeding and biotechnology go hand in hand at Suzano, in an increasingly integrated way. After the CTNBio's approval, the herbicide-tolerant genetically modified eucalyptus will be incorporated into Suzano's breeding program to develop and assess suitability in different geographic regions where the company cultivates eucalyptus, as is done with conventional clones. The objective of this phase is to optimize planting material for future operational use.\n\n## NEW ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES FOR GLOBAL CHALLENGES\n\nIn 2021, FuturaGene obtained a research license for CRISPR-Cas9, a gene editing technology developed by a number of organizations, including Corteva Agriscience, the Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University, and other institutions. This technology, together with FuturaGene's current 'toolbox', will be applied to the ongoing research and development of new eucalyptus varieties that are more productive, are resistant to diseases and pests and have better quality fibers. In addition, the company aims to make the new varieties more resilient to climate change, thus reducing the risks of climate-related productivity losses.\n\nThis new gene editing research license can be converted into a commercial license. A key aspect of this license agreement is the right to share the benefits of this technology with small producers in Suzano's supply chain, royalty free.\n\nBased on third party and in-house scientific data, Suzano believes that genetically modified eucalyptus will provide significant productivity gains and environmental benefits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLearn more about FuturaGene by visiting the website\n\n.",

In addition to advancing in textile fiber production with Spinnova ( see more details in the next topic ), Suzano has been studying the application of MFC in printing and writing paper, among other uses that are still being evaluated. In addition, we started tests with MFC to replace raw materials from fossil sources used in cleaning products (dish detergents, fabric softeners and laundry detergents) and in the manufacturing of paints and fibre cement slates, which used to be made with asbestos.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PARTNERSHIP FOR SUSTAINABLE FABRIC\n\nSeveral brands in the textile industry are looking to reduce their emissions and environmental footprint and create a circular material basis for their products. In 2021, one example of innovability in this area was our joint venture with Spinnova, a Finnish material innovation startup. We will exclusively produce and sell 100% renewable textile fiber made from microfibrillated eucalyptus cellulose.\n\nIn February 2021, together with the creation of the joint venture, the two companies announced an investment of 22 million euros for the construction of the first production unit to manufacture this fiber, which will be sold under the SPINNOVA\u00ae brand. The pre-commercial scale plant is located in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 (Finland), where Spinnova's Research and Development center and pilot plant are located. Spinnova will contribute its exclusive technology, while Suzano will supply microfibrillated cellulose produced from the eucalyptus grown in Brazil. Production will be managed and operated by the joint venture called Woodspin, in which each company holds a 50% stake. The plant is expected to start operation in 2023.\n\n## CLOTHING MADE FROM 100% RENEWABLE FIBER\n\nOur renewable raw material, combined with Spinnova's technology, will meet the needs of the market and society for more sustainable fibers. They are produced from the same raw material used in paper production through a production process that does not require much water, generates little solid waste and uses renewable-based chemicals. SPINNOVA\u00ae fiber is a highly advantageous alternative in terms of sustainability since, for example, its production generates minimal greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nImportant leading fashion groups, such as the Swedish H&M, the Danish Bestseller, the Finnish Marimekko, the German Adidas and the Norwegian Bergans, have already signed agreements with Spinnova to participate in its material development process.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLignin plant, Limeira unit (state of S\u00e3o Paulo).Photo: Fernando Cavalcanti.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## LIGNIN, PROTECTION FACTOR\n\nLike pulp and paper, lignin is a renewable product of the planted tree industry. It is a complex organic compound that, together with cellulose, makes up most of the wood in trees. Among other things, it can be used as a phenolic resin or antioxidant for rubber products. In addition, it is an excellent fuel that produces steam for more efficient production processes, and it also generates electricity, which contributes to a more renewable energy matrix.\n\nThe lignin produced by Suzano is being used in several application studies in different industrial sectors. The most recent one brings together the Research and Development teams from Suzano and the Botic\u00e1rio Group, one of the largest beauty conglomerates in the world. Together, the teams\n\nare testing the benefits of lignin in beauty products, especially for dark skin. Researchers involved in the partnership have identified an antioxidant effect of the ingredient that can also boost the protection factor in sunscreens (SPF). In addition, lignin could also be used to minimize the grayish tone of foundations for black skin-a phenomenon that occurs when these products come into contact with the oxygen in the air-by preventing them from changing color as a result of the oxidation process.\n\nAfter the research phase, the results are expected to be used by Botic\u00e1rio to develop new cosmetics lines starting in 2022. Lignin is produced in Limeira, where Suzano operates the first kraft lignin plant in Latin America.",

The main objectives of this program, approved in 2020, are to foster sustainability management among the suppliers, establish guidelines for our relationships with our partners and integrate ESG criteria into procurement decisions. During the year, the RSM program was applied to several projects and initiatives that aim to increasingly establish lasting and high-quality relationships with our suppliers to generate shared value throughout our production chain.\n\nUnderstanding the strengths and weaknesses of the different companies that serve us and improving their level of performance and awareness means reducing risks for everyone.\n\nOne of the challenges that come with this process is to educate our buyers, who pursue the best commercial conditions. On the one hand, our suppliers need to understand the importance of following current best practices in the social, environmental and governance arena. On the other hand, our business areas must understand the benefits of hiring companies that, for example, emit less greenhouse gases or have a more diverse workforce compared to their competitors. This is a work in progress, which, over the next few years, is expected to bring about profound transformations throughout Suzano's supply chain, which currently includes 26,000 active suppliers.\n\nLearn about our highlights in 2021:\n\n## SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT POLICY\n\n## The Sustainable Procurement Policy\n\nconsolidates the principles and guidelines that drive the effective integration of sustainability into Suzano's procurement processes, including everything from the acquisition of office supplies to forestry and industrial inputs, to services. The policy provides guidelines for product or service specifications, the registration and approval of suppliers, and the selection and hiring of our partners.\n\n## SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT\n\nBased on Suzano's Code of Conduct , we launched a specific document to guide our relationships with our supply chain. In addition to issues commonly discussed, such as integrity in business relationships, decent labor relations and management systems, it addresses comprehensive ESG issues by including topics such as environmental protection, human rights and social development.

This study informed the creation of a Social and Environmental Risk Matrix, which classifies suppliers into four risk groups: low, medium, high and very high. Based on this assessment, it was possible to establish specific management strategies for each risk category, since higher risk levels require stronger guidance and monitoring, and a robust development approach with the suppliers.\n\nAs an example, the suppliers included in the matrix as high and very high social and environmental risks are monitored in real time through the Reprisk platform. This tool continuously assesses and updates the degree of risk exposure of suppliers considering the risk of the production sector as a whole, the country where the suppliers operate, and the severity of the information found in the media.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the creation of the Social and Environmental Risk Matrix and our management approaches, access Suzano's Sustainable Procurement Policy .\n\n## CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE VALUE CHAIN\n\nClimate change is the first sustainability issue to be discussed with our suppliers as part of our initiatives to take sustainability beyond Suzano's walls. We invited 100 suppliers with opportunities related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to participate in our program. Through initiatives like that, we seek to improve sustainability management and encourage the reduction of GHG emissions in our supply chain year after year, in line with our commitment to become increasingly climate positive. To develop this program, we established a partnership with CDP .\n\nOf the invited suppliers, 78 representatives of categories that are considered critical in terms of greenhouse gas emissions voluntarily participated in the first cycle of the program. This level of engagement was superior to the average 67% of other companies that also use the CDP Supply Chain platform. During 2022, we will engage our suppliers to improve their climate change management and strategy and, consequently, their score in the CDP questionnaire.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n78% of the participants\n\nengaged with the program, which is a significant achievement for its first year -\n\n12% above the global average.\n\n## INCLUSIVE PROCUREMENT\n\nThe next issue in our agenda is inclusive procurement, which aims to promote diversity, equity and inclusion throughout our supply chain. In 2021, the company carried out a comprehensive diversity and inclusion census among our partners to establish indicators of minority representation among their employees, managers and owners and to identify existing practices in this area. Through December 2021, approximately 500 suppliers had engaged in the issue of inclusive procurement. In 2022, the data we collected will be essential for us to increase our number of partnerships with companies in which managers and owners belong to minority groups, in addition to fostering an increase in diversity among their employees. In this first cycle, our focus will be on gender.\n\nPablo Alan Guimar\u00e3es Pires, Wood Supply technician, Imperatriz unit (state of Maranh\u00e3o).

        "page_content": "## INOVALOG\n\nInovalog ('Innovalog') is Suzano's pulp logistics transformation program. It was launched in March 2021 as part of one the company's strategic business avenue\n\n('Be best-in-class in total pulp cost') and its desire to be recognized as a benchmark in market innovation. Among its main objectives are the pursuit of increased operational productivity, quality of life for the team and efficiency in the connection with startups and technology companies. The program translates how the logistics team intends to help the company achieve its goals and ambitions.\n\nThe first step was to consult the team and the main areas it interacts with, recognizing the importance of co-creation at Suzano. The results of the program, which is based on three development drivers (people, digital/systems and operational excellence), include the creation of more than 150 initiatives in 2021, training for the team, system improvements, process automation and cost reduction.\n\nThe culture of co-experimentation is another important feature of Inovalog . Currently, Suzano's Logistics, in partnership with startups and other companies in the market, is testing and developing new concepts to be incorporated into everyday businesses. Some of the projects are planned to be scaled up in our operations as early as 2022.\n\n## SUSTAINABLE LOGISTICS\n\nSuzano sees the reduction or elimination of fossil fuel in its transportation as an important component of its environmental strategy. Therefore, the company has been working to increase productivity by using low-emissions rail transport. In addition, on certain routes within the greater S\u00e3o Paulo area, Suzano is replacing conventional trucks with electric ones. For heavy equipment, this option is only available in industrial areas close to our plants and wood yards. It is still uncertain when we will be able to completely replace fossil fuels with renewable alternatives. For Suzano, the focus now is to be connected to institutions and companies around the world that aim to systematically track solutions for a zero-emission operation.\n\nPartial solutions such as hybrid vehicles and transition fuels are currently being seen as steppingstones toward phasing out fossil fuels. Some of the alternatives being studied include hybrid vehicles with electric trailer axles and other components, feasibility studies of methane-powered fleets to transport wood and pulp, and options for producing biomethane from biomass in industrial plants.\n\n## ITAQUI BERTH\n\nIn 2018, Suzano won a concession to manage public areas and infrastructure for general cargo, especially pulp and paper, in the Itaqui port, in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, for an initial period of 25 years. To implement this project, the company will be investing approximately R$390 million.\n\nThe construction of the berth and support room was completed in November 2021 and accounted for part of Suzano's investments for the construction of this terminal, which will be\n\nused for the export of pulp produced in the company's Imperatriz unit. Berth operations started in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nIn addition to the berth, the investments will finance the construction of a 73,000-tonne warehouse to ensure more efficient flow of pulp. The construction project is scheduled to be completed in the first half of 2022, and the warehouse is expected to be operational in the third quarter.\n\nElmo de Jesus Mendes Tavares, leader of Logistics Operations, Berth 99 - Itaqui Port, S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds (state of Maranh\u00e3o).

Now, think of a data-science automated knowledge center that can analyze and share, in real time, information collected in these different regions with this same group of employees. This is like putting the operation under a giant magnifying glass: the activities are conducted based on the evaluation of a much higher number of aspects, in much less time and with lower risks. This is the Control Tower project, which was developed through Suzano's co-creation and innovability efforts and is currently considered one of the most transformational projects in terms of productivity\n\nTHE MAIN OBJECTIVE of this project, which was tested in the state of Maranh\u00e3o in 2021, is to provide autonomy to the workers at the forefront of our operations. That is why, to develop the project, the company consulted 70 forestry workers and followed the design thinking methodology, to give voice to those in the field and arrive at a solution that could effectively meet their needs. As a result, operators now have tablets that provide online information and management dashboards, which they can use to make the best choices with confidence and agility to achieve their goals.\n\nLorena Ferreira da Cunha e Souza, service provider (company Nova RH), Henrique de Jesus Silva, Forest Logistics operator, Joscimar Silva Santos, Harvest administrative assistant, and Ana Carolina Silva de Alemida, Forest Logistics operator, in the Imperatriz unit (state of Maranh\u00e3o).

        "page_content": "## \\_ OUR MANAGEMENT GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3\n\nCurrently, Suzano has 2.4 million hectares of native forests and eucalyptus forests distributed across three Brazilian biomes (Cerrado, Atlantic Forest and the Amazon), which have very different characteristics. How can we manage such a broad footprint, with so many variables, in a way that optimizes the use of natural resources, forest productivity and costs, while also improving our conservation efforts and maintaining good relationships with our neighbors to ensure benefits for everyone?\n\nThe partnership between the Forestry and Research and Development (R&D) areas enabled better understanding and the classification of the different conditions of eucalyptus cultivation environments. Using machine learning, we were able to isolate and demarcate Suzano's macroenvironments. Based on that, all management and breeding recommendations are developed to maximize the productive potential of each environment, considering the best combination between management, clones and environment.\n\nMaria Helena dos Santos, fertigation applicator, Tr\u00eas Lagoas unit (state of Mato Grosso do Sul).Photo: M\u00e1rcio Schimming.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nManagement recommendations follow the concept of precision forestry. With regard to breeding, it is worth noting that we adopt a strategy to accelerate the discovery and selection of more productive clones with better wood quality. In addition to using better clones, the company developed a clonal allocation optimizer, called Tetrys. This algorithm enables Suzano to place the most adapted and productive clones in the company's different environments.\n\nUsing analytics, big data and artificial intelligence, Tetrys evaluates numerous scenarios to identify the best clone, considering variables such as temperature, rainfall, soil type and texture, and altitude. In addition to improving plantation safety and providing more effective matches that result in a 2% increase in forest productivity, this tool reduces the risk of potential environmental issues, including the incidence of pests and diseases.\n\nThe development of Tetrys, which involved more than 80 employees within the company, resulted in a 15-fold increase in the capacity to generate clone allocation scenarios, when compared to the procedure prior to the implementation of the tool. Since the beginning of the project, more than 270 million trees have been planted the equivalent of an area of 205,000 hectares.\n\nIn addition to providing better control of planting quality, these projects are being efficient to increase the productivity of commercial plantations in sites where there have been no weather-related adverse effects. Also, based on the knowledge generated, it is possible to reposition the forest base, focusing on expanding plantations in areas of greater productive potential and lower environmental risk.\n\nIn 2021, we innovated the process of generating and transferring technologies. For the first time, we held an integrated event in which management recommendations ( SMS - Suzano Management System ) and breeding recommendations (SGS - Suzano Genetic Selection) were widely discussed with the Silviculture areas, with the participation of all support areas. This was a way to share knowledge more efficiently, facilitate co-creation and make joint decisions for the coming year. Based on this new interpretation of what happens in the field, it became possible to make more specific recommendations in silvicultural activities, including soil preparation, planting spacing, clonal allocation, fertilization and plant protection, adapted to the characteristics of each region.\n\n## MORE WITH LESS\n\nThe same approach applies to the management of regrowth, which consists of using previously selected shoots of remaining strains from the previous harvest. This type of management is very much in line with the idea of producing more with fewer natural resources, since a series of steps, such as seedling production and transportation and soil preparation, are not necessary in the management of regrowth.\n\nAt Suzano, we are implementing a concept called C14 (or 14-year cycles), which has enabled us to reduce the use of inputs and the emission of greenhouse gases, while also leveraging regrowth productivity. This is only possible thanks to quality control, the implementation of best management practices and a better understanding and control over the factors that affect productivity, resulting from big data analysis of issues in this area.\n\nCurrently, APPROXIMATELY 14% of the areas are under REGROWTH MANAGEMENT, resulting in savings of around 40% IN FOREST FORMING COSTS when compared to restauration\n\n2.5% OVERALL INCREASE in the mean annual increment (MAI) of pulp per hectare per year\n\nIn addition, the company implemented a regrowth area selection optimizer, an artificial intelligence technology that makes it possible, in the strategic planning phase, to identify the planting areas with the highest potential for regrowth. The more efficient the company is in selecting these areas, the more sustainable and productive their management becomes over time.",

        "page_content": "## \\_ WATER IN THE FOREST\n\nClimate change is a global reality and certainly one of the most pressing issues for the forestry industry and society. The development of our planted trees and conservation areas depends on the availability of water.\n\nDozens of initiatives have been implemented in recent years to address the situation of more frequent and intense droughts in some regions where we operate. One of them is forest management aimed at increasing water availability in watersheds that are considered critical (in other words, watersheds in areas where Suzano operations are exposed to risk of water scarcity).\n\nThis is one of our main Commitments to Renewing Life: increase water availability in 100% of critical watersheds by 2030. This represents approximately 6% of our forest base in more critical regions and watersheds. Our unique management approach includes initiatives such as increasing the age mosaic, extending the crop cycle, reducing planted forest density, promoting forest restoration, optimizing roads and decommissioning areas. In 2021, we exceeded our target of applying this management approach in 4,500 hectares. Through decommissioning of critical areas alone, we reached approximately 5,650 hectares.\n\n## ADAPTATION STRATEGY\n\nCBased on alarming data released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Suzano immersed itself in this issue in 2021, considering different scenarios. In addition to evaluating historical data collected by the company itself, as a key element of this initiative, the company worked in the identification and measurement of risks based\n\non IPCC scenarios. This is a step forward in our journey toward alignment with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nAs part of this comprehensive assessment, Suzano classified high-risk areas with regards to forest productivity and identified regions where plantations should be decommissioned, and the company's production activities should be ceased. Suzano also determined the size of its forest base needed to face the consequences of climate change without compromising supply for its units. The implementation of this strategy will consider the scale and importance of the company's social and economic role in each region to avoid any negative impact in these areas.\n\n## \\_ CONTROLLED WATER USE\n\nTechnological advances have increasingly improved the development of solutions to control the use of water. One of them, closely linked to Suzano's innovability concept and implemented in 2021, is a seedling protection collar that is inserted at the time of planting to form a protection barrier around the plant.\n\n## PROTECTION COLLAR\n\nThis shield is made from primary sludge, a residue made up of fibers that were not used in the industrial process for pulp production. One of the benefits of the collar is to keep the soil moist for a longer time. As a result, the seedling needs to be irrigated less often, thereby consuming less water in its initial growth stage. It is estimated that 532 million liters of water are saved for every 100,000 hectares planted. In 2021, at the Maranh\u00e3o unit alone, we saved approximately 65 million liters of water - the equivalent of 4,330 trucks of 15,000 liters each.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \\_ STANDARDS\n\n| Water withdrawal per                              | 2019              | 2020              | 2021          | 2021        | 2021         |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|\n| source in forestry  operations\u00b9 (m 3 )  GRI 303-3 | Total Suzano S.A. | Total Suzano S.A. | Surface water | Groundwater | Total        |\n| S\u00e3o Paulo                                         | 214,372.00        | 341,680.32        | 141,438.03    | 140,809.32  | 282,247.35   |\n| Mato Grosso do Sul                                | 1,082,185.00      | 951,724.00        | 924,918.13    | 0.00        | 924,918.13   |\n| Esp\u00edrito Santo/Bahia                              | 850,009.17        | 392,476.72        | 322,081.28    | 71.73       | 322,153.01   |\n| Maranh\u00e3o                                          | 209,403.80        | 120,980.00        | 111,083.50    | 564.00      | 111,647.50   |\n| Total                                             | 2,355,969.97      | 1,806,861.04      | 1,499,520.94  | 141,445.05  | 1,640,965.99 |\n\n- 1.

Therefore, Suzano is constantly evolving its practices with the goal of minimizing risks and increasing efficiency. Two important initiatives in this area are highlighted below.\n\n## SIX-TRAILER TRUCK EXPANSION\n\nSix-trailer trucks (also known as hexatrains) are exclusive vehicles developed by Suzano in partnership with automotive companies. Operating in the company's farms in Tr\u00eas Lagoas, the vehicles are also being used in forestry logistics activities in Aracruz and Mucuri.\n\nThis mode of transportation allows the company to transport a higher volume of wood in fewer trips. It also reduces the number of vehicles in circulation, which has environmental advantages, such as a reduction of 2,798 tonnes per year of greenhouse gases emissions and in the risk of accidents involving the local fauna. In addition, the strategy for training six-trailer truck drivers includes drivers from small transport companies located in the South of the state of Bahia. As a result, Suzano continues to promote local employment while also maintaining our contracts with these companies in force.\n\nWhile six-trailer trucks offer many advantages, there are also negative impacts that the company is working to address. In 2021, Suzano received 37 specific complaints about its forestry operations in Mucuri, including the operation of six trailer trucks.\n\n## \\_ FOR MORE ECOLOGICAL BALANCE\n\nSuzano is advancing its biological control strategy to replace chemical control in its plantations. In 2021, the company created and released more than 115 million natural enemies, enabling biological pest control in approximately 150,000 hectares. The natural enemies were created in the Aracruz, Alambari, Imperatriz and Tr\u00eas Lagoas laboratories, the latter inaugurated in the second half of the year.\n\nWe believe that, by scaling our production and acting preventively, we will achieve an ecological balance until some point in the future when the use of agrochemicals will no longer be necessary. Our investment in infrastructure and specialized professionals is starting to yield positive results: during an outbreak of caterpillars in Mato Grosso do Sul in 2021, for example, the use of insecticides to fight the problem was significantly lower compared to similar situations in the past.\n\nIn addition to classical biological control, the company kicked off the FenomicS project ('Phenomics' project). This initiative is focused on evaluating the resistance of our clones to the main pests and diseases, as well as their tolerance to adverse weather factors, earlier in the process and more intensely. The project is expected to make the selection of resistant clones two times more efficient. Using a new technique, we are also able to select clones that are more efficient in terms of water use. While the use of genetic resistance against pests and diseases makes it possible to reduce the need for pesticides, the selection and planting of clones that are tolerant to water deficits increases our eco-efficiency. These two approaches are expected to reduce our production risks and minimize our impacts.\n\nGrey brocket deer, state of Mato Grosso do Sul. Photo: Araqu\u00e9m Alc\u00e2ntara.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The company has committed to connect half a million hectares (an area four times the size of the city of Rio de Janeiro) of priority areas for conservation in the Cerrado, Atlantic Forest and Amazon biomes, by 2030.\n\nThis new commitment, announced in June 2021, signals our level of contribution and engagement with the conservation of the biodiversity of Brazilian ecosystems, considering that the fragmentation of habitats is one of the main threats to the life of species. In addition, it confirms the company's leadership position in this area, at a national and international level, in line with the global ambitions of the United Nations (UN).\n\nSuzano believes that this biodiversity target cannot be a responsibility of the company alone, but rather of society as a whole. To set this target, the company carried out a collaborative process that included consultation with more than 40 national and international stakeholders, including NGOs and representatives of the public and private sectors and academia. This process, specifically designed to identify opportunities and challenges for biodiversity conservation, was carried out in partnership with the Ecofuturo Institute.\n\nBased on the priority areas for conservation identified by the Ministry of the Environment and the areas set by the National System of Nature Conservation Units (SNUC, for its initials in Portuguese) as fully protected Conservation Units, Suzano identified the main areas of fragmented natural remnants to be connected. Then, as a result of the intense engagement of different players, the company defined the pathways for connection, which will be made through the implementation of biodiversity corridors..\n\n## DRIVING FORCE\n\nThousands of isolated forest fragments will be connected. Approximately 50% of them are in areas owned by Suzano. The other fragments are located on third-party lands, which will require strong engagement and networking on the part of the company to be able to connect them. This effort will increase our responsibility and commitment to maintain these habitats restored\n\nand preserved, considering the landscape of the area.\n\nThe company will act strategically by implementing biodiversity corridors and establishing business models that generate shared value and promote biodiverse production, in addition to developing initiatives to reduce pressure on biodiversity as a result of human action.\n\n## \\_ STANDARDS\n\n| Protected habitats,                                         | 2019                | 2020                | 2021             | 2021       | 2021       | 2021                      | 2021         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|------------|------------|---------------------------|--------------|\n| by type and forest  stewardship unit\u00b9  (hectares) GRI 304-3 | Total   Suzano S.A. | Total   Suzano S.A. | Aracruz/ Mucuri\u00b2 | S\u00e3o Paulo\u00b3 |            | Tr\u00eas Lagoas\u2074 Imperatriz 5 | Total        |\n| Atlantic Rainforest                                         | 342,979.68          | 345,268.09          | 271,839.63       | 78,936.23  | 3,579.19   | 0.00                      | 354,355.05   |\n| Cerrado                                                     | 307,612.41          | 329,360.69          | 1,430.56         | 35,423.13  | 259,849.16 | 130,467.27                | 427,170.12   |\n| Mangrove                                                    | 789.65              | 313.76              | 308.47           | 0.00       | 0.00       | 0.00                      | 308.47       |\n| Restinga                                                    | 9,938.51            | 7,897.28            | 6,975.91         | 0.00       | 0.00       | 0.00                      | 6,975.91     |\n| Amazon                                                      | 237,166.60          | 242,027.15          | 0.00             | 0.00       | 0.00       | 253,390.70                | 253,390.70   |\n| Total                                                       | 898,486.85          | 924,866.97          | 280,554.57       | 114,359.36 | 263,428.35 | 383,857.97                | 1,042,200.26 |\n\n- 1.

More than 4,300 species of plants, birds, amphibians, reptiles and mammals are cataloged in its monitoring database, including those under varying degrees of threat of extinction. These conservation areas are mainly distributed throughout the Cerrado, Atlantic Forest and Amazon biomes. In these regions, in addition to Permanent Preservation Areas (PPAs) and Legal Reserves (LRs), which are required by Brazilian law, the company has voluntarily identified High Conservation Value Areas (HCVAs), which total more than 90,000 hectares of habitats of global and national importance for the conservation of biodiversity.\n\nIn 2021, Suzano established a corporate standard of methods and criteria to identify environmental attributes and review and set aside HCVAs in all regions where the company operates.\n\nAS A RESULT, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF MORE THAN\n\n## 30,000 hectares\n\nOF HCVAS IN THE FORESTRY BUSINESS UNITS.\n\nItatinga river in the Neblinas Park (state of S\u00e3o Paulo).

To certify these services, the company went through an audit process for FSC forest certification (License Code FSC-C009927), carried out at the S\u00e3o Paulo unit 1 . Ecosystem (or environmental) services are benefits that society obtains from nature, directly or indirectly, such as food, medicine, fiber for clothing, wood for buildings and water. This is the first time that a Brazilian organization has been recognized and certified for proving Recreational Services for children, young adults and adults who visit a nature reserve. This achievement demonstrates the importance of conservation and environmental awareness efforts implemented in this area.\n\n## \\_ PARTNERSHIP FOR THE AMAZON\n\nWe know that we will not achieve our Commitments to Renewing Life by ourselves. With this conviction in mind, in 2021 we joined the project Promoting and Implementing Assisted Natural Regeneration in Mato Grosso and Par\u00e1, in partnership with the global and Brazilian chapters of the World Resources Institute, the Centro de Vida Institute (ICV, for its initials in Portuguese) and the Homem e Meio Ambiente da Amaz\u00f4nia Institute (IMAZON).\n\nThis initiative seeks to create and establish financial mechanisms to encourage forest restoration, generate income and employment, and improve the lives of people living in the Amazon region. Through assisted natural regeneration techniques, it is possible to accelerate forest growth in abandoned areas or areas of low agricultural potential at lower cost and in less time. In the social area, the goal is that restoration can be combined with techniques that generate economic benefits\n\nfrom the use of forests or from the consortium between native plants and agricultural crops.\n\nThe project includes the restoration of approximately 260,000 hectares spread throughout eight municipalities (three in the state of Par\u00e1, where Suzano operates, and five in the state of Mato Grosso).\n\n## \\_ PLANOS DA MATA\n\nSuzano and SOS Mata Atl\u00e2ntica have been working in partnership since April 2021 to implement the Planos da Mata project ('Atlantic Forest Plan' project), which was developed to support the creation of municipal plans for the Atlantic Forest. The goal is to strengthen public policies in the area of planning and local land development that can mitigate negative impacts caused by climate change.\n\nThe project is expected to inform the creation of an environmental master plan for 35 municipalities located in S\u00e3o Paulo, Esp\u00edrito Santo and Bahia, states where Suzano has forests and units.",

A few combined factors contributed to the company's progress in this area in 2021. One of them was the engagement of industrial directors and managers, whose variable compensation is now also linked to the company's commitments for 2025 and 2030. Other factors were the investments made by the company for the construction of two waste treatment centers, one in Tr\u00eas Lagoas (worth R$40 million, implemented in 2020) and another in Imperatriz (in the amount of R$32 million, implemented in 2021). Thanks to them, in 2021 we reduced the amount of waste directed to landfills by 34% compared to the previous year, transforming them into agricultural inputs for our eucalyptus forests and other agricultural crops in the regions where we operate.\n\nWe also have a pilot project being implemented in the Mucuri unit, where we direct our waste to a third-party waste treatment facility.\n\n## 31.7 kg\n\nof waste per tonne of pulp were directed to landfills.\n\n## 20.8 kg\n\nof waste per tonne of pulp were directed to landfills.\n\n- The goal is to reduce the amount 0\n- of waste directed to landfills per 03\n\n2\n\ntonne of pulp produced to\n\n13.3 kg\n\nFurthermore, in many cases, what is waste for the forestry industry becomes raw material for other sectors. As a way of accelerating the achievement of our goal, we created the VINO area (Sale of Non-Operating Items) , as part of the Procurement team, to sell industrial waste generated by our operations.\n\n## \\_ STANDARDS\n\n| Waste sent to landfill cell  [kg/ton on dry basis (kg/t)]   |   2019 |   2020 |   2021 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Consolidated total                                          |   36.1 |   31.7 |   20.8 |\n\n| Waste                                                 | 2019                  | 2019             | 2019         | 2020                  | 2020             | 2020         | 2021                      | 2021             | 2021                  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------|---------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|\n| generated,  by type and  operation [metric  tons (t)] | Non- hazardous  waste | Hazardous  Waste | Total        | Non- hazardous  waste | Hazardous  Waste | Total        | Non- hazardous  waste     | Hazardous  Waste | Total                 |\n| Forestry  operations                                  | 1,513.36              | 1,373.18         | 2,886.54     | 1,028.00              | 907.00           | 1,935.00     | 8,512.55                  | 1,004.66         | 9,517.21              |\n| Industrial  operations                                | 1,322,823.45          | 1,489.19         | 1,324,312.64 | 1,417,100.66          | 1,068.40         | 1,418,169.06 | 1,422,529.00              | 1,325.75         | 1,423,854.75          |\n| Total                                                 | 1,324,336.81          | 2,862.37         | 1,327,199.18 | 1,418,128.66 1,975.40 |                  |              | 1,420,104.06 1,431,041.55 |                  | 2,330.41 1,433,371.96 |\n\n20 20\n\n## 2 0 21",

We have a digital tool, developed internally by our teams, which recommends, through algorithms and in real time, the best allocation of available steam for each turbine, optimizing energy generation. We also developed a project with the goal of increasing the specific generation of steam by our industrial boilers per amount of fuel consumed, to increase the generation of electricity.\n\n## THE ECONOMIZA\u00cd PROGRAM\n\nThe Economiza\u00ed program ('Please Save' program) was launched in March 2021, at the Mucuri unit, with the goal of creating awareness of conscious and rational use of energy to drive a change in behavior and practices within our unit. All employees participate in this initiative, which includes concepts that go beyond the company's walls and reach their homes and families.\n\nIn October, the program was expanded to other Suzano units. However, due to scheduled shutdowns for general maintenance and other scheduling conflicts in some of the units, the pace of implementation and, consequently, the results of the program varied from one unit to another. In any case, the results achieved through December are significant and the trend is for the initiative to continue to advance in 2022.\n\nOne of our Commitments to Renewing Life is to increase the amount of renewable energy sent to the Brazilian energy matrix. The biggest step we have taken toward this goal was the approval of the Cerrado project, which will generate, on average, 180 MW of excess renewable energy, which will be sent back to the Brazilian grid.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLearn about the results of our Greenhouse Gas Inventory base year 2021, by visiting our Sustainability Center .\n\n## REDUCTION IN CONSUMPTION\n\nMWh\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nR$ 8,034,968.54\n\n32,267.9 TOTAL:\n\n## EconomizA\u00ed Program - 2021\n\n| Unit       | MWH       | R$             |\n|------------|-----------|----------------|\n| Mucuri     | 11,940.70 | R$3,140,000.00 |\n| Imperatriz | 14,334.00 | R$2,866,850.22 |\n| Suzano     | 1,601.20  | R$432,324.00   |\n| Jacare\u00ed    | 4,392.00  | R$1,595,794.32 |\n\nImperatriz unit (state of Maranh\u00e3o).Photo: M\u00e1rcio Schimming.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \\_ STANDARDS\n\n| Degree of renewability of Suzano's energy matrix   | 2019    | 2020    | 2021    |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Percentage of energy from non-renewable sources    | 12.69%  | 12.82%  | 12.31%  |\n| Percentage of energy from renewable sources        | 87.31%  | 87.18%  | 87.69%  |\n| Overall                                            | 100.00% | 100.00% | 100.00% |\n\n## Total of energy consumption (GJ)\n\n| GRI 302-1                       | 2019           | 2020           | 2021           |\n|---------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Fuel from non-renewable sources | 28,049,382.05  | 28,024,857.22  | 30,956,553.51  |\n| Fuels from renewable sources    | 216,521,617.38 | 214,386,646.59 | 220,444,126.07 |\n| energy consumption              | 3,429,652.68   | 3,498,800.20   | 3,872,202.27   |\n| Energy sold                     | 5,303,394.46   | 5,646,273.28   | 5,711,287.89   |\n| Overall                         | 242,697,257.65 | 240,264,030.73 | 249,561,593.96 |\n\n## Carbon balance (removals and emissions) [in ton CO 2 equivalent (tCO 2 e)]\u00b9\n\n|                                                 | 2019           | 2020           | 2021           |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Scope 1 Emissions                               | 2,142,410.89   | 2,155,102.69   | 2,328,335.53   |\n| Scope 2 Emissions                               | 71,225.59      | 59,531.90      | 137,822.64     |\n| Scope 3 Emissions                               | 1,511,361.76   | 1,568,893.44   | 1,842,095.64   |\n| Total emissions                                 | 3,724,998.24   | 3,783,528.03   | 4,308,251.814  |\n| Balance between land use emissions and removals | -15,476,553.88 | -18,983,839.64 | -13,204,509.36 |\n| Total balance (emissions - removals)            | -11,751,555.64 | -15,200,311.61 | -8,896,257.55  |\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## \\_ COLLABORATIVE AGENDA\n\nThe climate and biodiversity crises stress the urgency of engaging governments, society and the private sector to, together, promote the necessary changes to fight them. Although the impacts are known, the time for the adoption of effective measures to address these issues is only getting shorter.\n\nThe creation of a future focused on the low carbon economy is directly connected to the issues discussed at COP26, in Scotland, in November 2021. Leading up to the conference, Suzano held a series of preparatory events and meetings with companies, representatives of the Brazilian government, the press and global leaders. A group of Suzano executives represented the company at the conference.\n\nSuzano defends that, to achieve concrete targets related to lower carbon emissions in the long term, governments, companies and civil society must establish and achieve short- and medium-term goals.\n\nIn this sense, the company joined the Climate Action 100+ initiative (led by investors to ensure that the largest corporate emitters of greenhouse gases adopt the necessary measures to fight climate change) and the Assessing Low-Carbon Transition (ACT) initiative for the pulp and paper industries. We also recently joined the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi), the Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C campaign and the Race to Zero campaign, as part of these two initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnd the company remains attentive to new trends and methodologies. In addition to the SBTi, the creation of a new protocol by the GHG Protocol for measuring carbon removals will lead Suzano to set, in the medium term, targets according to the specifications of each new development. In the future, we expect to make new commitments in line with these two initiatives.\n\n## \\_ CARBON CREDIT MARKET\n\nFor Suzano, the carbon market linked to the Paris Agreement is a viable and promising mechanism for offsetting emissions and protecting nature. In this market, Brazil has the potential to generate carbon credits in the amount of approximately 1 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent, with revenues of approximately US$100 billion by 2030 1 . The forestry sector accounts for more than half of these credits, through initiatives related to sustainable management and the recovery of native forests.\n\nCreating a market mechanism for carbon trading is an initiative that requires the combined effort of many players. Positioned as part of the solution in the various forums on this issue, the company participates in collaborative initiatives that seek to establish standards and alignment around a common goal. This includes Suzano's active engagement with peers, partners, governments and other entities to support regulatory mechanisms and impact projects that can influence the climate agenda.\n\nEucalyptus plantation, A\u00e7ail\u00e2ndia (state of Maranh\u00e3o).

These companies made a public commitment to conserve, restore and grow more than 3.6 billion trees in more than 60 countries by 2030. It is important to note that we are the only Brazilian company that is part of this movement, in which we participate as a member of the Advisory Committee.\n\n## COP26 - SUZANO'S POSITION\n\nGRI 103-2\n\nFor Suzano, COP26, the UN Climate Conference, held in Glasgow, Scotland, in November 2021, was a unique opportunity to discuss alternatives to ensure the planet's climate security.\n\nThe conference highlighted important advances with regards to targets and to a system to invest in projects for global decarbonization. The conference also made it clear that we will need immediate and effective action by governments, companies and consumers.\n\nIn addition to the commitments made in support of this agenda, throughout 2021 Suzano worked to help promote knowledge and encourage practical action. In its 2050 Now website, a company initiative launched in October 2021, Suzano has made its positions, news and related analysis publicly available.\n\nLearn more by visiting the 2050 Now website .\n\nThis initiative, led by the platform 1t.org, aims to promote the planting of 1 trillion native trees worldwide by the end of this decade. It is part of the World Economic Forum's efforts to accelerate nature-based solutions in support of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030).",

The company quickly suspended its activities in the area to investigate the complaint. So far, Suzano has not been provided with the technical details of the pilot project included in the Action Plan, preventing the company from properly investigating the accusation.\n\nSuzano is part of the Ita\u00fanas River Basin Committee, which is responsible for the Plan.\n\nHowever, the document does not include the details or criteria that enable the identification of the areas covered by the plan.\n\nThe company reaffirms its commitment to the Action Plan and has sought to identify the priority areas for restoration included in it, as well as to understand how they correlate with the restoration program already developed by Suzano to ensure alignment among the parties involved in its implementation. The company is in constant dialogue with all the organizations that are part of the Ita\u00fanas River Basin Committee to clarify all the facts as soon as possible. While the investigation is being carried out, forestry activities in the area mentioned by SAPI remain suspended.\n\n.\n\n## \\_Human Rights\n\n- Click here to learn more.\n\n## \\_Land Management at Veracel Celulose\n\n- Click here to learn more.\n\n## \\_Operation of the Caravelas Maritime Terminal and occurrence of mud in Nova Vi\u00e7osa\n\n- Click here to learn more.\n\n## \\_Indigenous Communities\n\nRead in the Communities chapter\n\n.\n\n## \\_Quilombola Communities\n\nRead in the Communities chapter\n\n.",

The implementation of the strategy will start with the creation of a territory matrix, which will include a map of social and economic indicators for each area, the company's influence, the key regional players, their innovation potential and the good practices already in place.\n\nIn addition, this methodology will result in the construction of Territorial Plans, which will define important lines of work and projects that will contribute to increase the resilience of the regions where the company operates. In 2021, together with external partners, we concluded pilot projects in the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo and Bahia and implemented this process in the state of Maranh\u00e3o. In 2022, this methodology will also be implemented in the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Mato Grosso do Sul.\n\nColmeias program, state of Mato Grosso do Sul.

The company recognizes that it has an important role to play and has made two Commitments to Renewing Life that reinforce its contribution to social development: reducing poverty and improving the quality of education.\n\nOur objective is to contribute to advance structural efforts, such as the creation of work and the generation of income, associated with the improvement of education. We believe that these are catalysts for community development that promote the autonomy of communities.\n\nIn 2021, we managed to lift more than 9,000\n\nCurrently, our social programs benefit people in eight states: Bahia, Esp\u00edrito Santo, Minas Gerais, Maranh\u00e3o, Par\u00e1, Tocantins, Mato Grosso do Sul and S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nIn 2021, as we continued to expand our efforts to create work and generate income, we increased our social participation and helped lift more than 9,000 people (or 2,889 families) out of poverty. Despite the challenges imposed by the pandemic, we managed to exceed our annual target by 12.5% (our goal for 2021 was to lift 8,000 people out of poverty). This translated into an average income increase of 57.7%.\n\nwhich corresponds to\n\npeople benefited from the income generation programs\n\n21,075\n\n57.7% increase in average income\n\nS ince we outlined our social strategy, we have strengthened our income generating processes year after year. Our Commitments to Renewing Life , announced in February 2020, established a new level of social performance for the company, requiring an increase in scale and scope. Our two commitments in the social area are directly linked to income generation and education, two important issues for which we want to create innovative and sustainable solutions by working together with the communities and civil society organizations in the areas where we operate.\n\nIn line with these commitments, we organized ourselves to create and discuss the evolution of our Resilient Territories strategy.\n\npeople out of poverty",

Our baseline is the weighted average of public elementary education in priority municipalities, which, according to the most recent IDEB (2019) was 4.7. Our goal is that the municipalities served by Suzano reach 40% of their education target and a 6.6 weighted average. The challenging situation of education in Brazil, which was aggravated by the pandemic, required that the expectations regarding progress in the first cycle evaluated in 2021 be adjusted. In this sense, maintaining the 2019 average will be considered progress. The updated index will be published by the Ministry of Education in 2022.\n\nTo support this commitment, the company has the Suzano Education Program, which invests in improving public education through the\n\nIn 2021, our work included:\n\nnew municipalities, totaling Expansion of the program to\n\n13\n\n36 municipalities in 7 Brazilian states (Bahia, Esp\u00edrito Santo, Maranh\u00e3o, Mato Grosso do Sul, Par\u00e1, Tocantins and S\u00e3o Paulo)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1,750 elementary schools\n\n298,146 students from the\n\npublic school system\n\nprofessional development of educators and social participation with a focus on student learning.\n\nIn 2021, the methodology of the Suzano Education Program evolved and reached schools directly through training also for school administrators and teachers, to accelerate the expected results in the next nine years.

The World Bank set the poverty line in upper-middle-income countries at US$5.50 per person/day (R$475 monthly in 2020). Therefore, families living with a per capita income below this number are considered multidimensionally poor.\n\n## 2021 HIGHLIGHTS\n\nImplementing processes to minimize and mitigate social and economic impacts in places where access is limited or restricted has been a very complex task. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020, we have worked to understand how to better face this challenge. Based on an analysis of the pandemic from a global perspective and the hundreds of commitments we have in the locations neighboring our operations, we decided to prioritize resources to maintain our ability to serve the communities, assuming that this would be a long-lasting crisis-which has proved to be true.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to provide emergency support in all regions. We continued to embrace as many ideas as possible, based on partnerships and community engagement, to face the impacts caused by the coronavirus in the locations where we are present. At the same time, we dedicated efforts to developing new methodologies such as Resilient Territories.\n\nConcomitant deprivation in other indicators in addition to income indicates the intensity of a family's poverty.\n\nLast year, in addition to establishing the components of the Suzano MPI  and the methodology for measuring poverty, the company chose eight associations to carry out a pilot test, including indigenous, quilombola, agricultural, urban and artisanal fishing communities. The pilot project, scheduled for the first half of 2022, will test all the steps for calculating the MPI, from data collection to results. The company has already created a questionnaire that will provide a better understanding of the living conditions of the families in the vicinity of Suzano's areas by systematically measuring the impact of our operations and by taking into account the levels of economic development and social transformation achieved in these regions.\n\nThere are 3 million people below the poverty line in the areas where we operate. In the 56 municipalities where we prioritize our social strategy, this number totals 977,000. These figures are from the 2010 census-the absence of consistent data from the federal government confirms our responsibility and the expectations of these communities about Suzano's efforts. The company recognizes its clear role in creating transformational solutions for society.\n\nThe following were some of the initiatives we implemented:\n\nEmergency action: We focused our efforts on three main groups: priority municipalities for relationship-building; groups and institutions with limited income alternatives at the moment; and neighboring communities (urban and rural) with a high degree of social and economic vulnerability.

This initiative benefited 36 entities and more than 50,000 people in 77 municipalities in nine Brazilian states (Bahia, Esp\u00edrito Santo, Maranh\u00e3o, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Par\u00e1, Pernambuco, S\u00e3o Paulo and Tocantins). The campaign engaged 26 suppliers, thanks to an investment of R$5.3 million by Suzano.\n\nOther projects: Suzano continued the programs and projects that were already being implemented in the communities, such as the Rural Land Development Program and the Colmeias project ('Beehive' project).\n\nResults of the Emergency Call for Proposals in 2021:\n\n## R$1,165,000 invested\n\n44\n\nprojects approved\n\n2,951 people benefited by the projects\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have significant operations in xx municipalities, with different levels of land concentration. In some regions, the company's activities are spread over more than 50% of their territory. When these areas were acquired by the company, they had already been anthropized-a large percentage was formed by degraded pastures that were recovered for the planting of our trees. Even so, eucalyptus monoculture continues to be the target of much criticism and questioning from society, which, despite being positive for keeping us informed about the hopes and concerns of the local communities, seems to us to be largely without foundation or technical justification, as we explore below.\n\nThis issue, which is extremely important to Suzano, needs to be further explored and clarified. For us, rural zoning must respect the economic, social and cultural calling of each territory. The key question is: does monoculture prevent or limit the practice of traditional cultures, or does it threaten food security in the region? We understand that monoculture\n\nis harmful when it hinders traditional cultures or harms the local environment. Suzano affirms the right of these groups to traditionality and, recognizing its role, adopts the most advanced forest management practices, carries out family farming programs and supports economic and social development projects in the locations where it operates. This includes initiatives aimed at traditional communities, such as quilombola and indigenous peoples, founded on constant dialogue with the people involved.\n\nThis is not to say that we are fully satisfied with our performance. We know that we have room to evolve, and our ambition is to generate and share value with everyone and help lift 200,000 people out of poverty in the areas where we operate by 2030. We work in locations that have a low human development index (HDI) and still practice very informal economic activities. We want to increase the promotion of forestry in these locations.\n\nWe recognize that the social needs in these regions will always be greater than the capacity to absorb labor. Therefore, Suzano also develops and promotes programs to train and prepare local suppliers, so that they can work both with\n\nSuzano and with other local companies. As part of this process, we also want to support the many outsourced workers that are part of our ecosystem, giving them better conditions to establish themselves in the municipalities where we have a significant presence.\n\nSuzano builds bridges to better understand the communities and, through that, help them have a better quality of life. However, we recognize that we cannot to do it all alone. The solution for the issue of unequal wealth distribution along the chain, for example, does not depend only on the company. However, we want to influence the creation of public policies and, through the set of initiatives we share with governments, local entities and society, create wealth and social and environmental equality for all.",

Our only existing overlap was resolved with the definitive demarcation of 11,000 hectares in the town of Aracruz, in 2007. The company promptly reverted the intrusion on indigenous territory. Additionally, for the past 10 years Suzano has maintained a comprehensive relationship and social investment program in the 12 villages (Tupiniquim and Guarani) in the municipality. The program includes integrated and long-term initiatives aimed at restoring the environmental conditions necessary for sociocultural practices, the affirmation of ethnic identity and the development of sustainable economic activities.\n\nHermenegilda Angelo dos Santos, participant in the Cer\u00e2mica Vargem do Tanque program, in Cunha (state of S\u00e3o Paulo).

In 2021, in the north of the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo, where Suzano has eucalyptus plantations, preservation areas and an operation base, seven repossession processes were carried out to stop the action of clandestine groups that took advantage of the quilombola land agenda in the region to encourage real estate speculation in company-owned areas close to traditional communities-going as far as trying to force them to participate in the occupations. The land issue is addressed in specific forums, with the participation of the community, the company and public authorities, through an inclusive process of dialogue.\n\nApart from the land issue, for more than ten years Suzano has maintained an extensive relationship program with all these communities, including several lines of social investment and directly benefiting 20 quilombola associations. Initiatives in progress include technical and financial support to strengthen production and ensure food security; document regularization of traditional farmers and their community associations; processing and marketing of farm products; and development of small community businesses.\n\nSuzano also launched a Call for Proposals for Quilombola projects, an initiative in partnership with the National Coordination of the Networking Efforts of Rural Black Quilombola Communities (CONAQ, for its initials in Portuguese), focused on income generation initiatives.

Like a memoir, they offer us perspectives from the past, the small details of the present and an idea of how far we can go into the future. Therefore, I commend the collective work of so many hands and areas to create this comprehensive narrative, which only exists thanks to the dedication of Suzano's 36,000 direct and indirect employees.\n\nThese 159 impeccably designed pages give us access to a large amount of data, figures, stories and results that demonstrate Suzano's global leadership in its industry. There is considerable balance among financial, environmental and corporate governance highlights, including comparisons between 2020, 2021 and 2030.\n\nIt must be said that innovability is a feminine noun in the Portuguese language. If the company wants to exude this attribute, it must pursue gender equity more intentionally. As is said in the report, innovation is not only reflected in the development of projects and processes, but also in governance. This demands constant and uninterrupted action to reinforce institutional gender policies within the chain, teams, customers and suppliers. Having 22.5% of leadership positions occupied by women in 2021 and 30% occupied by women and people of color by 2025 is still unambitious and short of true innovation, which must always be intersectional.\n\nA critical argument regarding diversity, equity and inclusion is how inseparable they are from climate, social and environmental justice in Brazil. Therefore, I would like to recognize two missing components: 1) inclusion policies that also consider indigenous people and 2) greater level of detail and visibility of initiatives related to indigenous communities, quilombola remnants and land rights movements. In addition to providing a numerical account of what the company has done, it is extremely important to collect and publish short testimonials and stories about what these representatives, families and groups have to say. These voices reinforce the legitimacy of and the commitment to reducing inequalities.\n\nFinally, more than celebrating results, we must always learn to communicate them in a relatable manner and with the necessary urgency. In this sense, data and numbers related to corporate communications are also essential to measure the impact of Suzano's presence on social media, its website and the coverage it receives from the Brazilian media. Therefore, I suggest the creation of a section dedicated to communication indicators and overall metrics, which, without a doubt, is a strategic area for the company's reputation, crisis management, positions and narrative.\n\nThis is a time of multiple crises: climate, political, economic, social and health. The Commitments to Renewing Life, so well recorded from page 30 onwards, cannot wait too long. In times of so many deaths and losses, the well-being of the planet and people becomes urgent.",

All of this demonstrates the company's strength and commitment to this issue.\n\nThe report also attests to Suzano's strong work in the ESG arena, providing a broad perspective of all areas. Information included in the report shows that the company has, in general, good measurement of its impacts and a call to accelerate positive action through its 2050 Now initiative.\n\nThe innovability agenda is very interesting from the core business perspective, but it presents an opportunity for a broader view.\n\nConsidering the planting phase, the focus is on the development of genetically modified variations to improve productivity and reduce water and energy consumption. In this case, there is an opportunity regarding the company's position on recovery and regeneration.\n\nWhen looking at the issue of regenerative planting, there are three points to be considered: regeneration of areas for cultivation, preservation through natural corridors of available area and planting model. The first two points were covered in the report.\n\nThe challenge is mainly linked to the planting model. It must go beyond the conventional monoculture approach and consider the option of diversified planting and polyculture that can help address challenges of other sectors and be a competitive advantage.\n\nRegarding developed products, the positive impact is focused on the renewable source of the raw materials. This can in fact be an advantageous starting point in relation to non-renewable materials, but, especially in the case of competition with plastic resins in packaging, the textile industry and the use of lignin, it is essential to have analyses that demonstrate that your products are better throughout their entire life cycle compared to most common options. Another key issue is to ensure participation in the creation of this ecosystem to validate that they are beneficial options, even after use by consumers, encouraging reusability and recycling.\n\nThis last point is linked to the emissions inventory. It is a major milestone that the company already has a negative carbon balance, considering scopes 1, 2 and 3. Specifically with regard to scope 3, it is worth further detailing what is being considered and including in the scope the total life cycle of products and services.\n\nFinally, regarding the social agenda, Suzano's 2030 commitments include lifting 200,000 people out of poverty. The indicator used to measure success in this area is income growth. There is an opportunity here to enhance this focus by looking at a resilience agenda. Globally, this issue is connected with the goal of promoting resilience to 4 billion people who live in situations of social vulnerability and are already affected by climate change.\n\nThis report demonstrates Suzano's important pioneering spirit and the seriousness of its sustainability strategy and execution, showing that the company is an important player, not only within the forestry industry, but also in the Brazilian business sector. And with that, there are always opportunities to expand this work through multi-company initiatives and thus further enhance the positive results.",

        "page_content": "## TECHNICAL OPINION ON THE REPORT AND ITS VERIFICATION\n\n- \u00b7 Suzano's Report consists of a complete edition and a Sustainability Center, both available on the company's website. The scope of our verification covered the 2021 data and indicators on the material topics presented in these publications, with the exception of the specific indicators of TCFD and SASB;\n- \u00b7 The Report is based on 8 material topics defined in a materiality assessment carried out in 2021. In our understanding, the review of the topics brings an updated perspective on the impacts of the company's activities. We highlight the inclusion of new topics: Innovability, biodiversity & ecosystem services, human rights and diversity &inclusion;\n- \u00b7 In respect to the implementation of the Cerrado project, we observed, through interviews and document review, a 2021 report, which demonstrates a broad participatory diagnosis and the involvement of local actors, in the analysis of the socio-environmental impacts of the construction of the industrial site. This evidence that Suzano seeks to implement a sustainability strategy in the region. However, the Report presents little information regarding this process;\n- \u00b7 We noticed that Suzano has robust processes for collecting and consolidating social performance data in relation to the communities in its surroundings. However, the Report is timid in presenting results of management reviews on the year 2021, in relation to the negative and/or positive social impacts of its activities. The Report\n\nalso does not present the approach of social management in local communities by region, with their respective characteristics;\n\n- \u00b7 Regarding the GRI 403-7 Indicator (Prevention and mitigation of occupational health and safety impacts directly linked by business relationships), we evidenced that Suzano presents the health and safety actions and tools used in the company's processes and not those related to the products and services;\n- \u00b7 Regarding 'incidents of discrimination and corrective actions taken' (GRI indicator 406-1) in the Cerrado project, it was not possible to evidence the data associated with the indicator;\n- \u00b7 Related to the proportion of spending on local suppliers (GRI 204-1 indicator), although we have seen improvements in internal supply processes with a project to recategorize suppliers, we noted that Suzano is still looking for effective procedures to improve its performance on the indicador;\n- \u00b7 In relation to risks and opportunities related to biodiversity and ecosystem services, we found that the Report presents qualitative information, especially on opportunities, not disclosing risk scenarios;\n- \u00b7 We  observed that Suzano reports data on all waste generated at its units. However, we evidenced that, in some operational units, the method of compiling the data of the GRI 306-6 indicator 'Waste sent for final destination', was aligned with the Waste Commitment, which includes industrial solid waste destined for own or third-party landfills,\n\nand not the technical requirements of the GRI indicator, which covers all types of waste sent to final destination;\n\n- \u00b7 It is our understanding that sufficient indicators have been reported, to achieve the Core option of the GRI Standard for Sustainability Reports.\n\n## TE CHNICAL OPINION ON THE COMMITMENTS TO RENEWING LIFE (CRL)\n\n- \u00b7 During our Verification, we evidenced that Suzano's Commitments were structured in an objective and challenging manner. Additionally, we observed that Suzano has established documented procedures in order to ensure the planning, operation and control of each CRL, as well as the creation of an information database in the Sharepoint system (Microsoft) to analyze and quarterly monitor the results;\n- \u00b7 We verified that, for 2 consecutive years, Suzano did not reach the goal established in relation to the Energy Commitment 'Increase the export of renewable energy by 50%', due to the occurrence of unplanned events, such as the shutdown of the turbine of the turbogenerators (TG) of the Imperatriz unit in 2021;\n- \u00b7 We evidence that in 2021 Suzano established the Commitment of 'Connecting 500 thousand hectares of priority areas for biodiversity conservation in the Cerrado, the Atlantic Forest and the Amazon by 2030', referring to the Biodiversity CRL. In this cycle, it was possible to verify the methodology used to structure the goal, as well as the unfolding of\n\nthe commitment in actions, among them, the definition of the ecological corridors. From the next cycle onwards, it will be possible to assess the reliability and accuracy of the data generated;\n\n- \u00b7 We observed that the Commitment 'Water in the Forest - Increase water availability in 100% of critical watersheds' is a set of operational actions in the company's areas. We also evidenced that in 2021 Suzano expanded the studies to measure the use of water in the forest, using medium and high resolution satellites, to establish the available water in critical hydrographic basins;\n- \u00b7 We evidenced a robust structure of Suzano's internal diversity and inclusion program called 'Somos Plurais', an initiative that provides for actions committed to respecting and promoting the rights of employees and disseminating engagement practices, which are directly related to the Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) Commitment for Women, D&I Black People, D&I Inclusive Environment LGBTQIAP+ and People with Desabilities (PwD) and D&I Accessibility. We found that the 2021 results of the D&I Commitments made significant progress compared to the established baseline;\n- \u00b7 Regarding the Commitment 'Removing people from the poverty line', we evidenced a robust system of registering people and monitoring projects that increase their economic gains. However, the challenges of managing a large database of people, as more people are monitored for economic gains, requires a refined methodology.",

It is important to establish an objective, reliable and independent database for the economic measurement of the people covered by this goal. The correlation of production data with economic gains can be used for this, as it avoids the single use of self-declared data by people. The tools used to monitor the Commitment shall be compatible with the volume of data to be processed.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nAs a result of our assurance we concluded that:\n\n- \u00b7 The information presented in the Report is balanced, consistent and reliable;\n- \u00b7 Suzano established appropriate systems for the collection, aggregation and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data used in the Report;\n- \u00b7 The Report adheres to the Principles for defining report content and quality of the GRI Standards and meet its Core level;\n- \u00b7 The Commitments to Renewing Life were established in a structured and challenging way.\n\n## DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND IMPARTIALITY\n\nBureau Veritas Certification is an independent professional services firm specializing in Quality, Health, Safety, Socialand Environmental Management, with more than185 years' experience in independent assessment.\n\nBureau Veritas has a quality management system that is certified by a third party, according to which policies and documented procedures are maintained for the compliance with ethic, professional and legal requirements.\n\nThe assessment team has no links with Suzano and the assessment is performed independently.\n\nBureau Veritas implemented and follows a Code of Ethics throughout its business, in order to assure that its staff preserve high ethical, integrity, objectivity, confidentiality and competence/ professional attitude standards in the performance of their activities.At the end of the assessment, a detailed report was drawn up, ensuring traceability of the process.
