        "page_content": "## Growing Stronger to Care Better\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dear and Esteemed Fellow Shareholders,\n\nFrom the very inception, we at Reliance have believed that a corporate is much more than an economic unit generating wealth. It is an integral part of the social system catering to human and societal needs and aspirations. The painful period of the COVID-19 pandemic brought out Reliance's spirit of societal service like never before. The way the whole Reliance Family worked with a sense of national duty in this period was most satisfying to me, and I am sure, to all of you as well.\n\nWe were able to quickly change and repurpose our processes, our policies, our roles and responsibilities, our plants, our systems with a single motive - to support others. If the production teams worked over producing PPE kits or medical-grade oxygen, the Jio and Retail teams took care that no customer was left without daily essentials or internet\n\nservices. The IT teams ensured employees could work remotely, and the HR teams ensured the employees received the best possible social security. Our Foundation hospitals and internal medical teams ensured all employees and their families received timely medical help regardless of location, while creating the largest COVID infrastructure panIndia in the shortest possible time. The Foundation teams took up the mammoth responsibility of reaching out to the most disadvantaged, marginalised communities to ensure nobody went hungry.\n\nEach and every Reliance Family member directly or indirectly participated in the fight against COVID. Each and every Reliance Family member went beyond their call of duty. Each and every Reliance Family member became the Brand Ambassador of Reliance's spirit of\n\nReliance played a leading role in caring for India and Indians in the last couple of years of the pandemic. We now aim to care for the Planet as we embark on our most exciting transformation - the Green Transformation.\n\n## Shri Mukesh D. Ambani\n\nChairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries\n\nCare and Empathy. It is heartening to see that together we have overcome the worst. It is with great hope that I look forward to the future of Reliance, of India, as well as the entire world.\n\n## Taking volatility in stride\n\nJust when we were about to heave a sigh of relief, the rise in geopolitical tensions have exposed the fault lines in the global economy. Geopolitical conflict has caused significant dislocation in energy markets and disrupted traditional trade flows. The process of globalisation, which drove the global economic growth over the last four decades, appears to have hit a wall. The cause of economic inter-dependence that globalisation promoted to help align every country's interests and, thereby, help reduce conflicts, has taken a back seat.\n\nFortunately, Reliance is better equipped to face these uncertainties today than ever before. Reliance has built three extremely agile and highly potent growth engines - Digital Services, Retail and O2C - which were all tested, and came out with flying colours, during the COVID-led extreme volatility. It is just last year that Reliance deleveraged its balance sheet to a net debt zero status. Besides, India's own strong growth prospects over the next couple of decades bodes well for Reliance.\n\nReliance has maintained its leadership position among Indian corporates for nearly three decades now. It is Reliance's ability to innovate, to build in unparalleled flexibility, to transform itself from time to time and the great conviction in India's capability to compete globally at world-scale, which has helped the Company stay at the top and continue making newer records.\n\n## Green transformation begins\n\nGetting bigger and stronger only means Reliance is ready to take up even greater responsibilities to serve not just the surrounding communities or India, but also the whole planet. Reliance has made a firm commitment to become one of the world's leaders in the fight against the crisis of climate change.\n\nFY 2021-22 marked the beginning of Reliance's Green Transformation, at a scale which will make India the world's leading green energy producer. We know that affordability is the most critical factor in the adoption of any new technology and the scale of societal benefit it can create. Reliance has embarked on this journey with a vision to repeat the feat it achieved in wireless broadband. In the field of Green Energy - Reliance will develop end-to-end Green Energy solutions, which will make clean and abundant\n\nenergy available to everyone at the most affordable price. Just as India has the world's most affordable wireless broadband today, we will have the world's most affordable Green Energy within this decade. And these solutions will then be exported to other countries, helping them contain carbon emissions.\n\nLeveraging its world-class execution capability and the strong debtfree balance sheet, Reliance has committed to improving the economics of this Green ecosystem to directly compete with the fossil fuels. However, one cannot operate in just one segment of the Green Energy value chain and hope the cost-efficient ecosystem will come up on its own. Reliance has undertaken to enable the entire Green Energy ecosystem throughout India starting with solar power generation, to production of green hydrogen to its distribution and consumption.\n\nGreen Energy is a rapidly evolving vast global industry with a lot of technological innovation under way. To guide on this path, we established the Reliance New Energy Council with some of the globally renowned thought leaders in the field. To kickstart the initiative, last year Reliance announced a $10 billion capex commitment over three years.\n\nWe entered into a series of partnerships, including equity investments, with local and international corporates with unique technological and execution capabilities, with a strong track record of innovation and a growing number of patents and IPRs across the Green Energy value chain.\n\nReliance's partnerships include companies like Ambri in the US, Faradion in the UK and The Netherlands-based Lithium Werks in the energy storage space.\n\nSimilarly, Reliance invested in Germany's NexWafe, which is a\n\npioneer in next-gen technology to produce monocrystalline silicon wafers needed in making solar panels. We also acquired promoters' stake in REC Solar - a global technology leader in solar panel manufacturing. Reliance picked up a 40% stake in Sterling & Wilson Renewable Energy - one of the world's leading EPC turnkey contractors in large scale solar projects.\n\nIn the Hydrogen ecosystem, Reliance joined hands with the US-based Chart Industries to set up India H2/uni00A0Alliance to commercialise hydrogen technology and develop a supply chain in collaboration with other Indian stakeholders. We also entered into an agreement with Denmark's Stiesdal A/S for its innovative next-gen electrolyser technology, which has the potential to reduce dramatically the cost of producing hydrogen from pure water.\n\nSimultaneously, we began work on the four Giga-factories at Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex to set up world-scale production capacity for solar panels, energy storage systems, electrolysers and fuel cells spread over 5,000 acres in Jamnagar. Reliance will also invest in creating an ecosystem of thousands of small and medium scale project consultants and installers pan-India to set up Green Energy generation projects in every nook and corner of the country. Similarly, Reliance will undertake large Giga Watt scale turnkey Green Energy projects for Power GenCos or large investors on its own.\n\nWith these collaborations and the Giga-factories, Reliance is set to achieve a uniquely integrated position in the Green Energy value chain globally. This deep integration, apart from the new-age technologies and world-class execution capabilities, will ensure Reliance's renewable energy systems stay at the cutting edge of cost efficiency",

        "page_content": "globally. Greater affordability and competitive cost structures will ensure massive adoption of Green Energy solutions, providing a booster to India's Green Energy transition, as well as helping our country to become 'Atma Nirbhar' in our energy needs.\n\n## A step towards Net Carbon Zero\n\nReliance also took an important step towards our goal to achieve net carbon zero status by year 2035. We initiated the process to separate the petcoke gasification complex into a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, with an aim to repurpose the unit and unlock value through future collaborations.\n\nPresently, the syngas produced at the complex is used as fuel at the Jamnagar complex and is a major source of carbon emission. With Reliance switching to green and renewable energy for its energy needs, syngas will become available for upgradation to high value petrochemicals and hydrogen fuel. The highly concentrated stream of CO2 in syngas can be easily captured and sequestered. All these steps will greatly reduce the carbon footprint of the Jamnagar complex.\n\n## Financial and operational performance FY 2021-22\n\nLet me now elaborate on Reliance's operating and financial performance during FY 2021-22.\n\nDuring the year, Reliance was able to overcome all the pandemic-led difficulties to post another record performance operationally as well as financially with strong contribution from all our businesses. Both the consumer businesses, Retail and Digital Services, recorded highest ever revenues and EBITDA. The E&P business also posted significantly improved numbers with strong volume growth and improved realisations. The largest contributor to our earnings - the O2C business\n\ntoo delivered robust earnings with strong fuel margins.\n\nReliance posted a record high EBITDA of ' 1,25,687 crore on a consolidated basis for FY 2021-22, which was 28.8% up from the previous year. The consolidated net profit for the year stood at ' 67,845 crore again a new record.\n\nThe Company had achieved a net debt-free status last year, thanks to the largest ever capital raise we had carried out in India Inc.'s history in the previous year. During FY 2021-22, the Company's capex increased in all businesses, due to which the year closed with marginal net debt.\n\nThe Company continues to manage its treasury operations actively and efficiently to reduce interest burden and lengthen maturities. At the very beginning of FY 2021-22, Reliance Industries made history by raising a jumbo loan of $4 billion on better terms than any corporate in the Asian region with similar credit profile. It was the largest-ever foreign currency bond issuance from India, with the lowest coupon rate achieved for benchmark 30-year and 40-year issuances by a private sector BBB corporate from Asia exJapan. Similarly, the Company paid ' 30,791 crore to the Government of India towards its 15 years of future spectrum dues to save on annual interest cost burden.\n\n## Executing our growth plans\n\nReliance's diversified portfolio of business verticals represent our growth engines, where we have been adding capabilities consistently. During FY 2021-22, each one of these growth engines moved into top gear, cementing Reliance's position further as India's largest company by sales, profits as well as market value.\n\n## Retail\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBraving the intermittent COVID restrictions, the Retail business continued to expand offline, as well as online. It added nearly 8 million sq/uni00A0ft of retail space taking its total retail space to over 41.6 million sq ft. Besides, the business added 11.1 million sq ft of warehousing space during the year. Importantly, the business created over 1,50,000 jobs through the year.\n\nThe business posted all time high revenues and EBITDA with steady improvement in profit margins. Growth was seen across all product categories from Consumer Electronics to Grocery to Apparel & Footwear. Even the relatively smaller segments of jewellery, pharma and furniture & home d\u00e9cor, and new businesses like Freshpik and Milkbasket, witnessed rapid growth.\n\nIn our New Commerce initiative, the focus remained on on-boarding merchants during the year. FY 2021-22 witnessed over 3-fold jump in the number of merchants onboarded as compared to the previous year.\n\nThe Retail business continued to forge partnerships across the value chain to enhance customer experience and product offerings. Throughout the year, the Retail business invested over ' 9,700 crore in these partnerships.\n\n## Digital Services\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJio maintained its market leadership for a third year in a row through FY/uni00A02021-22. Jio's consumer offering, including service quality and value, continued to remain best-in-class, which helped addition of over 130 million new customers during the year. Subscriber churn at the lowerend has resulted in Jio improving its user engagement matrix, like data and voice consumption per user, to a record high level. Jio has the largest single-country subscriber base and carries the highest volume of data traffic globally, excluding China.\n\nIn line with the industry, Jio raised tariffs by ~20% across all prepaid plans effective December 2021, while ensuring that Jio continues to provide the best value for money to all consumers across every price point.\n\nThe year also saw Jio emerge as the leader in fiber based wireline broadband connectivity with over 5 million connected homes. The devices powering Jio Fiber in Indian homes, are working on the Jio operating system - Jio OS - which has a rich set of capabilities and customisation options. The Jio Set Top Box has by far the most compelling set of apps - both from Jio and leading third party apps - for streaming content like movies, music, live news to video calling. Jio's pan-India optic fiber cable network has already reached the doorstep of almost 20 million households, which underlines its rapid growth potential.\n\nManagement\n\nReview\n\nJio is working relentlessly to make India 2G-mukt, so that even the poorest of the poor can enjoy the benefits of digital connectivity. The progress of telecom technology is making inefficient 2G obsolete. The Jio revolution since 2016 has already lowered the 4G tariffs below the 2G tariffs in India. However, handset affordability has proven a major hurdle for over 250 million Indians, preventing a transition to digital networks.\n\nTo overcome this hurdle, Jio launched JioPhone Next - world's most affordable full-touchscreen 4G phone - in collaboration with Google. The phone runs on Pragati OS - a specially optimised version of Google's Android OS.\n\nThe technology in the Internet, Communication and Telecom (ICT) industry continues to make rapid strides globally and India is getting ready to join the 5G bandwagon. Jio also took major steps in getting ready for 5G, with its 100% indigenous technology. Jio successfully carried out 5G testing across sites and has completed 5G coverage planning across 1,000 Indian cities. Jio has also developed several use cases for 5G in industries like healthcare and industrial automation.\n\nJio entered into a strategic partnership with Google for its Cloud Solutions to power the 5G experience of Indian enterprises as well as consumers. Jio also joined hands with University of Oulu in Finland - the leader of the world's first major 6G research programme - to accelerate research and standardisation in 6G - the futuristic next generation of telecom technology after 5G.\n\n## Oil to Chemicals\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe rapid growth in vaccinations and reopening of economies helped a strong economic recovery globally in FY 2021-22. As a result, the global demand for oil and transport fuels grew rapidly and recovered by 6.8 mb/d to 98.5 mb/d in FY 2021-22, up 7.4% Y-o-Y. The rapid growth in fuel demand supported the refining margins. Reliance maintained high level of capacity utilisation across sites throughout the year.\n\nThe demand growth in downstream chemicals, polymers and polyesters was comparatively subdued, due to the volatility in feedstock prices. There was also a constraint on global logistics and higher ocean freights that weighed on the business environment.\n\nThe availability of domestic gas as well as internal fuels meant that we could eliminate our dependence on high-cost LNG.\n\nAll the while, we continued to innovate and improve operationally. We commissioned and stabilised the Petroleum Naphtha quality upgrade, capturing higher premium. Likewise, Reliance won the 'Innovator of the Year' award for our proprietary catalyst RELCAT A for manufacturing LLDPE.",

        "page_content": "During the year, Reliance and bp's fuel and mobility joint venture, Reliance BP Mobility Limited (RBML), launched its first Jio-bp branded Mobility Station at Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra. This kicked off the rebranding process for all 1,460 fuel outlets the JV operates in India with a view to provide an unmatched and distinctive customer experience. These Mobility Stations bring together a range of services for consumers on the move - including additivised fuels, EV charging, refreshments & food, and plan to offer more low carbon solutions over time.\n\nWith a vision of being the leading EV charging infrastructure player in India, Jio-bp constructed and launched couple of country's largest EV charging hubs in Delhi NCR with BluSmart as its primary customer.\n\nReliance's world-class O2C assets and very high level of backward integration will continue to maximise output and returns, and continue to transition towards a sustainable, carbon-neutral, circular economy business in the coming years.\n\n## Oil and Gas E/ampersand.ss03P\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFY 2021-22 was a milestone year for our Oil & Gas business, with two of the three phases of KG-D6 development project commissioning. Notwithstanding the difficulties caused by the COVID pandemic, Reliance and bp were able to complete the work on Satellite Cluster and R-Cluster fields to start production and scale up during the year.\n\nWith both these fields commissioning, KG-D6 is now producing 18 MMSCMD of natural gas, accounting for ~20% of India's gas production.\n\nThe business posted significantly improved financial performance, thanks to a recovery in domestic pricing of natural gas.\n\nThe third phase of KG-D6 project is progressing as per plan. The development of MJ field is nearing completion of drilling activity, as well as the offshore installations. The project is expected to commission by end 2022 and take our total production to 30 MMSCMD.\n\nIn line with our strategic intentions, Reliance exited all its remaining investments in US shale gas this year.\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReliance has always believed in doing well by doing good. It is our firm belief that the long-term success of a corporate depends on giving back to the society it operates in and ensuring its operations are sustainable. During FY 2021-22, Reliance Industries continued to remain India Inc.'s largest spender on Corporate Social Responsibility.\n\nThe breadth and depth of work Reliance Foundation carried out in India's fight against COVID was simply astonishing. It set a new benchmark in what a corporate foundation can do and achieve, if it is determined and focused. Reliance Foundation created massive COVID-care infrastructure pan-India, treating lakhs of patients. It supplied free-of-cost medical oxygen to over 1 lakh critical patients a day, provided lakhs of PPE kits free-ofcost to frontline workers, distributed 8.5+ crore free meals through 'Anna Seva' to the needy, 40+ lakh vaccinations provided free of cost by Reliance to support the nation in its vaccination mission.\n\nAll the while, Reliance Foundation's work in the fields of Rural Empowerment, Sports for Youth, Education, Disaster Management among others continued to progress well.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic struck at a time when the world was entering a great phase of transformation. Now that the pandemic is nearly over, geopolitical tensions in several parts of the world have come to a boil. All this has resulted in significant volatility, high inflationary pressure and uncertainty in the energy and commodity markets. Crude oil prices, which had dipped into negative territory at the start of 2020, jumped to a 14-year peak of $130 at the start of 2022.\n\nReliance is built to weather such storms. Firstly, it is well diversified across Digital Services, Retail and Energy & Materials business. Secondly, over the years it has built in unparalleled level of agility in each of its business verticals. Thirdly, its global scale of operations help in overcoming many hurdles. And lastly, the Company's balance sheet has expanded, but is extremely light on debt.\n\nIn its true ethos of Care and Empathy, Reliance has charted its next journey of transformation to help the world cope with the climate change crisis. Over the next 12 months our investments across the Green Energy value chain will gradually start going live, scaling up over the next couple of years. This new growth engine holds great promise to outshine all our existing growth engines in just 5-7 years.\n\nAt the same time, Reliance continues to expand its existing businesses to newer frontiers of technology, innovation, scale and execution. Jio has already created the most reliable connectivity infrastructure throughout India, and is ready with an array of value-added digital services and products. Today Reliance Retail has the deepest grassroots level pan-India supply chain capability, the broadest supplier base, and a network of kirana partners to provide\n\nManagement\n\nReview\n\nexcellent service to end consumers. Reliance's O2C business is a global leader in terms of level of integration - a business model innovation that is being emulated globally.\n\nAll of Reliance's capabilities are created to serve India, to enable Indians. I am sure India will emerge stronger out of the current volatility, just the way it did through the last couple of years. India is set to become one of the world's top three economies in the next couple of decades, and all of Reliance's business verticals will play a leading role in achieving that. India and Reliance will aim to play a leading role in the world's transition to Clean Energy.\n\nThe last two years were the most difficult for everyone in living memory. I have great admiration and appreciation for the scientists, doctors, nurses, and all frontline\n\nworkers who risked their lives, our teams at O2C, Jio, Retail and Foundation, who helped not just the Company, but also the society whom we serve, navigate the difficult times.\n\nI would also like to place on record my sincere appreciation to the Board of Directors for their guidance. I would like to express my gratitude to all our stakeholders for their continuing faith in Reliance.\n\nWith best wishes, Sincerely\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mukesh D.

The issue was oversubscribed by nearly 3x with a peak order book aggregating to US$ 11.5 billion. The bonds were priced through RIL's secondary curve. US$ 1.5 billion was raised at a coupon rate of 2.875%; US$ 1.75 billion was raised at 3.625% and US$ 0.75 billion at 3.75%. The notes are due for repayment between 2032 and 2062. This transaction is significant on various counts. It is the:\n\n- \u00b7  Largest-ever foreign currency bond issuance from India\n- \u00b7  Tightest ever implied credit spread over the respective US Treasury across each of the 3 tranches by an Indian Corporate\n- \u00b7  Lowest coupon achieved for benchmark 30-year and 40year issuances by a private sector BBB corporate from Asia ex-Japan\n- \u00b7  First-ever 40-year tranche by a BBB private sector corporate from Asia ex-Japan\n\n## Global Economy\n\nGlobal economy grew by 6.1% in CY 2021, after declining 3.1% in CY 2020. Global economy is expected to grow at 3.2% in CY2022, below the long term trend of /uni00A0~3.5%, primarily due to coordinated global monetary policy tightening along with the geopolitical tensions. Advanced economies' (AEs) universe grew at a robust pace of 5.2% in CY 2021, and is expected to moderate in CY /uni00A02022 at 2.5%, with US and Euro Area growth expected at 2.3% and 2.6% respectively, supported by inventory restocking, universal immunisation, and strong pent-up demand from consumption and businesses. China grew by 8.1% in CY/uni00A02021, but is expected to slow to 3.3% in CY 2022 due to zero-tolerance COVID-19 policy, stringent restrictions on polluting industries and financial stress among major property developers. Global trade volume growth was robust in CY 2021 at 10.1%, and is expected to grow at a strong pace of 4.1% in CY 2022.\n\nStrong demand along with persistent supply-chain issues and high energy prices, have resulted in firming up of global inflationary pressures. Recent geopolitical tensions have further exacerbated the global inflation scenario. US inflation has continued to inch up and recorded June 2022 CPI inflation at 9.1%, highest since CY/uni00A01981, with broad-based rise in price pressures, while Euro-Area inflation climbed to a record 8.6% in June, primarily led by energy components. Crude oil averaged at $ 75/bbl in Apr'21 - Jan'22 period and above $100/bbl during Feb'22 - June'22 with outbreak of conflict in Europe. Disruption in trade flows, high energy prices and tightening of crude and refining demand-supply, along with strengthening of refining margins to historical highs could impact near-term demand growth. Rise in inflationary pressures has led global central banks to begin reversal of their accommodative monetary stance, with the US Federal Reserve beginning the\n\ntaper of asset purchase program in November 2021 and subsequently raising interest rates by 225 bps cumulatively since March.\n\nEven though post-pandemic reopening of the global economy is expected to provide further impetus to the demand, global monetary policy tightening in the face of rising inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainties could impact the near-term demand outlook.. IMF expects inflation to remain elevated in the near-term averaging 6.6% in AEs and 9.5% in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) in CY/uni00A02022, before subsiding in CY 2023 as supply chain disruptions ease and demand rebalances take place.\n\n## Indian Economy\n\nAfter witnessing a sharp decline of 6.6% in FY 2020-21, the Indian economy recorded a growth of 8.7% in FY2021-22 as per the provisional estimates by National Statistical Office. This is the strongest pace among major economies. The economic expansion has been supported by a strong national vaccination drive that enabled easing of COVID-19 related restrictions. India administered more than 177 crore doses of vaccine during the financial year, thereby fully vaccinating more than 60% of its population.\n\nThe economic impact of the Omicron COVID-19 variant was relatively mild with most high-frequency indicators above pre-pandemic level. Urban demand remains strong with improved mobility and debit and credit card spending. Overall fuel consumption grew by 4% in FY 2021-22. Debit and credit card spending increased by 26% Y-o-Y in March 2022. However, overall auto sales have been weak on the back of persistent supply chain shortages around the world.\n\nIndustrial indicators continued to remain robust, with manufacturing and services PMI in expansion\n\nzone for most of the year. Electricity demand for FY 2021-22 grew by 8% Y-o-Y, even after the economy witnessed coal shortages in early part of October 2021. Government revenue generation remained robust with GST collections averaging more than ' 1.2 lakh crore per month, increasing 31% Y-o-Y. Digital adoption gathered further pace with growth in UPI payments during FY 2021-22 rising more than 100% Y-o-Y.\n\nRBI maintained its accommodative monetary stance, keeping reference rates unchanged during FY 2021-22.

The monetary policy priority among advanced economies is now decisively centered around preserving consumer purchasing power and to anchor inflationary expectations amidst multi-decade high inflation. The withdrawal of ultraaccommodation both on the interest rates and liquidity front is primarily led by US Fed and has gained traction in other developed economies including Emerging Markets. The outlook of sharp upward adjustment in global interest rates and calibrated withdrawal of liquidity is leading to tighter financial conditions.\n\nOn the domestic front, the reverberation of change in global monetary landscape and rising inflationary pressure has tilted the balance in favour of gradual withdrawal of policy accommodation. The RBI has signalled this shift in policy priority by pushing the cost of domestic liquidity through narrowing of LAF corridor, unlimited sterilisation through new instrument of Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) and change in monetary policy stance (MPC) to focus on withdrawal of accommodation. The average inflation trajectory during FY 2022-23 is likely to stay closer to the higher end of RBI-MPC target of 6% whereas the growth impulses may moderate further. On the external front, the deterioration in current account deficit (CAD) to 2.5% of GDP and uncertainty on capital inflows amidst tightening global financial conditions is likely to exert depreciation pressure on the rupee in the near term. Overall, the macroeconomic outlook of challenging growth inflation tradeoff, faster policy normalisation in developed economies and geopolitical issues may keep the volatility high in the domestic financial markets.\n\nFinancial markets were extremely choppy and volatile during the year.

However the second half of the year witnessed rupee depreciation and a gradual move\n\nup in interest rates, exacerbated by geopolitical conflicts.\n\nThe Company was successfully able to navigate all such abrupt adjustments in the market, maintain adequate liquidity on its balance sheet, manage its financial market risks and deliver a consistent return on its investment portfolio by staying invested in low risk, liquid instruments. Reliance Treasury continued to stay focused on providing liquidity to the businesses at the optimal risk adjusted cost by accessing financing from different markets and using appropriate instruments and currencies.\n\n## Treasury Management and Financial Strategy\n\nReliance Treasury's impeccable timing on executing landmark transactions not just from India but also from Asia can be attributed to its ability and foresight to see emerging trends in financial markets.\n\nReliance Treasury continuously monitors the financial markets to assess financing and investment opportunities to raise financing at optimised cost and deliver superior returns respectively. It identifies opportunities to reduce interest costs and extend maturity profile of its existing debt portfolio. It also maintains a prudent mix of funding sources across instrument classes, financing products, geographies and investor classes.\n\n## Fund Raising\n\nReliance continues to be a sophisticated and innovative issuer of securities across the capital structure. During the year, Reliance issued US$ 4 billion senior unsecured notes across 10-years, 30-years and 40-years tranches comprising (i) US$ 1,500,000,000 2.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2032, (ii) US$ 1,750,000,000 3.625% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2052 and (iii) US$ 750,000,000 3.750% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2062. The Notes were nearly 3x oversubscribed with a peak order book aggregating ~US$ 11.5 billion and were priced\n\nthrough the Company's secondary curve. Reliance has now joined a select group of issuers from Asia to have made jumbo foreign currency bond issuances. The proceeds from the notes were primarily used for refinancing existing borrowings.\n\nThis transaction was significant on various counts:\n\n- \u00b7  It was the largest ever foreign currency bond issuance from India\n- \u00b7  It had the tightest ever implied credit spread over the respective US Treasury across each of the 3 tranches by an Indian Corporate\n- \u00b7  It carried the lowest coupon achieved for benchmark 30-year and 40-year issuances by a private sector BBB corporate from Asia exJapan\n- \u00b7  It had a first ever 40-year tranche offering by a BBB private sector corporate from Asia ex Japan\n\nThe Company's subsidiary, Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited prepaid entire deferred liabilities pertaining to spectrum acquired in auctions of year 2014, 2015, 2016 and the spectrum acquired in FY 2021-22 through trading of right to use with Bharti Airtel Limited aggregating to ' 30,791 crore (including accrued interest). This was refinanced through a mix of INR Loans and Debentures. The Company expects that this prepayment will result in interest savings of about ' 1,200 crore annually.\n\nThe Company's subsidiary REC Solar Pte Ltd. tied up Reliance Group's first green financing aggregating US$ 586 million including a US$ 250 million green term loan and ~US$ 336 million five-year green bank guarantee facility.\n\n## Credit Rating\n\nReliance's strong focus on financial capital coupled with financial discipline and prudence are reflected in the strong credit ratings ascribed by rating agencies. Reliance continues to enjoy a strong credit rating and continues to be rated two notches above sovereign by S&P and is one notch above sovereign by Moody's.\n\nThe table below depicts the credit rating profile:\n\n| Instrument         | Rating Agency   | Rating       | Remarks                                    |\n|--------------------|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| International Debt | S&P             | BBB+         | Two notches above India's sovereign rating |\n| International Debt | Moody's         | Baa2         | One notch above India's sovereign rating   |\n| Long-Term Debt     | CRISIL          | AAA (stable) | Highest rating by CRISIL                   |\n| Long-Term Debt     | CARE            | AAA (stable) | Highest rating by CARE                     |\n| Long-Term Debt     | ICRA            | AAA (stable) | Highest rating by ICRA                     |\n| Long-Term Debt     | India Ratings   | AAA (stable) | Highest rating by India Ratings            |\n\n## Liquidity Management\n\nRobust liquidity underpins Reliance's short-term financial planning processes with an aim of ensuring adequate protection against short term adverse market events. Reliance deploys a judicious mix of tenors and product types in its liquidity management processes and continues to explore path breaking financing solutions in partnership with its world-class banking partners. Consistent strong cash generation from operating activities provides the foundation for liquidity. This along with undrawn borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents provide solid liquidity buffer.\n\nReliance's liquidity management and investment plans are created within the context of its strategic and annual financial planning processes. The plans are reviewed on an ongoing basis to factor in evolving global and domestic macro factors.\n\nReliance maintains sufficient working capital resources for running all its businesses smoothly. The operating/uni00A0cycle is closely monitored to optimise working capital structure and ensure smooth business financing. Trade financing solutions/uni00A0are proactively reviewed and swiftly calibrated to deliver robust/uni00A0working capital management.\n\nRIL has opportunistically used short term borrowings through Commercial Paper to finance its working capital requirements. Given the low interest rate environment this has benefited the Company to maintain low cost of liabilities.\n\nRIL effectively manages its cash and cash equivalents through a diversified investment portfolio which has an appropriate mix of steady accrual, tax efficient and higher duration assets with lower reinvestment risk. The portfolio consists of wide-ranging fixed income instruments invested in top rated instruments like sovereign bonds, AAA papers and bank's fixed deposits. The diversification across instruments and counterparties ensures that there is minimal concentration risk.\n\nThe investment portfolio is monitored and operated under a robust risk management framework with a very nimble and dynamic adjustment to portfolio mix as and when necessary to ensure capital protection and appropriate risk adjusted returns. The investment portfolio balances well between the dual objectives of generating optimal returns with appropriate risk/reward and maintaining the assurance of liquidity at short notice..\n\n## Awards and Accolades\n\nDuring FY 2021-22, RIL won the Best Asia Pacific Corporate Bonds award from 'The Banker' for the US$ 4 billion multi-tranche Senior Unsecured Notes issued in January 2022.\n\n## Way Forward on Financial Capital\n\nReliance remains committed to sustainable value creation for stakeholders through disciplined capital framework and optimal utilisation of its resources. As it enters the next stage of growth, the Company through its robust cash flow and balance sheet, will accelerate the pace of growing capabilities for Digital, New Commerce, New Energy, and New Material businesses.",

        "page_content": "## RETAIL\n\n## Industry Overview\n\nIndia has emerged as one of the most resilient global economies, having braved the macro-economic headwinds caused by COVID-19. The Indian economy is propelled by a solid domestic demand that accounts for 56% of India's GDP, which provides a strong foundation for a sustained growth of the Indian retail market. The learnings from the first wave of COVID-19, combined with a strong impetus on vaccination, helped reduce the pandemic's impact on the economy in 2021. With a gradual fall in the number of cases and the easing of restrictions, production across major sectors is going back to pre-COVID levels. As the impact of the pandemic subsides and consumer demand resumes, the retail sector is expected to rebound and record a compounded growth rate of 11% to become a US$ 1.2 trillion market by 2025.\n\n## Emerging Trends and Business Response\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Omni-channel takes centre stage\n\nServing customers through an omni-channel approach is emerging as a prerequisite to growth.\n\n## Our Response\n\n- Reliance Retail has created the most extensive retail ecosystem in the country, with its retail outlets connected with digital commerce platforms to provide a unified consumer experience across channels.

Its product selection continues to grow, with electronics, fashion, and now pharma available on its platform. Reliance Retail's investment in Milkbasket and Dunzo will further strengthen its capabilities in serving customers.\n- Reliance Retail has been a pioneer in identifying emerging consumer trends and has created an extensive range of home and personal care products under its own brand portfolio. During the year, it introduced Puric, a range of personal hygiene and home disinfectant products with more than 20 SKUs, which has received positive response from consumers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJioMart apps downloaded\n\n## 48 million\n\n## 15 %\n\nShare of own brands in hand wash & hygiene category\n\n## Increased spend on hygiene, health, and nutrition\n\nFocus on health, hygiene and well-being takes center stage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Growth in smaller towns\n\nThe broad-based growth in the retail sector is being led by India's small towns.\n\n- Reliance Retail operates over two-third of its network of stores in Tier/uni00A0II and below towns.

        "page_content": "## RETAIL\n\n## New Commerce: A win-win-win Operating Model for growth and shared prosperity\n\nThe Indian retail market is the most fragmented in the world, characterised by the presence of millions of small kiranas. Operating in the unorganised space, the kiranas are constrained by various challenges, including the lack of: modern infrastructure, technology savviness, efficient sourcing capabilities and capital needed to serve the ever-evolving consumer/uni00A0needs.\n\nReliance Retail's New Commerce initiative is bringing out the entrepreneurial spirit of the kiranas, by physically and digitally enabling them and bringing them at par with organised players.\n\nReliance Retail aims to integrate millions of small kiranas with\n\nproducers, manufacturers and brands across India. Doing so would help them modernise, become more efficient and generate higher income. Reliance Retail is thus creating a win-win-win partnership with all stakeholders of the retail value chain. The ecosystem thus created would lead to a wider selection of products, superior quality, compelling value proposition and a finer shopping experience to millions of consumers buying from the kiranas.\n\nDuring the year, the company launched New Commerce services for consumer electronics and pharma merchants. It has significantly scaled up its merchant partnerships across Grocery and Fashion & Lifestyle consumption baskets. The platforms\n\n## Strategic Priorities and Way Forward\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccelerate new store expansion\n\nContinued emphasis on growing the digital commerce business across all consumption baskets through improved offers and service capabilities\n\nFast-track new merchant onboarding and increase wallet share across all consumption baskets\n\nhave witnessed robust growth in matrices such as order values and frequency of orders, reflecting the trust and growing bond with the merchant partners.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDevelop new brands, integrate acquisitions, launch and scale up new businesses\n\nStrengthen supply chain infrastructure, and product and design ecosystems to support rapid business growth\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReliance Retail strives to create an enabling workplace environment where each employee is provided the opportunity to participate, contribute, and grow. To/uni00A0ensure the safety, health and well-being of employees, various initiatives were undertaken during the year.\n\nTo help employees address stress during the unusual circumstances created by the pandemic, online yoga sessions were arranged during the International Yoga Month. For women, for whom the challenges have been multifold, Reliance's focus has been to provide support and work flexibility. Many of them have opted to work-from-home. There have also been panel discussions and focused engagement with women employees every month through the times of COVID-19 to help them in better work-life integration.\n\nAll through the pandemic, efforts were directed at educating employees on safety, building resilience, and addressing health and nutrition concerns. Talks were also held on diverse parenting needs and addressing specific concerns during the pandemic.\n\nOften specialised training becomes necessary to ensure the safety of both staff and the people they serve. Take the training on 'Disaster Mitigation and Preparedness for Retail Outlets', which was undertaken with the help of the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM). Specialised training also became mandatory for staff and contractors with the opening of the first Hamleys Play store in Mumbai, as required by the Protection of Children from Sexual Offense (POCSO) Act.\n\nThe health and safety of employees is of paramount importance at Reliance. An illustrative case is the ergonomic assessments taken during the year for Retail staff, whose work involves manual handling, or long hours where they are either required to stand or sit, all of which pose risks of musculoskeletal disorder. To address the concern, ergonomics assessments were conducted across all formats pan India for all job roles to identify ergonomic hazards and immediate action was taken to reduce the risk level.\n\nRoad safety is another area of concern. To address it, extensive trainings were arranged during the year. Frequent refresher trainings are also conducted for our delivery associates as well as for our delivery partners (GRAB riders) on road safety to ensure they remain safe while delivering essential items at the doorstep of customers.\n\nBoth online and offline engagement activities were held during the year to trigger conversations on safety and enhance the safety culture.",

        "page_content": "## DIGITAL SERVICES\n\n## Industry Overview\n\n## Transition towards 4G/uni00A0networks\n\nThe launch of Jio started the 4G transition in India. The 4G subscriber base across the industry is now over 730 million as of March 2022, thanks to increasing broadband network penetration across both urban and rural India and the improving device ecosystem. More than 250 million 2G feature phone users in the country will also be transitioning to digital networks over the next few years. The pandemic's impact on recharge cycle and tariff hike have caused a transient SIM consolidation, mainly for low usage and inconsistent subscriber base. This has rationalised the reported subscriber base and should bring cost and network efficiencies for the industry.\n\n## Increasing smartphones and new use cases boost data tra/uniFB03c\n\nImproving smartphone penetration and increasing proliferation of digital applications have resulted in a 38% increase in data usage across the country over CY 2021 (~137 Exabytes of data usage in India during 2021). According to the Ericsson Mobility Report 2021, total mobile data traffic in India is projected to increase by more than 4x to reach 49.0 Exabytes per month by 2027. This will be driven by two factors - greater smartphone penetration, including in rural areas, and increase in average data usage per smartphone. Jio's device strategy and sustained investments in digital will be key to this enhanced data usage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 5G rollout\n\nEarlier in the year, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) allotted trial spectrum for 5G services to all operators. 5G field trials are currently underway, with all operators working with their respective network vendors to test the network and develop relevant use cases. DoT and Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) are working towards conducting auction for 5G spectrum bands in 2022.\n\n## Increasing need for good quality FTTX\n\nIndia's leapfrog into mobility broadband has resulted in the fixed broadband sector being an under-invested space for the past two decades. As a result, India has amongst the lowest fixed broadband penetration in the world at less than 10% households.\n\nFiber penetration is even lower, with most fixed broadband running on legacy copper-based infrastructure. COVID-19 lockdowns and the consequent need to work-fromhome and learn-from-home, have reinforced the need for high quality fixed broadband.\n\n## Positive changes in the Indian telecom landscape\n\nIn September 2021, the Government of India undertook decisive steps in the form of reforms and a relief package to strengthen the Indian telecom sector. Subsequently, all the operators undertook a 20-25% hike across prepaid plans that has boosted revenue growth for the sector.\n\n## Emerging Trends and Business Response\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Transition towards 4G/uni00A0networks\n\nTransition of 250 million+ 2G feature phone users to digital networks\n\n## How Jio is responding?\n\nJio's comprehensive device strategy encompassing JioPhone Next, JioPhone and OEM partnerships and investments into the digital ecosystem would lead this transition\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Growing ecosystem of B2C applications\n\nProliferation of broadband connectivity drives adoption of digital applications\n\n## How Jio is responding?\n\nJio has built a suite of solutions and services across entertainment, commerce, communication, finance, education and gaming with leading engagement levels in each category.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Increasing FTTH penetration\n\nRapidly increasing demand for high-speed fiber backed internet at homes\n\nJio's extensive intracity fiber network, last mile execution, seamless customer experience along with attractive bundling of digital solutions enabled it to emerge the market leader within two years of launch\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 5G rollout in India\n\nTrial spectrum has been allocated to operators and spectrum auction is expected in 2022\n\nJio has conducted field trials of its homegrown 5G stack with competitive position and capabilities comparable to global Tier 1 vendors.

        "page_content": "## DIGITAL SERVICES\n\n## Business Performance\n\n## Mobile Services\n\n## Jio continues to drive India's digital transformation\n\nJio's network carried almost 10% of the global mobile data traffic in CY 2021, and Jio continues to remain the broadband network of choice with over 50% share of India's data traffic, thereby underlining the 'Jio effect' on the digital ecosystem in India. Jio was the digital lifeline during the continuing pandemic. FY 2021-22 saw over 130 million new users join the network on a gross basis and data traffic grow at ~46% Y-o-Y to more than 91 Exabytes.\n\nCustomer engagement on Jio network increased further; per capita data and voice consumption stood at 19.7 GB and 968 minutes per month respectively for the quarter ending March 2022. During the year, Jio undertook a ~20% hike across prepaid plans with effect from December 1, 2021. Its new plans continue to provide best value for consumers in the industry across price points. Financial relief for the telecom sector and improving revenue growth potential will accelerate realisation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of Digital India and enable India's transformation into the world's leading digital society.\n\n## Enhanced network capacity\n\nPost the 2021 spectrum auction and trading agreement with Bharti Airtel, Jio's spectrum footprint has increased 56% to 1,732MHz (average life of over 14.5 years). This has boosted its network capacity to serve the rapidly growing demand for data services. Further, Jio has relentlessly driven network improvement to provide superior customer experience through network automation, nextgen platform deployment, advanced analytics and data sciences. The\n\nrobustness of Jio's network was further underlined by the fact that it worked with minimal disruption even during three cyclones and seven heavy rainfall/ flood situations across the country during the year.\n\n## Expansion of 4G device ecosystem\n\nSince inception, Jio has innovated to catalyse and grow the affordable digital device system in the country. JioPhone has successfully transitioned over 100 million 2G users in the country over the past four years.\n\nBuilding on this success, Jio, in partnership with Google, announced the launch of JioPhone Next during the year. This is the most affordable smartphone anywhere in the world, with a unique financing option making it accessible for a much wider set of consumers.\n\nJioPhone Next is packed with unprecedented features like an all new Pragati OS, Translate Now & Read Aloud across 10 Indian languages and a host of preloaded Jio and Google apps. Jio is also partnering with other leading OEMs to provide multiple device options to its subscribers and accelerate the 2G to 4G transition in the country.\n\n## Jio leads the March towards 5G-Yukt India\n\nJio's 5G stack is 100% homegrown and a comprehensive 5G solution that is fully cloud native, software defined and digitally managed. This 5G stack encompasses radio and core network, software architecture and hardware equipment, including outdoor small cells and gNodeBs. Jio's/uni00A0network is built on a converged and future proof architecture that allows for seamless upgrade from 4G to 5G and beyond. 5G coverage planning has been completed in top 1,000 cities based on targeted customer consumption and revenue\n\npotential using heat maps, 3D maps and ray tracing technology.\n\nApart from conducting field trials of its 5G stack. Jio has done active trials of 5G use cases ranging from AR/ VR, low-latency cloud gaming, network slicing and multi-tenancy for video delivery, TV streaming, connected hospitals and industrial applications.\n\n## Fixed Broadband Services\n\nJio continues to see fixed broadband as a significant greenfield opportunity and aspires to connect 50 million homes and 50 million MSMBs in India. Its expansive intracity fiber network, execution abilities, superior customer experience together with its diverse suite and bundling of digital content, tech-enabled tools and solutions will be key differentiators.\n\n## Jio is now the largest fiber broadband provider in India\n\nThe need for high quality broadband and Jio's extensive infrastructure and superior services have made it the operator of choice for fixed broadband in the country. Within a short span of two years since its launch, Jio has become the largest fiber broadband provider with over 5 million connected homes with an average data usage of almost 300 GB per home per month. It has continued to roll out last mile infrastructure at an elevated pace and its network covers almost 20 million homes.\n\n## #1\n\nJio's market position in FTTH\n\n## JioPhone Next, the most affordable smartphone anywhere in the world\n\n## Extended suite of digital o/uniFB00erings for homes and enterprises\n\nJio has been consistently enriching its digital portfolio to augment the fixedline services to enable work-fromhome, learn-from-home, healthfrom-home, and enterprise grade digital solutions for small businesses.\n\n- \u00b7 Homes - Enhanced STB with JioOS, bouquet of new Jio and third-party applications, Society Centrex, 4K content on JioTV+, Home Secure, Home Automation, LiveTV and Gaming solutions\n- \u00b7 Enterprises - Integrated connectivity, cloud, security, and SaaS platform with vertical specific solutions for enterprises\n\n## JIO SET - TOP - BOX APP ECOSYSTEM\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## JIOBUSINESS MARKETPLACE\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT\n\n## Industry Overview\n\nHaving bounced back from the shocks of the pandemic in the second half of last fiscal, FY 2021-22 was a year of continued resilience and implementing learnings from the first wave of the pandemic. The beginning of the year saw a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases, which would have impacted content production again but for the implementation of contingency plans and new SOPs that helped business continue in a normal fashion. Demand for content continued to grow across platforms, with both TV and Digital seeing growth in viewership. However, the movie exhibition industry remained affected as cinema halls were either shut or opened with lower capacity through the year, leading to either a delayed release in halls or OTT release.\n\n## TV viewership reverted to pre-pandemic levels\n\nDuring the second wave of the pandemic (April-June 2021), TV viewership saw a much smaller spike than last year as lockdowns were localised and movement of people was not as restricted. TV viewership normalised through the year and returned to pre-COVID levels at the beginning of CY 2022 and the genre shares also reverted back. Broadcast networks rolled out their full content catalogue and OTT platforms scaled up release of original shows. Regional viewership continued to be strong across languages, with most markets seeing intense competition for share. Movie channels continued to be impacted during the year due to the postponement of movie releases. Sports viewership was boosted by events like T20 World Cup, Tokyo Olympics and IPL.\n\n## TV VIEWERSHIP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEntertainment\n\nNews\n\nTotal TV with News\n\nSource:  BARC Data\n\n## Strong growth in advertising revenues\n\nThough FY 2021-22 started on a weak footing, local and short duration lockdowns, accompanied by a strong consumer demand and advertiser appetite, caused only a minor blip in the strong growth momentum that had begun to build up in the second half of FY 2020-21. Industry ad revenues surpassed 2019 levels, with TV ad volumes reaching a multi-year high and digital continuing its strong growth momentum. However, high input price inflation for the FMCG sector, the biggest advertiser, tempered the growth towards the end of the year. While TV continues to be the primary platform for brands looking to reach audiences at scale and brand building with high frequency advertising, digital has an inherent advantage in targeting, driving personalisation and offering options for advertisers with constrained budgets.\n\n## 18.6 %\n\nIncrease in ad spend in 2021\n\n## INDIA AD INDUSTRY\n\nTV Print Digital Radio/Cinema/  OOH Source: Dentsu Digital report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## TV subscription continued to be resilient\n\nIndia's TV penetration of ~67% and Average Revenue Per Unit (ARPU) of ~US$ 3 remain well below that for most developed as well as developing economies, highlighting the headroom for growth. After the introduction of the New Tariff Order (NTO) regulation in FY 2019-20, the industry had seen a jump in subscription revenue. However, the growth has plateaued since then due to the continued legal battle over the implementation of the amended regulation, pending which a status quo had been imposed by the courts on channel pricing. The revenue was also marginally impacted by the pandemic as some of the pay-TV households migrated to the free DTH platform, DD FreeDish.\n\n## TV subscriptions in India\n\n| million   |   FY 2020-21 |   FY 2021-22 |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------|\n| Cable     |           73 |           67 |\n| DTH       |           56 |           55 |\n| HITS      |            2 |            3 |\n| Free TV   |           40 |           43 |\n| Total     |          171 |          168 |\n\n## Digital continued to see strong traction\n\nOTT platforms offer an alternative to TV with on-demand, differentiated content and, more importantly, a dedicated screen, unlike TV which is shared by 4-5 household members. Digital content consumption has seen a sharp growth over the last couple of years driven by increasing broadband and smartphone penetration and increasing volume of exclusive content for digital. With more than 30 OTT platforms, Indian consumers have plenty of options to choose from - regional to global platforms, from production houses' apps to teleco-aggregation platforms. The propensity to pay for digital subscriptions has grown as consumers have begun to see value in OTT content offering.\n\nGiven the competitive pay TV ARPUs, OTTs are still experimenting with the pricing for their subscription-based video on demand (SVOD) platforms.. The year saw several major platforms change their subscription plans. Most Indian platforms continue to operate a hybrid monetisation model,\n\nSource: EY-FICCI M&E Report\n\n## Emerging Trends and Business Response\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Content consumption on digital platforms/uni00A0is/uni00A0growing\n\nWith over 300 million people watching content on digital platforms, digital has now become a second screen, and in some cases the first.\n\n## Our response\n\nAs part of RIL group, which ushered in the broadband revolution in the country, Network18 has been focused on creating digital platforms which become the gateway for content consumption. With a 'Digital First, TV Always' approach, the group is investing in technology and content creation for platforms like News18.com, Moneycontrol.com, Voot, to provide consumers a seamless experience on the medium of their choice.\n\nNetwork18 has been at the vanguard of content evolution in the country, continuously experimenting and innovating new concepts. Its teams keep abreast of changing consumer preferences and continuously adapt. From bringing Bigg Boss to OTT screens, to launching NFTs to engage with loyal fans, to creating news campaigns that drive change at the ground level, the group content repertoire has been evolving, both in breadth and depth.\n\n## New content forms emerging\n\nFrom user generated short videos to metaverse, content is seeing a wave of disruption\n\noffering free content supported by ads and premium content behind the paywall. As per the BCG CII Report, the Indian OTT industry is expected to grow at a 22-25% CAGR over the next decade, driven by both subscription and advertising.\n\n## SIZE OF THE INDIAN OTT INDUSTRY\n\n($)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFY 2014-15\n\nFY 2020-21 E\n\nFY 2029-30 P\n\nCAGR\n\nSource: BCG CII Report 2022",

        "page_content": "## OIL TO CHEMICALS\n\n## Industry Overview\n\nFY 2021-22 was characterised by the recovery in global demand as a result of improved consumer sentiment, vaccination drive and the reopening of economies, leading to an increase in crude and petrochemicals prices. Global refinery operating rates also improved in line with the rising demand.\n\n## Crude Oil Demand and/uni00A0Supply\n\nDemand in CY 2021 recovered sharply by 5.6 mb/d to  97.5 mb/d. In comparison, demand had fallen by 8.5 mb/d to 91.9 mb/d in CY 2020.\n\nRobust global economic recovery, rising vaccination rates, easing social distancing measures and travel restrictions supported steady demand recovery in FY 2021-22. The demand recovery was further supported by gas to oil switching in the power sector following the energy crisis and high natural gas prices beginning October 2021. In the last week of February 2022, Russian Ukraine conflict began which led to high oil prices and volatility due to uncertainties in global oil supply. Prices rose above $100/bbl levels due to sanctions on Russia and expected disruption to Russian oil & product trade flows.\n\nGlobal oil supply increased by 1.4 mb/d to 95.5 mb/d in CY 2021. Oil supply growth was mainly controlled by OPEC+ with a mandate to increase 400 kb/d of output each month from August 2021 to March 2022 in response to demand. OPEC supply was lower by 4.2 mb/d in CY 2020 but increased by 0.7 mb/d in CY 2021. NonOPEC supply which fell by 2.6/uni00A0mb/d in CY/uni00A02020 increased by 0.7/uni00A0mb/d in CY/uni00A02021 mainly led by Russia. However, uncertainties to supply rose in March 2022 due to US, Canada sanctions on Russian oil imports in response to Russia-Ukraine conflict. This,/uni00A0together with self-imposed restrictions by private companies started to impact trade flows and regional supply.\n\nIn FY 2021-22, lower oil supply amid higher oil demand growth led to reduction in global crude inventories and oil market tightness.\n\n## Global Refining Operations\n\n## Global refinery crude throughput (mb/d)\n\n|                   |   CY 2021 |   CY 2020 |   Change 2021  vs. 2020 |\n|-------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------------|\n| OECD Americas     |      17.8 |      16.6 |                     1.2 |\n| OECD Europe       |      11   |      10.7 |                     0.3 |\n| China             |      14.2 |      13.8 |                     0.4 |\n| Rest of the World |      34.8 |      33.7 |                     1.1 |\n| World Total       |      77.8 |      74.8 |                     3   |\n\nSource: IEA\n\nGlobal refinery throughputs increased steadily during FY 2021-22 on higher utilisation and new capacity additions to meet rising transportation and petrochemical demand. In CY 2021, refinery throughputs recovered by 3 mb/d after falling by 7.3 mb/d in CY 2020. Permanent refinery closures amounted to 2.8/uni00A0mb/d till the end of 2021 mainly in the US, Europe and Asia.\n\nRefining margins recovered strongly in FY 2021-22 as refinery throughputs lagged fuel demand recovery.\n\n## Crude Oil, LNG and Ethane Prices\n\n## CRUDE OIL PRICES\n\n(US$/BBL)\n\n2\n\n2\n\n-\n\nR\n\nMA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Source: Platts\n\nCrude prices rose sharply in FY 2021-22 with Brent price reaching US$ 118.8/bbl in March 22 from US$ 64.7/bbl in April 2021. Oil prices rose in response to steady oil demand growth, continued oil supply management by OPEC+, falling global oil inventories and also geopolitical impacts such as Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nIn 2H 2021, US supply outages due to Hurricane Ida also supported oil prices despite the demand being impacted by COVID-19 variants like Delta.\n\nThe energy crisis, high natural gas prices, the failure of OPEC+ to meet its output targets and rising geopolitical tensions further propelled oil prices. Geopolitical risks with Russia-Ukraine conflict , the blockade in Libya and protests in\n\nl\n\na\n\n/g\n\n$\n\nKazakhstan also contributed to the rise in oil prices in 2H FY 2021-22 in spite of the tapering of demand following the spread of the Omicron variant and China's zero tolerance COVID-19 policy.\n\n## LNG PRICES\n\n(US$/MMBTU)\n\n2\n\n2\n\n-\n\nR\n\nMA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring the year, LNG prices were highly volatile, with Asian prices seeing a low of US$5.8/MMBtu in March 2021 and a high of US$51.7/MMBtu in March 2022, averaging at US$23.37/MMBtu in FY 2021-22. The uptick in price was due to demand recovery post-COVID, coupled with unplanned LNG outages, lower Russian pipeline gas flow into Europe and later invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February. The Company used various optimisation initiatives to minimise the impact of high energy prices.\n\n## US ETHANE PRICES\n\n## (US$/GAL)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n0.00 MAR-19 MAY-19 JUL-19 SEP-19 NOV-19 JAN-20 MAR-20 MAY-20 JUL-20 SEP-20 NOV-20 JAN-21 MAR-21 MAY-21 JUL-21 SEP-21 NOV-21 JAN-22 MAR-22\n\nDuring the year, ethane demand-supply growth was accelerated due to the addition of export facilities, delivery of new Very Large Ethane Carrier Ships (VLECS) and demand growth of the newly operational cracker in the US. Ethane prices in FY 2021-22 moved in tandem with that of natural gas for most of the time, and hence traded at highest-ever prices in the last four years at 46.8 US cents per gallon (cpg). This was owing to the surge in natural gas prices as a result of the supply scarcity and colder than expected winter. The average price of ethane for FY 2021-22 was 34.9 cpg.  Despite relatively higher prices, ethane continued to be the preferred feedstock.\n\n## Tanker Freight\n\nThe crude tanker market continued weaker trend due to various factors, ranging from COVID-19, reduction in crude imports to China, OPEC cuts, increasing bunker prices to limited cargoes being quoted, weighed in on market sentiment. This also helped to lower overall crude cost.\n\nClean Tanker freight rate for shipping products remained at a 5-year low in FY 2021-22 as lockdown restrictions led to uncertainty and dampened sentiments. Ample new-built tanker availability also helped long-haul distillate market movements, keeping a lid on freight prices\n\nReliance has been proactively taking appropriate actions by taking optimal cover through time charters & COAs' (Contract of Affreightment) to avoid freight volatilities and incurring additional cost to the refinery.\n\n## Transportation Fuels\n\n## Global Market Environment\n\nGlobal gasoline demand recovered steadily in FY 2021-22 as a result of improving mobility and higher preference for personal vehicles. In CY 2021, demand recovered to above 96% of pre-pandemic level (CY 2019 levels) as restrictions on mobility were lifted gradually on rising vaccinations. Diesel demand recovery also continued in FY 2021-22 - on strong economic growth and rising industrial activity with demand reaching 98% of pre-pandemic level in CY 2021.\n\nJet fuel was the only fuel to remain significantly below pre-pandemic level with demand recovering to only 66% of CY 2019 levels in CY 2021 mainly due to sluggish recovery in business and international travel. However, demand was supported by countries which were opening up and easing international travel restrictions, following rising vaccination coverage and low impact from the Omicron COVID wave.",

        "page_content": "## OIL TO CHEMICALS\n\n## Domestic Market Environment\n\nAfter the lows of FY 2020-21, Indian fuel demand bounced back in FY 2021-22. However, the growth was tempered by the second and third pandemic waves, which led to partial or total lockdown in stretches across the country during 1Q and 4Q respectively.\n\n## India Fuel Consumption Trend (exit quarter trend)\n\n| Product (Mn MT)   |   4Q FY 2019-20 |   4Q FY 2020-21 |   4Q FY 2021-22 |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| HSD (Gasoil)      |            19.7 |            20.6 |            20.6 |\n| MS (Gasoline)     |             7.1 |             7.8 |             7.9 |\n| ATF (Jet fuel)    |             1.9 |             1.4 |             1.4 |\n\nOn the back of sustained economic activities, and the absence of a blanket nationwide lockdown, business growth was steady through the course of the year. India's fuel demand grew by 7.8% and stood at 113 MMT. LPG demand too maintained an upward growth trajectory.\n\nWhile inter-city highway traffic has maintained steady momentum, growth in intra-city travel has surged, as reflected in the consistently growing Motor Spirit (MS) sale. Despite muted growth in 1Q FY 2021-22 and some set back in 4Q, both gasoil and gasoline demand has grown steadily with the resurgence of road traffic. FY 2021-22, diesel demand increased by 5.5% and gasoline demand increased by 10.4% Y-o-Y. Exit industry volumes are already 4.2% higher than the pre-COVID average in FY 2019-20. The shift away from ride-sharing and limited availability of public transport (driven by lower bus frequency and curtailed rail movement) have increased preference for self-owned vehicles, which has supported this growth.\n\nReaching the end of their ongoing investment cycle, both state-owned oil marketing companies and private players have continued expanding their network, and taking the total number of retail outlets in India to over 83,000.\n\nFY 2021-22 also emerged as the defining year for Indian Electric Vehicle (EV) industry. On the back of sustained policy push at both the central and state levels, increased options in the market and growing charging infrastructure, EV sales recorded a 218% growth over that in FY 2020-21. Even though the base is low, the industry is looking at convergence of charging infrastructure and retail outlets.\n\nRebounding from its worst ever year, India's aviation industry, driven primarily by the domestic sector, grew strongly in the 2H FY 2021-22. Phased allowance from 70-100% capacity utilisation enabled airlines to ramp up steadily. ATF demand in FY 2021-22 grew 35% Y-o-Y.\n\n## Margins\n\nGasoline margins rose sharply to US$ 11.4/bbl in FY 2021-22 from US$/uni00A03//uni00A0bbl in FY 2020-21, backed by steady demand recovery and improving mobility. Also, limited exports from China in 2H CY 2021 supported cracks.\n\nGasoil margins increased to US$ 12.3/bbl in FY 2021-22 from US$ 5.7/bbl in FY 2020-21, following steady demand growth supported by the strong economic recovery and rising industrial activity. However, gasoil margin gains were limited due to sluggish jet fuel demand recovery and persistently higher stocks during most of the year. Cracks were supported by lower gasoil exports from China, due to various policy changes like the imposition of higher taxes on blended fuels such as light cycle oil, tightening supervision on independent refiners, lower crude import and product export quotas in 2H CY 2021. Gasoil cracks rose strongly in March 2022 on disruptions to Russian diesel supply to Europe amid Russia-Ukraine conflict and trade sanctions on Russia.\n\nJet fuel cracks rose to US$ 9.1/bbl in FY 2021-22 from the unprecedented low of US$ 1.2/bbl in FY 2020-21. Jet fuel demand continued to recover, albeit slowly led by North America in FY 2021-22.\n\n## Asian Cracks for\n\n## Transportation Fuels\n\n| $/bbl         |   FY 2021-22 |   FY 2020-21 |\n|---------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Gasoline 92R  |         11.4 |          3   |\n| Jet           |          9.1 |          1.2 |\n| Gasoil 10 ppm |         12.3 |          5.7 |\n\nSource: Platts\n\n## Global Cracker Operations\n\nGlobal demand for ethylene grew 8% Y-o-Y to 179 MMT in CY 2021 from 166 MMT in CY 2020, while operating rates remained unchanged at 86%. New capacity addition for the year was 12 MMTA, in line with the demand growth.\n\n## Ethane and Naphtha Prices\n\nEthane average prices increased by 63% Y-o-Y to 34.9 cpg in FY 2021-22. While naphtha average prices in Asia were up by 82% Y-o-Y led by the rise of crude price, LNG supply crunch and related strength in energy prices.\n\n## Polymers and Elastomers\n\n## Global Market Environment\n\nGlobal polymer demand - for polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) - in CY 2021 was 253 MMT, registering an uptick of 4% on Y-o-Y basis. Global PP, PE and PVC demand grew by 5%, 4% and 4% respectively in CY 2021, led by Asia, especially China and India.\n\nGrowth in global demand for StyreneButadiene Rubber (E-SBR) was 4% and Polybutadiene Rubber (PBR) 6% in FY 2021-22 on the back of strong automotive sector demand. Global vehicles production recovered by 3% in CY 2021, and global vehicle sales recovery was 4%, despite various setbacks like semiconductor shortage, supply chain issues and low inventories.\n\n## Domestic Market Environment\n\nPP domestic market demand grew by 16% on Y-o-Y basis on account of healthy demand from the health & hygiene sector, raffia and Biaxially Oriented Polypropylene (BOPP) packaging. PE demand also registered a growth of 4% on Y-o-Y basis, driven by e-commerce, FMCG and liquid packaging. PVC demand grew by 6% Y-o-Y, majorly driven by growth in construction activities and policy boost for several water and sewage pipeline projects.\n\nIndian E-SBR demand grew by 7% in FY 2021-22 while demand for PBR was up by 5% for the year. The demand growth was supported by revival in passenger vehicle, commercial vehicle and replacement market.\n\n## Margin\n\nPolymer prices strengthened during FY 2021-22 amidst global demand boost and regional supply shortages due to lower import availability amid container shortage. Global operating rate for PP and PE averaged 89% and 87% respectively during 2021, at par with pre-pandemic levels. Polymer margins weakened during the year amidst higher feedstock cost. Integrated PP-Naphtha and HDPE-Naphtha margins contracted by 17% . PVC margins weakened by 3% during the year.\n\n## Southeast Asia Polymer Margins\n\n| (US$/MT)         |   FY 2021-22 |   FY 2020-21 |   % chg Y-o-Y |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|\n| HDPE-Naphtha     |          426 |          512 |           -17 |\n| PP -Naphtha      |          529 |          637 |           -17 |\n| PP-Propylene     |          235 |          193 |            22 |\n| PVC-EDC- Naphtha |          569 |          584 |            -3 |\n| PBR-BD           |         1126 |          727 |            55 |\n| SBR-BD-Styrene   |         1063 |          718 |            48 |\n\nSource: Platts and ICIS\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## OIL TO CHEMICALS\n\n## Intermediates and Polyesters\n\n## Global Market Environment\n\nGlobal demand for Intermediates (MEG/PX/PTA) increased by 5% to 157/uni00A0MMT in CY 2021 from 149 MMT in CY 2020. PX markets improved in the latter part of the year due to new downstream PTA capacity additions. PTA markets remained healthy and witnessed 7% overall annual growth, the demand went up despite rising inventory in the first half of the year. MEG demand was impacted due to intermittent disruption led by pandemic and energy crisis. Supply disruptions in the US led to tightening of China port inventories.\n\nPolyester overall global demand improved by 7% at 85 MMT. Increase in vaccination rate and relatively lower restrictions across the world have helped improve the global demand for textiles and apparels. Global apparel market which shrunk in CY 2020 by 22% to US $ 1.3 trillion, has recovered by 16% in CY 2021 to US $ 1.5 trillion.\n\n## Domestic Market Environment\n\nDomestic Intermediates demand improved by 32% on account of recovery in textile and polyester demand. Removal of restrictions and improvement in retail demand led to the recovery of the polyester downstream industry, which has shown resilience against repeated pandemic waves and volatility in raw material prices. Polyester downstream operating rates varied from stable to strong across the value chain barring an exceptional dip in April-May '21. Lower polyester imports on account of high ocean freights supported demand and margins.\n\n## Margins\n\nGlobal economic recovery resulted in improved petrochemicals demand. In FY 2021-22, PX prices surged 61%,\n\nwhile PX-Naphtha margins firmed by 21% Y-o-Y, but it is well below 5-year average levels. In 3Q, the imposition of dual control policy in China, emergence of Omicron coupled with the start-up of large PX capacities (2x2.5 MMTPA) resulted in supply overhang and weak margins.\n\nPTA markets in China remained oversupplied given the capacity addition of 8.6 MMTA, together with medium to high level market inventories. Global PTA operating rates remained around 79% in FY 2021-22. PTA prices followed crude oil price movements in FY 2021-22, with the margin on PX improving gradually from H1 with the decrease in China inventory. Overall, in FY 2021-22, PTA prices surged 56% while PTA-PX margins firmed up by 43% Y-o-Y.\n\nMEG margins were under pressure due to oversupply and lower operating rates. MEG prices surged 36% and MEG-Naphtha margins softened by 12% Y-o-Y owing to high feedstock prices.\n\nPET markets witnessed an unprecedented trend during the year. Global PET supplies tightened due to plant shutdown in the US and Europe during the pandemic, leading to a surge in PET prices by 43%, however margins firmed up by 11% Y-o-Y constrained by high feedstock prices.\n\n## Intermediates and Polyester Margin Trends\n\n| (US$/MT)       |   FY 2021-22 |   FY 2020-21 |   % chg Y-o-Y |\n|----------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|\n| PX- Naphtha    |          207 |          172 |            21 |\n| PTA-PX         |          224 |          157 |            43 |\n| MEG-Naphtha    |          203 |          232 |           -12 |\n| POY-PTA & MEG  |          195 |          203 |            -4 |\n| PSF-PTA & MEG  |           43 |          150 |           -71 |\n| PET- PTA & MEG |          161 |          146 |            11 |\n\nSource: Platts, ICIS, CCF Group\n\n## Business Performance\n\n## Production Meant for Sale\n\n| Particulars                    | Products                 |   FY 2021-22 |   (in MMT) FY 2020-21 |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|\n| Transportation                 | Gasoil                   |         25.8 |                  24.9 |\n| Fuels                          | Gasoline / Alkylate      |         11.7 |                  10.5 |\n|                                | ATF                      |          3.7 |                   2.2 |\n| Polymers and   Elastomers      | PP                       |          2.9 |                   2.9 |\n|                                | PE                       |          2.2 |                   2.3 |\n|                                | PVC                      |          0.7 |                   0.7 |\n|                                | Elastomers and Feedstock |          0.4 |                   0.3 |\n| Intermediates   and Polyesters | PX and By-products       |          2.9 |                   3.4 |\n|                                | Benzene and Derivatives  |          0.5 |                   0.5 |\n|                                | PTA                      |          2.2 |                   2   |\n|                                | MEG and By-products      |          1.2 |                   1.3 |\n|                                | Filament                 |          1.2 |                   1   |\n|                                | Staple                   |          0.8 |                   0.7 |\n|                                | PET                      |          1.2 |                   1.1 |\n| Others                         | Fuels, Solids and Others |         10.9 |                   9.7 |\n| Total                          |                          |         68.2 |                  63.6 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOverall production meant for sale increased from 63.6 MMT to 68.2/uni00A0MMT. Most of the increase came from transportation fuels due to increase in global demand.

RIL responded to this national emergency by building new facilities in its plants for medical oxygen and importing oxygen in ISO containers from all over the world through emergency airlift operations with the help of the Indian Air Force. Simultaneously, multimodal logistics solutions were established to deliver medical oxygen to various hospitals across the country in the shortest possible time, thereby saving human lives.\n\nApart from the crisis in shipping containers, port operations were affected globally , and port congestion hit an all-time high, creating challenges in vessel schedules reliability, labour management and so on. The resulting demand-supply gap led to a multi-fold increase in shipping freight in H1 FY 2021-22.\n\nTo ensure optimum supply chain cost, RIL swiftly implemented long-term supply chain cost planning, flexible multimodal transportation solutions and digital monitoring of movement across the entire supply chain. Longterm contracts with shipping line partners and organised extra-loader ships to manage large volumes in global exports. This approach has helped to retain market share and business margins . During this time, the Company supported all stakeholders in the SCM value chain for vaccinations, treatments, and timely financial support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Bio-Degradable & Compostable Polybutylene Adipate Terephthalate (PBAT) Process & Composites: Niche Applications for Packaging & Agriculture/uni00A0Sectors\n\nRIL has developed and scaled up to pilot a novel process for PBAT. Different grades with varied melt viscosities showed good performance in terms of physical and mechanical properties. The developed grades were also compounded with various fillers for ease of downstream processing and enhancing product properties required for applications in flexible as well as rigid packaging, agriculture mulch films, among others.\n\nNovel bio-compostable net-bags have been developed through a netextrusion process using PBAT polymer blends / composites. The process optimisation and development have\n\nbeen carried out on conventional downstream machines with high output and minimal loss of material in processing. It offered a cost competitive product for a green packaging solution for the fruit & vegetable (F&V) sector. The developed net-bags are easy and convenient to use and have good weight carrying capacity. These net-bags are ideal for leafy vegetables, as they maintain freshness for longer time. This development is important in view  of replacement of single-use plastic by sustainable materials. Further, the R&D team is working on different variants of net-bags for different weight carrying capacity to target applications other than F&V.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## OIL AND GAS E/uni00A0P\n\n## Industry Overview\n\nGlobal oil demand rebounded in CY/uni00A02021, as the global economy began to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, global oil production increased slower than demand, driving up prices. The production shortfall was mainly due to OPEC+ production cuts that started in late 2020. During 4Q CY 2021, global demand increased sharply by 1.1 MMBD to 99 MMBD. This resulted in withdrawals from global petroleum inventories that averaged 1.4 MMBD in 2021, leading to higher crude oil prices.\n\nAverage annual price of Brent crude oil climbed to US$ 70.7/bbl in 2021, ~US$ 30 more than the CY/uni00A02020 annual average and highest in the past three years. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil averaged US$ 3/bbl below Brent in 2021. With an outbreak of conflict in Europe, Brent prices rose sharply to above $110/ bbl levels, reaching as high as $130/ bbl in March'22.\n\nGlobal gas consumption increased by 4.6% in 2021 to ~3.8 TCM, more than double the decline seen in 2020, driven by the economic recovery and successive extreme weather events. Insufficient supply coupled with unexpected outages led to tight markets and steep price increases. The year closed with record high spot prices in Europe and Asia, as natural gas supply remained very tight. Henry/uni00A0Hub prices almost doubled from their 2020 levels to average US$ 3.9/MMBtu, the highest since 2014. Asian LNG spot prices rose more than four-fold to US$ 18/MMBtu with a 4Q average of over US$/uni00A035/ MMBtu. Record high prices led to dampening of demand growth in the second half of 2021.\n\n## Emerging Trends and Business Response\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Clean energy\n\nConcerns over greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have heightened global focus on green energy to mitigate the industry's environmental impact\n\n## How RIL E&P is geared up?\n\n- At RIL, the focus is on building a gas-based portfolio. Being a cleaner fuel, gas is seen as a transition fuel to green energy\n\n## Brownfield developments\n\nIn these challenging times, when prices for oil and gas are volatile, companies are focusing on brownfield developments to improve commerciality\n\n- The Company is leveraging its existing infrastructure in the KG/uni00A0Basin to develop three projects in Block KG D6 and is undertaking exploration in contiguous areas. Two/uni00A0of the fields, R Cluster and Satellite Cluster, have been commissioned and production is being ramped up\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Digital technologies\n\nAccelerated adoption of new technologies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has reinforced the importance for improved efficiencies\n\n- Always at the forefront in the adoption of the latest technologies, RIL is further enhancing its capabilities through Digital Twin, Autonomous Fields, Virtual Command Centres and other cutting-edge technologies\n\n## Business Performance\n\n## Production\n\n| JV production   | Unit of Measurement   | FY 2021-22   | FY 2020-21   |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| KG D6           |                       |              |              |\n| Gas             | BCF                   | 224.3        | 24.0         |\n| Oil             | MMBL                  | 0.2          | -            |\n| CBM             |                       |              |              |\n| Gas             | BCF                   | 10.2         | 11.8         |\n\n## KG D6\n\nWith ramp up of gas production from R Cluster and Satellite Cluster Fields, E&P's operating performance improved due to incremental production and higher gas price realisation across the producing assets, leading to higher Revenue and EBITDA.\n\nThe D1-D3 and MA fields in the KG/uni00A0D6 Block produced ~3 TCFe of gas, oil and condensate, which have set global benchmarks in operational performance and excellence during their operations over the years. These/uni00A0existing facilities have been made future ready for the next 20 years through necessary upgradations made before production start-up from R/uni00A0Cluster and Satellite Cluster fields. The three integrated projects - R/uni00A0Cluster, Satellite Cluster and MJ - are leveraging the hub infrastructure in place by utilising existing production facilities and thus reducing costs. At the onshore terminal, RIL is undertaking augmentation of Monoethylene Glycol (MEG) regeneration and reclamation, and associated facilities.\n\n## KG D6 Deepwater Production/uni00A0Update\n\nR Cluster Field was commissioned successfully in December 2020 and achieved peak production of 12.9 MMSCMD with six wells. Satellite Cluster Field was commissioned in April 2021, two months ahead of schedule. All five wells have been opened, tested and ramped up, achieving a peak production of 6.1/uni00A0MMSCMD. Together, the fields are currently producing ~18 MMSCMD, and contributing substantially to domestic production.\n\n## KG D6 MJ Deepwater Development Update\n\nPhase 1 drilling and installation of Xmas Trees for all 8 wells have been completed. Phase-2 drilling and completion activity has commenced in July 2022. The second and final installation campaign has commenced in December 2021. All/uni00A0subsea structures (Manifolds), 24' rigid pipeline and Turret Mooring System (TMS) buoy, along with mooring lines, have been installed.\n\nFor the Floating Production Storage & Offloading (FPSO) vessel , hull construction has been completed. All topside modules have been fabricated and erected on the hull.\n\nGeostationary and Swivel modules have been installed. Pre-commissioning and commissioning activities have commenced. Reliance expects to commission MJ Field in 3Q FY 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Abandonment\n\nThe D1D3 Field ceased production in February 2020, following which the Oil Industry Safety Directorate (OISD) and Management Committee (MC) have approved the permanent Plug & Abandonment (P&A) of wells and in-situ abandonment of the associated equipment.\n\nFollowing cessation of production in MA Field, freeing flexible flowlines of hydrocarbons and the flushing of umbilicals were completed, and the floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit was demobilised. The flexible flowlines, dynamic flexibles, dynamic umbilicals, subsea structures, mooring lines and the Submerged Turret Production (STP) buoy were decommissioned in accordance with the Field Decommissioning Plan, which was approved by the OISD and the MC. Well P&A has been completed for all MA wells.\n\n## Exploration strategy\n\nRIL and its partner bp acquired Block KGUDWHP-2018/ (KG-UDW1) under the OALP II licensing round. The Petroleum Exploration License (PEL) was issued in August 2019, with 341 days' extension of the Initial Exploration Phase granted in 2021. Despite the pandemic and related challenges and constraints, the 3D Seismic Acquisition campaign was completed in the Block. Currently, Data Processing and Interpretation work is ongoing for prospect maturation, with a plan to drill the first exploration well in 2023.",

Therefore, the transition from old energy to new, green and clean energy is inevitable and will trigger major geopolitical shifts, economic transformations and redefine financial models in the 21 st century.\n\nThe accelerated pace of transition to a lower-carbon world will be accompanied by far-reaching changes in regulations, governance norms, market conditions and technology. Societal sentiments against harmful environmental practices are growing. Regulations mandating the minimum use of renewable energy for operations and incentivising the use of alternate energy sources coupled with technological advances and changing customer preferences have the potential to lower demand for fossil fuels and their price, increase RIL's operational costs and prevent access to strategically important markets and new energy reserves.\n\nClimate change related disruptions, including rising temperatures and sea levels, heat waves, erratic rainfall, floods and droughts can adversely impact the smooth functioning of RIL's supply chain.\n\nFinancial institutions and investors are nudging the world's transition to a low-carbon economy and limiting their exposure to particular industries or projects. These developments could affect access to capital markets for Reliance and its partners. The rising sentiment against fossil fuels could impact shareholder opinions and cause fluctuations in RIL's valuation. RIL could be impacted by growing litigation and activism, necessitating increased environmental and legal liability provisions. Trade regimes and tariff caps could further impact the Company's financial flows. Measures to make organisations accountable for their GHG emissions may increase compliance costs arising from technology investments needed for monitoring, mitigation and sequestering.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nAddressing climate change through energy transition is a strategic focus of RIL's business continuity plans. We believe if Old Energy created the problem of Climate Change, New Energy is poised to provide a reliable solution to Climate Mitigation. Reliance has announced a Net Carbon Zero target for 2035, going beyond compliance requirements and business imperatives. We aim to invest ' 75,000 crore by 2024 to:\n\n- \u00b7  Enable at least 100 GW of solar energy by 2030\n- \u00b7  Build four Giga factories to build an integrated, end-to-end renewable energy ecosystem\n- \u00b7  Invest in enhancing the value chain, partnerships and future technologies, including upstream and downstream industries\n- \u00b7  Transform RIL's business to Net Carbon Zero operations\n\nWe have a 15-year vision to rebuild Reliance as one of the world's leading New Energy and New Materials Company. The roadmap includes creating sustainable energy sources and materials for India's future needs, building world-scale assets that produce clean fuels and materials of the future and developing nextgeneration Carbon Capture and Storage technologies to convert carbon dioxide into useful products and chemicals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are developing the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex on 5,000 acres in Jamnagar, comprising four Giga Factories. These include an integrated solar photovoltaic module factory, an advanced energy storage battery factory for intermittent energy, an Electrolyser Factory for the production of Green Hydrogen and a Fuel Cell Factory for converting hydrogen into motive and stationary power. We are also setting up infrastructure in Jamnagar to manufacture ancillary material and equipment needed to support the Giga Factories and enabling independent manufacturers\n\nto join and grow as part of this ecosystem. Reliance R&D teams are actively working to make CO 2 a recyclable resource and innovating lower emission technologies.\n\nAs we transition into a New Energy era, targets for periodic reductions in emissions are being established, which will be monitored regularly through governance mechanisms that oversee RIL's progress toward Net Carbon Zero goals.\n\nThe transition to a world that is powered by clean energy is a capital intensive journey. RIL's strong balance sheet, operational efficiencies\n\n## Commodity Prices and Markets\n\n## Risk Description\n\nDespite a sharp demand recovery from the lows seen during the pandemic in 2020-21, total oil demand is yet to reach pre-pandemic levels either globally or in India. This, coupled with commissioning of additional refining capacity notwithstanding the refinery closures in the West due to poor economics and in China due to pollution, keeps refining margins under pressure.\n\nThe crude oil market remains tight due to production from OPEC Plus countries falling short of their targets and continued sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. Crude oil stocks have fallen close to 5-year lows. Besides, geopolitical developments like Russia and US/EU standoff on Ukraine and Houthi drone attacks in the UAE have added to the price volatility as well as causing a high-risk premium on crude oil. Alongside the above, gas prices also rose sharply increasing input costs.\n\nImpact of unforeseen events like pandemic on product evacuation, challenges in logistics and thereby probable risk of stock surplus, plant shutdowns and stringent recycling norms and government regulations can reduce plastic consumption.\n\nReliance Retail operates in the consumer sector and a slowdown in macro-economic growth and weak consumer sentiments/spending could have a bearing on its performance. Government restrictions on account of the COVID-19 pandemic could affect smooth operation of business activities, store operation, and expansion. Sporadic disruptions in the operating environment and inability to build infrastructure at a pace and scale needed by the rapidly growing Retail business could hinder operational efficiency and customer service.\n\nCompetitive pressure from the retail industry reflected in price wars between various retailers and resulted in traditional retailers moving from the physical retail world into e-commerce platforms disrupting walk-ins.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nProactive measures by Reliance such as revised product placement strategies, placement in deficit market through exports to diverse geographical locations mitigated the risk of non-evacuation with minimal adverse effect. Robust supply chain network and additional temporary warehouses closer to\n\nthe customer locations to address the demand variability issues in the domestic market. The Company increased the usage of multimodal logistics (including coastal) to fulfil its contractual commitment to customers. Reliance has either started to supply or increased volumes to some countries in Africa\n\nand Latin America. Also, the Company has been targeting more end users/ buyers for exports and offering cargoes on delivered basis.\n\nIn respect of crude oil, the Company has increased sourcing from North America (Canada in particular) as well as non-conventional feedstocks\n\nand competitive edge will help us to absorb the impact of energy transition costs, carbon taxes or lower margins.\n\nRIL keeps its stakeholders abreast of its climate change goals through ongoing engagement. We believe that this alignment is critical if we are to succeed in creating a sustainable future for our Company and our stakeholders and build the Reliance of tomorrow.",

If the products sold are not safe or otherwise fail to meet customers' expectations, Reliance Retail could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers and have material impact over brand, reputation and financial performance.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nIn spite of the resurgence of the pandemic, unpredictable and challenging environment, Digital Services has further consolidated its position as one of the world's largest and fastest growing mobile and wireline data network and has India's largest subscriber base.\n\nDigital business has adopted multiple measures for sustained customer experience including superior usage and billing experience across all touchpoints, anytime, anywhere mobile and wireline broadband network access, best-in-class customer service backed by AI BoTs and app based QRC process, competitive tariff pricing and\n\nagile model while developing its systems and platforms.\n\nCustomer engagement remains robust with strong gross additions of subscribers, significant increase in net MNP subscribers and increase in per capita data usage.\n\nThe Company has also invested in newer technologies start-up's such as AI / ML, Blockchain, BoT, Speech / NLP, Metaverse, Mobility & 5G network, Robotics, Cloud & Edge computing etc. Use of these technologies will further enhance customer experience and value proposition.\n\nReliance Retail is a consumer centric organisation and adapts to any\n\nchanges in customer preferences and shopping habits through market study to stay abreast of the emerging trends. Entry into new categories, adapting merchandise to suit changing consumer demands, launching of new store formats are some of the initiatives that are undertaken from time to time. All our businesses have taken cognizance of 'CUSTOMER SAFETY' as the topmost value and priority. All our products manufactured in-house, across formats, follow stringent safety norms and adhere to rigorous quality checks. Regular screening and checks for these products are also undertaken when supplied by vendors/ third party vendors.\n\nDigital and New commerce channels with requisite investments in supply chain infrastructure and technology. During the year, business gained operating efficiency and footfalls as environment returned to normalcy.\n\nReliance Retail is ahead of all market competitors, in terms of 'pricing'. Till date, it is known as one of the 'lowest price' operator nationally. Operating with huge volumes gives it a strong foundational support and acts as a competitive advantage to its overall pricing strategy.\n\nGovernance\n\nManagement\n\nReview\n\n## Oversight over Investee Companies/Alliances\n\n## Risk Description\n\nReliance has entered into strategic alliances and other business relationships with various entities to expand its operations. Lack of oversight over Investee companies or not being able to successfully integrate RIL's acquisitions might adversely impact its business and competitive position or affect its financial performance or result in significant costs to integrate.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nReliance incorporates the process of immediately aligning investment/ investee companies to the Group and rolls-out the Group governance\n\nframework and integrates the newly acquired companies in a structured manner.\n\n## Talent to Support Scaling Business\n\n## Risk Description\n\nWith people at the heart of the business, Reliance's inability to attract, retain or develop employees relative to the scale and breadth of its operations could adversely affect its business.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nReliance has built a robust in-house Talent pool for all business-critical roles and created a rigorous training regime to have successors ready at every front end. Open culture and work environment are fostered in the organisation.\n\nIts campus outreach and engagement initiatives have helped RIL to secure prime slots on the campus for graduate engineers as well as MBAs. Concerted efforts on job rotations and growth opportunities have propelled the productivity and longevity indicators.\n\nRIL has established a 'Forward Looking' culture by forecasting emerging trends related to people skills along with continuous training sessions. This has helped in putting together a talent pool with large scale skilling initiatives, digitisation and succession planning for businesses.\n\n## Data Privacy Risk\n\n## Risk Description\n\nIn this digital economy, businesses collect, process, and analyse data from individuals to understand their customers better and provide customised experiences. Collecting and using data necessitates several concerns about data privacy.\n\nStringent Data Privacy laws and regulations are in place that regulate the collection, storage, and handling of personal information by businesses globally. Presently, Information Technology Act 2000 (amendment 2008) governs the data privacy requirements in our country and India is on the cusp of adopting a comprehensive personal data protection law.\n\nAt Reliance, due to the expansion of B2C businesses, and large scale digitisation, there is an imperative need to handle personal data of customers, consumers, employees, partners and service providers. While these data helps RIL give personalised and customised services, it also poses risk of data breach and non-compliances to laws and regulations.",

        "page_content": "## Risk Response\n\nReliance makes sure that all its business processes follow privacyby-design principle and makes sure that the Company handles privacy information securely and with all fiduciary responsibilities. Reliance conducts privacy impact analysis for all the businesses on a regular basis and makes sure that the gaps if any are closed efficiently.\n\nReliance is quite cognizant of the risks in handling personal data and takes utmost care to handle these securely. Ensuring and safeguarding data privacy is one of the top priorities for RIL. Reliance believes in staying always ahead of the compliance curve and remaining compliant to all present and future laws and regulations related to Data Privacy.\n\n## Cybersecurity Risk\n\n## Risk Description\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation and the way the Company works has fundamentally changed. This has subsequently increased RIL's dependence on digital technologies. While Reliance continues to focus on large scale digitisation, it brings a lot of concerns around Cyber Security with the use of new technologies, open source software, adoption of cloud, etc. Consequently, cyber-attack surfaces also increase substantially which increases the cyber security risks.\n\nDigital services being technology driven, there is an inherent risk of errors, bugs, or security vulnerabilities in products and internal systems.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nThe Company realises the consequence of digital transformation in terms of increase of the cyber-attack surface due to use of new generation technologies like Cloud, AI, ML, Blockchain etc. and takes utmost care to ensure that cyber security controls are part of the design itself so that the Company is secure-by-design.\n\nMeasures taken by the Company include shift-left strategy in ensuring that security is completely integrated into the DevOps pipeline, highest order of security automation and orchestration to attain efficiency in its cyber defense, and validation of its cyber posture by third party experts. Increased cyber security awareness\n\nthrough employees' mandatory trainings and training for RIL's service providers are important controls and the Company considers this as a 'Human Firewall'. Reliance has also developed an anti-phishing platform in-house viz R-Phish, through which Reliance conducts regular phishing simulation to make sure that all its users are phishing resistant.\n\nAll RIL's businesses, manufacturing units are ISO 27001 compliant for the last 5 years in a row and all its retail operations (Reliance Retail and Petroleum Retail (Jio BP) are certified with the latest PCI DSS (Payment card industry Data Security Standard). Reliance is the only organised and multi brand retail business in the\n\ncountry to demonstrate PCI DSS certification continuously for nine years in a row.\n\nMultiple layers of proactive and reactive controls are adopted for Digital Services to mitigate risk of vulnerabilities such as Penetration tests on a routine basis, a Bugbounty program since the last 3 years to crowdsource security testing of live products by independent security researchers. A mature cybersecurity program based on NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Cybersecurity Framework has been adopted. All systems and security tools are monitored for any cyberattacks via a 24x7 Security Operations Centre.\n\nWhile Reliance is compliant with the existing data privacy laws of India, it is also in the process of implementing global best practices on Data Privacy as part of its readiness for the impending regulation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Safety and Operational Risks\n\n## Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) Risks in Operations\n\n## Risk Description\n\nHSE risks include the effects of natural disasters (floods, earthquakes, among others) and safety lapses on human capital. The nature of its operations exposes the Company, its employees and the society, to a wide range of health, safety, security and environment risks due to the geographical location and technical complexity of operations.\n\nVarious HSE regulations across geographies regulate Reliance's business of Exploration & Production of oil and gas, and their further refining and downstream processing. A major HSE incident, such as fire, oil spill and security breach, can result in loss of life, environmental degradation and overall disruption in business activities.\n\nHSE risk in retail extends to food safety and waste management also. The nature of retail operations exposes RIL's employees and contractors to a wide range of occupational health hazards as well as safety risks due to complexity of operational requirements. Changes in HSE regulatory framework possibly will have lasting effect on Retail Business, especially in the environmental domain like changes in plastic waste management and e-waste rules.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nDuring the year, RIL's facilities in the hydrocarbon business have continued focused efforts to manage the risks for safe, reliable, and compliant operations. Safety and operational risk management framework continues to play a pivotal role in consistently managing HSE risks on a real-time basis.\n\nReliance entities have devised novel ways to review and audit the facilities periodically through virtual and physical means. Reliance has been active in networking with industry and sponsored and participated in the '6 th Global Summit on Process Safety by Centre for Chemical Process Safety' and continued its contribution in\n\ndeveloping safe industry practices through participation in Standards Committees of statutory authorities (OISD, PNGRB, etc.)\n\nReliance's digital safety platform project has progressed well in digitalising its key HSE processes through Industry 4.0 technologies. This year, Reliance rolled out solutions for digitalising risk registers, three lines of defense program across its key hydrocarbon entities. Reliance has undertaken significant activities on new projects in hydrocarbon business, in its fuel retail business and New Energy domain, which have progressed through various phases.\n\n## Safety and Environmental Risks During Transportation\n\n## Risk Description\n\nWith most of the crude being supplied to RIL by sea vessels, and the overwhelming majority of refined products being exported by sea, road and pipeline, the Company faces the risk of HSE incidents, oil spills and so on, leading to disruption in business activities.\n\nEvents like technical integrity failure, natural disasters, extreme weather, human error and other adverse events or conditions could lead to loss of containment of hydrocarbons or other hazardous materials, as well as fires, explosions or other personal and process safety incidents.\n\nRIL operates a fleet of tugs, port service vessels and operations of port and terminal infrastructure and is exposed to a complex and diverse range of marine risks, with respect to exploration vessels, oil tankers, chemical tankers, gas tankers, and dry cargo vessels.\n\nReliance has taken various measures to protect health of its workforce in the pandemic.\n\nThe Retail business poses risks inherent to retail operations involving fire, breakdown in work event and risk related to ergonomics. Every member of the workforce is communicated on the potential exposure to HSE risks, and they are an integral part of risk management.

        "page_content": "## Risk Response\n\nRIL has a strong vessel vetting, incident monitoring and emergency response system. A robust ship vetting programme ensures the vessels that are contracted to carry RIL cargo or those calling Sikka port to load products 'Free-on-board' are screened based on risks prior to their induction. The third-party ship vetting system, based on extensive data analysis, provides a risk rating benchmarked against other similar vessels. This allows a clear picture of the quality of the vessel and whether it is acceptable to RIL.\n\nPeriodic vendor management audits are carried out for time charters and STS service providers in accordance with the Marine Assurance Framework. Where physical inspection of timecharter vessels is not feasible due to COVID-19 protocol, a desktop review is carried out.\n\nEmergency Response system has been tried out in real scenario and found to be adequate. Incident Management includes root cause analysis and ensuring ship-owners' addressal of the same. The data\n\n## Physical Security and Natural Calamity Risks\n\n## Risk Description\n\nDue to the geographical spread of operations, both onshore as well as offshore, Reliance is vulnerable to manmade and natural disasters. It is an attractive target for activities related to terrorism, criminal and violent protests, which could cause harm to people, infrastructure and disrupt business operations. Pandemic conditions can also have a severe impact. Therefore, it is important to proactively focus on safeguarding people and infrastructure from all internal and external threats.\n\nPrompt and adequate response is required to deal with all the internal and external crises and at the same time have the situational awareness to do so. Business continuity plans are critical to ensure that business operations are not disrupted and if required, are restored at the earliest. Otherwise, this could adversely impact the Company's operations and reputation.\n\nSome of the network locations, offices, employees and other ecosystems are subject to various forms of intentional or natural disruptions, thereby impacting network availability, customer experience, restoration cost and efforts.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nGlobal Corporate Security (GCS) focuses on adopting pre-emptive derisking strategies to safeguard and secure the Company. GCS has robust business continuity management plans and capability to handle disasters, natural calamities, and any other disruptions or incidents.\n\nGCS is responsible for securing the people, assets and operations of RIL. This is accomplished by continuous situational awareness to proactively mitigate risks and constantly review and upgrade security plans. These are supported by deploying manpower along with an integrated security platform with wide area high end electronic sensors, drones,\n\nseamless communication and AI based analytics across the enterprise. The COVID-19 crisis posed unique, unprecedented challenges which were successfully overcome by adopting new, revised procedures and protocols in handling men and material at all sites.\n\nDigital Services have developed and implemented an Integrated Disaster Recovery and Emergency Response Process. Integrated response is facilitated by various teams to keep the networks functional and customer services intact. It has also implemented measures for prevention and detection of any physical security threats which\n\nincludes patrolling the vulnerable areas, Real-time situational awareness by deploying alarms management and monitoring through centralised Networks Operations Centre (NoC). Disaster recovery processes and drills are also conducted for managing unscheduled downtime. Security & Loss Prevention (SLP) and Field Operations teams proactively support in reducing pilferage, theft and losses, alarm alerts, video based surveillance, GPS based trackers and consumption monitoring.\n\nReliance Retail SLP de-risks, safeguards and secures the Retail business of the Company with a\n\nis further used in assisting legal/ operations in case of any potential losses to RIL as a result of the incident.\n\nRIL's control framework for road transportation has matured over a period of time and is run in collaboration with contractors. The contractors are supported by the Company through capacity building for their drivers in areas such as defensive driving, route hazard mapping and real time tracking.\n\nprudent mix of physical security, remote surveillance and databased audit interventions. Reliance Retail actively monitors threat and maintains detailed disaster recovery\n\nand incident response mechanism plans to ensure business continuity during any disruption or incident. Enhanced use of technological interventions and AI based exception\n\nidentification, using CCTV to provide a less intrusive and highly accurate risk management solutions across businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Compliance and Control Risks\n\n## Regulatory Compliance Risks\n\n## Risk Description\n\nIncreased regulatory scrutiny has raised the bar on regulatory compliance. This requires alignment of corporate performance objectives, with regulatory compliance requirements. COVID-19 has led the government to announce a range of notifications which companies need to adopt swiftly and effectively.\n\nChanges in the regulatory environment, licensing processes and timelines could potentially impede the ease of doing business.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nReliance has adopted a digitallyenabled comprehensive compliance management framework. It is integrated with business processes, risks and controls. Changes in regulations, including COVID-19 induced changes, are also tracked and integrated within the Reliance Compliance Management System. Effective control and efficient oversight of the senior management\n\nis ensured by cascading the responsibility matrix till the last performer of the activity. Apart from assurance through Three lines of defense, compliances are also periodically monitored through the Segment Compliance Committees and the Group Compliance Committee.\n\nRegular interactions with various trade associations/ councils help in\n\nanticipating regulatory environment and through attuning to any policy changes.\n\nThe Company's Code of Conduct, training as well as focus on ensuring 100% compliance and continuous monitoring have enabled a mature, digitally-enabled compliance framework.",

The RBI is expected to remain dovish in the near term to support growth despite global rate hikes. Overall liquidity situation is also expected to remain comfortably in surplus.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nReliance borrows funds from domestic and international markets to meet its funding requirements. Given the accommodative stance from Central banks, interest rates remained low during the year and RIL benefited from it. RIL is now subject to risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates.\n\n## Foreign Exchange (FX) Risk\n\nReliance prepares its financial statements in Indian Rupee (INR), but most of the payables and receivables of the Hydrocarbon business are in US dollars. Foreign currency liabilities are availed to fund its capital investments and working capital requirements. Rupee depreciation impacts the landed cost of the foreign currency liabilities. The depreciation for this year has been 3.7%.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nReliance deploys surplus liquidity primarily in Government securities, State Government securities, AAA Corporate bonds and Debt mutual funds. Corporate bonds and Debt Mutual Fund investments bear credit risk.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nThe Company continues to maintain sufficient liquidity buffer to meet additional demands that may emerge on account of the growth and new businesses. Reliance issued fixed rate Long-term senior unsecured notes of US$4.0 billion, primarily for refinancing maturities.\n\nInterest rate risk is managed actively through financial derivative\n\ninstruments available to convert floating rate liabilities into fixed rate liabilities or vice-versa. FX bonds issuance of US$4.0 billion was done at a fixed coupon to lock in the prevailing low levels of interest rates and credit spreads.\n\nForeign Exchange (FX) risk arising from the mismatch of foreign currency assets, liabilities and earnings is\n\ntracked and managed as per the Internal Risk Management Framework.\n\nDirect investments are restricted to Board approved select AAA rated corporates. Debt Mutual Fund investments are managed and monitored based on a tight internal Risk Management Framework and restricted to high credit quality schemes.\n\n## Insurance - Risk Mitigation\n\nReliance operations may be subject to a number of circumstances which are not wholly within the Company's control and which could adversely affect its operations. To cover such eventualities, Reliance maintains a robust risk mitigation practice by transferring the insurable risk to insurer. Mostly protection is on All Risk basis which includes cover against fire, explosions, natural catastrophes, breakdown, terrorism etc. Entire insurance program is designed in such a way that adequate protection is available for all assets belonging to Reliance and against the liability arising out of business operations. Protection design is best-in-class and takes care of entire Reliance's operations.\n\n## SEBI - Developments During the Year\n\nDuring the year, SEBI came out with SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) (Second Amendment) Regulations 2021 w.e.f. May 05, 2021 including requirements related to Risk Management. Also, it may be mentioned that these risk management practices have been adopted by the Company since year 2018, largely on lines of global best practices.\n\n## Leading Edge Technology - Governance, Risk, Compliance and Audit (GRCA 2.0) Platform\n\nTHe GRCA 2.0 Platform, which is an in-house developed platform on open source technology, has enabled real-time actionable dashboards and real-time monitoring of risks and controls across three lines of defense. The platform along with robust ERP system and data analytics capabilities is used for risk management. The platform enables control evaluation via automated real time monitoring of exception alerts, timely resolution and is scalable and agile.\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nThe world is entering into a new energy era, which is going to be highly disruptive. New Energy and New Materials will help RIL in its mission to heal the environment. It is an expression of Reliance's commitment that We Care for our planet. JIO has developed deep expertise in multiple emerging technologies like 5G, AI/ ML and blockchain and Mixed Reality. JIO PLATFORMS is blossoming into a global technology player. Reliance Retail continues to be amongst the fastest growing retailers in the world. Reliance's risk management is facilitating better risk mitigation strategies and assurance over the effectiveness of risk management across all categories of risks. Reliance has navigated through the Black Swan event with record growth and unmatched innovative response and is much more resilient for future in this Brittle, Anxious, Nonlinear, Incomprehensible (BANI) world. Reliance's risk management is agile for course correction and is scalable to support new businesses and ventures, including dealing with upside risks.",

It is also about taking cognisance of the non-financial and social parameters, the convergence of which is critical to optimise trust and goodwill with its stakeholders and the larger ecosystem. The Company's unique strength lies in its ability to balance financial and non-financial goals. It gives Reliance the edge to tap opportunities across the spectrum to strengthen its long-term sustainable value creation potential while meeting the needs of its diverse stakeholders.\n\nGiven the complexity of Reliance's operations and its growth aspirations, it must embrace the latest technology advances, invest in robust research capabilities, nurture communities and stay abreast of ever-evolving customer preferences. The Company must also create a mutually rewarding experience for employees and reduce the environmental impact of every action it undertakes. Reliance understands the importance of monitoring and mitigating risks and identifying opportunities that can directly or indirectly impact its present and future existence. Its approach has always been holistic so that the interdependencies between the different aspects of business\n\nand the cause-effect relationship are synchronous. Its determination to walk this balanced path and grow while keeping 'Care' at the core are reflected in the Company's resilient and sustained financial performance.\n\nThe disclosures made in this part of the report are shaped by industry best practices and universally accepted standards and frameworks such as Global Reporting Initiative(GRI), International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and World Economic Forum's International Business Council (WEF-IBC) metrics.\n\nIn this report, Reliance has enumerated its value creation story by aligning to the six capitals of the framework laid down by the IIRC covering Natural Capital, Human Capital, Manufactured Capital, Intellectual Capital, Financial Capital and Social and Relationship Capital.\n\nThis section focuses on Reliance's value creation from the lens of Non-financial Capitals of IIRC <IR> framework.

For Reliance, caring for its stakeholders during these troubled times took centre stage. Just as people around the globe were struggling to manage the first wave of the pandemic, the debilitating second wave struck the world and India in 2021. Against this backdrop, Reliance's enduring commitment to 'Serve' or deliver 'Seva' to India and humanity became even more crucial. It formed the nucleus of proactive support to communities undertaken by the Company.\n\nDrawing on its combined strengths, the 'One Reliance' family worked round the clock to quickly mobilise efforts on the ground to deliver 'CARE' and support the nation's fight against the pandemic. Since its inception, the Company's dedication to inclusive growth, sustainable development and meeting stakeholder expectations\n\nhave been a part of its core values. Reliance's commitment to its stakeholders includes but is not limited to the communities in which it operates, the employees who drive its growth, the suppliers and partners who help achieve its business goals and the customers who are the lifeline of the Company. Reliance's spirit of\n\n'WE CARE' encompasses all Indians and the humanity at large. Today as India and the world emerge out of the shadows of COVID-19, the spirit of resilience has become the new lodestone guiding Reliance in the post-pandemic era.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employee Care\n\nDuring the pandemic, Reliance extended care to its employees and the 'One Reliance' family through a four-pronged approach that covered communications, risk reduction, creating Infrastructure, and ensuring health and well-being, with a focus on mental health.\n\n- \u00b7  In addition to implementing stringent social distancing norms, all work locations were sanitised every three hours. Materials entering sites and townships were fumigated to ensure safety.\n- \u00b7  To contain the spread of the virus, Reliance ran daily temperature checks and ran a separate Outpatient Department for employees with symptoms.\n- \u00b7  Reliance initiated an online symptom-checker where the employees filled questionnaires daily to identify high-risk cases and extend support, as required.\n- \u00b7  The Company adopted robust testing modalities in collaboration with the state-of-the-art Reliance Life Science Labs to maximise testing capacity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7  Reliance developed dedicated COVID-19 care centres across various locations housing over 2,000 beds for critical patients.\n- \u00b7  The Company implemented a COVID Pass Authenticator that has been integrated with the online symptom checker and testing data.\n- \u00b7  The Company announced an initiative, 'Reliance Family Support and Welfare Scheme', under which it extends support to the bereaved family members of the employees who succumbed to COVID-19.\n- \u00b7  The Company made provisions for special COVID leave that employees can avail if they or their family members are affected by the pandemic.\n- \u00b7  For off-roll workforce members who succumbed to the pandemic, the Company, through Reliance Foundation, extended its support to the bereaved families by contributing a lump sum payment of ' 10 lakh directly to the nominee of the deceased.\n- \u00b7  In line with the Government of India's guidelines, Reliance rolled\n\nout its vaccination programme, called Mission Vaccine Suraksha, for all its employees and eligible family members. As of FY 2021-22, nearly 100% of the eligible employees have been administered the first dose under Mission Vaccine Suraksha and 96% of all the eligible employees are fully vaccinated.\n\n- \u00b7   To address physical and mental health challenges, Reliance implemented webinars on lifestyle disorders and ways to manage the post-pandemic impact, Diabetes Control Mission, BMI reduction programme, and lifestyle clinic, amongst others.\n- \u00b7  Teleconsultations with specialists were conducted via the JioHealthHub app.\n- \u00b7  Yoga and meditation sessions and peer-to-peer discussion platforms were facilitated.",

Under the dedicated personal supervision of the Chairman and Managing Director, Shri Mukesh D. Ambani, the Company re-engineered its existing facilities to set up the largest production facilities in India to produce and deliver medical oxygen from a single location in record time. The Company adopted a two-pronged approach to strengthening the availability of medical-grade oxygen in India, including:\n\n- \u00b7  Refocusing several industrial processes at Reliance's Jamnagar and other facilities for rapid scaleup in the production of medicalgrade liquid oxygen.\n- \u00b7  Managing the supply chain by augmenting loading and transportation capacities to ensure the swift and safe supply of oxygen to states and Union Territories across India.\n\nDespite not being a manufacturer of medical-grade oxygen historically, the Company's engineers quickly reconfigured and optimised operations, which were initially designed for refining and producing petrochemical grade oxygen to produce high-purity medical-grade oxygen during the second wave of the pandemic. Reliance also converted nitrogen tankers into transport trucks for medical-grade oxygen through innovative and safe processes approved by the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO), the relevant regulatory body of the Government of India.\n\nIn the words of Chairman and Managing Director Shri Mukesh D. Ambani, \"For me and all of us at Reliance, nothing is more important than saving every life as India battles against a new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an immediate need to maximise India's production and transportation capacities for medical grade oxygen. I am proud of our engineers at Jamnagar who have worked tirelessly, with a great sense of patriotic urgency, to meet this new challenge. I am truly humbled by the determination and sense of purpose shown by the bright, young\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRamped up from zero to produce 11% of the liquid medical-grade oxygen requirements of the country, including establishing the entire supply chain to meet the urgent need\n\nSet up capacity of 2,000+ beds for COVID-19 care\n\nDistributed\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncrore\n\nMasks\n\n1.4+\n\nDistributed\n\ncrore\n\nMeals\n\n8.5+\n\nIncreased capacity of Reliance-led COVID-19 testing labs to\n\n15,000 +\n\nDistributed 2,00,000 + gloves and 5,00,000 + ORS packets\n\nmembers of the Reliance family who have once again risen to the occasion and delivered when India needs it the most.\"\n\n## Expanding COVID Care Facilities\n\n- \u00b7  As the second wave of COVID-19 infections gripped the country, Reliance BP Mobility Limited (RBML, Operating under the brand name Jio-bp) reintroduced its programme of supplying fuel free of cost to COVID emergency services vehicles. Under the pan-India programme, a total of 2,203.59 KL was dispensed to 56,283 emergency vehicles (53,272 HSD and 3,011 MS) from May 13 to June 30, 2021.\n- \u00b7   Reliance procured and administered 40+ lakh vaccine doses. Of this, 9.4 lakh doses were given to various state governments and 2 lakh to the armed forces.\n\nSince its inception, Reliance has been committed to sustainable growth, which has only been possible due to the underpinning governance. The Company recognises the role of robust governance mechanisms for long-term value creation. Efficient corporate governance has acted as a pillar of Reliance's sustained growth throughout the year.\n\nManagement\n\nReview\n\n## Reliance's Integrated Approach to ESG Governance\n\nReliance's Corporate Governance practices are driven by the principles of transparency, accountability, and integrity. This is operationalised by relevant policies and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure compliance and good governance for all stakeholders.\n\n## Board Governance\n\nReliance's senior leadership comprises of a 14-member Board which is responsible for direction and oversight of Reliance. The Board of Directors come from diverse backgrounds with unique competencies and rich experience. The induction into the Board of Directors is instituted by the Board level Human Resources, Nomination and Remuneration Committee. This Committee oversees aspects which include formulation of the criteria for determining qualifications, positive attributes, and independence of a Director, and recommend to the Board a policy, relating to the remuneration of the Directors, Key Managerial Personnel, and other employees. The Committee has also developed a set of criteria for evaluating the performance of the Board of Directors, including that of Independent Directors. Attendance, familiarity with the business, and engagement are some of the key parameters defined for evaluating the Board's performance. The Board of Directors, through its Committees, oversee the ESG initiatives and performance.\n\n## ESG Governance\n\nReliance is on a continuous improvement journey to create longterm value for its stakeholders. The key decisions that are taken pertaining to ESG include indepth analysis through an Integrated Profit and Loss lens. Reliance has integrated ESG into its governance structure so that the Company can have a better oversight and strengthen management responsibility for business-related ESG challenges and opportunities.\n\nThe Corporate Social Responsibility & Governance (CSR&G) Committee oversees the implementation of sustainability activities. Business Responsibility Report (BRR) describing the initiatives taken by the Company from an environmental, social and governance perspective is reviewed and recommended to the Board by the CSR&G Committee. The progress on the Company's CSR initiatives is periodically reviewed by the CSR&G Committee and the Company's Board of Directors. RIL continuously enhances its existing systems and processes to capture the impact of its social/economic and developmental initiatives. The Risk Management Committee oversees the ESG related risks and risk mitigation measures. Further, the Health, Safety & Environment (HSE) Committee reviews the environment related policies and matters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetailed information on various Board Committees is available on https:// www.ril.com/OurCompany/Leadership/ BoardCommittees.aspx and the Corporate Governance section of this report.\n\n## Policies and Codes\n\nPolicies and codes are the essential components that help operationalise governance frameworks. Reliance's policies and codes signify the Company's commitment to the highest business ethics and corporate values and are communicated transparently to all the relevant stakeholders. A/uni00A0detailed list of policies is available in the Corporate Governance Section of this report.\n\nBoard diversity in skill-set, nationality, experience, and perspective is important for effective leadership and governance. A diverse Board provides guidance and effective oversight over the Company's operations. It enhances responsiveness to stakeholder needs, collaboration across departments, and provides expertise leading to the continuous growth of the Company. Presently, the Board consists of two eminent women directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Regulatory Issues and Compliance\n\nRegulatory compliance at Reliance has been of utmost importance, especially in an evolving regulatory scenario. Reliance's Regulatory compliance risk is addressed by the Reliance Compliance Management System. It is a digitally enabled comprehensive compliance management framework that's integrated with business processes, risks and controls and updated on a regular basis.\n\nChanges in regulations are also monitored on an ongoing basis by the Group Compliance Committee.

Therefore, the global New Energy agenda has to transcend from dialogue to action and commitment through urgent on-ground implementation. Led by this vision, Reliance had announced a target to be Net Zero by 2035. To achieve this ambitious goal, Reliance announced to:\n\n- \u00b7  Establish and enable 100 GW of solar energy by 2030\n- \u00b7  Build Giga Factories to create and offer a fully-integrated, end-toend renewable energy ecosystem\n- \u00b7  Invest in value chain, partnerships and future technologies, including upstream and downstream industries\n- \u00b7  Transform its business to Net Carbon Zero operations\n\n## Reliance's Commitment\n\nAs the world develops new technologies to combat the effects of climate change, Reliance has embraced the need of the hour and spearheaded its initiatives towards decarbonisation. The Company is transforming itself, embracing newage technologies and establishing a comprehensive green energy ecosystem in India, ranging from solar modules and batteries to hydrogen fuel cells.\n\nReliance sees investments in renewables and alternative energy as an active way to ensure positive outcomes for future generations. With renewables and alternative energy dominating the future power generation mix, the Company is changing the way it operates.\n\nAs one of the biggest energy markets globally, India will play a key role in transforming the world's energy landscape. The country has already\n\nannounced its National Hydrogen Mission, which aims to boost green hydrogen production. As a Company that is always focused on growing businesses of the future and making India a stronger economy, Reliance will lead by leveraging its strengths that include finance, talent, technology, and proven project execution capabilities. The Company aims to play a meaningful role in meeting the country's growing energy demand sustainably by making its New Energy business truly global.\n\n## Reliance's Strategy\n\nAs a part of Reliance's long-term strategy on emission reduction, the Company is committed to reducing its overall operational GHG footprint - Scope 1 or direct emissions and Scope 2 or indirect emissions from energy purchase.\n\nThe O2C Net Zero plan is anchored on six key strategic initiatives, which are as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nImproving energy efficiency\n\nEnergy transition to clean and green renewable energy from fossil fuels\n\nRepurposing of petcoke gasification streams to utilise syngas for producing chemicals and hydrogen\n\nProducing syngas on a renewable basis through biomass gasification\n\nUsing Carbon Dioxide (CO2) as a recyclable resource and adopting Carbon Capture Utilisation and Sequestration (CCUS) pathways such as but not limited to synthetic fuels and chemicals, mineral carbonation in construction materials, algae cultivation for biofuels and food supplements, and other technology-led solutions\n\nGenerating carbon credits and using them to offset hard-toabate emissions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Company is already accelerating its progress through resource efficiency and energy conservation. As the business evolves towards its Net Zero target, digitalisation is one factor that enables the ecosystem. Reliance is using its global collaboration to help establish the feasibility and successful deployment of CCUS.\n\nThe Company's initiatives will contribute towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) to combat climate change, ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns, and ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.\n\n## Reliance's Approach\n\nReliance is on the path of transformation to move its legacy businesses to Net Zero operations and improve it further with the best Corporate Governance and sustainability systems.\n\nThe Company has already enlisted eight global technocrats, many of whom are advisers to governments worldwide, as part of a nine member New Energy Council. This Council will be vital in leading an accelerated transition and providing futuristic solutions to practical problems that may arise along the way.\n\nReliance's approach is to create a New Energy ecosystem, transition to clean energy and convert clean energy to Green Chemicals.",

In line with the TCFD risk methodology, it takes into cognisance climate-related risks that may hamper the Company's growth. It has instituted steps to hedge such identified risks using proper lines of control.\n\n## Governance\n\nGovernance is one of the most vital components of a company's climate risk framework. This pillar covers the Governance framework, roles, responsibilities, and decisionmaking procedures by which a company adheres to its climaterelated commitments. Reliance has a robust Governance structure to identify and mitigate climaterelated risks and opportunities. The Company's material issues that may impact climate change are assessed at regular intervals. The Governance structure followed at Reliance to oversee climate change risk mitigation includes:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe HSE Committee has broad oversight on climate-related governance. The/uni00A0HSE Committee, CSR & Governance and the Risk Management Committee oversees Company's ESG initiatives.\n\n## Strategy\n\nReliance conducts a deep analysis of the climate-related nuances of all its businesses to formulate critical strategic advantages and competitive strengths of each segment. The structured materiality assessment process also helps determine issues vital to individual business units and Reliance. The Company has outlined its way to decarbonise in Reliance's Net Zero Strategy.\n\nA detailed discussion on the Company's New Energy Business to achieve Net Zero by 2035 is provided in the MD&A section of this report.\n\n## Risk and Opportunities\n\nClimate-related risks pose threats that have financial implications for organisations, such as direct damage to assets and indirect impacts on the supply chain. Reliance identifies such risks at the Corporate and site levels through integrated work processes and group-wide risk management. It applies an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework\n\nusing top-down and bottom-up approaches to anticipate any issues and mitigate their impacts in advance. Climate-related risk management initiatives are analysed through the lens of physical and transition risks. To facilitate continuous and real-time risk assessment,\n\nReliance has implemented a 'Three Lines of Defense' model that encapsulates:\n\n- \u00b7 First line of defense by Business/ Process managers through Self-verification\n- \u00b7 Second line of defense by the Risk Management team through Functional Assurance\n- \u00b7 Third line of defense by the Internal Audit and Management Assurance Function offering Independent Assurance\n\nReliance's business operations face risks from natural calamities due to the vast spread of its operational locations. Natural calamities which are largely resultant of climate change are being manifested in terms of heat waves, erratic rainfall, cyclones, floods, and drought.\n\nThe Company has created Global Corporate Security (GCS). It is a dedicated and distinct function that focuses on adopting pre-emptive, de-risking strategies to safeguard and secure the Company from disasters, natural calamities, and any other disruptions or incidents as a part of business continuity management. GCS ensures that the people, assets, and operations of Reliance are secure.\n\nTo combat climate change, Reliance has embarked on an ambitious journey to transition to new, green, and clean energy. However, this transition to a lower carbon economy brings its own set of risks which include dynamic policy, legal, regulatory, technology and market developments and changes to facilitate this transition.\n\nReliance sees a significant opportunity in hydrogen and alternate energy. Details on the Company's energy transition plan is provided in the Natural Capital section and the details on creating a green energy ecosystem is in the New Energy section.\n\n## Metrics and Targets\n\nThe disclosure on Metrics provides information on how the Company is progressing towards targeted climate-related indicators. These are the mechanisms for measuring and disclosing the progress in line with the commitments or ambitions set for managing and mitigating the impact of climate-related risks. Reliance consistently discloses its metrics, goals, and progress against them in its Annual Integrated Report.\n\nReliance's assured climate-related parameters and performance metrics can be found in the section on Natural Capital on PG 168-175 of this report.",

The Company consistently works towards creating a long-term value for all its stakeholders by responding to their needs and expectations.\n\nMateriality is principle that determines which topics or issues directly or indirectly impact an organisation's ability to create value for all stakeholders and stay competitive. The Company conducts in-depth materiality assessment at defined intervals to identify the topics that are pertinent to its business and stakeholders. At Reliance, materiality assessment entails finding and evaluating a wide range of potential economic, environmental, and social issues that could impact the Company's performance and its stakeholders and then prioritising them into important material topics.\n\n## Approach towards Materiality\n\nReliance operates in dynamic environments, and the assessment of material topics is an ongoing process that helps the Company in prioritising the topics depending on its criticality. Reliance conducted a materiality assessment for the listed entity during FY 2021-22. The selection of material topics involved identifying probable material issues considering international reporting standards and the priorities of peers. Subsequently, key internal and\n\nexternal stakeholders that have an impact and influence on Reliance were identified for the materiality assessment. Inputs of the identified stakeholders on the probable material issues were captured through relevant stakeholder engagement mechanisms. A detailed analysis of each probable material issue was undertaken, considering the inputs of stakeholders and management. Further, the material topics were prioritised considering both management and stakeholder perspectives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Methodology\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Peer Benchmarking\n\nIdentified a list of industry peers as well as international standards viz.

Re-usable totes and crates are used to a large extent to reduce generation of packaging wastage. Supplier cartons are re-used where possible. Reliance Retail's vision is to move towards 100% paperless operations at its facilities. Reliance Jewels uses carry bags and envelopes made with recycled paper at its stores.\n\n## Towards Circularity\n\nTo grow responsibly in magnitude and scale while satisfying all stakeholders expectations lie at the core of Reliance's operation. The Company recognises the need to move to a low-carbon economy. It takes proactive initiatives to accelerate the change and has enhanced its internal governance framework to minimise and mitigate risk. Reliance is working on a multipronged approach covering various aspects of the circular economy through a cradleto-cradle approach. It has identified short, medium and long term strategies to accelerate the progress of circularity for plastics. In the short term, the focus is on increasing the Company's PET recycling footprint and usage of Multi-layered Plastics (MLP) for road construction. In the medium term, it is focusing on polyolefin recycling. In the long term, the Company is looking at chemical\n\nrecycling alternatives such as Waste to Oil (W2O) and Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL), among others.\n\nReliance supports projects that encourage circularity, such as the development of the R|ELAN TM fabric, in recognition of the growing consumer preference for environmentallyfriendly products. The Company is also developing commercial scale continuous catalytic pyrolysis technology. The process has been successfully demonstrated as a pilot delivering promising results to convert unsegregated mixed waste plastics into Pyrolysis Oil. These products have significant scope in accelerating global circularity.\n\nReliance Retail's packaging is based on the core principle of a Sustainable Circular Economy. The 3Rs for Retail business stands for:\n\nReduce: Reduction of usage of packaging material and packaging material waste.\n\nReuse: Multi-use packaging instead of single-use/ single time packaging.\n\nRecycle: Converting waste packaging into materials for new packaging items.\n\n## Packaging Design Approach Targeted for Sustainable Packaging\n\nFor Reliance's brand Hamleys, the plush toys developed out of India are made of 100% sustainable fibre sourced from the Company.\n\n30% (~54K units) of Hamley's e-commerce orders are fulfilled by Reliance's re-useable gamified, up cycled packaging.\n\n<!-- image -->",

With Reliance's philosophy to reduce freshwater dependence, the Company has commissioned state-of-the-art technologies to reduce specific freshwater consumption, maximise recyclability and minimise external discharge. The world-class desalination unit at Jamnagar provides strategic advantage in terms of water management.\n\nReliance continues to focus on maximising wastewater recyclability and reusability of treated water. The treated effluent is reused in cooling towers, horticulture activities and firewater networks. Rainwater harvesting capacities are being augmented to 3,17,669 kL across RIL. All the manufacturing divisions have water efficient faucets and reuse treated wastewater for domestic purposes.\n\nReliance Retail in FY 2021-22 has made significant Investments in automation to improve operational efficiency and productivity in its quest to reduce overall water consumption. The Company has employed mechanised crate washers at fruits and vegetable processing centres that have reduced the consumption of water.\n\nIn FY 2021-22, the total water withdrawn for RIL stands at 224.19/uni00A0million kilolitre out of which 32.94 million kilolitre was discharged and 103.54 million kilolitre was recycled. Additionally, the E&P vertical reported on 5.25 million kilolitre of produced water.\n\n## RIL'S WATER CONSUMPTION BY SOURCE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroundwater\n\n- Surface water\n- Rain water\n\nSeawater\n\nDesalination\n\n- Third Party Water\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n0.03\n\n## Way Forward\n\nReliance is going through a transformative phase. With its commitment to be Net Zero by 2035, it is investing heavily across all the levers of decarbonisation and changing its business which previously was heavily dependent on fossil fuels to new avenues of energy. The Company has planned significant investments in the next decade and will work along with strategic collaborators/partners to help India and the world transition to clean and green/uni00A0energy.",

The HSE Policy is enabled by the Operating Management System (OMS). The OMS is a framework to deliver and sustain conformance to the essentials at all times and achieve excellence in operating activities and processes. The OMS provides a systematic approach to consistently reduce Health, Safety, Security, and Environment (HSSE) risks in operating activities. Risk management is at the heart of the OMS and implementation of a standardised Risk Management process has brought enhanced risk understanding down to the asset facing personnel who understand and manage operating risk on a real time basis.\n\nThe governance of OMS is entrusted to a fully equipped and well-qualified HSE and Process Safety organisation embedded within the operating entities. A Safety & Operational Risk function has been put in place at the corporate level to bring in technical expertise and to provide independent assurance. This function facilitates aligning the requirements of OMS with global and national standards such as OSHA, API, PESO, PNGRB, OISD and NFPA.\n\nThe Company implemented a three lines of defense approach to have an independent view of OMS implementation requirements in the operating and maintenance activities.\n\nThe principles set out in OMS have been imbibed in operations and are helping to achieve safe, compliant and reliable operations. The OMS framework is based on the principle of continual improvement. Systems and processes have been put in place to analyse incidents and implement learnings to further improve the operations from safety and reliability point of view.\n\n| Safety Parameters  (FY 2021-22)                           |   RIL |   Retail |   Jio |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------|----------|-------|\n| Lost Time Injury                                          | 35    |    49    |  5    |\n| Lost Time Injury   Frequency Rate (per million man-hours) |  0.13 |     0.06 |  0.07 |\n\nIn Malaysia, there were 46 injuries and the LTIFR was 4.73 per million manhours.

These are spaces where employees can lean on each other and provide mutual support when facing stress and anxiety. In addition, the programme helps develop well-being champions who can act as listening posts and support employees without prejudice and judgement.\n\nSeveral unique initiatives under R-Swasthya were rolled out for the employees and their families during the year. Over 15,000 employees and families attended about 60 webinars. Additionally, engagements on mental wellness, education and awareness, physical health, financial planning, mindfulness, and others were organised throughout the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A 21 Day Campaign to Mark International Day of Happiness\n\nThe Company launched a 21-day campaign on the International Day of Happiness for the Reliance Family. The campaign was curated to encourage employees and their families to develop healthy habits focusing on mental, physical, financial, social, and spiritual wellness. More than 2000 employees joined this initiative, where a new activity was shared every day and participants were encouraged to socialise and share the learnings of their experience with others through various platforms.\n\nReliance Retail has implemented measures to provide a safe and healthy workplace and access to benefits. With the onset of the pandemic, the Company moved to a remote working environment and offered employees with benefits of location flexibility, extended maternity leaves, guidance on accessing doctors on the Reliance network and coordination for hospitalisation and medicines among many other initiatives. It extended its well-being benefits to all employees to ensure their physical and mental well-being. As part of this, several webinars were conducted for employees on Empathy, Physical well-being, Mental health and Behavioural and Mental adjustments to remote working models. Structured communication around vaccination ensured eligible employees register themselves and their family members for vaccinations through the government app - CoWIN or Aarogya Setu as applicable and follow the mandated process.\n\nIn FY 2021-22, key initiatives undertaken to promote health and well-being across the Company included:\n\n- \u00b7  Providing psychological and financial support through emergency assistance or additional insurance coverage on a case-to-case basis\n- \u00b7  Scaling internal counselling capabilities with external partners, giving employees time offs and breaks for mental wellbeing and self-care\n- \u00b7  Setting up adequate IT infrastructure support to enable employees to work-fromhome efficiently\n- \u00b7  Launch of 'Project Sakhi' shaped by three key pillars - Women Safety and Hygiene, 24*7 Outreach and Career Progression to reinforce safety, hygiene and well-being of women store employees\n\n- \u00b7  One tap 'StreeShakti' WhatsApp group created for the safety and well-being of women employees at the stores through which updates are shared on the group regularly\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion\n\nReliance's philosophy of 'We/uni00A0Care' has helped it draw talent who not only bring expertise and experience to the Company but also have shared values. It takes pride in its diverse workforce that transcends nationalities, cultures, genders, abilities, generations, and experiences.\n\nReliance strives to build a conducive environment where each employee has the chance to participate, contribute and grow while tapping its rich and diversified human capital to realise its aspirations and build a long-term competitive edge.

        "page_content": "## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nReliance Retail has adopted a topdown approach to demonstrate the spirit of inclusion & diversity. As a starting point, more than 200 senior leaders have been sensitised on 'Unconscious Biases', which often serve as impediments to building an inclusive workplace. Reliance Retail has implemented two significant flagship programmes, 'Jagriti' and 'Pragati', to enable women employees to grow to managerial roles at stores. These programmes are designed to empower women employees to overcome their mental barriers and inhibitions and generate belief in their abilities to become managers and successfully lead stores and teams. Select women employees were put through various training programmes and promoted as store and department managers to encourage more women to take on leadership roles and boost gender diversity. Currently, there are over 370 stores led by women managers, of which the Grocery business has 204 womenled stores, followed by Trends with 76. There has been a perceptible and definitive improvement in hygiene, discipline and working conditions at these stores.\n\nReliance Retail has gone a step further. Its 'Sahakari Bhandar' has employed close to 100 differentlyabled boys and girls under the programme 'Saksham', transforming their lives right from training to employment and then engagement. There are exclusive rewards & recognition programmes designed for them at the workplace as well as cultural activities to ensure their continued engagement.\n\n## ' HerCircle'\n\nA first-of-its-kind digital networking platform launched by Smt.

The initiative focuses on gender specific needs and challenges; and through a set of development interventions aims at addressing the specific personal life stages and career stage needs of women employees in partnership with all the stakeholders.\n\nImpact: The programme reached out to nearly 5,000 employees resulting in a allyship in the organisation with an increased awareness on inclusion, equality, equity and diversity.\n\n## Talent Management\n\nOnboarding the right talent and investing in their growth is key to Reliance's people strategy. The Company seeks out and develops high-potential employees, providing them with accelerated learning and development opportunities.\n\nTalent Development has always remained a key enabler for achieving business and talent outcomes. The Company focuses on four key areas to promote the culture of continuous improvement and development among the employees.\n\nFour key focus areas of Reliance:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBuilding Future Readiness and Talent Sustainability\n\nBuilding Leaders of Tomorrow\n\nNurturing Young Talent\n\nFostering Talent in the Virtual Ecosystem\n\n## Building future readiness and talent sustainability\n\nReliance aspires to be a global leader in the energy and materials space, sustaining the leadership position of O2C, and achieving Net Zero.

Upskilling for new-age technologies, power skills and domain knowledge\n\nDuring the year, the Company launched several deep skilling initiatives to develop and strengthen digital and data skills of its employees both at an organisation level as well as for specific focus groups.

The learning strategy has been defined as per the role-based employee lifecycle from new role readiness programmes to next role readiness programmes.\n\nThe objective for defining a structured capability development strategy is two-fold:\n\n- \u00b7  Encourage people's productivity by creating a sustainable learning environment within the organisation.\n- \u00b7  Enable employees to learn the knowledge and skill they need to excel in their position using digital tools and technology.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nApproach: The Petchem Academy launched a monthly initiative 'Story Sutra' to cover a business story by employees.

The Company recognises that it can play a fundamental role in providing skill building opportunities to the young or unskilled workforce. Reliance takes immense pride in developing skillsets relevant for India and Indians in evolving economic models. This is reflected in the 2.2+ Crore person-hours of training imparted during the reporting year. The Company has a substantial workforce that is under the age of 30 (representing 55.2%), and in the consumer facing businesses the Company also provides job opportunities to the employees in the Non-Supervisory category (over 50% as shown in the graphs below). Nonetheless, there are factors which contribute to separations and the Company recognises that these are inevitable and monitors them as an important matrix for employee retention.\n\nFor RIL, the most common reasons for the voluntary separations have been identified as - diverse career advancement opportunities available in the market, pursuing higher education, and relocating to areas closer to home.\n\nIn the digital services business voluntary separations was primarily driven by specific frontline non-supervisory roles pertaining to sales and service.\n\nRetail employs a young staff, typically in the twenties. With reopening of the economy, multiple opportunities opened up for young employees, enabling them to explore new sectors and workforce models. Retail implemented significant engagement programs to secure critical talent. Retail's people practices have allowed it to get certified by the Great Place to Work Institute as one of the Top 100 Best Workplaces in the country.\n\n## Employees by Skill Breakdown\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLeader\n\nManager\n\nExecutive\n\nTrainee\n\nApprentice\n\n- Non-Supervisory\n\nJIO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSr. Leader\n\nLeader\n\nManager\n\nSupervisory\n\nNon-Supervisory\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nManagement\n\nReview\n\n## Grooming Future Leaders\n\n'Spectrum' , Reliance Hydrocarbons' annual dedication to the Company's culture of continuous and holistic development, ran its 6 th edition on the theme of 'Learning Unlimited'.

The Company's Board level Human Resources, Nomination and Remuneration Committee periodically reviews and evaluates overall human resources and associated policies from time to time. Further, the decisions relating to the employee Code of Conduct are monitored through Ethics and Compliance Task Force (ECTF), which consists of an Executive Director, General Counsel, Group Controller, and Group Company Secretary. This Task Force evaluates incidents of suspected or actual violations of the Code of Conduct and reports them to the Audit Committee every quarter. In addition to this, Reliance\n\nhas mandatory e-learning courses, which aim to equip its employees with the required understanding and knowledge to effectively conduct its business in an ethical manner and prevent, identify, and respond to violations.\n\n## Grievance redressal mechanism\n\nTo deal with concerns of ethics, non-compliance, and violations of its Code of Conduct, Reliance has established a vigil mechanism and a whistle blower policy for its employees and directors. The whistle-blower can make a protected disclosure through an e-mail or dedicated telephone line or a letter to the ECTF or to the Chairman of the Audit Committee.

The IP governance framework helps in meeting all compliance requirements in areas such as confidential information management, third party engagement management, regulatory requirements across the globe, among others.\n\nReliance has implemented various digital initiatives to support its R&D efforts. The R&D team has adopted a benchmarked Intellectual Property management system that provides enterprise-wide end-to-end workflow management, streamlining and automating various portfolio\n\nmanagement processes. This system also acts as a centralised repository of various intellectual properties. The Company's R&D has implemented best-in-class Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) which is seamlessly integrated with the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). The ELN application provides scientists with a robust platform to capture and store structured and unstructured data as they conduct experiments or execute laboratory procedures. ELN user interface is flexible and can be tailored by creating experiment templates that allow the scientist to easily enter information and directly capture results from analytical instruments and barcode systems for sample lifecycle management.\n\n## Leveraging its Intellectual Capital to Fight COVID-19\n\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 disrupted every economy worldwide and tested human vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, governments and businesses left no stone unturned to minimise the impact of COVID-19 on health and the economy. Reliance, a responsible organisation, leveraged its intellectual capital to contribute to the country's fight against COVID-19.\n\nReliance's scientists analysed more than 1,000 genomes of the virus. The knowledge base was used to develop novel cost-effective diagnostic kits called 'R-Green' and 'R-Green pro one'. These kits have received ICMR approval and showed a high degree of accuracy and specificity during validation studies. Reliance has also collaborated with IIIM-CSIR (Jammu) to develop an RT-LAMP Kit to facilitate the point-of-care diagnosis of COVID-19.\n\nThe R&D team actively contributes to the Company's technical wisdom to facilitate innovation globally by publishing research articles on diagnostics and treatment.

The paper is listed in WHO's global repository. The flow-virometry-based method proposed by Reliance for roboticsbased high-throughput sample testing has received accolades from international communities, such as the Future Virology journal.\n\nPSA based oxygen concentrators can produce oxygen with 93% (+- 3%) purity. The unit is an excellent solution during hospitalisation situation due to COVID-19 to maintain the SpO2 level of a patient. Reliance R&D has designed oxygen generator with a purity of 90% to 95% with 5 LPM oxygen leveraging its expertise in adsorption technology. As adsorbents contribute significantly to the cost of the PSA unit, the Company's R&D team is working extensively for in-house adsorbent development for oxygen PSA systems.\n\n## R&D Focus Areas\n\n## Bio-innovations\n\nReliance recognises that advancements in biological science could transform economies and societies to tackle climate change issue. At Reliance, the core biology stream was integrated with digital sciences and engineering for\n\ndevelopment of Next-Gen tools and eco-friendly technologies for a safe and healthy planet.\n\nReliance's synthetic biology platform aims for innovation-led growth via hybridising competencies developed in genetic engineering, photosynthesis, omics, big-data analytics and robotics. The platform has helped improve productivity outcomes for novel products and create new business opportunities in food, personal care and nextgeneration biomaterials. Reliance demonstrated robust and scalable year-round outdoor algal cultivation continuously for more than four years.\n\nReliance has successfully demonstrated the application of algae biomass for food and feed application in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. It has also initiated work to commercialise super protein powder from algae for various Indian and global snacks, health drinks, and texturised meat substitutes. Algal biomass produced in a sustainable way using seawater, sunlight, and CO2 was harvested and processed to develop a rich and appropriate source of highly nutritious food and feed ingredients. The ingredients have successfully replaced the prevalent and environmentally regressive fish meal ingredient from various applications.\n\nReliance has also developed Microbial cell factories for fermentation production of one of the strongest biomaterials such as Spider Silk for advanced fabric and personal care application. Collaboration with some of the leading personal care brands is ongoing for developing unique skin and hair care formulations using this recombinant spider silk.\n\nThe Company also leverages advanced analytical science to fasttrack innovation in biology. 'Digital tongue' is an algorithm for prediction of taste of the proteins and proving enzyme-system to bias taste of food towards customer's requirement. Several ML (Machine Language) tools were developed and used in computational biology platforms to fabricate DNA to make novel products from microbial cell factories.\n\nThe CRISPR platform demonstrated genome alteration of algae and cyanobacteria using programmable nucleases. The R&D team is working relentlessly for developing molecular tools and applications of the technology for agricultural and synthetic biology product development.\n\nThe team is applying this technology for higher algal biomass and novel product development in crops that conventional methods cannot produce. The Company aims to use this path breaking technology to solve significant challenges.\n\nCoal which cannot be mined and, if not redeemed for its value in the form of methane production, would be a waste of natural resources. Reliance's Bio CBM process is targeted at converting coal that cannot be mined to methane, which will help improve the country's energy security and even help reduce GHG emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Circular Economy\n\nThe single use plastic in food packaging and consumer goods mostly ends up in landfills. Reliance recognises the negative impact of single use plastic on the environment. Reliance is exploring sustainable solutions to reuse plastic waste to promote and adopt a circular economy to tackle this menace. The Company's R&D team and the Sustainability Solutions team in the Reliance-Petchem business have launched ReRoute TM , the only product of its kind in the market today that can be used to make bituminous concrete road surfacing using the 'dry mix' process.\n\nThe R&D team also developed net bags and bag on roll applications using biodegradable plastic. These have been tested at Reliance Retail stores. The materials showed excellent properties required for flexible as well as rigid packaging. Innovations in biodegradable plastic technology have also moved from bench scale to pilot scale development.\n\nReliance's low temperature continuous catalytic pyrolysis technology can convert plastic waste containing multi-layer film polymers into stable oil. The technology does not require any feed segregation or clean up. Additionally, this novel process gives a higher yield and enhanced stability. The produced stable oil can be readily processed in a refinery or petrochemical units such as FCC, Coker, Steam cracker, etc.\n\nReliance uses RCAT HTL technology to produce biofuel using various organic feedstock wastes to derive value from the waste. Produced biofuel can be utilised for heat and power applications or as a transportation fuel. Biofuel generated using the technology has been successfully tested in commercial engines, and the technology is ready for commercialisation. The technology has the potential to significantly contribute to the Company's Net Zero goal by achieving a 25% blend in its refining capacity.\n\nDiscarded PET based fabrics have a detrimental impact on the environment. As an essential step towards a circular economy and addressing the challenge of discarded PET based fabrics, the Company's R&D is targeting to separate PET from mixed fabric blends and convert it back to fibers and into fabric. The R&D team has also developed a process to recycle waste tyres and is exploring ways to convert waste recyclable polyester material into valuable chemicals to make polyurethane with improved physical properties. The team developed a bench process using a Reliance proprietary solvent to separate different layers of polymer. Separate layers can be recycled as per their different functionalities and processability.\n\nEarlier, a benign process was used to recover high-value metals, vanadium and nickel, from petcoke cinder, which is a leftover by the product from entrained flow gasifiers. Hydro process demands a large quantity of acid or alkali for leaching, and pyro process involves very high temperature (> 1,700 O C). The R&D team has developed a hybrid process where salt roasting at low temperature, followed by hydrometallurgical processing steps, leads to the extraction of vanadium and nickel at a significantly lower cost than the conventional process. R&D team is also pursuing various national and international collaborative projects to utilise CO2.\n\n## Chemical Recycling of Multilayer Packaging Material\n\nApproach: The Polymer R&D team developed a novel process using in-house developed chemical 'RESOLVE' for separation of polymer layers in multilayer packaging. The process is a simple two-step approach using 'RELSOLVE' separating medium and it avoids the complex multistep process involving various solvents and antisolvents for the recovery of the polymer layers.\n\nImpact: The process helps in recovering the polymer layer in pure form without dissolution.",

        "page_content": "## INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL\n\n## Industry and Infrastructure\n\nReliance has its pulse on evolving consumer needs, and it leverages its intellectual capital to develop novel solutions for industry and infrastructure use. Following are the key initiatives undertaken by the R&D team:\n\n- \u00b7  R&D team has developed a novel functional emulsion based SBR rubber. Reactive silica composite prepared from this reactive product has low rolling resistance and excellent abrasion properties.\n- \u00b7  Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) is generally processed with a higher quantity of external plasticisers to make it more flexible and processable. However, this flexible PVC polymer has poor leaching properties. Reliance has developed internally plasticisedPVC (IP-PVC), which does not need external plasticisers. Additionally, IP-PVC does not lose its inherent properties of flexibility and neither does it leach any plasticiser into the environment.\n- \u00b7  R&D team has developed quick and visible methods for identification of industrial popcorn samples from normal elastomer/polymer samples, thereby, enhancing the safety quotient of the elastomers or polymer processes.\n- \u00b7  R&D team has developed a novel polymer, disentangled high molecular weight polyethylene (DPE), for lightweight helmets, cutresistant gloves.\n- \u00b7  The chlorination of PVC produces chlorinated Polyvinyl Chloride (CPVC). UV-light meditated photochlorination of PVC to CPVC is a common industrial practice to produce CPVC resin. Reliance has developed in-house visible light mediated photochlorination by replacing hazardous UV light. The CPVC has improved resin properties than the commercially available option.\n\n- \u00b7  R&D team has developed an innovative, green, and commercially viable process to produce selective infrared transmitting polymeric materials. The NIR-transmitting material is produced through solid-state reactive processing and is cheaper, non-toxic, air and moisture stable with the added advantage of the flexibility to mould into the desired shape.\n- \u00b7  R&D team is developing technologies to make lowcost carbon fibers using various raw materials.\n- \u00b7  There is a growing demand for novel solutions that provide protection to process and structural components from corrosive environment. R&D team has developed thermoset composite solutions that can be coated on surfaces to provide adequate protection from mild to the harsh corrosive environments.\n\n## A/uniFB00ordable and Clean Energy\n\nReliance believes that climate change presents an opportunity to create a healthier, happier, and sustainable planet. Affordable and clean energy options will realise this opportunity for humanity. The R&D team has been operating a large pilot facility near Jamnagar, where it converts sunlight, CO2 and seawater to renewable bio-crude. The ponds have been operating continuously without any failure for more than four years. No other organisation in the world has been able to cultivate algae without crashes and significant downtime. Reliance has developed all the technology components which will be instrumental in converting CO2 to useful products to combat climate change.\n\nThe Company has also developed a catalytic gasification technology that can convert a variety of carbonaceous feedstocks like petcoke, coal, biomass, etc. into hydrogen and syngas.\n\nThe novel catalytic process can be used to convert challenging feedstocks like high-ash Indian coal and agricultural residue into hydrogen or syngas. The Company has successfully completed plant testing of the technology with different agricultural residues and high-ash Indian coal, and 10 TPD plant capacity is being worked out.\n\nA high temperature-polymer electrolyte membrane (HT-PEM) fuel cell system has been built and is presently being tested on simulated Reliance-Jio towers. In coming years renewable hydrogen will supply fuel cells to produce in-situ hydrogen.\n\n## Oil to Chemicals (O2C)\n\nFossil fuels like gasoline and diesel have a high carbon footprint impacting the environment. Having committed to a Net Zero target by 2035, Reliance strives to explore innovative options to adopt sustainable practices. Reliance's Multizone Catalytic Cracking (MCC) is an in-house disruptive innovation to generate chemical building blocks for speciality materials from refinery streams or whole crude instead of fuels. The MCC is a vital technology enabler that will help in Jamnagar's O2C transformation. The 3KBPSD MCC demo plant is in the advanced design stage and has been constructed for a demonstration before building a full-scale commercial plant.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA/uni00A0unique technology has also been developed to separate the aromatics BTX component from olefinic MCC gasoline and recycle the raffinate stream to MCC riser for maximising petrochemicals production.\n\n## Refining and Petrochemicals\n\nReliance has developed a highcapacity sodium removal adsorbent and a process to remove trace amounts of sodium from disulphide oil (DSO). This solution has been commercialised at Jamnagar. The treated DSO is being utilised in Reliance's Refinery Off-Gas Cracker (ROGC) unit replacing imported costly additive, Dimethyl disulphide (DMDS). A facility is also being developed at the JMD to transport the product to Reliance's other petrochemical sites to use them in-stream crackers.\n\nThe R&D team has developed an in-house RELOX (Reliance Oxidation) catalyst for the purification of nitrogen gas streams. The RELOX catalyst purifies nitrogen gas streams containing hydrocarbon impurities and is used in the nitrogen purification unit. The RELOX catalyst is being supplied to the PET HMD site, where production is in progress. The Company aims to use RELOX\n\ncatalyst in all PET plants for nitrogen gas purification.\n\nThermic fluids are predominantly used in high temperature process applications between 150 O C and 400 O/uni00A0 C. For the first time globally, the R&D team has developed an in-house novel adsorbent and a process for the online purification of thermic fluids. The technology has been commissioned at Dahej and Silvassa plants and is under commissioning in Hazira. Besides being superior to conventional techniques like distillation and alkali wash, this technology is environmentally friendly and cost effective.\n\nThe R&D team has developed REL-ORCAT, a proprietary catalytic technology, for olefins removal or BI reduction from aromatics rich hydrocarbon streams. The technology with its superior catalyst has the potential to replace conventionally used clay-based catalyst. The team has also developed an eco-friendly, single-step adsorptive process to purify recycling/waste MEG generated in polyester plants. Further, to maximise propylene yield, conversion and reduce the coke make, the team has developed a process for High Active FCC catalyst.\n\nBiodegradation is the most sustainable and economical way of industrial effluent treatment, as it leads to terminal conversion of organic pollutants into microbial biomass without leaving behind toxic residues. Once established, it's a self-regenerating system. Tailor made microbial consortia have been developed, scaled, and implemented for consistent chemical oxygen demand (COD) remediation at the polyester ETP plant at Patalganga Manufacturing Division (PMD). Similarly, a specialised microbial consortium has been implemented for COD reduction at Silvassa Manufacturing Division (SMD) for smooth and uninterrupted operations.\n\n## Climate action\n\nR&D team has developed a mixed oxide stable catalyst to convert methanol and CO2 to a high-value Di-methyl carbonate (DMC) product that can be used as a solvent and specialty chemical. The process and the catalyst have been scaled up to a pilot stage. The team has also developed a sorbent based circulating fluidised bed process for concentrating CO2 from dilute refinery and power plant flue gases. The process is protected by several patents.\n\nUnder RIL's flagship programme, Algae to Oil, the R&D team has developed a technology that utilises abundant sunlight, waste CO2 and sea water, to produce valuable products. This process has a huge potential to utilise atmospheric CO2 and convert it to a valuable green crude oil, thus reducing the carbon footprint to a significant extent and combating climate change. RIL has been operating a large pilot facility at Gagwa near Jamnagar.",

Although organisations have tried numerous ways to prevent phishing attacks, there is no full-proof solution. Therefore, employees become the last line of defence.\n\nSeveral organisations use Simulation based anti-phishing exercises as a method to educate employees. However, it only assesses an employee's susceptibility to phishing attacks which varies with every new simulation.\n\nTo address this, Reliance has developed a phishing simulation platform 'R-phish' to conduct antiphishing exercises on a periodic basis and to calculate the user awareness index 'Phishing Resistance Score (PRS)'. PRS, which is a function of multiple factors attributing to user awareness initiatives, determines user's resistance to identifying a phishing email.\n\nManagement\n\nReview\n\n## Way Forward\n\nReliance believes that innovation and technology will be key to its continuous growth.

Reliance has reached out to over 14.5 million people and empowered 50,600+ villages across India through various initiatives under the Rural Transformation Programme.\n\nDuring FY 2021-22, over 121 lakh m 3 of water harvesting capacity was created through the construction or upgradation of facilities such as earthen or masonry dams and check dams, agricultural ponds and open wells. As a result, over 5,600 hectares of land is estimated to get guaranteed irrigation for at least two agricultural seasons. Consequently, 364 villages now have better access to drinking water.\n\nFurthermore, Reliance is augmenting rural households' nutritious intake by promoting Reliance Nutrition Gardens (RNG), which are modest kitchen or backyard gardens.\n\nReliance aims to augment the lives of farmers, fishermen and women, livestock owners, and rural youth across the country by delivering critical information, thereby protecting livelihoods. Initiatives such as interactive awareness, broadcast dissemination services, and troubleshooting programmes assist the rural population living in hinterlands to stay informed. The initiative engages with over 1,000 knowledge partners, including research institutes, universities, specialist technical agencies, and grassroots organisations. Understandable and straightforward information in vernacular languages is circulated using numerous digital platforms such as voice messages, WhatsApp, Jiochat, and audiovideo conferencing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Improving Livelihoods through Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs)\n\n## Towards Water Security through Shramdaan\n\nReliance Foundation has undertaken various initiatives to support, promote, nurture, and incubate FPOs across the country.

This inspiring display of community participation has ensured ease of irrigation, benefiting 85 households in the village.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reliance Foundation's Impact Assessment for Water Interventions\n\nReliance Foundation's flagship programme of Bharat India Jodo (BIJ) has worked on water interventions for the past ten years. This initiative works with communities affected by variable rainfall, repeated droughts, dependency on rainfed agriculture, severe soil degradation, migration for manual work, lack of basic facilities and uncertain earnings. BIJ's initiatives are broadly based on four aspects: organising and capacitating the community, participatory budgeting, collaboration with Gram Panchayats and the Government for synergies and building community capacities for water resources, including critical support for water harvesting and management.\n\nThe capacities created through these activities have resulted in improved water availability for agriculture and household needs. Based on a study conducted, the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprogramme has demonstrated impact and contribution to the holistic development of the villages in the following ways:\n\n## For 89% of the farmers\n\nRain was no longer a primary source for irrigation\n\n## 79% of the farmers\n\nReported an increase in area under assured irrigation in the last five years\n\n## 54% of the farmers\n\nAdopted efficient irrigation techniques\n\n## 85% of the farmers\n\nCould crop their fields two or more times a year\n\n## More than 50% of the farmers\n\nCultivate three or more types of crops annually\n\n## 89% intervention village residents\n\nHave the primary source of water within 200m from their house\n\n## 75% intervention village residents\n\nReported reduction in the inconvenience caused to women in fetching water\n\n## Women Connect India Challenge\n\nReliance Foundation announced the Women Connect Challenge, a global call for solutions to improve women's participation in everyday life by meaningfully changing how they access and use technology. Ten organisations across India were chosen as grantees for the WomenConnect Challenge India, established by the Reliance Foundation and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The organisation's solutions encouraged women farmers, entrepreneurs, and members of Self-Help Groups to solve social and cultural hurdles and bridge the gender digital gap.

The camps educated participants on topics such as acceptable behaviour, effective communication, player scouting, and safeguarding youngsters from all types of abuse.\n\n## Disaster Response\n\nNatural catastrophes wreak havoc on human lives, livelihoods, and intensity wherever they strike. The impact is amplified in developing countries such as India, with inherent socio-economic inequities. Reliance Foundation aims to ease the suffering of those affected by such events.\n\nThe Foundation adopts a twopronged approach to respond to natural disasters. The programme provides early warning and advisory services to build community preparedness and ensures speedy response post disaster. Reliance Foundation strives to respond quickly to disasters by interacting directly with affected communities by leveraging its strengths - human resources and information technology.\n\nThrough Reliance Foundation, the Company extended support to communities impacted by cyclones -Tauktae, Yaas, Jawadand flood-affected communities in the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha, and Kerala by distributing dry ration kits, livestock shelters during FY 202122.

One notable activity is to assist students in appearing for entrance examinations of prestigious schools such as Navodaya and Sainik schools. The projects helped children keep up with studies through remedial classes run by volunteers in their villages during the lockdown.\n\nReliance's CSR team at Nagothane launched the Lakshya initiative to support students who cannot afford private coaching classes. The Lakshya initiative, started in 2015, prepares students from surrounding villages for competitive exams for securing jobs in services like the Police, Army, Navy, Railway, SSC, and Banking. It includes on-ground\n\ntraining provided by subject matter experts like security personnel, Reliance Foundation school teachers, counsellors and others. The preparatory platform trains students free of cost. The CSR team also aims to address the inferiority complex among rural students. They work with them to build their selfconfidence and help shape their careers. The team provides required guidance and encouragement to students to prepare them for jobs that can provide them with security, respect, and social standing in their communities.\n\nTo date, 114 students have enrolled in the training programme, of which 21 students (23.94%) have qualified for the competitive examinations conducted by the Government, with female candidates outnumbering the male candidates.\n\ncompleted by around 754 teachers and 126 non-teaching staff of 13 Reliance Foundation Schools on technology platforms.\n\nWith the goal of empowering India's brightest youth with the potential to lead India's technologically driven growth, the Reliance Foundation Scholarships were awarded to 76 students in August 2021, to full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Sciences.

Since then, the three family members, her mother, elder sister, and Sri, have tried extremely hard to make ends meet. Her mother, an educated lady, took it upon herself to earn for the family by tutoring local students. She wished to give her daughters a good education so that they could come out of this devastating situation and end their financial struggles.\n\nReliance Foundation stood firmly by their family. Her mother, Shipra, works as a Shiksha Mitra with the Foundation and prepares children for school entrance exams. Sri's elder sister secured admission in a Navodaya school and thereafter qualified for several higher education opportunities. She is presently pursuing a nursing course.\n\nBoth the daughters have earnestly worked and studied hard to end their mother's struggles and help her lead a comfortable life. Sri secured admission last year in Class 7 in the Beohari Navodaya Vidyalaya. Shipra's dream of giving her daughters a quality education has been fulfilled.

Reliance through the Foundation endeavours to ensure that the youth appreciate and connect with the country's rich heritage and arts. Reliance Foundation defines ways to protect and promote India's priceless heritage to sustain and make art and culture relevant to the younger generation. This rich art and cultural ethos runs across all of Reliance's businesses.\n\nReliance collaborated with pioneering designer Ritu Kumar and Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (RRVL) to charter a new, untried interpretation of India's crafts and textiles. It took the country's vibrant and diverse culture beyond existing ideas in couture and fashion. This was a novel step to preserve, nurture and celebrate India's art and textiles heritage.\n\n## Employee Volunteering & Social Change\n\nVolunteering is a significant enabler to express and share gratitude, essential for developing resilience in challenging times. At Reliance, volunteering has been a key lever for giving back to the communities. Reliance Foundation continued with the virtual mode of volunteering due to the pandemic. In FY 202122, volunteering was expanded to newer areas of engagement to address present and future challenges. The programmes were crafted and implemented to focus on harnessing skills of the immense people resources and their expertise available within the organisation. The objective of these programmes has been the holistic development of beneficiaries while concentrating on thematic areas of education and capacity building of social organisations. These programmes are congruent with the goals of Reliance Group of Industries and the UN SDGs.\n\nReliance Foundation continued to work extensively with two major beneficiary groups - children and youth. During FY 2021-22, the employee volunteering activities focused on building the capacities of staff members of social development organisations across India. The highlights of the year are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  This was the third consecutive year for the Month of Good Deeds, which encourages employees and their families to give back to the community by volunteering their time and skills. These sessions reached more than 4,400 children, youth, and NGOs from cities like Giridh and Koderma (Jharkhand), Rourkela, Rajpura, Alibaug and several metros.\n- \u00b7  Employees and their families from Jio Digital organised 30 virtual sessions on art and language skills in the second edition of the Jio Digital Monsoon Camp for more than 5,300 children from Jammu, Srinagar, Latur, Tuticorin, Erode and others.\n- \u00b7  Volunteers from the Learning and Development team from the Hydrocarbons and Retail divisions located across metros and Nagapattinam, Shillong, Warangal, Begusarai trained 1,000 staff members from NGOs on advanced excel, report writing, stakeholder management etc.\n- \u00b7  Virtual sessions on raising awareness on plastic and waste segregation were conducted by expert volunteers in partnership with the Indian Centre for Plastics in the Environment (ICPE). Over 3,800 children attended the sessions, including students from Reliance Foundation schools.\n\nNearly 21,000 lives have been touched due to the invaluable contribution of Reliance employees and their family members in FY 2021-22.\n\n## Sustainable Supply Chain Management\n\nReliance takes pride in diversified portfolio of businesses spread across Oil and Gas (O2C, E&P), Retail and Digital. The Company relies heavily on its excellence in supply chain management aided by efficient and robust systems and processes to run seamless operations and efficiently manage its vast pool of suppliers and partners.\n\n## Managing a Vibrant Supplier/uni00A0Network\n\nTo effectively deliver high -quality projects with stringent timelines, managing a substantial number of suppliers located across the globe is key to any company's success. Reliance ensures regular interface and interactions with its partners and vendors across various levels to address this need. All procurement and Contracting (P&C) activities for Exploration and Production (E&P) Division are primarily governed by contracts signed with the Government of India. E&P Project Development and Operations require highly specialised technical goods and services. Reliance is one of the very few vendors in the world that can cater to these technological and expertise requirements at exceedingly high precision and satisfactory levels.\n\nThrough its sustained investment in mega projects and operations, Reliance has contributed to developing India's chemicals and engineering supplier base. Supporting and encouraging its suppliers to indigenise, expand their capabilities and increase their economic value has always been the focus of the Company. Reliance has procured goods and services worth more than ' 23,800 crore from indigenous suppliers in FY 2021-22. The Company ensures a high quality of service by\n\nworking with its contractors to ensure that their employees are competent, and that work is carried out in a safe environment complying with statutory requirements. Some of these initiatives include :\n\n- \u00b7  Standardisation of PPEs for contract workers\n- \u00b7  Fair & transparent practices for statutory compliance\n- \u00b7  Contractor performance evaluation including Safety and Environment Performance\n- \u00b7  Trade & Safety test for all contract workers\n- \u00b7  Focus on safety practices and records during new contractor registration\n- \u00b7  Weekly visit of safety ambassadors to plants for improvement of contract worker safety\n- \u00b7  Training for field personnel on safe handling of hazardous chemicals\n\nReliance also ensured that COVID-19 vaccinations were made available for the Company's suppliers and their employees.\n\n## Sustainable Supply Chain Processes and Supplier Engagement\n\nReliance has developed systems and processes with years of expertise and experience to build and manage a sustainable and effective supply chain. Ongoing collaborations and partnerships have helped the Company maintain a long-term productive relationship with suppliers.\n\nThe sustainable sourcing ethos of Reliance focuses on eight parameters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGreen packaging\n\nEnvironment protection\n\nMake in India & developing India's engineering talent\n\nSupplier collaboration\n\nDigital enabling interaction with suppliers\n\nContract worker care\n\nCommunity support\n\nRegeneration/Safe disposal\n\nGreen packaging involves using recycled plastic or PET flakes, recycling plastic / wooden pallets used for domestic market, and optimising bag specifications to reduce material usage and palletisation to ensure safe handling and faster turnaround. The packaging design approach is based on the core principles of a sustainable circular economy of reduce, reuse, and recycle.\n\nEnvironment protection is ensured by the co-development of environmentally conscious and safe products with suppliers, like the development of Silicon spray using environment-friendly solvents during FY 2021-22. The Company also\n\nfocused on reducing paper use and its physical transfer through end-toend digital 'Procurement to Pay Cycle' processes and preference for digital invoices over paper invoices. Reliance received over 90% of the invoices from suppliers in digital format. The procurement decisions are also based on the energy efficiency of the products.\n\nReliance encouraged the development of India's engineering talent by replacing imported RE13 Spin Finish oil for PFY with indigenously developed Spin finish oil components developed in the Company's technical laboratories. Reliance uses Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) for select categories, long-term agreements with packaging suppliers, and conducts joint programmes with vendors and reduce system costs to ensure sustainable supplier collaborations.\n\nReliance has developed a query management system for supplier queries, vendor self-service facility for transaction-related queries, development of P&C helpdesk and 'Chatbot' for online, realtime feedback to suppliers. The Company has shown care towards its contract workers with multiple safety performance evaluations and defining PPE norms by work type. It ensures 100% compliance to the laws and regulations, including verification of contract worker wages payment.\n\nReliance extends support to the local community by encouraging its suppliers to source talent from 'near plant' communities. The Company is conscious about the regeneration and safe disposal of its waste. The total sale of e-waste including used oil and batteries, catalyst and plastic waste to the vendors is authorised by the Central and State Pollution Control Boards (CPCB/SPCB) for efficient and environmentally friendly recycling and disposal of that waste. Waste materials like wood, paper, metal, etc., are also recovered or recycled.",

The EOIs received are then evaluated based on parameters such as technical competence, past experiences, HSE performance, quality system and financial strength for shortlisting bidders in response to the issuance of Request for Proposal.\n\nThe Supplier Code of Conduct, developed by Reliance, forms the basis of the Company's relationship with its suppliers. Reliance's belief that its suppliers need to comply with Labour and Human rights, Health and Safety, Environmental Protection, Ethical Conduct, Business Integrity and Confidentiality Laws and Standards is reflected in its Supplier Code of Conduct. The Company facilitates a range of measures to comply with the prevalent AntiMoney Laundering, Anti-Bribery and Prevention of Corruption Act and the Supplier Code of Conduct. The compliance function and Ethics and Compliance Task Force (ECTF) have built a strong capability to undertake regulatory compliance checks, counterparty checks, real-time screening of any suspicious internal transactions, and investigations of reported incidents to curb any unlawful behaviour by its suppliers.\n\nAll suppliers are compliant with the Reliance Group Business Partner Code of Conduct (BPCOC). Reliance strictly adheres to all the procurement processes for the contracts signed with the Government of India.\n\nThird-party vendors are identified and evaluated based on their track record and capability of meeting the Company standards. Reliance is moving towards a per-piece/perpallet based contract from the costplus contracts to enable a significant cost advantage. The operational performance of these vendors, once onboarded, are continuously measured and monitored against defined parameters, and corrective actions demanded where necessary.\n\nSupplier engagement is an overly critical factor for Reliance, and the same is ensured during the procurement process through regular meetings / communication. Suppliers and Reliance work as Partners to achieve the laid down objectives of the Company.\n\n## Nurturing Digital Ecosystems\n\n## JioGenNext\n\nJioGenNext began with the leadership's vision of encouraging startups.

JioGenNext intends to use MAP to increase its value addition to entrepreneurs and develop win-win collaborations in the startup ecosystem.\n\n## Customer Satisfaction\n\nFor Reliance, customers are the key to a sustainable future. Winning their trust drives the Company to surpass consumer expectations continuously. Across all its businesses, Reliance aims to offer customers a diverse selection of options, an exceptional value proposition, high standards of quality, and an unrivalled experience. The Company continued to provide its millions of customers with highquality service across all business verticals throughout the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.\n\n## Customer Satisfaction Surveys\n\nUnderstanding consumer demands and responding to market realities are critical to the success of Reliance's businesses.

The focus is to simplify systems and processes, and train and empower people to deliver a faster resolution to customers. Human resources and scheduling restructuring for its Customer Action Centre have helped the Company respond to calls and emails from customers. The abandoned call percentage was always kept at less than one per cent, and no pendency to customers reaching out on email and social channels. Reliance Retail created a specialised team whose primary responsibility is to track orders placed online by customers and communicate with them to ensure that they are delivered and installed as efficiently as possible. The Company launched a Remote Technical Support (RTS) desk that\n\neliminates the need for repair engineers to travel to customer locations. Troubleshooting is done over the phone with videos and images, providing customers quick resolution to technical issues. RTS also helped pull off faster replacements, which reduced complaints by 20%. The Company empowered customers with various self-service initiatives including deploying cancellation feature on the app. It reduced complaints related to cancellations and refunds by 15%. As a result of supply bottlenecks during the year, imported spares were not readily available, adversely impacting repair service levels. Reliance Retail improved the repair Service Level Agreements (SLA) to 82% closure within three days and 94% closure within seven days by working closely with brands to prioritise ResQ customer repairs, increasing spares inventory levels and enabling quick supply to service centres.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SOCIAL AND RELATIONSHIP CAPITAL\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Elevating Customer Experience at Reliance Fashion and Lifestyle\n\nTo enhance customer experience at Reliance Fashion & Lifestyle offline outlets, the Company launched various targeted initiatives.

The aim was to ensure that each client was well-served. The results were reflected in an improved Net Promoter Score/uni00A0(NPS) of 21% absolute for Trends Small-town and 12% absolute for Trends, with a 63% increase in NPS feedback response rate.\n\nWithin the online store, an improvement in NPS of 7% was achieved through the launch of several customer focused initiatives and process improvements, such as aggressive promised delivery dates and adherence to the same, supply chain speed improvements across order journey by an average of one day, improved refund speed with 99% returns getting repaid at the door. To further enhance customer service on the platform, the Company has focused on reducing queue waiting time and increasing first-time solution percentage, improving NPS of customer interactions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Netmeds: Standing by customers through COVID-19\n\nNetmeds is an online pharmacy digital commerce platform managed and operated by Reliance Retail. Netmeds spread COVID-19 awareness through its app and through awareness camps at many Netmeds stores. Netmeds also created a new COVID-19 essentials category, with a wide assortment of products, in the app for customers to place orders easily. The Fulfillment Centre team went beyond its call of duty to deliver essential products to customers in times of crisis and fear when courier partners were not available to make the deliveries. Customers wholeheartedly appreciated this act of humanity and kindness, as evident through their testimonials. Netmeds has ensured exceptional customer delight led by its B2B sales force team that personally delivered medicines to pharmacies on multiple occasions, enabling timely availability to customers. Netmeds also supported its group companies by on-time delivery of Remdesivir, PPE kits and other COVID related medicines.\n\n## Data Privacy and Security\n\nReliance places tremendous importance on security and privacy in each of its businesses.

Statement on Company's Philosophy on Code of Governance\n- 2. Corporate Governance Structure, Policies and Practices\n- 3. Board of Directors\n- 4. Board Committees\n- 5. Framework for monitoring Subsidiary Companies\n- 6. General Body Meetings\n- 7. Means of Communication\n- 8. General Shareholder Information\n- 9. Other Disclosures\n\n## Statement on Company's Philosophy on Code of Governance\n\nCorporate Governance encompasses a set of systems and practices to ensure that the Company's affairs are being managed in a manner which ensures accountability, transparency and fairness in all transactions in the widest sense. The objective is to meet stakeholders' aspirations and societal expectations. Good governance practices stem from the dynamic culture and positive mindset of the organisation. We are committed to meet the aspirations of all our stakeholders. This is demonstrated in shareholder returns, high credit ratings, awards and recognitions, governance processes and an entrepreneurial performance focussed work environment. Additionally, our customers have been benefited from high quality products delivered at extremely competitive prices.\n\nThe essence of Corporate Governance lies in promoting and maintaining integrity, transparency and accountability in the management's higher echelons. The demands of Corporate Governance require professionals to raise their competence and capability levels to meet the expectations in managing the enterprise and its resources effectively with the highest standards of ethics. It has thus become crucial to foster and sustain a culture that integrates all components of good governance by carefully balancing the inter-relationship among the Board of Directors, Board Committees, Finance, Compliance & Assurance teams, Auditors and the Senior Management. Our employee satisfaction is reflected in the stability of senior management, ability to attract talent across various levels and substantially higher productivity. Above all, we feel honoured to be integral to India's social development. Details of several such initiatives are available in the Report on Corporate Social Responsibility.\n\nAt RIL, Corporate Governance is all about maintaining a valuable relationship and trust with all the stakeholders. We consider stakeholders as partners in our success and\n\nremain committed to maximising stakeholders' value, be it Customers, Local Communities, Employees, Suppliers & Distributors, Trade Unions, NGOs, Investors & Shareholders and Government & Regulatory Authorities. This approach to value creation emanates from RIL's belief that sound governance system, based on relationship and trust, is integral to creating enduring value for all. We have a defined policy framework for ethical conduct of businesses. We believe that any business conduct can be ethical only when it rests on the six core values viz. Customer Value, Ownership Mindset, Respect, Integrity, One Team and Excellence.\n\nAt RIL, we believe that as we move closer towards our aspirations of being a global corporation, our Corporate Governance standards must be globally benchmarked. Therefore, we have institutionalised the right building blocks for future growth. The building blocks will ensure that we achieve our ambition in a prudent and sustainable manner. RIL not only adheres to the prescribed Corporate Governance practices as per the Listing Regulations, but is also committed to sound Corporate Governance principles and practices. It constantly strives to adopt emerging best practices being followed worldwide. It is our endeavour to achieve higher standards and provide oversight and guidance to the management in strategy implementation, risk management and fulfilment of stated goals and objectives.\n\nOver the years, we have strengthened governance practices. These practices define the way how business is conducted and value is generated. Stakeholders' interests are taken into account before making any business decision. RIL has the distinction of consistently rewarding its shareholders for over four eventful decades from Initial Public Offer (IPO). Since then, RIL has moved from one big idea to another and these milestones continue to fuel its relentless pursuit of ever-higher goals.\n\nOn standalone basis, we have grown by a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of Revenues\n\n22.2%, Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) before exceptional items 23.1% and Net Profit before exceptional items 24.1%. The financial markets have endorsed our sterling performance and the market capitalisation has increased by CAGR of 31.6% during the same period. In terms of distributing wealth to our shareholders, apart from having a track record of uninterrupted dividend payout, we have also delivered consistent unmatched shareholder returns since listing. The result of our initiative is our ever widening reach and recall. Our shareholder base has grown from 52,000 after the IPO to a consolidated present base of around 33 Lakh.\n\nFor decades, RIL is growing in step with India's industrial and economic development. The Company has helped transform the Indian economy with large projects and world-class execution. The quest to help elevate India's quality of life continues and is unabated. It emanates from a fundamental article of faith: 'What is good for India is good for Reliance'.\n\nWe believe, Corporate Governance is not just a destination, but a journey to constantly improve sustainable value creation. It is an upward-moving target that we collectively strive towards achieving. Our multiple initiatives towards maintaining the highest standards of governance are detailed in this Report.\n\n## Corporate  Governance Structure, Policies and Practices\n\nThe Company has put in place an internal multi-tier governance structure with defined roles and responsibilities of every constituent of the system. The Company's shareholders appoint the Board of Directors, which in turn govern the Company. The Board has established various Committees to discharge its responsibilities in an effective manner. The Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) provides overall direction and guidance to the Board. In the operations and functioning of the Company, the CMD is assisted by four Executive Directors and a core group of senior level executives.",

For Commodities hedging, there exist Over The Counter (OTC) and Exchange markets that offer financial instruments (derivatives), that enable managing the Price risk.\n\nStrategic decisions regarding the timing and the usage of derivatives instruments such as Swaps / Futures / Options, are taken based on various factors including market conditions, physical inventories, macro-economic situation.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast\n\n- significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2022 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n- 1. As required by the Companies (Auditor's Report) Order, 2020 ('the Order'), issued by the Central Government of India in terms of sub-section (11) of section 143 of the Act, we give in the 'Annexure/uni00A01' a statement on the matters specified in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Order.\n- 2.

Our audit\n\nof internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to these Standalone Financial Statements\n\nA company's internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements\n\n| Corporate   | Management   | Governance   | Financial   |\n|-------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Overview    | Review       |              | Statements  |\n\nto future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to standalone financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to\n\n## For D T S & Associates LLP\n\nChartered Accountants ICAI Firm Registration Number: 142412W/W100595\n\nper T P Ostwal Partner Membership Number: 030848 UDIN: 22030848AIMPYR9342\n\nPlace of Signature: Mumbai Date: May 06, 2022\n\nStandalone\n\nstandalone financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements were operating effectively as at March/uni00A031,/uni00A02022, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.\n\n## For S R B C & CO LLP\n\nChartered Accountants ICAI Firm Registration Number: 324982E/E300003\n\nper Vikas Kumar Pansari Partner Membership Number: 093649 UDIN: 22093649AIMNPC6387\n\nPlace of Signature: Mumbai Date: May 06, 2022",

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the cost of such assets. A qualifying asset is one that necessarily takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use.\n\nInterest income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.\n\nAll other borrowing costs are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss for the period for which they are incurred.\n\n## (h)  Inventories\n\nItems of inventories are measured at lower of cost and net realisable value after providing for obsolescence, if any, except in case of by-products which are valued at net realisable value. Cost of inventories comprises of cost of purchase, cost of conversion and other costs including manufacturing overheads net of recoverable taxes incurred in bringing them to their respective present location and condition.\n\nCost of finished goods, work-in-progress, raw materials, chemicals, stores and spares, packing materials, trading and other products are determined on weighted average basis.\n\n## (i) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets - Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets\n\nThe Company assesses at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that any Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets or group of Assets, called Cash Generating Units (CGU) may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to determine the extent of impairment, if any. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss to the extent, asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable\n\namount is higher of an asset's fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risk specific to the assets.\n\nThe impairment loss recognised in prior accounting period is reversed if there has been a change in the estimate of recoverable amount.\n\n## (j) Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.\n\n## Provision for Decommissioning Liability\n\nThe Company records a provision for decommissioning costs towards site restoration activity. Decommissioning costs are provided at the present value of future expenditure using a current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred to fulfil decommissioning obligations and are recognised as part of the cost of the underlying assets. Any change in the present value of the expenditure, other than unwinding of discount on the provision, is reflected as adjustment to the provision and the corresponding asset. The change in the provision due to the unwinding of discount is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## (k)  Contingent Liabilities\n\nDisclosure of contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of amount cannot be made.\n\n## (l) Employee Benefits Expense\n\n## Short-Term Employee Benefits\n\nThe undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered by employees are recognised as an expense during the period when the employees render the services.\n\n## Post-Employment Benefits\n\nDefined Contribution Plans\n\nThe Company recognises contribution payable to the provident fund scheme as an expense, when an employee renders the related service. If the contribution payable to the scheme for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognised as a liability. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the balance sheet date, then excess is recognised as an asset to the extent that the pre-payment will lead to a reduction in future payment or a cash refund.\n\n## Defined Benefit Plans\n\nThe Company pays gratuity to the employees who have completed five years of service with the Company at the time of resignation/superannuation. The gratuity is paid @15 days basic salary for every completed year of service as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The gratuity liability amount is contributed to the approved gratuity fund formed exclusively for gratuity payment to the employees. The gratuity fund has been approved by respective Income Tax authorities. The liability in respect of gratuity and other post-employment benefits is calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method and spread over the period during which the benefit is expected to be derived from employees' services.\n\nRemeasurement gains and losses arising from adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur in Other Comprehensive Income.\n\nEmployee Separation Costs: The Company recognises the employee separation cost when the scheme is announced, and the Company is demonstrably committed to it.\n\n## (m) Tax Expenses\n\nThe tax expenses for the period comprises of current tax and deferred income tax. Tax is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income. In which case, the tax is also recognised in Other Comprehensive Income.\n\n## i. Current Tax\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the Income Tax authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted at the Balance sheet date.\n\n## ii. Deferred Tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements\n\nFinancial\n\nStatements\n\nStandalone\n\nand the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The carrying amount of Deferred tax liabilities and assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period.\n\n## (n)  Share Based Payments\n\nEquity-settled share based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share based payments transactions are set out in Note 29.2.\n\nThe fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss such that the cumulative expenses reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the Share Based Payments Reserve.\n\nThe dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.\n\nIn case of Group equity-settled share-based payment transactions, where the Company grants stock options to the employees of its subsidiaries, the transactions are accounted by increasing the cost of investment in subsidiary with a corresponding credit in the equity.\n\n## (o)   Foreign Currencies Transactions and Translation\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency closing rates of exchange at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent of exchange differences which are regarded",

Additionally, exchange gains or losses on foreign currency borrowings taken prior to April 1, 2016 which are related to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are adjusted in the carrying cost of such assets.\n\nNon-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are recorded using the exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e. translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income or Statement of Profit and Loss are also recognised in Other Comprehensive Income or Statement of Profit and Loss, respectively).\n\nIn case of an asset, expense or income where a non-monetary advance is paid/received, the date of transaction is the date on which the advance was initially recognised. If there were multiple payments or receipts in advance, multiple dates of transactions are determined for each payment or receipt of advance consideration.\n\n## (p)  Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company is generally the principal as it typically controls the goods or services before transferring them to the customer.\n\nGenerally, control is transferred upon shipment of goods to the customer or when the goods is made available to the customer, provided transfer of title to the customer occurs and the Company has not retained any significant risks of ownership or future obligations with respect to the goods shipped.\n\nRevenue from rendering of services is recognised over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations at the reporting period.\n\nRevenue is measured at the amount of consideration which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring distinct goods or services to a customer as specified in the contract, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (for example taxes and duties collected on behalf of the government). Consideration is generally due\n\nupon satisfaction of performance obligations and a receivable is recognised when it becomes unconditional. Generally, the credit period varies between 0-60 days from the shipment or delivery of goods or services as the case may be. The Company provides volume rebates to certain customers once the quantity of products purchased during the period exceeds a threshold specified and also accrues discounts to certain customers based on customary business practices which is derived on the basis of crude price volatility and various market demand - supply situations. Consideration are determined based on its most likely amount. Generally, sales of petroleum products contain provisional pricing features where revenue is initially recognised based on provisional price.\n\nDifference between final settlement price and provisional price is recognised subsequently. The Company does not adjust short-term advances received from the customer for the effects of significant financing component if it is expected at the contract inception that the promised good or service will be transferred to the customer within a period of one year.\n\n## Contract Balances\n\nTrade Receivables\n\nA receivable represents the Company's right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional.\n\n## Contract Liabilities\n\nA contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration or is due from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Company transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier).\n\nContract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Company performs under the contract.\n\n## Interest Income\n\nInterest Income from a Financial Assets is recognised using effective interest rate method.\n\n## Dividend Income\n\nDividend Income is recognised when the Company's right to receive the amount has been established.\n\n## (q)  Financial Instruments\n\n## i. Financial Assets\n\n- A. Initial Recognition and Measurement\n\nAll Financial Assets are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of Financial Assets, which are not at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss, are adjusted to the fair\n\nvalue on initial recognition. Purchase and sale of Financial Assets are recognised using trade date accounting.\n\n## B. Subsequent Measurement\n\n## a) Financial Assets measured at\n\n- Amortised Cost (AC)\n- A Financial Asset is measured at Amortised Cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the Financial Asset give rise to cash flows on specified dates that represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n- b) Financial Assets measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI)\n- A Financial Asset is measured at FVTOCI if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling Financial Assets and the contractual terms of the Financial Asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that represents solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n- c) Financial Assets measured at Fair Value\n- Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) A Financial Asset which is not classified in any of the above categories are measured at FVTPL. Financial assets are reclassified subsequent to their recognition, if the Company changes its business model for managing those financial assets. Changes in business model are made and applied prospectively from the reclassification date which is the first day of immediately next reporting period following the changes in business model in accordance with principles laid down under Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments.\n\n## C. Investment in Subsidiaries, Associates and Joint Ventures\n\nThe Company has accounted for its investments in Subsidiaries, associates and joint venture at cost less impairment loss (if any). The investments in preference shares with the right of surplus assets which are in nature of equity in accordance with Ind AS 32 are treated as separate category of investment and measured at FVTOCI.\n\n## D. Other Equity Investments\n\nAll other equity investments are measured at fair value, with value changes recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss, except for those equity investments for which the Company\n\nhas elected to present the value changes in 'Other Comprehensive Income'. However, dividend on such equity investments are recognised in Statement of Profit and loss when the/uni00A0Company's right to receive payment is established.\n\n## E. Impairment of Financial Assets\n\nIn accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company uses 'Expected Credit Loss' (ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of Financial Assets other than those measured at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL).\n\nExpected Credit Losses are measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to:\n\n- \u00b7   The 12-months expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from those default events on the financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date); or\n- \u00b7  Full lifetime expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the life of the financial instrument).\n\nFor Trade Receivables the Company applies 'simplified approach' which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.\n\nThe Company uses historical default rates to determine impairment loss on the portfolio of trade receivables. At every reporting date these historical default rates are reviewed and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.\n\nFor other assets, the Company uses 12 month ECL to provide for impairment loss where there is no significant increase in credit risk. If there is significant increase in credit risk full lifetime ECL is used.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nii.\n\n## Financial Liabilities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA.\n\nInitial Recognition and Measurement\n\n- All Financial Liabilities are recognised at fair value and in case of borrowings, net of directly attributable cost. Fees of recurring nature are directly recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as finance cost.\n\n## B. Subsequent Measurement\n\nFinancial Liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. For trade and other payables maturing within one year from the balance sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.",

        "page_content": "## Notes\n\nto the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st March, 2022\n\n## iii. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Company uses various derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, currency swaps, forwards & options and commodity contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates, exchange rates and commodity prices. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Company formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Company wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are also subsequently measured at fair value.\n\nDerivatives are carried as Financial Assets when the fair value is positive and as Financial Liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to Statement of Profit and Loss, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedge which is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and later to Statement of Profit and Loss when the hedged item affects profit or loss or is treated as basis adjustment if a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a Non-Financial Assets or NonFinancial liability.\n\nHedges that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:\n\n## A. Cash Flow Hedge\n\nThe Company designates derivative contracts or non-derivative Financial Assets/ Liabilities as hedging instruments to mitigate the risk of movement in interest rates and foreign exchange rates for foreign exchange exposure on highly probable future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability or forecast cash transactions.\n\nWhen a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve being part of Other Comprehensive Income. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in cash flow hedging reserve till the period\n\nthe hedge was effective remains in cash flow hedging reserve until the underlying transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve is transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss upon the occurrence of the underlying transaction. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## B. Fair Value Hedge\n\nThe Company designates derivative contracts or non-derivative Financial Assets/Liabilities as hedging instruments to mitigate the risk of change in fair value of hedged item due to movement in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices.\n\nChanges in the fair value of hedging instruments and hedged items that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to Statement of Profit and Loss over the period of maturity.\n\n## iv. Derecognition of Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company derecognises a Financial Asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the Financial Asset expire or it transfers the Financial Asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109. A Financial liability (or a part of a Financial liability) is derecognised from the Company's Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.\n\n## v. O/uniFB00setting\n\nFinancial Assets and Financial Liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, the Company has a legally enforceable right to set off the amount and it intends, either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## (r) Non-current Assets Held for Sale\n\nNon-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and sale is considered highly probable.\n\nA sale is considered as highly probable when decision has been made to sell, assets are available for immediate sale in its present condition, assets\n\n| Corporate   | Management   | Governance   | Financial   |\n|-------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Overview    | Review       |              | Statements  |\n\nare being actively marketed and sale has been agreed or is expected to be concluded within 12 months of the date of classification.\n\nNon-current assets held for sale are neither depreciated nor amortised.\n\nAssets and liabilities classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost of disposal and are presented separately in the Balance Sheet.\n\n## (s)  Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity\n\nThe Company has adopted Successful Efforts Method (SEM) of accounting for its Oil and Gas activities. The policy of recognition of exploration and evaluation expenditure is considered in line with the principle of SEM. Seismic costs, geological and geophysical studies, petroleum exploration license fees and general and administration costs directly attributable to exploration and evaluation activities are expensed off. The costs incurred on acquisition of interest in oil and gas blocks and on exploration and evaluation other than those which are expensed off are accounted for as Intangible Assets Under Development. All development costs incurred in respect of proved reserves are also capitalised under Intangible Assets Under Development. Once a well is ready to commence commercial production, the costs accumulated in Intangible Assets Under Development are classified as Intangible Assets corresponding to proved developed oil and gas reserves. The exploration and evaluation expenditure which does not result in discovery of proved oil and gas reserves and all cost pertaining to production are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\nThe Company uses technical estimation of reserves as per the Petroleum Resources Management System guidelines 2011 and standard geological and reservoir engineering methods. The reserve review and evaluation is carried out annually.\n\nOil and Gas Joint Ventures are in the nature of joint operations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities as well as income and expenditure are accounted on the basis of available information on a line-by-line basis with similar items in the Company's Financial Statements, according to the participating interest of the Company.\n\n## (t) Earnings Per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year adjusted for bonus element in equity share. Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the conversion of all dilutive potential\n\nStandalone\n\nequity shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as at the beginning of the period unless issued at a later date.\n\n## C.   Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the Company's Financial Statements requires management to make judgement, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and the accompanying disclosures. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in next financial years.\n\n## (A) Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe determination of the Company's estimated oil and natural gas reserves requires significant judgements and estimates to be applied and these are regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data, reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity, drilling of new wells, and commodity prices all impact on the determination of the Company's estimates of its oil and natural gas reserves. The Company bases it's proved reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements.\n\nEstimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used to calculate depletion charges for the Company's oil and gas properties. The impact of changes in estimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortising the remaining carrying value of the asset over the expected future production. Oil and natural gas reserves also have a direct impact on the assessment of the recoverability of asset carrying values reported in the Financial Statements.\n\nDetails on proved reserves and production both on product and geographical basis are provided in Note 35.1.\n\n## (B) Decommissioning Liabilities\n\nThe liability for decommissioning costs is recognised when the Company has an obligation to perform site restoration activity. The recognition and measurement of decommissioning provisions involves the use of estimates and assumptions. These include; the timing of abandonment of well and related facilities which would depend upon the ultimate life of the field, expected utilisation of assets by other fields, the scope of abandonment activity and pre-tax rate applied for discounting.",

Property, Plant and Equipment/Intangible Assets are depreciated/ amortised over their estimated useful life, after taking into account estimated residual value. Management reviews the estimated useful life and residual values of the assets annually in order to determine the amount of depreciation/ amortisation to be recorded during any reporting period. The useful life and residual values are based on the Company's historical experience with similar assets and take into account anticipated technological and future risks. The depreciation/ amortisation for future periods is revised if there are significant changes from previous estimates.\n\n## (D) Recoverability of Trade Receivables\n\nJudgments are required in assessing the recoverability of overdue trade receivables and determining whether a provision against those receivables is required. Factors considered include the credit rating of the counterparty, the amount and timing of anticipated future payments and any possible actions that can be taken to mitigate the risk of non-payment.\n\n## (E) Provisions\n\nThe timing of recognition and quantification of the liability (including litigations) requires the application of judgement to existing facts and circumstances, which can be subject to change. The carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities are reviewed regularly and revised to take account of changing facts and circumstances.\n\n## (F)  Impairment of Financial and NonFinancial Assets\n\nThe impairment provisions for Financial Assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected cash loss rates. The Company uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, based on Company's past history, existing market conditions as well as forwardlooking estimates at the end of each reporting period.\n\nIn case of non-financial assets, assessment of impairment indicators involves consideration of future risks. Further, the company estimates asset's recoverable amount, which is higher of an asset's or Cash Generating Units (CGU's) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.\n\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using pre-tax\n\ndiscount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account, if no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.\n\n## (G)  Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses for which there is probability of utilisation against the future taxable profit. The Company uses judgement to determine the amount of deferred tax that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits and business developments.\n\n## (H) Fair Value Measurement\n\nFor estimates relating to fair value of financial instruments refer note 38 of financial statements.\n\n## (I)  Global Health Pandemic on Covid-19\n\nThe continuance of corona virus (COVID-19) pandemic globally and in India is causing significant disturbance and slowdown of economic activity. The Company's operations and revenue during the period were impacted due to COVID-19. The Company has taken into account the possible impact of COVID-19 in preparation of financial statements, including its assessment of recoverable value of its assets based on internal and external information upto the date of approval of these financial statements and current indicators of future economic conditions.\n\n## D.   Standards Issued but not E/uniFB00ective\n\nOn March 23, 2022, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has notified Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2022.

The sensitivity analysis below, have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions occurring at end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant. The result of Sensitivity analysis is given below:\n\n|                                                                 |                        |                        |                        | ( '  in crore)         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                                                 | As at 31st March, 2022 | As at 31st March, 2022 | As at 31st March, 2021 | As at 31st March, 2021 |\n| Particulars                                                     | Decrease               | Increase               | Decrease               | Increase               |\n| Change in rate of discounting (delta  effect of +/- 0.5%)       | 24                     | 26                     | 24                     | 25                     |\n| Change in rate of salary increase (delta  effect of -/+ 0.5%)   | 25                     | 26                     | 24                     | 26                     |\n| Change in rate of employee turnover  (delta effect of -/+ 0.5%) | 2                      | 2                      | 2                      | 2                      |\n\nThese plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: Investment Risk, Interest Risk, Longevity Risk and Salary Risk.\n\n| Investment Risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is  determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.                                                                                 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Interest Risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially offset  by an increase in the return on the plan's debt investments.                                                                                                              |\n| Longevity Risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate  of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life  expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability. |\n| Salary Risk The present value of the defined plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan  participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.                                                                   |\n\n## 29.2 Share Based Payments\n\n## a)  Scheme details\n\nThe Company has Employee Stock Option Schemes i.e. ESOS-2006 and ESOS-2017 under which options have been granted at the various exercise prices to be vested from time to time on the basis of performance and other eligibility criteria.

The Company continues to maintain that the Contractor is entitled to recover all of its costs under the terms of the PSC and there are no provisions that entitle the GOI to disallow the recovery of any Contract Cost as defined in the PSC. The Company referred the issue to arbitration with GOI for resolution of disputes. The demand from the GOI of $ 165 million ( ' 1,248 crore) being the Company's share (total demand $ 247 million-' 1,872 crore) towards additional Profit Petroleum has been considered as contingent liability.\n\nIn supersession of Ministry's Gazette Notification no. 22011/3/2012-ONG.D.V. dated 10 th January, 2014, the GOI notified the New Domestic natural Gas Pricing Guidelines 2014, the GOI has directed the Company to instruct customers to deposit differential revenue on gas sales from D1D3 field on account of the prices determined under the above guidelines converted to NCV basis and the prevailing price prior to 1 st November, 2014 ($ 4.205 per MMBTU) to be credited to the gas pool account maintained by GAIL (India) Limited. The amount so deposited by customer in Gas pool Account is ' 295 crore (net) as at 31 st March, 2022 is disclosed under Other Non-Current Assets. Revenue has been recognised at the GOI notified prices in respect of gas quantities sold from D1D3 field from 1 st November, 2014. This amount in the Gas Pool Account has also been challenged under cost recovery arbitration and is pending adjudication.\n\nTribunal has scheduled further procedural hearing in the matter.\n\n- 35.4 (a)  GOI sent a notice to the KG D6 Contractor on 4 th November, 2016 asking the Contractor to deposit approximately US $1.55 billion on account of alleged gas migration from ONGC's blocks. RIL, as Operator, for and on behalf of all constituents of the Contractor, initiated arbitration proceedings against the GOI. The Arbitral Tribunal vide its Final Award dated 24 th July, 2018 upheld Contractor's claims. GOI filed an Appeal under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, against the Final Award of the Arbitral Tribunal on 15 th November, 2018 before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court. The Appeal is currently being heard before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court.\n- (b)  Arbitration was initiated by BG Exploration and Production India Limited and RIL (together the Claimants) against GOI on 16 th December, 2010 under the PSCs for Panna - Mukta and Tapti blocks due to difference in interpretation of certain PSC provisions between Claimants and GOI. The Arbitral Tribunal by majority issued a final partial award ('2016 FPA'), and separately, two dissenting opinions in the matter on 12 th October, 2016. Claimants challenged certain parts of the 2016 FPA before the English Courts, which delivered its judgment on 16 th April, 2018 and remitted one of the challenged issues back to the Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration. The Arbitral Tribunal decided in favour of the Claimants in large part vide its final partial award dated 1 st October, 2018 ('2018 FPA'). GOI and Claimants filed an appeal before the English Commercial Court against this 2018 FPA. The English Commercial Court rejected GOI's challenges to 2018 FPA and upheld Claimants' challenge in February 2020 and remitted the underlying issue in challenge back to the Arbitration Tribunal for determination. On 29 th January, 2021 the Tribunal issued a further final partial award on the remitted matter and GOI has challenged the same before the English Commercial Court. Claimants have filed an application before the Arbitral Tribunal seeking increase in the PSC Cost Recovery Limits and the same is sub-judice. Arbitral Tribunal is yet to schedule the final re-computation of accounts phase of the arbitration, which will take place post determination of Claimants' request for increase in cost recovery limit under the PSCs.\n\nGOI has also filed an execution petition before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court under sections 47 and 49 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 seeking enforcement and execution of the 2016 FPA, ignoring the judgments of English High Court and the subsequent Tribunal Awards.  The Claimants contend that GOI's Execution Petition is not maintainable. GOI's Execution Petition is currently sub judice before Delhi High Court.\n\n| Corporate   | Management   | Governance   | Financial   |\n|-------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Overview    | Review       |              | Statements  |\n\nStandalone\n\n- (c)  NTPC had filed a suit for specific performance of a contract for supply of natural gas by RIL before the Hon'ble Bombay High Court. The main issue in dispute is whether a valid, concluded and binding contract exists between the parties for supply of Natural Gas of 132 Trillion BTU annually for a period of 17 years. The matter is presently sub judice and RIL is of the view that NTPC's claim lacks merit and no binding contract for supply of gas was executed between NTPC and RIL.\n\nConsidering the complexity of above issues, the Company is of the view that any attempt for quantification of possible exposure to the Company will have an effect of prejudicing Company's legal position in the ongoing arbitration/ litigations. Moreover, the Company considers above demand/disputes as remote.\n\n## 35.5 Exploration for and Evaluation of Oil and Gas Resources\n\nThe following financial information represents the amounts included in Intangible Assets under Development relating to activity associated with the exploration for and evaluation of oil and gas resources.\n\n| Particulars                         | As at   31st March, 2022   | ( '   in crore)  As at   31st March, 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Exploration & Evaluation (E&E) Cost |                            |                                             |\n| Exploration Expenditure written off | 102                        | 1                                           |\n| Other Exploration Cost              | 79                         | -                                           |\n| Exploration Cost for the year       | 181                        | 1                                           |\n\n|                                            |                                                                                                                          | As at   31st March, 2022                                                                                                | ( '  in crore) As at   31st March, 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| 36.

The total demand upto AY 2018-19 is ' /uni00A01 ,128 crore as on date. Based on the decisions of the Appellate authorities and the interpretations of other relevant provisions of the Income tax Act, 1961, the company has been legally advised that the demand raised is likely to be either deleted or substantially reduced and accordingly no provision is considered necessary.\n- (IV) On December 16, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued a show cause notice ('SCN') inter alia to the Company (RIL) in connection with the trades by RIL in the stock exchanges in 2007 in the shares of Reliance Petroleum Limited, then a subsidiary of RIL. Hearings were held before the Whole Time Member ('WTM') of SEBI in respect of the SCN. By an order dated March 24, 2017, the WTM passed the directions: (i) prohibiting inter alia RIL from dealing in equity derivatives in the 'Futures & Options' segment of stock exchanges, directly or indirectly, for a period of one year from the date of the order; and (ii) to RIL to disgorge an amount of ' 447 crore along with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from November 29, 2007 till the date of payment. In May 2017, RIL and the other noticees filed an appeal before the Securities Appellate Tribunal ('SAT') against this order. SAT, by a majority order (2:1), dismissed the appeal on November 5, 2020 and directed RIL to pay the disgorged amount within sixty days from the date of the order. The appeal of RIL and other noticees has been admitted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. By its order dated December 17, 2020, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India directed RIL to deposit ' 250 crore in the Investors' Protection Fund, subject to the final result of the appeal and stayed the recovery of the balance, inclusive of interest, pending the appeal. RIL has complied with the order dated December 17, 2020 of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.",

The company has a risk management framework aimed at prudently managing the risk arising from the volatility in commodity prices and freight costs.\n\nThe Company's commodity risk is managed centrally through well-established trading operations and control processes. In accordance with the risk management policy, the Company enters into various transactions using derivatives and uses over-the-counter as well as Exchange Traded Futures, Options and Swap contracts to hedge its commodity and freight exposure.\n\n## iii)  Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing financial loss to the company. Credit risk arises from company's activities in investments, dealing in derivatives and receivables from customers. The Company ensure that sales of products are made to customers with appropriate creditworthiness. Investment and other market exposures are managed against counterparty exposure limits. Credit information is regularly shared between businesses and finance function, with a framework in place to quickly identify and respond to cases of credit deterioration.\n\nThe company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business activities. Credit risk is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent Company Guarantees, advance payments and factoring & forfaiting without recourse to the company to avoid concentration of risk. The company restricts its fixed income investments to liquid securities carrying high credit rating.\n\n## iv)  Liquidity Risk\n\nLiquidity risk arises from the Company's inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The company maintains sufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The company accesses global and local financial markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to ensure efficient funding from across well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the company's cash flow position and ensures that the company is able to meet its financial obligation at all times including contingencies.",

Treasury pools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net deficit or invest the net surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank deposits, money market funds, reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to avoid concentration risk in any one instrument or counterparty.\n\n## ( ' in crore)\n\n## ( ' in crore)\n\n|                           | Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2022   | Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2022   | Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2022   | Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2022   | Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2022   | Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2022   | Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2022   |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Particulars  ^            | Below 3  Months                           | 3-6 Months                                | 6-12  Months                              | 1-3 Years                                 | 3-5 Years                                 | Above 5  Years                            | Total                                     |\n| Borrowings                |                                           |                                           |                                           |                                           |                                           |                                           |                                           |\n| Non-Current * @           | 2,169                                     | 6,416                                     | 9,517                                     | 74,969                                    | 32,724                                    | 60,399                                    | 1,86,194                                  |\n| Current  #$               | 9,328                                     | 90                                        | -

Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Company's business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and other feedstock, refined products, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Company has adopted a structured risk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved hedge accounting framework which allows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange traded futures and options, over-the-counter swaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve this objective.\n\nThere is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Company has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Company uses the hypothetical derivative method and Dollar offset method.\n\nThe hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:\n\n- -Differences in the timing of the cash flows.\n- -Different indexes (and accordingly different curves).\n- -The counterparties' credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements.\n\n| Corporate   | Management   | Governance   | Financial   |\n|-------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Overview    | Review       |              | Statements  |\n\nStandalone\n\nThe table below shows the position of hedging instruments and hedged items as on the balance sheet date:\n\n## Disclosure of effects of hedge accounting\n\n- A.

Further, items of property, plant and equipment that are ready for its intended use as determined by the management have been capitalised. Judgement is involved to determine that the aforesaid capitalisation meet the recognition requirement under Ind AS including determination of whether the criteria for intended use of the management has been met.\n\n- a)   Our audit procedures included and were not limited to the following:-\n- \u00b7 Assessed the design and operating effectiveness of the controls with respect to capital expenditure incurred on various projects included in capital work in progress, intangible assets under development.\n\nAct. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Group, associates, joint ventures in accordance with the 'Code of Ethics' issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2022. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of audit procedures performed by us and by other auditors of components not audited by us, as reported by them in their audit reports furnished to us by the management, including those procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nRe-assessment of estimated useful lives by the Holding Company used for determination of depreciation of tangible assets, amortisation of intangible assets and recoverability of their carrying values involves assumptions used for such technical assessment, consideration of historical experience and anticipated future risks.\n\nEstimates of oil and gas reserves are used to calculate depletion charges for the Holding Company's oil and gas assets and also have a direct impact on the assessment of the recoverability of their carrying values. Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data, reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity, drilling of new wells and commodity prices impacts the determination of the Holding Company's estimates of oil and natural gas reserves.\n\n- b)   The auditors in the Combined Financial Statements of Shale Gas Entities (USA) of Reliance Industries Limited have also reported a key audit matter on the estimates of oil and gas reserves topic.\n- c)   The auditors of Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited ('RJIL'), a subsidiary of the Holding Company, have reported a key audit matter on amortization / depreciation of spectrum costs and related tangible assets as it is a material item on the balance sheet of the subsidiary in value terms. Spectrum costs and the related tangible assets are amortised/depreciated to appropriately reflect the expected pattern of consumption of expected future economic benefits from continued use of the said assets. Determination of rate of amortisation/ depreciation in order to ensure compliance with the applicable Accounting Standards involve significant estimates and judgement and use of technology. Accordingly, it has been considered as a key audit matter.\n- d)   The auditors of Jio Platform Limited ('JPL'), a subsidiary of the Holding Company have reported capitalization under Intangible Assets under Development as key audit matter as significant judgement is involved in identification of expenses that are directly attributable and reasonably allocable to development of intangible assets and timing of capitalization. Accordingly, it has been considered as a key audit matter.\n\nAccordingly, the above matters relating to tangible and intangible assets have been considered as a key audit matter.\n\nRefer Note B.3 (c), B.3 (e) and Note C (a) of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n- \u00b7 Assessed the nature of the additions made to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, capital work-inprogress and intangible asset under development on a test check basis to test whether they meet the recognition criteria as set out in Ind AS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment and Ind AS 38 - Intangible Assets, including intended use of management.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed the management re-assessment of estimated useful lives of tangible assets, intangible assets and recoverability of their carrying values with respect to anticipated future risks.\n- \u00b7 Performed walk-through of the estimation process associated with the oil and gas reserves. Further, assessed the valuation methodology, including assumptions around the key drivers of the cash flow forecasts including future oil and gas prices, estimated reserves, discount rates used, etc. by engaging valuation experts.\n- \u00b7 Assessed the objectivity and competence of the Holding Company's specialists involved in estimating oil & gas reserves and valuation specialists engaged by us.\n- \u00b7 Assessed whether the updated oil and gas reserve estimates were included in the Holding Company's, accounting for amortisation/uni00A0/ depletion and disclosures of proved reserves and proved developed reserves in the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed the disclosure made by the Holding Company in the financial statements.\n- b)   In respect of the key audit matter reported by the auditors in the Combined Financial Statements of Shale Gas Entities (USA) of Reliance Industries Limited, we performed inquiry of the audit procedures performed by them to address the key audit matter.

As reported by the subsidiary auditor, the following procedures have been performed by them:-\n- \u00b7 Testing controls over determination of expected economic benefits from the use of relevant assets and monitoring actual consumption thereof to trueup the expected pattern of consumption during an accounting period;\n- \u00b7 Involved internal telecom and information technology specialists to validate the expected pattern of consumption of the economic benefits emanating from the use of the relevant assets and the IT environment over the relevant application systems used in monitoring of actual consumption thereof;\n- \u00b7 Substantive testing procedures including, verifying the mathematical accuracy of computation of amortisation/ depreciation charge for the year.\n\nFinancial\n\nStatements\n\nConsolidated",

We also:\n\n- \u00b7  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.

We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Other Matter\n\n- (a)   The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial statements and other financial information in respect of 24 subsidiaries which reflect total assets of ' 5,22,997 crore as at March 31, 2022, and total revenues of ' 2,98,412 crore and net cash inflows of ' 29 crore for the year ended on that date and the financial statements and other financial information of 3 associates and 3 joint ventures which reflects Group's share of net loss after tax of ' 113 crore for the year ended March 31, 2022, which have been audited by one of the joint auditors, individually or together with another auditor.\n- (b)   We did not audit the financial statements and other financial information, in respect of 299 subsidiaries, whose financial statements include total assets of ' 5,81,190 crore as at March 31, 2022, and total revenues of ' 2,02,660 crore and net cash inflows of ' 2,018 crore for the year ended on that date.

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding Company's , its subsidiaries, its associates and joint ventures, which are incorporated in India, internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the 'Guidance Note') and the Standards on Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both, issued by ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform\n\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nA company's internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nFinancial\n\nStatements\n\nConsolidated\n\n## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, the Group , its associates and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India,\n\n## For D T S & Associates LLP\n\nChartered Accountants ICAI Firm Registration Number: 142412W/W100595\n\nper T P Ostwal Partner Membership Number: 030848 UDIN: 22030848AIMQEE7221\n\nPlace of Signature: Mumbai Date: May 06, 2022\n\nhave, maintained in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and such internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2022, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.\n\n## Other Matters\n\nOur report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Holding Company, in so far as it relates to these 197 subsidiaries, 52 associates and 16 joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures incorporated in India.\n\n## For S R B C & CO LLP\n\nChartered Accountants ICAI Firm Registration Number: 324982E/E300003\n\nper Vikas Kumar Pansari Partner Membership Number: 093649 UDIN: 22093649AIMNSR5740\n\nPlace of Signature: Mumbai Date: May 06, 2022",

Certain financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments),\n- ii. Defined Benefit Plan's - Plan Assets and\n- iii. Equity settled Share Based Payments\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended from time to time) and presentation requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, (Ind AS compliant Schedule III), as applicable to the CFS.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements comprises of Reliance Industries Limited and all its subsidiaries, being the entities that it controls. Control is assessed in accordance with the requirement of Ind AS 110 Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Indian Rupees ( ' ) and all values are rounded to the nearest crore ( ' 00,00,000), except when otherwise indicated.\n\n## B.2 Principles of Consolidation\n\n- (a)   The financial statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiaries are combined on a line-byline basis by adding together like items of assets, liabilities, equity, incomes, expenses and cash flows, after fully eliminating intra-group balances and intragroup transactions.\n\n- (b)   Profits or losses resulting from intra-group transactions that are recognised in assets, such as Inventory and Property, Plant and Equipment, are eliminated in full.\n- (c) In case of foreign subsidiaries, revenue items are consolidated at the average rate prevailing during the year. All assets and liabilities are converted at rates prevailing at the end of the year. Any exchange difference arising on consolidation is recognised in the Foreign Currency Translation Reserve (FCTR).\n- (d)   The audited / unaudited financial statements of foreign subsidiaries / joint ventures / associates have been prepared in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principle of its Country of Incorporation or Ind AS.\n- (e) The differences in accounting policies of the Holding Company and its subsidiaries / joint ventures / associates are not material and there are no material transactions from 1 st January, 2022 to 31 st March, 2022 in respect of subsidiaries / joint ventures / associates having financial year ended 31 st December, 2021.\n- (f) The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances.\n- (g)   The carrying amount of the parent's investment in each subsidiary is offset (eliminated) against the parent's portion of equity in each subsidiary.\n- (h)   The difference between the proceeds from disposal of investment in subsidiaries and the carrying amount of its assets less liabilities as on the date of disposal is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss being the profit or loss on disposal of investment in subsidiary.\n- (i) Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures has been accounted under the Equity Method as per Ind AS 28 - Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. Investments in joint operations are accounted using the Proportionate Consolidation Method as per Ind AS 111 - Joint Arrangements.\n- (j) The Group accounts for its share of postacquisition changes in net assets of associates and joint ventures, after eliminating unrealised profits and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures.\n- (k) Non-Controlling Interest's share of profit / loss of consolidated subsidiaries for the year is identified and adjusted against the income of the Group in order to arrive at the net income attributable to shareholders of the Company.\n\n| Corporate   | Management   | Governance   | Financial   |\n|-------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Overview    | Review       |              | Statements  |\n\n- (l) Non-Controlling Interest's share of net assets of consolidated subsidiaries is identified and presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet\n\n## B.3  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## (a)  Current and Non-Current Classification\n\nThe Group presents assets and liabilities in the Balance Sheet based on Current / Non-Current classification.\n\nAn asset is treated as Current when it is -\n\n- -Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle;\n- -Held primarily for the purpose of trading;\n- -Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or\n- -Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.\n\nAll other assets are classified as Non-Current.\n\nA liability is treated as Current when -\n\n- -It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle;\n- -It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;\n- -It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or\n- -There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.\n\nThe Group classifies all other liabilities as Non-Current.\n\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities are classified as Non-Current Assets and Liabilities\n\n## (b)  Business Combination\n\nBusiness Combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, except for common control transactions which are accounted using the pooling of interest method that is accounted at carrying values.\n\nThe cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date i.e. the date on which control is acquired. Contingent consideration to be transferred is recognised at fair value and included as part of cost of acquisition. Transaction related costs are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred.\n\nConsolidated\n\nFor each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.\n\nGoodwill arising on business combination is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. After initial recognition, Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses if any.\n\nCommon control business combination: Business combinations involving entities or businesses that are controlled by the group are accounted using the pooling of interest method.\n\n## (c)  Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment are stated at cost, net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and rebates less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes purchase price, borrowing cost and any cost directly attributable to bringing the assets to its working condition for its intended use, net charges on foreign exchange contracts and adjustments arising from exchange rate variations attributable to the assets. In case of land the Group has availed fair value as deemed cost on the date of transition to Ind AS.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity and the cost can be measured reliably. Property, Plant and Equipment which are significant to the total cost of that item of Property, Plant and Equipment and having different useful life are accounted separately. Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating to project, net of income earned during the project development stage prior to its intended use, are considered as preoperative expenses and disclosed under Capital Work-in-Progress.\n\nDepreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment is provided using written down value method on depreciable amount except in case of certain assets of Oil to Chemicals segment which are depreciated using straight line method. Depreciation on wireless telecommunications equipment and components is determined based on the expected pattern of consumption of the expected future economic benefits. Depreciation is provided based on useful life of the assets as prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act,",

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of a Property, Plant and Equipment are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (d)  Leases\n\nThe Group, as a lessee, recognises a right-ofuse asset and a lease liability for its leasing arrangements, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset.\n\nThe contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, if it involves the use of an identified asset and the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset and has right to direct the use of the identified asset. The cost of the right-of-use asset shall comprise of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date plus any initial direct costs incurred. The right-of-use assets is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The rightof-use asset is depreciated using the straightline method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset.\n\nThe Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses incremental borrowing rate.\n\nFor short-term and low value leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe Group, as a lessor, classifies a lease either as an operating lease or a finance lease. Leases are classified as finance lease whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.\n\n## (e)  Other Intangible Assets\n\nOther Intangible Assets are stated at cost of acquisition net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and rebates less accumulated amortisation / depletion and impairment loss, if any. Such cost includes purchase price, borrowing costs, and any cost directly attributable for preparing the asset for its intended use, net charges on foreign exchange contracts and adjustments arising from exchange rate variations attributable to the Other Intangible Assets. In case of certain Other Intangible Assets, the Group has availed fair value as deemed cost on the date of transition to Ind AS.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity and the cost can be measured reliably.\n\nOther Indirect Expenses incurred relating to project, net of income earned during the project development stage prior to its intended use, are considered as pre-operative expenses and disclosed under Intangible Assets under Development.\n\nGains or losses arising from derecognition of an Other Intangible Asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.\n\nThe Group's Other Intangible Assets include assets with finite and indefinite useful life. Assets with finite useful life are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful life and assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised but are tested for impairment annually at the cash generating unit level.\n\nA summary of the amortisation / depletion policies applied to the Group's Other Intangible Assets to the extent of depreciable amount is as follows.\n\n| Particulars          | Depreciation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Technical   Know-How | Over the useful life of the  underlying assets ranging from 5  years to 35 years                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Computer   Software  | Over a period of 5 to 10 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Development   Rights | Depleted using the unit of production  method.

Development costs are capitalised as an intangible asset if it can be demonstrated that the project is expected to generate future economic benefits, it is probable that those future economic benefits will flow to the entity and the costs of the asset can be measured reliably, else it is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## (g)  Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents comprise of cash on hand, cash at bank, short-term deposits and short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n## (h)  Finance Costs\n\nBorrowing costs include exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an adjustment to the interest cost. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the cost of such assets. A qualifying asset is\n\none that necessarily takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use. Interest income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.\n\nAll other borrowing costs are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss for the period for which they are incurred.\n\n## (i) Inventories\n\nItems of inventories are measured at lower of cost and net realisable value after providing for obsolescence, if any, except in case of byproducts which are valued at net realisable value. Cost of inventories comprises of cost of purchase, cost of conversion and other costs including manufacturing overheads net of recoverable taxes incurred in bringing them to their respective present location and condition. Cost of finished goods, work-in-progress, raw materials, chemicals, stores and spares, packing materials, trading and other products are determined on weighted average basis.\n\n## (j) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets - Property, Plant and Equipment, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nThe Group assesses at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that any Property, Plant and Equipment, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets or group of assets, called Cash Generating Units (CGU) may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to determine the extent of impairment, if any. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss to the extent, asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is higher of an asset's fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risk specific to the assets. The impairment loss recognised in prior accounting period is reversed if there has been a change in the estimate of recoverable amount.\n\n## (k)  Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a",

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.\n\n## Provision for Decommissioning Liability\n\nThe Group records a provision for decommissioning costs towards site restoration activity. Decommissioning costs are provided at the present value of future expenditure using a current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred to fulfill decommissioning obligations and are recognised as part of the cost of the underlying assets. Any change in the present value of the expenditure, other than unwinding of discount on the provision, is reflected as adjustment to the provision and the corresponding asset. The change in the provision due to the unwinding of discount is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## (l) Contingent Liability\n\nDisclosure of contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of amount cannot be made.\n\n## (m) Employee Benefits Expense\n\n## Short-Term Employee Benefits\n\nThe undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered by employees are recognised as an expense during the period when the employees render the services.\n\n## Post-Employment Benefits\n\n## Defined Contribution Plans\n\nThe Group recognises contribution payable to the provident fund scheme as an expense, when an employee renders the related service. If the contribution payable to the scheme for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognised as a liability. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution\n\ndue for services received before the balance sheet date, then excess is recognised as an asset to the extent that the pre-payment will lead to, for example, a reduction in future payment or refund.\n\n## Defined Benefit Plans\n\nThe Group pays gratuity to the employees who have completed five years of service at the time of resignation / superannuation. The gratuity is paid @15 days basic salary for every completed year of service as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The gratuity liability amount is contributed to the approved gratuity fund formed exclusively for gratuity payment to the employees. The gratuity fund has been approved by respective Income Tax authorities. The liability in respect of gratuity and other post-employment benefits is calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method and spread over the period during which the benefit is expected to be derived from employees' services.\n\nRemeasurement gains and losses arising from adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, in Other Comprehensive Income.\n\n## Employee Separation Costs\n\nThe Group recognises the employee separation cost when the scheme is announced and the Group is demonstrably committed to it.\n\n## (n)  Tax Expenses\n\nThe tax expenses for the period comprises of Current Tax and Deferred Income Tax. Tax is recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income. In which case, the tax is also recognised in Other Comprehensive Income.\n\n## i. Current Tax\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted at the Balance sheet date.\n\n## ii. Deferred Tax\n\nDeferred Tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred Tax Assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred Tax Liabilities and Assets are measured at the\n\ntax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The carrying amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period.\n\n## (o)  Share Based Payments\n\nEquity-settled share based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equitysettled share based payments transactions are set out in Note 28.2. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss such that the cumulative expenses reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the Share Based Payments Reserve. The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.\n\n## (p)   Foreign Currencies Transactions and Translation\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency's closing rates of exchange at the reporting date.\n\nExchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent of exchange differences which are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on foreign currency borrowings that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets, are capitalised as cost of assets. Additionally, exchange gains or losses on foreign currency borrowings taken prior to April 1, 2016, which are related to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are adjusted in the carrying cost of such assets.\n\nNon-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are recorded using the exchange rates at the date of the\n\ntransaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e. translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income or Statement of Profit and Loss are also recognised in Other Comprehensive Income or Statement of Profit and Loss, respectively).\n\nIn case of an asset, expense or income where a non-monetary advance is paid / received, the date of transaction is the date on which the advance was initially recognised. If there were multiple payments or receipts in advance, multiple dates of transactions are determined for each payment or receipt of advance consideration.\n\n## (q)  Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Group is generally the principal as it typically controls the goods or services before transferring them to the customer.\n\nGenerally, control is transferred upon shipment of goods to the customer or when the goods is made available to the customer, provided transfer of title to the customer occurs and the Group has not retained any significant risks of ownership or future obligations with respect to the goods shipped.\n\nRevenue from rendering of services is recognised over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations at the reporting period.\n\nRevenue is measured at the amount of consideration which the group expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring distinct goods or services to a customer as specified in the contract, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (for example taxes and duties collected on behalf of the government).\n\nConsideration is generally due upon satisfaction of performance obligations and a receivable is recognised when it becomes unconditional. Generally, the credit period varies between 0-60 days from the shipment or delivery of goods or services as the case may be.\n\nThe Group provides volume rebates to certain customers once the quantity of products purchased during the period exceeds a threshold specified and also accrues discounts to certain customers based on customary business",

Consideration are determined based on its most likely amount.\n\nGenerally, sales of petroleum products contain provisional pricing features where revenue is initially recognised based on provisional price. Difference between final settlement price and provisional price is recognised subsequently.\n\nThe Group does not adjust short-term advances received from the customer for the effects of significant financing component if it is expected at the contract inception that the promised good or service will be transferred to the customer within a period of one year.\n\n## Contract Balances\n\n## Trade Receivables\n\nA receivable represents the Group's right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional.\n\n## Contract Liabilities\n\nA contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has received consideration or is due from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Group transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group performs under the contract.\n\n## Interest Income\n\nInterest Income from a financial asset is recognised using Effective Interest Rate Method.\n\n## Dividend Income\n\nDividend Income is recognised when the Group's right to receive the amount has been established.\n\n## (r)  Financial Instruments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## i. Financial Assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA.\n\nInitial Recognition and Measurement\n\nAll financial assets are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets, which are not at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss, are adjusted to the fair value on initial recognition. Purchase and sale of financial assets are recognised using trade date accounting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## B. Subsequent Measurement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Financial assets measured at\n\n## a) Amortised Cost (AC)\n\nA financial asset is measured at Amortised Cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows on specified dates that represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n- b) Financial Assets measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) A financial asset is measured at FVTOCI if it is held within a business model whose objective give rise on specified dates to cash flows that\n\nis achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n- c) Financial Assets measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above categories are measured at FVTPL.\n\nFinancial assets are reclassified subsequent to their recognition, if the Group changes its business model for managing those financial assets. Changes in business model are made and applied prospectively from the reclassification date which is the first day of immediately next reporting period following the changes in business model in accordance with principles laid down under Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments.\n\n## C. Other Equity Investments\n\nAll other equity investments are measured at fair value, with value changes recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, except for those equity investments for which the Group has elected to present the value changes in 'Other Comprehensive Income'.\n\nHowever, dividend on such equity investments is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss when the Company's right to receive payment is established.\n\n## D.   Impairment of Financial Assets\n\nIn accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group uses 'Expected Credit Loss' (ECL) model, for\n\nevaluating impairment of financial assets other than those measured at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL). Expected Credit Losses are measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to:\n\n- \u00b7  The 12-months expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from those default events on the financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date); or\n- \u00b7  Full lifetime expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the life of the financial instrument).\n\nFor trade receivables, the Group applies 'simplified approach' which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. The Group uses historical default rates to determine impairment loss on the portfolio of trade receivables. At every reporting date these historical default rates are reviewed and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.\n\nFor other assets, the Group uses 12 month Expected Credit Loss to provide for impairment loss where there is no significant increase in credit risk. If there is significant increase in credit risk full lifetime Expected Credit Loss is used.\n\n## ii. Financial Liabilities\n\n## A. Initial Recognition and Measurement\n\n- All financial liabilities are recognised at fair value and in case of borrowings, net of directly attributable cost. Fees of recurring nature are directly recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as finance cost.\n\n## B. Subsequent Measurement\n\nFinancial Liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. For trade and other payables maturing within one year from the balance sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\n\n## iii.   Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Group uses various derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, currency swaps, forwards and options and commodity contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates, exchange rates and commodity prices. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates\n\nand documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are also subsequently measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.\n\nAny gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedge which is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and later to Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, when the hedged item affects profit or loss or is treated as basis adjustment if a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability.\n\nHedges that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:\n\n## A. Cash Flow Hedge\n\nThe Group designates derivative contracts or non-derivative financial assets / liabilities as hedging instruments to mitigate the risk of movement in interest rates and foreign exchange rates for foreign exchange exposure on highly probable future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability or forecast cash transactions. When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is of Profit and Loss as finance cost. recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve being part of Other Comprehensive Income. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold / terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in cash flow hedging reserve till the period the hedge was effective remains in cash flow hedging reserve until the underlying transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve is transferred to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss",

If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## B. Fair Value Hedge\n\nThe Group designates derivative contracts or non-derivative financial assets / liabilities as hedging instruments to mitigate the risk of change in fair value of hedged item due to movement in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices.\n\nChanges in the fair value of hedging instruments and hedged items that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss over the period of maturity.\n\n## iv. Derecognition of Financial Instruments\n\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109 - Financial Instruments. A financial liability (or a part of a financial liability) is derecognised from the Group's Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.\n\n## v. O/uniFB00setting\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the Balance Sheet when, and only when, the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off the amount and it intends, either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability/uni00A0simultaneously.\n\n## (s)  Non-Current Assets Held for Sale\n\nNon-Current Assets are classified as Held for Sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and sale is considered highly probable. A sale is considered as highly probable when decision has been made to sell, assets are available for immediate sale in its present condition, assets are being actively marketed and sale has been agreed or is expected to\n\nbe concluded within 12 months of the date of classification. Non-current assets held for sale are neither depreciated nor amortised. Assets and liabilities classified as Held for Sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost of disposal and are presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## (t) Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity\n\nThe Group has adopted Successful Efforts Method (SEM) of accounting for its Oil and Gas activities. The policy of recognition of exploration and evaluation expenditure is considered in line with the principle of SEM. Seismic costs, geological and geophysical studies, petroleum exploration license fees and general and administration costs directly attributable to exploration and evaluation activities are expensed off. The costs incurred on acquisition of interest in oil and gas blocks and on exploration and evaluation other than those which are expensed off are accounted for as Intangible Assets under Development. All development costs incurred in respect of Proved Reserves are also capitalised under Intangible Assets under Development. Once a well is ready to commence commercial production, the costs accumulated in Intangible Assets under Development are classified as Other Intangible Assets corresponding to proved developed oil and gas reserves. The exploration and evaluation expenditure which does not result in discovery of proved oil and gas reserves and all cost pertaining to production are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\nThe Group uses technical estimation of reserves as per the Petroleum Resources Management System guidelines 2011 and standard geological and reservoir engineering methods. The reserve review and evaluation is carried out annually. Oil and Gas Joint Ventures are in the nature of Joint Operations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities as well as income and expenditure are accounted on the basis of available information on a line-by-line basis with similar items in the financial statements, according to the participating interest of the Group.\n\n## (u)  Earnings Per Share\n\nBasic Earnings Per Share is calculated by dividing the net profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year adjusted for bonus element in equity share. Diluted Earnings Per Share adjusts the figures used in determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as at the beginning of the period unless issued at a later date.\n\n## Notes\n\n## C.   Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the Group's financial statements requires management to make judgement, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and the accompanying disclosures. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.\n\n## (a)  Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe determination of the Group's estimated oil and natural gas reserves requires significant judgements and estimates to be applied and these are regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data, reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity, drilling of new wells, and commodity prices all impact on the determination of the Group's estimates of its oil and natural gas reserves. The Group bases it's proved reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements.\n\nEstimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used to calculate depletion charges for the Group's oil and gas properties. The impact of changes in estimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortising the remaining carrying value of the asset over the expected future production. Oil and natural gas reserves also have a direct impact on the assessment of the recoverability of asset carrying values reported in the financial statements. Details on proved reserves and production both on product and geographical basis are provided in Note 34.\n\n## (b)  Decommissioning Liabilities\n\nThe liability for decommissioning costs are recognised when the Group has an obligation to perform site restoration activity. The recognition and measurement of decommissioning provisions involves the use of estimates and assumptions. These include the timing of abandonment of well and related facilities which would depend upon the ultimate life of the field, expected utilisation of assets by other fields, the scope of abandonment activity and pre-tax rate applied for discounting.\n\n## (c)   Property Plant and Equipment / Other Intangible Assets\n\nEstimates are involved in determining the cost attributable to bringing the assets to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by the management. Property,\n\nPlant and Equipment / Other Intangible Assets are depreciated / amortised over their estimated useful life, after taking into account estimated residual value. Spectrum Cost is amortised over its balance validity period, based on the expected pattern of consumption of the expected future economic benefits.\n\nManagement reviews the estimated useful life and residual values of the assets annually in order to determine the amount of depreciation / amortisation to be recorded during any reporting period. The useful life and residual values are based on the Group's historical experience with similar assets and take into account anticipated technological and future risks. The depreciation / amortisation for future periods is revised if there are significant changes from previous estimates.\n\n## (d)   Recoverability of Trade Receivables\n\nJudgements are required in assessing the recoverability of overdue trade receivables and determining whether a provision against those receivables is required. Factors considered include the credit rating of the counterparty, the amount and timing of anticipated future payments and any possible actions that can be taken to mitigate the risk of non-payment.\n\n## (e)  Provisions\n\nThe timing of recognition and quantification of the liability requires the application of judgement to existing facts and circumstances, which can be subject to change. The carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities are reviewed regularly and revised to take account of changing facts and circumstances.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (f)   Impairment of Financial and NonFinancial Assets\n\nThe impairment provisions for Financial Assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected cash loss rates. The Group uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, based on Group's past history, existing market conditions as well as forwardlooking estimates at the end of each reporting period.\n\nIn case of non-financial assets the Group estimates asset's recoverable amount, which is higher of an asset's or Cash Generating Units (CGU's) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.\n\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account, if no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.",

During the year ended March 31, 2022, the Group has determined that there is no impairment towards these assets.\n\n## (g)   Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses for which there is probability of utilisation against the future taxable profit. The Group uses judgement to determine the amount of deferred tax that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits and business developments.\n\n## (h) Fair Value Measurement\n\nFor estimates relating to fair value of financial instruments refer Note 37 of financial statements.\n\n## (i) Revenue\n\nThe application of Accounting Standard on Revenue Recognition for digital segment involves complexity and use of key judgements with respect to multiple elements deliverables, timing of revenue recognition, accounting of discounts, incentives, etc. The Management has reviewed such accounting treatment and is satisfied about its appropriateness in terms of the relevant Ind AS.\n\n## (j)   Global Health Pandemic on COVID-19\n\nThe continuance of corona virus (COVID-19) pandemic globally and in India is causing significant disturbance and slowdown of economic activity. The Group's operations and revenue during the period were impacted due to COVID-19. The Group has taken into account the possible impact of COVID-19 in preparation of financial statements, including its assessment of recoverable value of its assets based on internal and external information upto the date of approval of these financial statements and current indicators of future economic conditions.\n\n## (k) Leases\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. Identification of a lease requires significant judgement. The Group uses judgement in assessing whether a contract (or part of contract) include a lease, the lease term (including anticipated renewals), the applicable discount rate, variable lease payments whether are in-substance fixed. The judgement involves assessment of whether the asset included in the contract is a fully or partly identified asset based on the facts and circumstances, whether the contract include a lease and non-lease component and if so, separation thereof for the purpose of recognition and measurement, determination of lease term basis, inter alia the non-cancellable period of lease and whether the lessee intends to opt for continuing with the use of the asset upon the expiry thereof, and whether the lease payments are fixed or variable or a combination of both.\n\n## D.

The above information is certified by the actuary.\n\nThe Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets is determined considering several applicable factors, mainly the composition of Plan Assets held, assessed risks, historical results of return on Plan Assets and the Group's policy for Plan Assets Management.\n\nVIII) The expected contributions for Defined Benefit Plan for the next financial year will be in line with financial year 2021-22.\n\n- IX)  These plan's typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: Investment Risk, Interest Risk, Longevity Risk and Salary Risk.\n\n| Investment Risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is  determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.                                                                                 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Interest Risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially offset  by an increase in the return on the plan's debt investments.                                                                                                              |\n| Longevity Risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate  of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life  expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability. |\n| Salary Risk The present value of the defined plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan  participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.                                                                   |",

The Company continues to maintain that the Contractor is entitled to recover all of its costs under the terms of the PSC and there are no provisions that entitle the GOI to disallow the recovery of any Contract Cost as defined in the PSC. The Company referred the issue to arbitration with GOI for resolution of disputes. The demand from the GOI of $ 165 million ( ' 1,248 crore) being the Company's share (total demand $ 247 million-' 1,872 crore) towards additional Profit Petroleum has been considered as contingent liability.\n\nIn supersession of Ministry's Gazette Notification no. 22011/3/2012-ONG.D.V. dated 10 th January, 2014, the GOI notified the New Domestic natural Gas Pricing Guidelines 2014, the GOI has directed the Company to instruct customers to deposit differential revenue on gas sales from D1D3 field on account of the prices determined under the above guidelines converted to NCV basis and the prevailing price prior to 1 st November, 2014 ($ 4.205 per MMBTU) to be credited to the gas pool account maintained by GAIL (India) Limited. The amount so deposited by customer in Gas pool Account is ' 295 crore (net) as at 31 st March, 2022 is disclosed under Other Non-Current Assets. Revenue has been recognised at the GOI notified prices in respect of gas quantities sold from D1D3 field from 1 st November, 2014. This amount in the Gas Pool Account has also been challenged under cost recovery arbitration and is pending adjudication.\n\nTribunal has scheduled further procedural hearing in the matter.\n\n- 34.4 (a)   GOI sent a notice to the KG D6 Contractor on 4 th November, 2016 asking the Contractor to deposit approximately US $1.55 billion on account of alleged gas migration from ONGC's blocks. RIL, as Operator, for and on behalf of all constituents of the Contractor, initiated arbitration proceedings against the GOI. The Arbitral Tribunal vide its Final Award dated 24 th July, 2018 upheld Contractor's claims. GOI filed an Appeal under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, against the Final Award of the Arbitral Tribunal on 15 th November, 2018 before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court. The Appeal is currently being heard before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court.\n- (b)    Arbitration was initiated by BG Exploration and Production India Limited and RIL (together the Claimants) against GOI on 16 th December, 2010 under the PSCs for Panna - Mukta and Tapti blocks due to difference in interpretation of certain PSC provisions between Claimants and GOI. The Arbitral Tribunal by majority issued a final partial award ('2016 FPA'), and separately, two dissenting opinions in the matter on 12 th October, 2016. Claimants challenged certain parts of the 2016 FPA before the English Courts, which delivered its judgment on 16 th April, 2018 and remitted one of the challenged issues back to the Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration. The Arbitral Tribunal decided in favour of the Claimants in large part vide its final partial award dated 1 st October, 2018 ('2018 FPA'). GOI and Claimants filed an appeal before the English Commercial Court against this 2018 FPA. The English Commercial Court rejected GOI's challenges to 2018 FPA and upheld Claimants' challenge in February 2020 and remitted the underlying issue in challenge back to the Arbitration Tribunal for determination. On 29 th January, 2021 the Tribunal issued a further final partial award on the remitted matter and GOI has challenged the same before the English Commercial Court. Claimants have filed an application before the Arbitral Tribunal seeking increase in the PSC Cost Recovery Limits and the same is sub-judice. Arbitral Tribunal is yet to schedule the final re-computation of accounts phase of the arbitration, which will take place post determination of Claimants' request for increase in cost recovery limit under the PSCs.\n\nGOI has also filed an execution petition before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court under sections 47 and 49 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 seeking enforcement and execution of the 2016 FPA, ignoring the judgments of English High Court and the subsequent Tribunal Awards.  The Claimants contend that GOI's Execution Petition is not maintainable. GOI's Execution Petition is currently sub judice before Delhi High Court.\n\n- (c)   NTPC had filed a suit for specific performance of a contract for supply of natural gas by RIL before the Hon'ble Bombay High Court. The main issue in dispute is whether a valid, concluded and binding contract exists between the parties for supply of Natural Gas of 132 Trillion BTU annually for a period of 17 years. The matter is presently sub judice and RIL is of the view that NTPC's claim lacks merit and no binding contract for supply of gas was executed between NTPC and RIL.\n\nConsidering the complexity of above issues, the Company is of the view that any attempt for quantification of possible exposure to the Company will have an effect of prejudicing Company's legal position in the ongoing arbitration/ litigations. Moreover, the Company considers above demand/disputes as remote.",

(III) On December 16, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued a show cause notice ('SCN') inter alia to the Company (RIL) in connection with the trades by RIL in the stock exchanges in 2007 in the shares of Reliance Petroleum Limited, then a subsidiary of RIL. Hearings were held before the Whole Time Member ('WTM') of SEBI in respect of the SCN. By an order dated March 24, 2017, the WTM passed the directions: (i) prohibiting inter alia RIL from dealing in equity derivatives in the 'Futures & Options' segment of stock exchanges, directly or indirectly, for a period of one year from the date of the order; and (ii) to RIL to disgorge an amount of ' 447 crore along with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from November 29, 2007 till the date of payment. In May 2017, RIL and the other noticees filed an appeal before the Securities Appellate Tribunal ('SAT') against this order. SAT, by a majority order (2:1), dismissed the appeal on November 5, 2020 and directed RIL to pay the disgorged amount within sixty days from the date of the order. The appeal of RIL and other noticees has been admitted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. By its order dated December 17, 2020, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India directed RIL to deposit ' 250 crore in the Investors' Protection Fund, subject to the final result of the appeal and stayed the recovery of the balance, inclusive of interest, pending the appeal. RIL has complied with the order dated December 17, 2020 of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.\n- (IV) Hathway Cable and Datacom Limited has received Show Cause cum Demand Notices ('SCNs') from the Department of Telecommunications ('DOT'), Government of India for the financial years from 2006-07 to 2019-20 towards license fees aggregating to ' 3,587 crore which includes penalty and interest thereon.

and\n\nLevel 3: Inputs based on unobservable market data.\n\nValuation Methodology\n\nAll financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently re-measured at fair value as described below:\n\n- a)   The fair value of investment in quoted Equity Shares, Bonds, Government Securities, Treasury Bills, Certificate of Deposits and Mutual Funds is measured at quoted price or NAV.\n- b)   The fair value of Interest Rate Swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves.\n- c)   The fair value of Forward Foreign Exchange contracts and Currency Swaps is determined using observable forward exchange rates and yield curves at the balance sheet date.\n- d)   The fair value of over-the-counter Foreign Currency Option contracts is determined using the Black Scholes valuation model.\n- e)   Commodity derivative contracts are valued using available information in markets and quotations from exchange, brokers and price index developers.\n- f) The fair value for Level 3 instruments is valued using inputs based on information about market participants assumptions and other data that are available.\n- g)   The fair value of the remaining financial instruments is determined using discounted cash flow analysis.\n- h)  All foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rate at reporting date.\n\n## B. Financial Risk Management\n\nThe Group's activities expose it to variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Within the boundaries of approved Risk Management Policy framework The Group uses derivative instruments to manage the volatility of financial markets and minimize the adverse impact on its financial performance.\n\n## i) Market Risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk and commodity risk.\n\n## a)  Foreign Currency Risk\n\nForeign Currency Risk is the risk that the Fair Value or Future Cash Flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign currency rates.

The Group issues debt in a variety of currencies based on market opportunities and it uses derivatives to hedge interest rate exposures.\n\nThe exposure of the Group's borrowings and derivatives to interest rate changes at the end of the reporting period are as follows:\n\n|                                                        | ( '  in crore)           | ( '  in crore)           |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                                        | Interest Rate Exposure   | Interest Rate Exposure   |\n|                                                        | As at   31st March, 2022 | As at   31st March, 2021 |\n| Borrowings                                             |                          |                          |\n| Non-Current - Floating (Includes Current Maturities) * | 96,097                   | 91,399                   |\n| Non-Current - Fixed (Includes Current Maturities) *    | 1,19,723                 | 1,01,143                 |\n| Current  #                                             | 52,178                   | 60,371                   |\n| Total                                                  | 2,67,998                 | 2,52,913                 |\n| Derivatives                                            |                          |                          |\n| Foreign Currency Interest Rate Swaps                   | 7,712                    | 33,279                   |\n| Rupees Interest Rate Swaps                             | 54,845                   | 19,450                   |\n| Currency Swaps  ^                                      | -                        | 2,655                    |\n\n- * Includes ' 1,053 crore (Previous Year ' 812 crore) as Prepaid Financial Charges and ' 48 crore as revaluation gain.\n- ^ Receive fix in INR and pay floating in USD\n- # Includes ' 592 crore (Previous Year ' 290 crore) as Commercial Paper Discount.\n\n## ii) Commodity Price Risk\n\nCommodity price risk arises due to fluctuation in prices of crude oil, other feed stock and products and bullion. The Group has a risk management framework aimed at prudently managing the risk arising from the volatility in commodity prices and freight costs.\n\nThe Group's commodity price risk is managed centrally through well-established trading operations and control processes. In accordance with the risk management policy, the Group enters into various transactions using derivatives and uses over-the-counter as well as Exchange Traded Futures, Options and Swap contracts to hedge its commodity and freight exposure.",

Credit risk arises from Group's activities in investments, dealing in derivatives and receivables from customers and other financial instruments. The Group ensures that sales of products are made to customers with appropriate creditworthiness. Credit information is regularly shared between businesses and finance function, with a framework in place to quickly identify, respond and recognise cases of credit deterioration.\n\nThe Group has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business activities. Credit risk across the Group, is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent Group Guarantees, advance payments, security deposits and factoring and forfaiting without recourse to Group. The Group restricts its fixed income investments in liquid securities carrying high credit rating.\n\n## iv)  Liquidity Risk\n\nLiquidity risk arises from the Group's inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The Group maintains sufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The Group accesses global and local financial markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to ensure efficient funding from across well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Group's cash flow position and ensures that the Group is able to meet its financial obligation at all times including contingencies.\n\nThe Group's liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. Treasury pools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net deficit or invest the net surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank deposits, money market funds, reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to avoid concentration risk in any one instrument or counterparty.\n\n## ( ' in crore)\n\n## ( ' in crore)\n\n|                           | Below 3  Months   | 3-6 Months   | 6-12  Months   | 1-3 Years   | 3-5 Years   | Above 5  Years   | Total    |\n|---------------------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|----------|\n| Borrowings                |                   |              |                |             |             |                  |          |\n| Non-Current  #@           | 2,266             | 6,715        | 18,207         | 81,494      | 44,682      | 62,456           | 2,15,820 |\n| Current  ^                | 39,736            | 11,228       | 1,214          | -

Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Group's business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and other feedstock, refined products, precious metals, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Group has adopted a structured risk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved hedge accounting framework which allows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange traded futures and options, over-the-counter swaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve this objective.\n\nThere is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method and Dollar offset method.\n\nThe hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:\n\n- -Differences in the timing of the cash flows.\n- -Different indexes (and accordingly different curves).\n- -The counterparties' credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements.\n\nThe table below shows the position of hedging instruments and hedged items as on the balance sheet date:\n\n## Disclosure of effects of hedge accounting\n\n- A.
