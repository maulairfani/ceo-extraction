This purpose has guided us over the past 12 months as, despite the many challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, our people went the extra mile to ensure we could provide affordable and reliable energy to our customers. We thank our teams for this dedication.\n\nThis year we focused on our position as a leader for positive change with our Where all good change starts campaign. Origin's strategy is all about that positive change as we connect our customers to the energy and technologies of the future and lead the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nTo lead that change, Origin has a team of close to 5,000 people across Australia and the Pacific. That team includes Kurt Logan, who features on the front cover of this report. Kurt is a technician at our Condabri facility in Queensland, which as part of our Australia Pacific LNG joint venture, supplies around 30 per cent of Australia's east coast gas demand.\n\n## Progress on our commitments\n\nOrigin's FY2021 financial performance reflected a strong operational position against the headwinds of volatile commodities markets for electricity, natural gas and oil. Against this backdrop of economic uncertainty resulting from the pandemic, we demonstrated the strength of our diversified model: Integrated Gas with its gas production and exploration and Energy Markets with its position in generation and as a multi-product retailer with energy and broadband services.\n\nOur focus on capital discipline and cost management allowed us to balance the priorities of paying down debt and delivering dividends to shareholders, while continuing to invest in targeted growth opportunities.\n\nFor the full year, Origin announced a statutory loss of $2,291 million, primarily comprising $2,247 million in non-cash charges, including impairments and a deferred tax liability. Our Underlying Profit of $318 million reflected lower commodity prices in the Energy Markets and Integrated Gas divisions. This was partially offset by lower operating costs for Australia Pacific LNG, retail cost savings, lower interest expense and oil hedging gains.\n\nOrigin's Free Cash Flow remained robust at $1,140 million, enabling debt reduction of $519 million, while allowing for investment in growth and an unfranked final dividend of 7.5 cents per share.\n\nIn the gas growth assets, we continued exploration activities in the prospective Beetaloo and Canning basins. Our future fuels activities gathered momentum, with a number of hydrogen feasibility projects including a green ammonia export project in Tasmania's Bell Bay expected to be completed by the end of 2021.",

        "page_content": "Origin is progressing work on updating our existing emissions reduction targets consistent with a 1.5 degree pathway. Our longterm aim is to achieve net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2050, and as part of that ambition we introduced a short-term target to reduce our Scope 1 emissions by an average of 10 per cent per annum between FY2021 and FY2023, from a 2017 baseline. This target is linked to executive remuneration, and in FY2021 we achieved an 11 per cent decline in Scope 1 emissions compared to the baseline.\n\n## Our business performance\n\nIn Integrated Gas, Australia Pacific LNG maintained production of 263 petajoules (Origin share) driven by outstanding field performance, associated capital expenditure reductions and further improvements in operational efficiency. Underlying EBITDA was $1,135 million - a 35 per cent reduction on the prior year, primarily due to lower realised oil prices that were partially offset by lower costs.\n\nAustralia Pacific LNG's performance was a standout, safely curtailing output when the market was subdued, and rapidly ramping up production when demand recovered. In FY2021, Australia Pacific LNG matched previous daily production records and shipped a record 130 cargoes for the year.\n\nAcross Energy Markets, lower electricity gross profit was driven primarily by the impact of lower wholesale prices on tariffs, higher network and metering costs, and assistance provided to customers adversely affected by the pandemic. This was partially offset by a reduction in the cost of energy. Lower gas margins were driven by a combination of lower gas tariffs, the roll-off of long-term capacity contracts and higher supply costs. Underlying EBITDA for Energy Markets was $991 million, down 32 per cent on the prior year.\n\nIn our Retail business our Strategic Net Promoter Score reached a record high and customer accounts increased by 30,000 through our Everyday Rewards plan and growth segments, including solar, broadband and community energy services. Our investment in Octopus Energy continues to exceed expectations. The rollout of the Octopus customer service platform, Kraken, gathered momentum with more than 250,000 customers benefiting from improved customer service. We continue to lead the industry on cost performance, achieving $110 million in savings since 2018 and we will achieve further savings as the Kraken rollout progresses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Outlook\n\nIn our full-year results, we gave guidance to Underlying EBITDA in FY2022 of between $1,850-$2,150 million, compared to $2,048 million in FY2021. This reflects weaker performance from Energy Markets largely offset by an expected stronger contribution from Australia Pacific LNG.\n\nWe anticipate that challenging conditions for our Energy Markets business will continue this year, ahead of a rebound in FY2023 if current forward prices continue and flow through to tariffs.\n\nAustralia Pacific LNG is expected to achieve a distribution breakeven of between US$20-US$25 a barrel. With realised prices expected to improve in FY2022 due to the lag in oil price flowing through to long-term contract prices, it is estimated that net cash flows from Australia Pacific LNG to Origin will be greater than $1 billion in FY2022.\n\nAs always, guidance is provided on the basis that market conditions and the regulatory environment do not materially change, and is subject to the potential ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on demand and customer affordability.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nScott Perkins became Chairman at our Annual General Meeting in October 2020, after five years as a director. We were pleased to welcome Ilana Atlas, Mick McCormack and Joan Withers to the Board as independent Non-executive Directors. Their contribution to the Board has already proven invaluable. We thank Gordon Cairns, our previous Chairman, and Teresa Engelhard for their dedication to Origin during their directorships.\n\nAs we enter Origin's third decade, we are excited by the possibilities that will come with the energy transition and look forward to supporting our customers while continuing to play our part in reducing Australia's emissions. Origin's business model is well placed to prosper in a low-carbon world. As shareholders we hope you share our excitement for the future.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming many of you to this year's Annual General Meeting on 20 October, which will again be held virtually in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThank you for your continued support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScott Perkins Chairman\n\nFrank Calabria\n\nChief Executive Officer",

In FY2021, we:\n\n- \u00b7 continued supporting residential and small business customers in financial distress due to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including protection from disconnection and default listing;\n- \u00b7 provided relief to most of our electricity customers in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria, with lower electricity prices;\n- \u00b7 supported customers experiencing financial hardship, with more than 35,300 payment plans successfully completed through our Power On hardship program;\n- \u00b7 improved our Strategic Net Promoter Score (NPS) by four points to +6 as at 30 June 2021;\n- \u00b7 successfully migrated more than 250,000 customer accounts to the Kraken platform;\n- \u00b7 delivered over $1 million in rewards to the more than 56,000 Origin Spike customers;\n- \u00b7 increased the number of green energy customers from 117,000 to 260,000 with the launch of Origin's new Origin Go product, which enables customers to benefit from 25 per cent GreenPower and 100 per cent Green Gas at no additional cost; and\n- \u00b7 APLNG continues to supply ~30 per cent of domestic east coast market.\n\n## Getting energy right for our communities\n\nWe respect the rights and interests of the communities in which we operate, and consult with them to understand and manage our impact.\n\nWe spent $270 million directly and indirectly with regional suppliers, or 18 per cent of our total spend, up from 14 per cent in FY2020.\n\nOur Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan (Stretch RAP) includes a commitment to increase the participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander businesses in Origin's supply chain. In FY2021, our spend with Indigenous suppliers was $10 million, exceeding our Stretch RAP target of $6.5 million and FY2020 performance of $5.3 million.\n\nWe continue to work closely with the Northern Land Council to engage with and maintain the support of our Native Title holders in the Beetaloo Basin. During the year, some of our Native Title holders visited the Kyalla well site near Daly Waters during fracking operations. We also undertook sacred site clearance and avoidance surveys for future work, and participated in meetings on country about our upcoming work program.\n\nThrough grants, 8,400 hours of employee volunteering, and our workplace giving program, the Origin Energy Foundation contributed over $3 million to the community in FY2021. This included a $100,000 grant to the Grattan Institute to research the impacts of home-schooling, due to COVID-19, on disadvantaged students.\n\nFor the second year running, Origin Energy was named Australia's Best Workplace to Give Back , topping GoodCompany's list of the Top 40 Best Workplaces to Give Back 2020. Origin and its employees donated more than $690,000 to over 250 Australia not-for-profit organisations in FY2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We aim to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050. Work is progressing on updated emissions reduction targets in line with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway.\n\nWe have announced our intention to put our climate reporting to a nonbinding, advisory vote of shareholders at our 2022 Annual General Meeting.\n\nDuring FY2021, we:\n\n- \u00b7 reduced our Scope 1 and 2 equity emissions by 1.4 million tonnes, or 8 per cent;\n- \u00b7 installed 74 MW of solar on Australian homes and businesses, up from 61 MW in FY2020;\n- \u00b7 launched Origin 360 EV Fleet, the first full-service electric vehicle (EV) fleet management solution of its kind in Australia;\n- \u00b7 progressed our renewable hydrogen and renewable ammonia opportunities, including a feasibility study in Bell Bay, Tasmania;\n- \u00b7 were certified carbon neutral by Climate Active for our Green Gas and Green LPG products; and\n- \u00b7 entered into a new agreement to supply 900,000 tonnes of ash from Eraring Power Station to mining company Glencore over the next two and a half years, almost doubling Eraring's ash re-use program.\n\nOur disclosures under the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure guidelines will be set out in our Climate Change Management Approach, to be released in September 2021.\n\n## Our people\n\nOur people are one of our greatest strengths, and having a diverse and inclusive workplace is key to the success of our business. We have made significant changes to the way we work in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and Origin's culture has strengthened during this time. During FY2021, we:\n\n- \u00b7 maintained a steady engagement score of 74 per cent, keeping Origin in the top quartile across Australia and New Zealand;\n- \u00b7 kept Actual Serious Incidents steady at four, with 52 Learning Incidents, ahead of our target of 30;\n- \u00b7 maintained a steady TRIFR score of 2.7, compared to 2.6 in FY2020;\n- \u00b7 achieved our target of 33 per cent of women in senior roles in FY2021, an increase from 32 per cent in the previous reporting period;\n- \u00b7 were certified a Great Place to Work by the Great Place to Work Institute, the global authority on workplace culture; and\n- \u00b7 were named in LinkedIn's annual list of Australia's 'Top Companies' - ranked at number 19.\n\nIn July 2021, Origin became a signatory to 40:40 Vision , an investor-led initiative targeting gender balance in executive leadership by 2030. As part of the 40:40 Vision initiative, we have committed to achieve gender balance (40:40:20) in executive leadership by 2030.\n\nWe have focused on supporting the mental health and well being of our people in FY2021 and continued to develop a range of resources and programs.\n\nWe also launched a range of diversity learning programs for our people in FY2021, including the Embrace Pride@Origin Learning Platform and our cultural awareness learning framework to build awareness of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures, histories and achievements.",

The impact in domestic energy markets was exacerbated by mild summer weather, continued growth in renewables and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nUnderlying Profit was lower at $318 million with Energy Markets impacted by lower wholesale prices, one-off network costs, roll-off of legacy contracts, higher gas supply costs, and increased amortisation expense. Earnings from APLNG were impacted by a lower realised oil price, partially offset by lower operating costs, depreciation and amortisation, interest expense and Origin hedging gains. Statutory Loss of $2,291 million reflected non-cash impairment charges, recognition of a deferred tax liability in respect of our investment in APLNG, unrealised losses on fair value and FX movements, and costs relating to a decision to defer the surrender of large-scale generation certificates (LGCs).\n\nDuring the period our operations continued to perform reliably and efficiently. Our generation fleet met all demand requirements with minimal unforced outages, managing through recent volatility driven by unplanned outages within the NEM and colder weather through the June 2021 quarter. APLNG responded to recovering market demand with record daily production achieved on two occasions in FY2021. APLNG also delivered record low unit costs driven by strong field performance and operational efficiencies. APLNG's realised oil price reduced to US$43/bbl as the price lag in its long-term LNG contracts meant that the April and May 2020 low crude oil prices flowed through into FY2021.\n\nFree Cash Flow remained robust at $1,140 million, driven by a high cash conversion in Energy Markets due to lower working capital requirements, $709 million cash distributions from APLNG, lower capital expenditure, and lower interest and tax payments. This enabled debt reduction of $519 million while allowing for investment in growth and dividends to shareholders. Adjusted Net Debt/Adjusted Underlying EBITDA was 2.9x, at the upper end of our 2.0-3.0x target range, as foreshadowed.\n\nOur strategic partnership with Octopus Energy to radically transform our retail operations is progressing, with 250,000 customer accounts migrated to the new Kraken platform by June 2021. Through our 20 per cent shareholding, Origin also benefits from Octopus's continuing growth trajectory, with UK customer accounts growing at more than 100,000 per month on average since our investment and through Octopus's entry into the Japanese market in partnership with Tokyo Gas.\n\nWe progressed upstream exploration and appraisal in the Beetaloo and Cooper-Eromanga basins and in late 2020 we announced a farm in to seven permits in the prospective Canning Basin.",

The reduction in Energy Markets' Underlying EBITDA was primarily due to this decline in wholesale prices, as well as impacts of increased network and metering costs not recovered in regulated tariffs, higher gas supply costs and the roll-off of certain gas supply and transport capacity sales contracts. This was partially offset by reduced retail costs with our savings target achieved, and increased earnings from Solar and Energy Services, and Octopus Energy. Operating cash flow decreased in the period, reflecting the lower EBITDA; however, EBITDA to cash conversion was strong at 103 per cent.\n\nOur peaking generation portfolio is well positioned for the energy transition and we continue to explore opportunities that would further improve our flexibility and capacity, including grid-scale storage and pumped hydro. We are also changing the way we run Eraring to better position it for increasing renewables. While current market and policy conditions make investment challenging, our longer-term view remains that as coal generation exits, new firm and flexible generation capacity will be required to complement increasing renewable generation. We will look to partner with governments and other market participants as opportunities arise.\n\nOur gas portfolio remains a strength with scale and flexibility to move gas to where it is needed most. In May, we announced 91 PJ in gas supply and transport agreements to materially increase supply to customers in southern markets out to 2025.\n\nIn a competitive retail market, we increased customer accounts by 30,000 and maintained a churn rate of 4.8 per cent below the market, for electricity and gas customers. We continue to see growth in Community Energy Services (CES), Solar, Storage and Broadband. Our broadband product has been boosted by a new partnership with Aussie Broadband.\n\nWe delivered on our $100 million savings target, having reduced cost to serve by $110 million since FY2018, of which $81 million was achieved in FY2021. 1 Our retail transformation program is focused on leading customer experience at the lowest cost, growing new revenue streams and offering simplified, rewarding and flexible products. We achieved our highest ever strategic NPS of +6 as at 30 June 2021 and we continue to provide support to customers impacted by COVID-19.\n\nOur partnership with Octopus Energy will accelerate our strategy to deliver superior customer experience at low cost, while opening up growth opportunities. We have established a new business (Retail X) to undertake a bottom-up build of Octopus's operating model, technology platform (Kraken) and distinctive culture. We migrated 250,000 customer accounts to Retail X in FY2021 and are targeting further capital and operating cost savings of $100 to $150 million by FY2024, from FY2018 baseline.",

APLNG demonstrated its operational flexibility by curtailing production early in the year in response to lower demand, followed by a ramp-up to record daily production as market demand increased later in the year. With continued improvement in utilisation of processing capacity driven by Eurombah Reedy Creek Interconnect (ERIC) pipeline and Talinga Orana Gas Gathering Station (TOGGS), and a high level of facility reliability, the remainder of the year saw production levels similar to FY2020.\n\nAPLNG achieved record low capital and operating expenditure, decreasing by more than $940 million or 32 per cent compared with FY2020. This was driven by strong field performance enabling reduced development activity with fewer drilling rigs, along with lower infrastructure spend, as well as lower gas purchases, royalties, tariffs and exploration spend. Total capital and operating expenditure in FY2021 was $2.8/GJ. 1\n\nAPLNG matched its previous operated daily production record of 1,614 TJ/day on two occasions, shipped its 600th LNG cargo, and delivered a record 130 cargoes in FY2021.\n\nOrigin's share of APLNG 2P (proved plus probable) reserves 2 increased by 247 PJ or 6 per cent before production, representing reserves replacement of 94 per cent during FY2021, driven by higher estimated recoveries from producing fields and maturation of resources to reserves.\n\nDespite APLNG's strong operational performance, Integrated Gas's Underlying EBITDA reduced primarily due a decline in the realised oil price from US$68/bbl (A$101/bbl) in FY2020 to US$43/bbl (A$58/bbl) in FY2021, partially offset by Origin oil hedging gains.\n\nOther highlights across Integrated Gas during the period included:\n\n- \u00b7 fracture stimulation and initial flowback and production testing undertaken at the Kyalla 117 well in the Beetaloo Basin with encouraging results that met the objective to flow liquid-rich gas. Operations were temporarily paused in July to investigate a potential downhole flow restriction, with an extended production test planned to commence in FY2022. Velkerri 76 well was spudded and a further production test at the Amungee NW 1H well, drilled in 2016, commenced in August;\n- \u00b7 drilling the Obelix-2 vertical exploration well to test the maturity of the Toolebuc Formation in the Cooper-Eromanga Basin, with positive initial analysis of log and core data;\n- \u00b7 announcing a farm-in with Buru Energy for a 40-50 per cent equity share in seven permits in the prospective Canning Basin, where Origin will fund an estimated $35 million work program over two years; and\n- \u00b7 progressing a number of hydrogen and renewable fuels projects, including a feasibility study into an export-scale renewable ammonia plant in Tasmania's Bell Bay, an export-scale project in Townsville with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Port of Townsville, and the Western Sydney Green Gas Project. In addition, a joint feasibility study on opportunities to develop the supply chain for export-scale renewable ammonia with the signing of MOUs with Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. (MOL) and POSCO.\n- 1 Opex excludes purchases and reflects royalties at the breakeven oil price.\n- 2 APLNG acquired various CSG interests from Tri-Star in 2002 that are subject to reversionary rights and an ongoing royalty interest in favour of Tri-Star.

        "page_content": "## 2 Strategy and prospects\n\n## Our business drivers\n\nAs a leading integrated energy company, Origin's earnings drivers are spread across the energy value chain.\n\nOur electricity margin is predominantly driven by outperforming the market cost of energy through our supply portfolio (power stations and supply contracts). Although Origin generates less electricity than it sells, a significant portion of its wholesale costs are relatively fixed, and so margins are leveraged to movements in wholesale market prices as they flow through into retail tariffs.\n\nIn natural gas, Origin's wholesale margin is driven by a strong gas supply portfolio, with pipeline and storage flexibility enabling us to direct gas to where it is most needed. A large portion of supply is under long-term contracts that are either fixed-price or linked to oil and Japan Korea Marker (JKM) prices, some of which reprice to market over time.\n\nProfitability in energy retailing is driven by attracting and retaining customers by providing a superior customer experience and lowcost service.\n\nOrigin is the upstream operator and has a 37.5 per cent interest in APLNG, which is Australia's largest CSG to LNG project. It is a significant supplier to both domestic gas and international LNG markets, with the majority of volume contracted until approximately 2035. Profitability is underpinned by maintaining a low annual capital and operating cost base relative to revenues. In FY2021, approximately 76 per cent of APLNG gas volume was sold as LNG (of which 90 per cent was under long-term oil-linked contracts). The remaining 24 per cent was sold domestically via a mix of long-term and short-term contracts.\n\nOrigin is focused on supporting our customers through the energy transition with a growing portfolio of clean energy solutions and technologies, including solar, batteries, e-mobility, hydrogen, carbon offsets and demand management, all of which are expected to grow in scale as the energy system decarbonises.\n\n## Market outlook\n\nThe energy market is transforming, and the rate of change is accelerating. Renewable energy continues to grow both in our homes and on the grid, placing downward pressure on wholesale electricity prices and changing the shape of energy supply and demand throughout the day and over the year. Governments are increasingly intervening in markets through direct investments and pricing outcomes which places further pressure on prices and private investments in the sector. Our customers' expectations are also changing dramatically, demanding integrated energy and emissions offerings and becoming market participants themselves with a wider choice of technologies to use, store and manage energy.\n\nFY2021 saw a disconnect between domestic east coast gas prices and the regional JKM index as domestic markets were temporarily oversupplied and regional markets tightened with an extreme Northern hemisphere winter and supply constraints. This, along with the impact of COVID-19, led to lower domestic sales volumes and prices, and higher supply costs linked to JKM. The impact is expected to flow into FY2022; however we expect east coast gas prices to reconnect with the regional JKM index over the medium term.\n\nInternational oil and LNG markets rebounded from the low COVID-19 levels experienced last year, reflecting tightened supply and demand dynamics. The LNG market is also benefiting from short-term market tightness driven by the severe Northern hemisphere winter and supply bottlenecks however this is expected to normalise over the next 12 months.\n\nIn the longer term, we continue to expect global trends towards decarbonisation, decentralisation and digitisation to shape energy markets.\n\n## We expect:\n\n- \u00b7 continued increases in large and small-scale renewable energy will maintain downward pressure on average electricity prices, but will also increase volatility and the need for more reliable, dispatchable ('firming') capacity such as flexible gas-fired generation and battery storage, which Origin is well placed to supply;\n- \u00b7 increased electrification over time, particularly in transportation in the near term;\n- \u00b7 current supply constraints in global LNG markets to ease over the next 12 months as liquefaction utilisation rates rise and new supply commences production; and\n- \u00b7 retail markets to remain competitive, but with improved transparency due to market reference bill requirements.\n\nIt is in this context that we continue to evolve our strategy to capture value in a future shaped by these global trends.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As coal is retired and use of renewables increases, the market will require investment in reliability. We are progressing a range of brownfield generation opportunities, including batteries and pumped hydro, which would further improve our flexibility and capacity to support the increase in renewables. Subject to market signals and regulatory certainty, we could quickly implement these at the appropriate time.",

Strong field performance and operatorship enabled APLNG to reduce development activity and costs while continuing to meet the needs of customers. APLNG remains focused on key value drivers such as workover and well unit rate savings, and production optimisation.\n\nBeyond APLNG, our strategy is to scale our low-cost upstream operating model to new development opportunities. In the Beetaloo Basin, we have a 77.5 per cent interest and operatorship of three exploration permits covering 18,500km 2 , with appraisal of two independent liquids-rich gas plays underway and plans to retest a dry gas play. We are considering farm-down options for Beetaloo in parallel to our appraisal activities.\n\nWe have a 75 per cent interest and operatorship of five permits located in the Cooper-Eromanga Basin in south west Queensland, and have recently acquired 100 per cent interest in one additional permit. In December 2020, we farmed-in to a 40-50 per cent equity share in seven permits in the Canning Basin. Additional prospective conventional and unconventional oil and gas plays are planned to be tested in these areas.\n\n## The right technologies\n\nEnergy markets around the world are rapidly transforming towards low-cost renewables and new digital technologies, and Australia is no exception. Continued penetration of decentralised generation and storage, combined with the rise of internet-enabled devices, is changing the way our customers interact with us and use energy at home and in their businesses. We are developing a leading digital platform and analytics capability to connect millions of distributed assets and data points to provide more personalised and value-add services to our customers, both in front of and behind the meter.\n\nWe have developed a proprietary Virtual Power Plant (VPP) platform to connect, and use artificial intelligence to orchestrate, distributed assets such as air-conditioning units, batteries, hot water systems and EV chargers. Through this platform, we have more than 159 MW from 79,000 connected services. We expect this to increase as we demonstrate the benefits to both customers and to the grid of optimising these distributed assets at critical times of market volatility.\n\nWe are also working with other businesses to source technical solutions and capabilities. We are co-founders of the Free Electrons global energy group, which brings together global utilities and leading start-ups looking to deploy new technology. The program has yielded a number of important partnerships, including with US based OhmConnect, the startup behind our behavioural demand response program, Spike, which launched in August 2020.\n\nOrigin is also pursuing opportunities in low-carbon technologies such as hydrogen, e-mobility, and carbon management.\n\nIn terms of hydrogen, Origin's integrated energy position provides it with a competitive strength in producing renewable hydrogen and ammonia using renewable energy and sustainable water. Hydrogen and ammonia demand is forecast to grow, allowing countries to reduce emissions and diversify fuel supply.\n\nIn terms of e-mobility, we provide charging solutions and infrastructure, and have launched a smart charging trial with ARENA aimed at optimising the charging of EVs to create value for customers and the energy markets as well as Origin 360 EV Fleet, Australia's first fully managed end-to-end EV fleet management proposition.\n\n## The right customer solutions\n\nOrigin is one of Australia's largest energy retailers by number of customer accounts, and is well placed to harness opportunities to deliver value to customers in a changing energy landscape.\n\nCustomers are at the heart of everything we do, and our immediate focus is to transform their experience to make it simple, seamless and increasingly digital.\n\nIn the near term, we are focused on delivering a superior customer experience, a market-leading cost position, and growing our product offerings including solar, CES and broadband.\n\nOur strategic partnership with Octopus Energy, is expected to fast-track our strategy to deliver a superior customer experience at even lower cost, while opening up future growth opportunities.",

A change of US$10/bbl for the remaining 50 per cent is estimated to impact Origin Underlying EBITDA by ~A$120 million.\n\nInterest expense is estimated to reduce by a further $40-60 million in FY2022.\n\nCapital expenditure is estimated to be $370 - $410 million, including $75 - $85 million exploration and appraisal spend primarily relating to Beetaloo and Canning basins. This excludes $210 - $220 million in investments relating primarily to the Octopus equity investment.\n\n## Energy Markets\n\nWe estimate Energy Markets Underlying EBITDA to be lower than FY2021 at $450 - $600 million, driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 Electricity Gross Profit reduction of $400 - $480 million primarily driven by a ~$20/MWh reduction in wholesale electricity prices flowing into customer tariffs, higher generation fuel costs and continued impacts of rooftop solar uptake and energy efficiencies. This is partially offset by lower wholesale electricity procurement costs with low-cost renewable supply coming online and capacity hedge contracts rolling off;\n- \u00b7 Natural Gas Gross Profit reduction of up to $50 million, reflecting higher procurement costs as a result of price reviews and increases in the JKM-linked supply costs, as well as lower volumes and prices on commercial and industrial sales, offset by repricing of retail customer tariffs; and\n- \u00b7 Cost to serve expected to be relatively stable, having achieved $110 million reduction from FY2018. Further savings associated with the adoption of Octopus' Kraken platform and operating model are expected over FY2023-24.\n\nWe expect a recovery in Energy Markets Underlying EBITDA in FY2023 of an estimated $150 - $250 million 1 , to $600 - $850 million provided current forward commodity prices continue and flow into customer tariffs.\n\n## Integrated Gas\n\nWe estimate continued stable production in FY2022 of 685 - 710 PJ (APLNG 100 per cent), reflecting strong field performance.\n\nWe estimate total APLNG capex and opex of $2.1 - $2.3 billion , higher than FY2021, reflecting planned downstream maintenance, higher non-operated development and infrastructure spend, increased E&A activity and workover, and higher power costs.\n\nAPLNG is targeting FY2022 distribution breakeven of US$20 - 25/boe , including approximately US$11/boe in project finance costs, with increased activity costs expected to be offset by higher non-oil linked revenue.\n\nBased on an APLNG realised oil price of US$68/bbl in FY2022, cash flows to Origin are estimated to be greater than $1 billion 2 , net of oil hedging . At 28 July 2021, Origin estimates that approximately half of APLNG's FY2022 JCC oil price exposure has been priced at US$68/bbl, based on the long-term LNG contract lags. See Section 5.2.2 for details of Integrated Gas oil hedging and LNG trading.\n\n- 1 Based on current forward prices for key commodities such as electricity, coal and oil. Assuming JKM prices reduce by US$2-US$3/mmbtu from current forward prices, and assuming no material change in sales volumes and other costs.\n- 2 Assuming an average AUD/USD rate of 0.75 and assuming all APLNG debt serviceability tests are met. Origin hedges losses estimated to be $134 million based on the same assumptions. As at 28 July 2021, ~31 mmboe (or 50%) of APLNG's FY2022 oil price exposure priced at ~US$68/bblbefore hedging.",

The ordinary dividends will be unfranked until APLNG starts paying income tax, which is not expected until later in the decade given existing tax losses held by APLNG.\n\nTypically, when in receipt of unfranked dividends, the income tax expense would be recognised in the year the dividend is received. However, as Origin had an unrecognised deferred tax liability in respect of our investment in APLNG, accounting standards require recognition of a deferred tax expense provided certain criteria are met.\n\nA deferred tax liability arises when the accounting cost base of an asset is higher than the tax cost base, resulting from a temporary difference. The carrying value of our investment in APLNG is significantly higher than the tax cost base, primarily as a result of our equity accounted share of retained profits to date.\n\nConsistent with accounting standards, the deferred tax liability has not been recognised historically because\n\n- 1. Origin is able to control the timing of distributions from APLNG which would reverse the temporary difference; and\n- 2. it has not been probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future via dividends paid from current retained earnings, capital returns or a disposal.\n\nAs it is now probable that APLNG will begin to distribute cash to shareholders via dividends in the coming years, Origin has recognised a deferred tax liability of $669 million in FY2021 representing 30 per cent of the dividends expected to be paid in the foreseeable future from the existing equity accounted retained earnings based on current market assumptions, including future oil prices.\n\nRecognition of the deferred tax liability only impacts the timing of accounting for the tax expense and has no impact on the underlying economics or cash flows. There is a remaining unrecognised deferred tax liability at 30 June 2021 of $810 million which may be partly or fully recognised in the future.\n\nGoing forward, when Origin receives unfranked dividends from APLNG, the proportion paid from earnings in that year will still incur tax expense, and the balance attributable to retained earnings will result in partial utilisation of the deferred tax liability.\n\n## 4.3 Accounting for large-scale generation certificate trading strategy\n\nSupply and demand for large-scale generation certificates (LGCs) is driven by the rate of new renewable projects coming online, voluntary demand for carbon offsets as well as the compliance obligations under the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET). Renewable project delays and generation curtailments have led to a near-term tightening of the LGC market. However, it is expected that the 33 TWh legislated target will be exceeded and longer term the market will be oversupplied. The Clean Energy Regulator has acknowledged this and provides the option for parties to shift demand from periods of tight supply by deferring the surrender of certificates to later years. Under the scheme, parties can defer up to 10 per cent of their obligation at no additional cost and can defer more than 10 per cent by incurring a shortfall charge of $65 per certificate that is refundable provided the LGCs are surrendered within three years. The refund is currently tax assessable; however legislative change is before Parliament that would make refunds non-assessable (such that it is aligned to treatment of the shortfall charge).\n\nThis presents an economic opportunity with the LGC forward curve in backwardation and, as previously disclosed, Origin elected to defer surrender of 2.5 million 2020 calendar year certificates in February 2021. Origin now expects to also defer approximately 3.1 million 2021 calendar year certificates due for surrender in February 2022.\n\nDuring FY2021, Origin incurred non-deductible shortfall charges of $262 million, of which $160 million was paid in relation to the under surrender of 2.5 million 2020 calendar year certificates and a further $102 million was accrued in relation to the first half of 2021 calendar year.\n\nIncluded in FY2021 Underlying Profit is a cost of $64 million reflecting the estimated future surrender cost, based on a weighted average of the current forward price and purchases to date, comprising:\n\n- \u00b7 $46 million relating to 2020 calendar year (~2.5 million certificates at $19 each, reflecting the forward price for the 2023 calendar year and purchases to date); and\n- \u00b7 $18 million relating to the first half of 2021 calendar year (~1.55 million certificates at $12 each, reflecting the forward price for the 2024 calendar year and purchases to date).\n\nThe balance of $198 million is excluded from Underlying Profit. See Appendix for further details.\n\nSubject to changes in volume and forward price estimates, we expect to incur a further $102 million in the first half of FY2022 relating to the shortfall charge for the second half of calendar 2021 1 and an estimated cost of $18 million will be recognised in FY2022 Underlying Profit. 1 Future surrender cost will continue to be reassessed each reporting period.",

This brings Origin's total distributions to shareholders for FY2021 to 20.0 cents per share, representing 31 per cent of free cash flow. The final dividend will be paid on 1 October 2021 to shareholders registered as at 8 September 2021.\n\nDuring the period, $191 million was incurred in respect of the investment in Octopus Energy and the costs associated with the Kraken system implementation. This has been treated as major growth expenditure and excluded from Free Cash Flow when measuring the dividend pay-out percentage.\n\nThe nil franking percentage reflects the current franking credit balance. A low franking balance is expected over the near term.\n\nOrigin will seek to deliver sustainable shareholder returns through the business cycle and will target a payout range of 30 per cent to 50 per cent of Free Cash Flow per annum in the form of ordinary dividends and/or on-market share buy-backs. Free Cash Flow is defined as cash from operating activities and investing activities (excluding major growth projects), less interest paid. Remaining cash flow will be applied to further debt reduction, value accretive organic growth and acquisition opportunities, and/or additional capital management initiatives.\n\nThe Board maintains discretion to adjust shareholder distributions for economic and business conditions.\n\nThe DRP will operate with nil discount and will be satisfied through on-market share purchases. The DRP price of shares will be the average purchase price, rounded to two decimal places, bought on market over a period of 10 trading days, commencing on the third trading day immediately following the Record Date.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This was partially offset by capital expenditure, investment in growth, interest payments and dividends to shareholders.\n\nForeign exchange/other primarily reflects the non-cash translation of unhedged USD debt and fees, partially offset by on-market purchase of shares ($96 million), operator cash call movements ($90 million), and settlement of foreign currency contracts ($65 million).\n\nOrigin's objective is to maintain an Adjusted Net Debt/Adjusted Underlying EBITDA ratio of 2.0-3.0x and a gearing 1 target of 20 per cent to 30 per cent. As previously foreshadowed, at 30 June 2021 these ratios were 2.9x and 32 per cent respectively, reflecting the reduction in EBITDA associated with lower prices across our key commodities; electricity, natural gas and oil. With continued strong cash flows from both our businesses and signs of recovery in each of these commodities, we remain focused on maintaining our target capital structure and achieving net debt below $4 billion over the medium term.\n\nAs our Adjusted Net Debt balance has declined from a peak of $13.1 billion as at 30 June 2015 to $4.6 billion, the quantum of debt capital we need to refinance in any year is lower. This reduced debt refinancing activity going forward means one investment-grade credit rating is sufficient for our debt capital requirements. During the year, we reduced our credit rating providers from two to one. Our long-term credit profile is Baa2 (stable) from Moody's.",

The rolling 12-month average interest rate on drawn debt decreased from 4.8 per cent in FY2020 to 4.3 per cent in FY2021.\n\nAs at 30 June 2021, Origin held $0.4 billion 1 of cash and $2.8 billion in committed undrawn debt facilities. This liquidity position of $3.3 billion is held to meet near-term debt and lease liability payment obligations of $1.8 billion (net of $0.1 billion fair value adjustments) and to maintain a sufficient liquidity buffer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## APLNG funding\n\nDuring construction of APLNG, shareholders contributed capital via ordinary equity and the investment in preference shares (termed MRCPS) issued by APLNG. APLNG distributes funds to shareholders firstly via fixed dividends of 6.37 per cent per annum on the MRCPS balance, recognised as interest income by Origin, and secondly via buy-backs of MRCPS, refer to Section 4.5 above. The fair value of MRCPS held by Origin at 30 June 2021 was A$1,296 million.\n\nAPLNG also funded construction via US$8.5 billion (100% APLNG) in project finance facilities. These facilities were partially refinanced in FY2019. The outstanding balance at 30 June 2021 was US$5,908 million (A$7,860 million), net of unamortised debt fees of US$65 million (A$86 million).

Higher residential demand related to working from home was partly offset by lower usage due to solar and energy efficiencies. Lower business volumes due to COVID-19 were partly offset by new contract wins.\n\nOwned and contracted generation output of 20 TWh was lower by 2 TWh, driven primarily by lower gas generation (-1.7 TWh) due to lower pool prices, lower demand and elevated gas generation in FY2020 to cover an outage at Eraring Power Station. Output at Eraring was lower (-0.4 TWh), reflecting lower wholesale prices. Both were partially offset by increased generation from renewable PPAs (+0.1 TWh) and solar feed-in tariffs (+0.4 TWh). Refer to Electricity Supply table below.\n\nApproximately 16 TWh per annum (or ~50 per cent) of our electricity supply costs are relatively fixed, subject to recontracting coal from FY2023 , representing Eraring and the bundled renewable PPAs. Energy procurement costs decreased overall, driven by lower fuel costs with less gas-fired generation, lower pool costs and lower capacity hedge costs. These were partially offset by an increase in market contracts with more volume hedged and higher unit costs due to the timing of the sale and purchase of swaps.\n\n## Sources and uses of electricity (TWh)\n\n40\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Approximately one third of savings is expected to be capital in nature with some of these savings already achieved. The remaining two thirds is expected from reduced operating costs to be achieved over FY2023 - 24.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Through the year, we continued to expand the scale and sophistication of our Virtual Power Plant (VPP), with 159 MW now connected from a range of distributed energy and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, including hot water systems, solar, batteries, air conditioners and various industrial assets. This represents a new type of instrument in our wholesale portfolio, where we can aggregate, control and dispatch thousands of distributed assets in response to market conditions and our portfolio position, creating value for both us and our customers through lower cost of energy.\n\nOf the 79,000 connected services, more than 56,000 are from our Spike program, which was launched in August 2020. Spike is a behavioural demand response program that rewards customers for reducing their energy usage and has proven to be very engaging with customers, with more than 843,000 SpikeHour invitations converting to a 67 per cent participation rate. We have also deployed in-app solar and battery features that provide our customers with powerful insights on how they use and manage energy in their homes.\n\nOperating costs increased during the period, largely due to costs relating to the launch of Spike, along with the scaling of our VPP and demand response offerings. The business continues to make small investments in trialling new energy solutions as we continue to transition to a low carbon future.\n\nOther income in the period related to distributions received from equity investments.",

The price lag in the LNG contracts resulted in the April and May 2020 low crude oil prices flowing through into FY2021. Similarly, higher prices experienced this calendar year to date will predominantly flow through into FY2022.\n\n- \u00b7 Commodity revenue and other income decreased by $939 million, primarily reflecting a realised oil price of US$43/bbl (A$58/bbl) compared to US$68/bbl (A$101/bbl) in FY2020.\n- \u00b7 Operating expenses reduced by $169 million, driven by lower royalties and tariffs as a result of lower revenue, less gas purchased and other operating cost savings. See below for further details.\n\nOrigin's share of depreciation and amortisation reduced by $111 million, reflecting a lower amortisation unit rate and a higher AUD/USD exchange rate. Downhole costs are amortised using a units of production method. With the development plan for the year reflecting lower capital costs, this has translated to a lower amortisation charge.\n\nMRCPS interest expense reduced by $68 million due to a reduction in MRCPS balance following buy-backs by APLNG and a higher AUD/USD exchange rate. Project finance interest decreased by $39 million due to a lower principal, lower average interest rate and a higher AUD/USD exchange rate. See Section 4.7 for details relating to APLNG funding.\n\n## APLNG volume summary\n\n|                                         | FY21       | FY21         | FY20       | FY20         |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------|--------------|------------|--------------|\n|                                         | APLNG 100% | Origin share | APLNG 100% | Origin share |\n| Volumes (PJ)                            |            |              |            |              |\n| Operated                                | 537        | 202          | 542        | 203          |\n| Non-operated                            | 163        | 61           | 165        | 62           |\n| Total production                        | 701        | 263          | 708        | 265          |\n| Purchases                               | 6          | 2            | 17         | 7            |\n| Changes in upstream gas inventory/other | (12)       | (4)          | (15)       | (6)          |\n| Liquefaction/downstream inventory/other | (39)       | (15)         | (42)       | (16)         |\n| Total sales                             | 656        | 246          | 668        | 251          |\n| Commodity revenue ($m)                  |            |              |            |              |\n| Domestic gas                            | 672        | 252          | 861        | 323          |\n| LNG                                     | 3,880      | 1,455        | 6,188      | 2,320        |\n| Sales mix (PJ)                          |            |              |            |              |\n| Domestic gas                            | 158        | 59           | 187        | 70           |\n| LNG contract                            | 450        | 169          | 449        | 169          |\n| LNG spot                                | 48         | 18           | 32         | 12           |\n| Realised price                          |            |              |            |              |\n| Domestic gas (A$/GJ)                    | 4.24       |              | 4.61       |              |\n| LNG (A$/GJ)                             | 7.79       |              | 12.86      |              |\n| LNG (US$/mmbtu)                         | 6.17       |              | 9.12       |              |",

Strong field capability enabled the flexibility to curtail production early in the year in response to lower demand coupled with planned maintenance, and then ramping up to record levels as demand increased later in the year.\n\nAPLNG sales volumes decreased 2 per cent, primarily reflecting lower purchased gas in the period.\n\nThe average realised LNG price decreased 39 per cent to A$7.79/GJ due to a lower realised oil price, partially offset by higher spot LNG volumes and prices. The average realised domestic gas price decreased 8 per cent to $4.24/GJ, primarily driven by lower realised prices on oil-linked sales to QGC.\n\n## Cash flow - APLNG 100%\n\n|                                                                 | FY21 ($m)   | FY20 ($m)   | Change ($m)   | Change (%)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|\n| Underlying EBITDA                                               | 3,051       | 5,108       | (2,057)       | (40)         |\n| Non-cash items in underlying EBITDA                             | 8           | 66          | (58)          | (88)         |\n| Change in working capital                                       | 265         | 64          | 201           | 314          |\n| Other                                                           | (10)        | 4           | (14)          | (350)        |\n| Operating cash flow 1                                           | 3,314       | 5,242       | (1,928)       | (37)         |\n| Capital expenditure 1                                           | (459)       | (1,038)     | 579           | (56)         |\n| Interest income 1                                               | 8           | 40          | (32)          | (80)         |\n| Acquisitions/disposals 1                                        | -           | (245)       | 245           | (100)        |\n| Loans (advanced to)/paid by other shareholders                  | 3           | 14          | (11)          | (79)         |\n| Investing cash flow                                             | (448)       | (1,229)     | 781           | (64)         |\n| Project finance interest and transaction costs 1                | (263)       | (382)       | 119           | (31)         |\n| Repayment of project finance 1                                  | (672)       | (731)       | 59            | (8)          |\n| Other financing activities 1                                    | (48)        | (45)        | (3)           | 7            |\n| Repayment of lease liabilities 1                                | (45)        | (80)        | 35            | (44)         |\n| Interest on lease liabilities 1                                 | (19)        | (19)        | -             | -            |\n| MRCPS interest                                                  | (293)       | (480)       | 187           | (39)         |\n| MRCPS buy-back                                                  | (1,598)     | (2,918)     | 1,320         | (45)         |\n| Financing cash flow                                             | (2,938)     | (4,655)     | 1,717         | (37)         |\n| Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents                       | (72)        | (642)       | 570           | (89)         |\n| Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1                       | (95)        | 104         | (199)         | (191)        |\n| Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents including FX movement | (167)       | (538)       | 371           | (69)         |\n| Distributable cash flow 1                                       | 1,721       | 2,846       | (1,125)       | (40)         |\n\nAPLNG generated distributable cash flow of $1,721 million ($645 million Origin share) at an effective oil price of US$43/bbl after servicing project finance interest and principal.

Operated infrastructure costs reduced $72 million due to the completion of the Talinga Orana Gas Gathering Station in the prior period. Exploration and appraisal spend declined $65 million and non-operated spend reduced $110 million due to reduced activity including the decision by APLNG to not participate in less economic fields. Savings in downstream spend as a result of fewer purchases of spares for maintenance were offset by a $50 million benefit in the prior period for settlement of a project construction claim.\n\nOperated upstream - Sustain includes expenditure for drilling, completions, fracture stimulation, the gathering network, surface connection, capital improvements and land access which occurs over multiple years.

It also includes overhead costs (net of recoveries) incurred as upstream operator and corporate service provider to APLNG, costs associated with growth initiatives such as hydrogen, and costs incurred in managing Origin's exposure to LNG pricing risk and impacts of its LNG trading positions.\n\n## Beetaloo Basin (Northern Territory)\n\nOrigin has a 77.5 per cent interest in three exploration permits over 18,500 km 2 in the Beetaloo Basin. Stage 2 appraisal under the farm-in arrangement is underway, targeting three independent shale gas plays. Work continues with regulators and Native Title holders to ensure operations are conducted safely and with transparency around the necessary approvals and consents.\n\n- \u00b7 Kyalla liquids-rich gas play - The Kyalla 117 well was drilled to a total measured depth of 3,809 metres, which includes a 1,579 metre lateral section.\n\nDuring the period, Origin undertook fracture stimulation and initial flowback and production testing activities with nitrogen lift operations enabling sustained production for up to ~17 hours without assistance to measure initial flow rates. The Kyalla 117 well successfully met its primary objective to flow liquids-rich gas from the Kyalla Formation to the surface. Preliminary production test data and petrophysical data included:\n\n- - unassisted gas flow rates ranging from 0.4-0.6 mmscf/d (0.6-0.9 TJ/d);\n- - highly saline stimulation flowback rates constraining production (water to gas ratios > 1,000 bbl/mmscf);\n- - liquids-rich gas (65 per cent methane, 19 per cent ethane, 11 per cent propane and butane, 3 per cent C5+); and\n- - minimal CO2 < 1 per cent.\n\nRecent activity has focused on the continued clean-up of the Kyalla 117 well in preparation for an extended production testing, using nitrogen to support operations. The well began flowing again without assistance for intermittent periods; however, production has not been sustained. Operations were temporarily paused to investigate a potential downhole flow restriction, with the results informing the development of a new go-forward plan.\n\n- \u00b7 Velkerri liquids-rich gas play - Construction of the Velkerri 76 well lease pad was completed and environmental approval to drill and fracture stimulate the Velkerri Flank well was granted in December 2019. The Velkerri 76 vertical well was spudded in August 2021 to collect core, log, and Diagnostic Fracture Injection Testing data to assess the prospectivity of liquids rich gas.\n- \u00b7 Velkerri dry gas play - The production test of Amungee NW 1H well commenced in August 2021 to assess if all original stages that were stimulated during the previous test in 2016 are contributing to flow rates.\n\n## Cooper-Eromanga Basin (Queensland)\n\nOrigin has a 75 per cent interest and operatorship of five permits located in the Cooper-Eromanga Basin in south west Queensland, and has recently acquired 100 per cent interest in one additional permit. In December 2020, the first vertical exploration well, Obelix-2, was drilled to test the maturity of the Toolebuc Formation. Log and core data from the well are being evaluated with results on maturity and hydrocarbon saturations expected in early FY2022 to inform the ongoing work program. The staged farm-in work program involves drilling up to five exploration wells to be completed by the end of 2024, targeting both unconventional liquids and gas.\n\n## Canning Basin (Western Australia)\n\nOrigin entered into agreements in December 2020 with Buru Energy to farm in to a 50 per cent equity share in five permits, and a 40 per cent equity share in two permits. The CY2021 work program includes the drilling of two wells to assess conventional oil prospects (Currajong and Rafael) and the acquisition of 2D seismic. The Currajong 1 well was drilled to a total measured depth of 2,340 metres in August 2021. Results obtained indicate potential oil bearing zones with options for a production test of the well being developed. The Rafael 1 well is expected to spud in Q1 FY2022.\n\n## Financial summary\n\n|                                               | FY21 ($m)   | FY20 ($m)   | Change ($m)   | Change (%)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|\n| Origin only commodity hedging and trading     | 55          | (92)        | 147           | (160)        |\n| Other Origin only costs                       | (65)        | (82)        | 17            | (21)         |\n| Underlying EBITDA                             | (10)        | (174)       | 164           | (94)         |\n| Underlying depreciation and amortisation/ITDA | (26)        | (24)        | (2)           | 8            |\n| Interest income - MRCPS                       | 106         | 174         | (68)          | (39)         |\n| Underlying Profit/(Loss)                      | 71          | (23)        | 94            | (409)        |\n\nRefer to the following table for a breakdown of Origin only commodity hedging and trading costs.\n\nOther Origin only costs reduced $17 million, primarily reflecting costs in the prior period associated with an agreement to reduce Origin's share of overriding royalty in the Beetaloo Basin.",

Material risks, and the Company's approach to managing them, are summarised below.\n\n## Risk management framework\n\nOverseen by the Board and the Board Risk Committee, Origin's risk management framework supports the identification, management and reporting of material risks. Risks are identified that have the potential to impact the delivery of business plans and objectives. Risks are assessed using a risk toolkit that considers the level of consequence and likelihood of occurrence using consistent risk assessment criteria.\n\nThe risk framework incorporates a 'three lines of defence' model for managing risks and controls in areas such as health and safety, environment (including climate change), finance, reputation and brand, legal and compliance and social impacts. All employees are responsible for making risk-based decisions and managing risk within approved risk appetite and specific limits.\n\nThe Board reviews Origin's material risks each quarter and assesses the effectiveness of the Company's risk management framework annually in accordance with the ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations.\n\n## Three lines of defence\n\n| Line of defence                 | Responsibility                                                                                   | Primary accountability                  |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| First line Lines of business    | Identifies, assesses, records, prioritises, manages and monitors risks.                          | Management                              |\n| Second line Oversight functions | Provides the risk management framework, tools and systems to  support effective risk management. | Management                              |\n| Third line Internal audit       | Provides assurance on the effectiveness of governance, risk  management and internal controls.   | Board, Board Committees  and Management |\n\nOur risk framework supports the identification and management of emerging risks and escalating threats. During FY2021, COVID-19 was a key threat to our operational and financial performance, requiring ongoing response and management across many of our existing material risks to minimise impacts. Our priorities continue to focus on the health and safety of our people, customers and the communities we operate in. We are ensuring the continuity of our operations and supporting activities, including our supply chain, to continue to provide our essential services to our customers and maintaining our financial resilience to respond to changes in global markets.\n\n## Material risks\n\nThe risks identified in this section have the potential to materially affect Origin's ability to meet its business objectives and impact its future financial prospects. These risks are not exhaustive and are not arranged in order of significance.\n\n## Strategic risks\n\nStrategic risks arise from uncertainties that may emerge in the medium to longer term and, while they may not necessarily impact on shortterm profits, can have an immediate impact on the value of the Company. These Strategic risks are managed through continuous monitoring and reviewing of emerging and escalating risks, ongoing planning and the allocation of resources, and evaluation from management and the Board.\n\n| Risk           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Management                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Climate change | Consequences Origin is exposed to risks and opportunities relating to  (i) the transition to a low-carbon economy and (ii) doing  business in a low carbon economy.

        "page_content": "## 7 APLNG reversion\n\nIn 2002, APLNG acquired various CSG interests from Tri-Star that are subject to reversionary rights and an ongoing royalty in favour of Tri-Star. If triggered, the reversionary rights require APLNG to transfer back to Tri-Star a 45% interest in those CSG interests for no additional consideration. The reversion trigger will occur when the revenue from the sale of petroleum from those CSG interests, plus any other revenue derived from or in connection with those CSG interests, exceeds the aggregate of all expenditure relating to those CSG interests plus interest on that expenditure, royalty payments and the original acquisition price.\n\nThe affected CSG interests represent approximately 19 per cent of APLNG's 3P CSG reserves (as at 30 June 2021), and approximately 20 per cent of APLNG's 2P CSG reserves (as at 30 June 2021).\n\nTri-Star served proceedings on APLNG in 2015 ('reversion proceeding') claiming that reversion occurred as early as 1 November 2008 following ConocoPhillips' investment in APLNG, on the assertion that the equity subscription monies paid by ConocoPhillips, or a portion of them, were revenue for purposes of the reversion trigger. Tri-Star has also claimed in the alternative that reversion occurred in 2011 or 2012 following Sinopec's investment in APLNG. These claims are referred to in this document as Tri-Star's 'past reversion' claims.\n\nTri-Star has made other claims in the reversion proceeding against APLNG relating to other aspects of the reversion trigger (including as to the calculation of interest, calculation of revenue and the nature and quantum of APLNG's expenditures that can be included), the calculation of the royalty payable by APLNG to Tri-Star, rights in respect of infrastructure, and claims relating to gas sold by APLNG following the alleged reversion dates. APLNG denies these claims and is defending the proceedings.\n\nIf Tri-Star's past reversion claims are successful, then Tri-Star may be entitled to an order that reversion occurred as early as 1 November 2008. If the court determines that reversion has occurred, then APLNG may no longer have access to the reserves and resources that are subject to Tri-Star's reversionary interests and may need to source alternative supplies of gas (including from third parties) to meet its contracted commitments. There are also likely to be a number of further complex issues that would need to be resolved as a consequence of any such finding in favour of Tri-Star. These matters will need to be determined by the court (either in the current or in separate proceedings) or by agreement between the parties, and they include:\n\n- \u00b7 the terms under which some of the affected CSG interests will be operated where currently there are no joint operating agreements in place;\n- \u00b7 the amount of Tri-Star's contribution to the costs incurred by APLNG in exploring and developing the affected CSG interests between the date of reversion and the date of judgment, which APLNG has stated in its defence and counter-claim are in the order of $4.56 billion (as at 31 December 2019) if reversion occurred on 1 November 2008; and\n- \u00b7 the consequences of APLNG having dealt with Tri-Star's reversionary interests between the date of reversion and the date of judgment, including the gas produced from them. Tri-Star has:\n- - estimated the value of such gas which it has been unable to take since the alleged reversion, calculated by reference to the sale of gas as LNG and gas to domestic customers, to be approximately $3.37 billion (as at 31 March 2019) and approximately $1.3 billion per annum thereafter. In the alternative, Tri-Star claims that the value of such gas should be assessed by reference to the revenue derived by APLNG or its affiliates from LNG sales since the alleged reversion, being\n\n<!-- image -->\n\napproximately $2.5 billion (as at March 2019), or $2.4 billion (as at March 2019) if the proceeds from sale of LNG is determined to be calculated net of liquefaction costs; and\n\n- - alleged that it should be paid the value of such gas or is otherwise entitled to set-off the value of such gas from any amount owing to APLNG arising from APLNG's counter-claim for contribution to the costs incurred by APLNG in exploring and developing the affected CSG interests between the date of reversion and the date of judgment; and\n- \u00b7 if reversion occurred:\n- \u00b7 the extent of the reversionary interests principally with respect to Tri-Star's ownership and/or rights to use or access certain project infrastructure; and\n- \u00b7 the repayment by Tri-Star of the ongoing royalty which has been paid by APLNG since reversion, resulting from its mistake as to the occurrence of the reversion trigger.\n\nIf APLNG is successful in defending Tri-Star's past reversion claims in the reversion proceeding, the potential for reversion to otherwise occur in the future in accordance with the reversion trigger will remain.\n\nIn 2017, Tri-Star commenced separate proceedings against APLNG ('markets proceeding') which allege that APLNG breached three CSG joint operating agreements by failing to offer Tri-Star (and the other minority participants in those agreements) an opportunity to participate in the 'markets' alleged to be constituted by certain of its LNG and domestic gas sales agreements, including the Sinopec and Kansai LNG sale agreements entered into by APLNG in 2011 and 2012. Tri-Star has alleged that it should have been offered participation in those sales agreements for its share of production from those three CSG joint ventures referable to both its small participating interests and its reversionary interests in those joint ventures.\n\nIn September 2019, Tri-Star made further claims in the markets proceeding relating to:\n\n- \u00b7 the nature and scope of the obligations of APLNG as operator pursuant to the CSG joint operating agreements;\n- \u00b7 Tri-Star's ownership and/or rights to use or access certain project infrastructure; and\n- \u00b7 APLNG's entitlement as operator to charge (both historically and in the future) certain categories of costs under the relevant CSG joint operating agreements.\n\nTri-Star is seeking, amongst other things, damages and/or an order that APLNG offer Tri-Star (and the other minority participants in those CSG joint operating agreements) the opportunity to participate in those sales agreements for their proportionate share of production from those three CSG joint ventures. APLNG denies these claims and is defending these proceedings.\n\nAPLNG filed defences and counterclaims in both proceedings in April and May 2020. In December 2020, Tri-Star filed replies and answers in the both proceedings. APLNG filed its rejoinders in the reversion proceeding and the markets proceeding in February and April 2021 respectively. The pleadings are now closed.\n\nIn both proceedings, the court has ordered, by consent, that the parties confer as to the real issues in dispute, and, in the reversion proceedings, as to potential separate questions for early determination. Following that process, the court will make further orders for the conduct of the two proceedings (which APLNG expects will continue to be managed in parallel). The usual court process would involve a period of document disclosure, potentially court-ordered mediation and then finally a hearing. The process that will ultimately be followed (and the procedural timetable) is difficult to predict at this stage.",

Origin's Statutory Profit contains a number of items that when excluded provide a different perspective on the financial and operational performance of the business. Income Statement amounts, presented on an underlying basis such as Underlying Profit, are non-IFRS financial measures, and exclude the impact of these items consistent with the manner in which senior management reviews the financial and operating performance of the business. Each underlying measure disclosed has been adjusted to remove the impact of these items on a consistent basis. A reconciliation and description of the items that contribute to the difference between Statutory Profit and Underlying Profit is provided in Section 4.1 of this OFR.\n\nCertain other non-IFRS financial measures are also included in this OFR. These non-IFRS financial measures are used internally by management to assess the performance of Origin's business and make decisions on allocation of resources. Further information regarding the non-IFRS financial measures is included in the Glossary of this OFR. Non-IFRS financial measures have not been subject to audit or review. Certain comparative amounts from the prior corresponding period have been re-presented to conform to the current period's presentation.",

        "page_content": "## Appendix\n\n## Large-scale generation certificate shortfall\n\nSupply and demand for large-scale generation certificates (LGCs) is driven by the rate of new renewable projects coming online as well as the compliance obligations under the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET). Renewable project delays and generation curtailments have led to a near-term tightening of the LGC market; however, it is expected that the 33 TWh legislated target will be exceeded and longer term the market will be oversupplied.\n\nThe Clean Energy Regulator has acknowledged the option for parties to shift demand from periods of tight supply by deferring the surrender of certificates to later years. Under the scheme, parties can defer up to 10 per cent of their obligation at no additional cost and can defer more than 10 per cent by incurring a shortfall charge of $65 per certificate that is refundable provided the LGCs are surrendered within three years.\n\nWith the forward curve in backwardation, Origin has previously elected to defer surrender of 2.5 million CY2020 certificates in February 2021 and expects to defer approximately 3.1 million CY2021 certificates in February 2022.\n\n## FY2021 impact\n\nDuring FY2021, we have paid a shortfall charge of $160 million in relation to CY2020 certificates and accrued a further $102 million in relation to CY2021 certificates. A cost of $64 million recognised in FY2021 Underlying Profit reflects the estimated future surrender cost, based on a weighted average of the current forward price and purchases to date of:\n\n- \u00b7 ~2.5 million 2020 certificates at $19/certificate; and\n- \u00b7 ~1.6 million 2021 certificates at $12/certificate (estimate for the first half of CY2021).\n\nThe balance of $198 million is excluded from Underlying Profit.\n\n## FY2022 impact\n\nSubject to changes in volume and forward price estimates, we expect to incur a further $102 million in relation to the shortfall charge for the second half of CY2021. A cost of $18 million will be recognised in FY2022 Underlying Profit. The balance of $84 million will be excluded from Underlying Profit.\n\nThe shortfall charge is non-deductible for tax purposes. The refund is currently tax assessable; however, legislative change is before Parliament which would make refunds non-assessable (such that it is aligned to treatment of the shortfall charge).\n\n|                                                                                              | Statutory Profit ($m)   | Adjustment ($m)   | Underlying Profit ($m)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|\n| CY2020 and CY2021 certificate shortfall recorded in FY2021                                   |                         |                   |                          |\n| Shortfall charge (~4.1 million certificates x $65) - $160 million paid; $102 million accrued | (262)                   | 262               | -                        |\n| Expected surrender cost (~2.5 million CY2020 certificates x $19)                             | -                       | (46)              | (46)                     |\n| Expected surrender cost (~1.6 million CY2021 certificates x $12)                             | -                       | (18)              | (18)                     |\n| Total FY2021 impact                                                                          | (262)                   | 198               | (64)                     |\n| Remaining CY2021 certificate shortfall (incurred in FY2022)                                  |                         |                   |                          |\n| Shortfall charge accrued (~1.6 million certificates x $65)                                   | (102)                   | 102               | -                        |\n| Expected surrender cost (~1.6 million certificates x $12)                                    | -                       | (18)              | (18)                     |\n| Total FY2022 impact                                                                          | (102)                   | 84                | (18)                     |\n| CY2020 certificate surrender (incurred in FY2024)                                            |                         |                   |                          |\n| Surrender (~2.5 million certificates x $19)                                                  | (46)                    | 46                | -                        |\n| Shortfall refund (~2.5 million certificates x $65)                                           | 160                     | (160)             | -                        |\n| Total FY2024 impact                                                                          | 114                     | (114)             | -                        |\n| CY2021 certificate surrender (incurred in FY2025)                                            |                         |                   |                          |\n| Surrender (~3.1 million certificates x $12)                                                  | (36)                    | 36                | -                        |\n| Shortfall refund (~3.1 million certificates x $65)                                           | 204                     | (204)             | -                        |\n| Total FY2025 impact                                                                          | 168                     | (168)             | -                        |\n| Total cost of ~5.6 million certificates                                                      | (82)                    | -                 | (82)                     |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The following securities were granted to the five most highly remunerated officers (other than Directors) of the Company during the year ended 30 June 2021:\n\n|              | Performance  Share Rights   | Restricted Shares   | Restricted  Share Rights   | Matching Share  Plan Rights 1   |\n|--------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| J Briskin    | 60,104                      | 123,900             | 60,102                     | 518                             |\n| G Jarvis     | 61,438                      | 111,258             | 61,440                     | 518                             |\n| A Lucas      | 49,018                      | 66,289              | 49,017                     | -                               |\n| M Schubert 2 | 61,438                      | 130,616             | 61,440                     | -                               |\n| L Tremaine   | 67,916                      | 118,650             | 67,917                     | 518                             |\n\n- 2 The securities granted to Mr Schubert were all forfeited upon cessation of his employment on 30 June 2021.\n\nThe awards of Performance Share Rights, Restricted Shares, and Restricted Share Rights were made in accordance with the Company's Equity Incentive Plan as part of the relevant Executive's remuneration. Further details on Rights granted during the financial year, and unissued shares under Options and Rights, are included in Section 7 of the Remuneration Report. No Rights were granted since the end of the financial year.\n\nNo Options or Rights were granted since the end of the financial year.\n\n## Origin shares issued on the exercise of Options and Rights\n\n## Options\n\nNo Options granted under the Equity Incentive Plan were exercised during or since the year ended 30 June 2021, so no ordinary shares in Origin were issued as a result.\n\n## Rights\n\n870,471 ordinary shares of Origin were allocated from the Origin Energy Limited Employee Share Trust during the year ended 30 June 2021 on the vesting and exercise of DSRs, PSRs and Matching Share Plan Rights granted under the Equity Incentive Plan and Employee Share Plan. No amounts were payable on the vesting of these DSRs, PSRs and Matching Share Plan Rights and, accordingly, no amounts remain unpaid in respect of any of those shares.\n\nSince 30 June 2021, 3,719 ordinary shares of Origin were allocated from the Origin Energy Limited Employee Share Trust on the vesting of Matching Share Plan Rights granted under the Employee Share Plan.\n\nAll shares in the Origin Energy Limited Employee Share Trust were purchased on market.\n\n## 7 Environmental regulation and performance\n\nThe Company's operations are subject to environmental regulation under Commonwealth, State, and Territory legislation. For the year ended 30 June 2021, regulators were notified of a total of 30 environmental reportable incidents. All of these incidents resulted in minor environmental consequences with the appropriate level of investigation undertaken. All incidents are investigated, and lessons learned captured and shared across the Company.\n\nIn FY2021, the Company received two formal environmental Clean Up Notices from a regulator arising from Origin's activities. All of the required actions set out in the Notices have been executed with final reports submitted and accepted by the Regulator. There were no fines issued in FY2021.\n\n## 8 Indemnities and insurance for Directors and Officers\n\nUnder its Constitution, the Company may indemnify current and past Directors and Officers for losses or liabilities incurred by them as a Director or Officer of the Company or its related bodies corporate to the extent allowed under law. The Constitution also permits the Company to purchase and maintain a Directors' and Officers' insurance policy. No indemnity has been granted to an auditor of the Company in their capacity as auditor of the Company.\n\nThe Company has entered into agreements with current Directors and certain former Directors whereby it will indemnify those Directors from all losses or liabilities in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the limits set by, the Constitution.\n\nThe agreements stipulate that the Company will meet the full amount of any such liability, including costs and expenses to the extent allowed under law. The Company is not aware of any liability having arisen, and no claim has been made against the Company during or since the year ended 30 June 2021 under these agreements.\n\nDuring the year, the Company has paid insurance premiums in respect of Directors' and Officers' liability, and legal expense insurance contracts for the year ended 30 June 2021.\n\nThe insurance contracts insure against certain liability (subject to exclusions) of persons who are or have been Directors or Officers of the Company and its controlled entities. A condition of the contracts is that the nature of the liability indemnified and the premium payable not be disclosed.",

The auditor's independence declaration for the financial year (made under section 307C of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)) is attached to and forms part of this Report.\n\n## 10 Non-audit services\n\nThe amounts paid or payable to EY for nonaudit services provided during the year was $1,873,000 (shown to the nearest thousand dollars). Amounts paid to EY are included in note G7 to the full financial statements.\n\nBased on written advice received from the Audit Committee Chairman pursuant to a resolution passed by the Audit Committee, the Board has formed the view that the provision of those non-audit services by EY is compatible with, and did not compromise, the general standards of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). The Board's reasons for concluding that the non-audit services provided by EY did not compromise its independence are:\n\n- \u00b7 all non-audit services provided were subjected to the Company's corporate governance procedures and were either below the pre-approved limits imposed by the Audit Committee or separately approved by the Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 all non-audit services provided did not, and do not, undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence as they did not involve reviewing or auditing the auditor's own work, acting in a management or decision making capacity for the Company, acting as an advocate for the Company or jointly sharing risks and rewards; and\n- \u00b7 there were no known conflict of interest situations nor any other circumstance arising out of a relationship between Origin (including its Directors and Officers) and EY which may impact on auditor independence.\n\n## 11 Proceedings on behalf of the Company\n\nThe Company is not aware of any proceedings being brought on behalf of the Company, nor any applications having been made in respect of the Company under section 237 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).\n\n## 12 Rounding of amounts\n\nThe Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/ Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191 dated 24 March 2016 and, in accordance with that class order, amounts in the financial report and Directors' Report have been rounded off to the nearest million dollars unless otherwise stated.\n\n## 13 Remuneration\n\nThe Remuneration Report forms part of this Directors' Report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It has been prepared in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) and Accounting Standards, and audited as required by section 308(3C) of the Act.\n\n## Letter from the Chairman of the Remuneration and People Committee\n\nOn behalf of the Remuneration and People Committee (RPC) and the Board, I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for FY2021.\n\n## FY2021 remuneration outcomes\n\nFY2021 was a challenging year for many of Origin's stakeholders, particularly Origin's shareholders.\n\nIn deciding the short-term incentive outcomes for the Executive Leadership Team, the Board balanced the fall in the share price over the financial year with the achievements of the leadership team in managing the multiple impacts of COVID-19, regulatory uncertainty, the accelerated growth of renewables and still performing well against their objectives for the year. Details of the performance of the team against their objectives for the year are set out in Section 4 of this Remuneration Report.\n\nThe Board's remuneration governance followed a rigorous process to test the Short Term Incentive (STI) scorecard outcomes and decide whether it should exercise its discretion to adjust outcomes.\n\nThe STI scorecard outcomes for the year reflected:\n\n- \u00b7 below-threshold performance in Energy Markets because of margin contractions following weaker commodity market prices from the pandemic and mild summer weather, exacerbated by an adverse gas price arbitration outcome;\n- \u00b7 stretch performance in Integrated Gas due to strong field performance, portfolio optimisation and responsiveness to recovering oil market conditions;\n- \u00b7 on-target performance for underlying earning per share (EPS) and net cash from/(used in) operating and investing activities (NCOIA), reflecting strong operational performance across our combined businesses in challenging external markets;\n- \u00b7 above-target performance in customer and climate change performance;\n- \u00b7 above-threshold but below-target achievement for our range of people measures. Notwithstanding a top-quartile engagement score of 74 and a 69.9 per cent of maximum result for safety, overall performance on all of the measures did not meet our robust target requirement.\n\nThe outcome for the CEO's STI scorecard was 62.2 per cent of maximum (103.7 per cent of target), driven by strong operational performance in Integrated Gas, and customer and climate change metrics. In balancing management's response and execution in an extraordinarily challenging and dynamic environment against financial results impacted by a range of headwinds, the Board and the CEO agreed this outcome should be reduced. The Board exercised its discretion and made a 25 per cent reduction to better align the result with the experience of shareholders. The Board noted that the CEO and leadership team also have significant shareholdings in the Company.\n\nIn summary, for FY2021:\n\n- \u00b7 the CEO's STI outcome was 46.6 per cent of maximum (77.8 per cent of target);\n- \u00b7 other Executive Key Management Personnel (KMP) outcomes range between 44.3 and 57.8 per cent of maximum (74.0 to 96.5 per cent of target); and\n- \u00b7 the aggregate outcome was 50.7 per cent of maximum (84.5 per cent of target), ignoring the zero STI award for M Schubert, who forfeited his STI on resignation.\n\nA partial vesting (35.3 per cent) of the FY2017 Long Term Incentive (LTI) grant occurred in FY2021, resulting from return on capital employed (ROCE) performance exceeding target. Further details are provided in Section 4.1 of the Remuneration Report.\n\n## FY2021 remuneration framework and levels\n\n## Fixed Remuneration and Non-executive Director fees\n\nThe annual fixed remuneration (FR) review normally conducted at year end was deferred on an organisation-wide basis. No changes to FR for Executive KMP were made for FY2021.\n\nThere were no changes to the level or structure of Non-executive Director (NEDs') fees in FY2021.\n\n## Short Term Incentive Plan\n\nNo changes were made to the Short Term Incentive Plan (STIP) architecture or opportunity levels during the year. The plan continues to be refined and developed to simplify the scorecard structure and to increase aspects of conduct and behavioural reviews.",

        "page_content": "## Long Term Incentive Plan\n\nA comprehensive assessment of the remuneration framework was undertaken during FY2020. The Board concluded from the review that the LTI Plan (LTIP) was not suited to the industry risks and opportunities inherent in Origin's business. The commodity price cycles faced by Integrated Gas coupled with the energy transition and transformation of the Energy Markets business undermined the efficacy of ROCE metrics. The LTIP was failing to meet the objectives of attraction, retention, motivation and building executive shareholding.\n\nAs advised to shareholders last year, the Board concluded that alternative models using Restricted Shares (RSs) with reduced opportunity, longer deferral periods, underpinning performance criteria and increased shareholding requirements are better suited to the Company's return and investment profile. The new Restricted Share Rights (RSRs) are considered a better structure to achieve the intended objectives.\n\nFollowing the release of the FY2020 Remuneration Report, the Board engaged with major investors and proxy advisors before finalising a revised LTIP structure. Overall, the feedback strongly supported the RSR structure, but a number of stakeholders expressed a preference for an external financial performance condition, such as relative TSR (RTSR), as a part of a modified LTIP structure. Accordingly, the combined RSR and RTSR model (modified LTIP) was adopted for LTIP awards made in FY2021.\n\nThe implications of this change on executive remuneration included:\n\n- \u00b7 a 33 per cent reduction in the LTIP maximum opportunity levels;\n- \u00b7 a reduction in maximum Total Remuneration (TR) of 13.4 per cent;\n- \u00b7 an increase in the Minimum Shareholding Requirements (MSR) for Executives;\n- \u00b7 an extension of the deferral period from four to five years; and\n- \u00b7 in relation only to those rights that ultimately vest, a dividendequivalent for better alignment with shareholders.\n\nThe Board made these changes as they better reflect the investment cycle of our business. They significantly improve alignment of executive and shareholder interests in the level of reward, the increased ownership required, and the longer deferral period.\n\nThere is no change to the executive remuneration framework, including equity grant, in FY2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FY2022 remuneration\n\nFollowing the salary freeze in FY2021, modest adjustments will be made to FR for Executive KMP from 1 July 2021 in order to maintain market competitiveness. The CEO's FR will increase by 2.7 per cent, and Other Executive KMP by an average of 2.3 per cent for FY2022, in line with adjustments for our workforce more generally.\n\nThere is no change to LTIP arrangements for the grants to be made in early FY2022.\n\nFinally, there will be no changes to the structure or level of NED fees for FY2022.\n\n## Steven Sargent\n\nChairman, Remuneration and People Committee",

It is based on the Behaviourally Anchored Rating Scale (BARS) methodology that assesses an individual's performance against specific examples of behaviour required for different roles and levels, rather than against generic descriptors.\n\nThis adds qualitative and quantitative information into the appraisal process. The behavioural assessment can result in incentive outcomes being adjusted up or down, within the prescribed maximum amount.\n\n## 2.3 Minimum shareholding requirement for Executive KMP\n\nA key objective of the remuneration framework is to promote employee share ownership and to encourage employees to think and act as owners. Equity is therefore a key element of remuneration, representing at least half of STI awards and the whole of LTI awards. This is supplemented by other share plan arrangements, including salary sacrifice, share purchase and matching plans (see Section 3.8).\n\nExecutive KMP are required to build and maintain a minimum shareholding in the Company. Following the introduction of the modified LTIP, the MSR will increase from the equivalent 200 per cent to 250 per cent of FR for the CEO, and from 100 per cent to 150 per cent of FR for Other Executive KMP. The changes will take effect from August 2023, which is the earliest date from which the modified LTIP can impact vesting patterns. From time to time, the Board determines the MSR as a number of shares with reference to movements in FR and share price. The MSR for FY2021 was 620,000 shares for the CEO and 130,000 for Other Executive KMP. The numeric share determinations will be reviewed during FY2022.\n\nUntil the MSR is reached, disposals are prohibited except as reasonably required to meet Employee Share Scheme taxation liabilities. Once the MSR is reached, disposals are prohibited where they would take the holding below the MSR level, except in extraordinary circumstances approved by the Board. The governance mechanism is through trading restrictions over and above any other trading restrictions that apply.\n\nShares (restricted and unrestricted) count towards the MSR, but rights are not counted.\n\n## 3 Remuneration framework details\n\n## 3.1 Fixed Remuneration\n\nFR comprises cash salary, employer contributions to superannuation and salary sacrifice benefits. It takes into account the size and complexity of the role, and the skills and experience required for success in the role.\n\nFR is reviewed annually, but increases are not guaranteed. Roles are benchmarked to the median of corresponding roles in organisations with comparable activity and scale and with whom Origin competes for talent. 1 In the absence of special factors, new or newly promoted incumbents generally commence below this reference point and move to the median over time. FR may be positioned above this reference point where it is appropriate to reward sustained high performance, or for key talent retention purposes or where it is necessary to attract and secure key skills to fill a business-critical role. Accordingly, the median positioning may vary between approximately the 40th and 60th percentile of the reference market.\n\n## 3.2 Variable Remuneration\n\nVR comprises the total of STI and LTI:\n\n- \u00b7 The minimum VR is zero, where no STI or LTI is awarded, or where the STI scorecard outcome is zero and LTI is not awarded or all of it fails to vest, or where discretion is exercised to reduce such awards or vesting outcomes to zero.\n- \u00b7 The target VR represents the total of STI awarded at the target level, plus 50 per cent of the face value 2 of any LTI subject to an explicit performance hurdle, plus 100 per cent of the face value of any 'underpinned' LTI tranche (Section 3.5). In terms of the LTI component, the 'target' represents a risked or expected (probabilistic) outcome.\n- \u00b7 The maximum VR is the total of STI awarded at the maximum level, plus the full face value of all LTI tranches assuming 100 per cent vesting.\n\n## 3.3 Total Remuneration\n\nTR is the sum of FR and VR.\n\n| TR at target (TRT)   | =   | FR   | target VR   |\n|----------------------|-----|------|-------------|\n| TR maximum (TRM)     | =   | FR   | maximum VR  |\n\nTRT is benchmarked to the median of equivalent TRT in the reference market, with the intention that when Origin's outcomes are at their maximum possible (i.e. TRM) they will be comparable to the top quartile of the reference TRT.",

The remuneration mix at target and at maximum is shown in the chart below which shows the significant proportion of variable or performance-based pay and delivery in equity. Variable or performance-based pay represents 65.5 per cent of the CEO's package at target outcomes, and 74.2 per cent at maximum outcomes. Forfeitable equity represents 48.3 per cent at target outcomes and 52.6 per cent at maximum outcomes.\n\n## CEO remuneration mix\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCorresponding figures for the average remuneration mix for other Executive KMP range from $939,000 (FR and minimum), to $2.442 million at target and $3.259 million at maximum. The proportion of performance-based pay is 61.5 per cent at target and 71.2 per cent at maximum, and the level of equity is 42.3 per cent at target and 47.1 per cent at maximum.\n\n## 3.8 Other equity/share plans\n\nThe Company operates a universal Employee Share Plan in which all full-time and part-time employees can choose to be eligible for awards of up to $1,000 worth of Company shares annually, or else participate in a salary sacrifice scheme to purchase up to $4,800 in shares annually.\n\nUnder the $1,000 scheme (the General Employee Share Plan (GESP)) shares are restricted for three years or until cessation of employment, whichever occurs first.\n\nUnder the Matching Share Plan (MSP), shares purchased under the sacrifice scheme are restricted for up to two years or until cessation of employment, whichever occurs first. For every two shares purchased under the salary sacrifice scheme within a 12-month cycle, participants are granted one matching share right at no cost. The matching share rights vest two years after the cycle began, provided that the participant remains employed by the Company at this time. Each matching share right generally entitles the participant to one fully paid ordinary share in the Company, or in certain limited circumstances a cash equivalent payment. The matching share rights do not have any performance hurdles as they have been granted to encourage broad participation in the scheme across the Company, and to encourage employee share ownership. All shares are currently purchased on market.\n\nDirectors are not eligible to participate in the above schemes, but may participate in the NED Share Acquisition Plan by sacrificing Board fees. This plan is intended to facilitate share acquisition, enabling new Directors to meet their MSR obligations. All NEDs currently meet their MSR and no shares were acquired under the scheme in FY2021.\n\nDirectors regularly assess the risk of the Company losing high-performing key people who manage core activities or have skills that are being actively solicited in the market. Where appropriate, the Board may consider the selected use of deferred payment arrangements to reduce the risk of such critical loss. From time to time, it may be necessary to offer sign-on equity to offset or mirror unvested equity, which a prospective executive must forfeit to take up employment with Origin. No retention arrangements were put in place for Executive KMP in FY2021.",

A restatement for these factors for FY2018 only was provided in the FY2019 Consolidated Financial Statements at note A1 Segments and in the Statement of cash flows, for indicative comparison purposes only.\n- 2 On a continuing activities basis (excludes Lattice Energy for FY2017 and FY2018).\n- 3 Adjusted Net Debt for FY2020 includes first recognition of lease liability ($514 million) under AASB16.\n- 4 Distribution break-even reported since FY2018 following commissioning of APLNG Train 2.\n- 5 sNPS is measured at the business level and is an industry-recognised measure of customer advocacy.\n- 6 TRIFR is the total number of injuries resulting in lost time, restricted work duties or medical treatment per million hours worked.\n- 7 CEO-1 represents Executives reporting directly to the CEO. It has been restated to include the CEO, in line with market practice and consistent with Chief Executive Women guidance and 40:40 Vision definitions, and to align with reporting lines as at 30 June in each year. CEO-2 includes roles directly reporting to CEO-1. Senior leadership roles captures the three reporting levels below CEO and includes roles with base salaries exceeding approximately $200,000 per annum.\n- 8 Employee engagement is measured as a score through an annual Company-wide survey conducted independently.\n\n9 This is the total dollar value of STI awarded for Executive KMP as a percentage of their total maximum STI. The percentage of STI forfeited is this amount subtracted from 100\n\nper cent. The FY2021 figure excludes M Schubert, whose STI award was forfeited. If M Schubert's forfeited STI is included, the figure would reduce to 42.4%.\n\n- 11 Dividends represent the interim plus final dividends determined for each financial year. For FY2021, this includes the final dividend determined on 19 August 2021 to be paid on 1 October 2021. The amounts paid within each financial year are 0c, 0c, 10c, 30c and 22.5c, respectively.\n- 12 TSR calculations use the three-month VWAP share price to 30 June, reflecting the testing methodology for relative TSR ranking.\n- 13 Underlying ROCE is defined in the Glossary and Interpretation.\n- 14 LTI awards granted in FY2017 were allocated 50% to a ROCE target, which vested at a level of 70.6% on 24 August 2020, and the other 50% to a RTSR target, which failed to reach its vesting threshold at test on 30 June 2021 and was subsequently wholly forfeited.",

Targets set at the beginning of the year may be subject to events materially outside the course of business and outside the control of the current management, in which case discretion may be required to vary targets or outcomes to reflect the intended purpose and/or actual results and achievements. The governing principles emphasise fairness and symmetry: fairness to shareholders and Executives, and symmetry of treatment between favourable and unfavourable events.\n\nSpecific examples in relation to the implementation of these principles in FY2021 were a reduction in the target for NCOIA to adjust for the additional investment in Octopus Energy announced in December 2020, offset by an increase to the target to account for deferred capex in Growth Assets and APLNG. The additional investment in Octopus arose after targets were set. The Board's approach was that the investment was a beneficial decision for shareholders and not one for which management be penalised, accordingly the target was reduced. In the case of the capex underspend compared to plans in place when the target was set, the approach taken was that management should not benefit from such reduced scope or deferral, accordingly the amount of the underspend was added to the target. The Board analysed outcomes with and without any adjustments, finding that net movements were minor and that no unwarranted benefit or significant disadvantage arose from the process.\n\nThe EPS and Energy Markets EBITDA scorecard measures are presented in the financial accounts in terms of underlying, which is also the starting point for consideration in setting of targets for STI purposes. Further adjustment may be made according to the governing principles. In FY2021 there was no material difference from the underlying view.\n\n## 4.2.1 STI outcomes\n\nFor FY2021, the Board considered the effect and implications on the STI scorecard (Section 4.3) of the following positive and negative factors including:\n\n- \u00b7 targets being set at the start of the year based on commodity price outlooks at that time;\n- \u00b7 the impact of increased network and metering costs that cannot be recovered in regulated tariffs;\n- \u00b7 the cumulative impact of regulatory actions by federal and state governments that limit the capacity for EBITDA growth in the Energy Markets business;\n- \u00b7 the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on domestic and global demand; and\n- \u00b7 management's business execution and responses to challenges.\n\nHaving regard for all these factors, advice from each of the Board committees and in consideration of shareholder experience and expectations, the Board determined that management has responded well to changing priorities and market conditions in an extraordinarily challenging and dynamic environment. Against this background, and with particular regard for the financial results, the CEO and the Board agreed to make a 25 per cent reduction to the formulaic outcome of the CEO scorecard which is provided in Section 4.3. Outcomes for all Executive KMP are provided in Section 4.3.1.\n\n## 4.2.2 LTI outcomes\n\nA partial vesting (35.3 per cent) of LTI awards granted in FY2017 occurred during the year. This was the first vesting of any LTI in nine years and resulted from above-target performance on a ROCE performance measure, which comprised half of the award.\n\nThe target for this ROCE measure was set at grant in the form of two gates, both of which need to be achieved for vesting to occur. The starting point for ROCE calculations for these gates is statutory EBIT divided by average capital employed (underlying ROCE data is presented in the Operating and Financial Review).\n\nThe first gate required that the average ROCE across the four financial years (FY2017-FY2020) equalled or exceeded the average of the four annual plan targets (which was 7.7 per cent p.a.) for any vesting to occur. The second gate required that the ROCE equalled or exceeded 9.5 per cent p.a. 1 (for 50 per cent vesting) or 11.5 per cent p.a. (for full vesting) in either the third or fourth financial year, with pro-rata vesting between those levels. An average ROCE of 8.4 per cent p.a was achieved with 10.32 per cent recorded in FY2019, resulting in a calculated 70.6 per cent vesting for this half of the award. The Board found no reason to vary the calculation outcome. Accordingly, the vest was confirmed at the calculated level. The other half of the award was subject to a 4-year RTSR hurdle against a 'ten-up/ten-down' peer group. 2 At the test date of 30 June 2021, this tranche failed to achieve a ranking above that of the 50th percentile in the peer group (the vesting threshold), and it was subsequently lapsed.",

It resulted in an STI outcome for CEO of 46.6 per cent of maximum (77.8 per cent of target).\n\nThe majority of the CEO's scorecard objectives are shared across Other Executive KMP. However, their weightings will differ according to their specific divisional metrics. Other Executive KMP scorecard outcomes were all below target and ranged between 44.3 to 57.8 per cent of maximum (74.0 to 96.5 per cent of target). M Schubert's outcome was zero as his STI award was forfeited on resignation. In the context of the team's operational execution and response to the challenging headwinds the Board concluded that the below-target outcomes were appropriate and made no further discretionary adjustments. The aggregate outcome for all Executive KMP was 50.7 per cent of maximum (84.5 per cent of target), ignoring the zero STI award for M Schubert.\n\n|               | STI award   | STI award    | STI award   | STI award   |\n|---------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Executive KMP | % of target | % of maximum | % forfeited | $'000       |\n| F Calabria    | 77.8        | 46.6         | 53.4        | 1,425       |\n| L Tremaine    | 96.0        | 57.5         | 42.5        | 976         |\n| J Briskin     | 96.5        | 57.8         | 42.2        | 868         |\n| G Jarvis      | 74.0        | 44.3         | 55.7        | 681         |\n| M Schubert    | 0.0         | 0            | 100         | 0           |\n\n## 4.4 Total pay received in FY2021\n\nIn line with general market practice, a non-AASB presentation of actual pay received in FY2021 is provided below, as a summary of real or 'take home' pay.

It operates under a Charter (published on the Company's website at originenergy.com.au). The RPC met formally four times during the reporting period.\n\nIncluding its Chairman, the RPC has five members, all of whom are independent NEDs (see Section 1 for details). The RPC's Charter requires a minimum of three NEDs. In addition, there is a standing invitation to all Board members to attend the RPC's meetings. Management may attend RPC meetings by invitation but a member of management will not be present when their own remuneration is under discussion.\n\nThe following diagram sets out the role of the RPC and its operational relationships with the Board, management, stakeholders and external advisors.\n\n## Board\n\nThe Board approves:\n\n- \u00b7 Executive remuneration policy\n- \u00b7 remuneration for the CEO and ELT\n- \u00b7 STI and LTI targets and hurdles\n- \u00b7 NED fees\n- \u00b7 CEO and ELT succession and appointments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Remuneration and People Committee\n\nThe RPC makes recommendations to the Board on the matters subject to its approval (listed above). The RPC approves remuneration scales, movements and equity allocations for employees other than the CEO and ELT.\n\nIn addition, the RPC stewards and advises the Board and management on remuneration and people matters including:\n\n- \u00b7 future leader talent pipelines and development processes\n- \u00b7 people strategies and culture development\n- \u00b7 corporate governance and risk matters relating to people and remuneration (including conduct, diversity and gender pay equity)\n- \u00b7 effectiveness of the remuneration policy and its implementation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Management\n\nManagement provides relevant data and information for RPC consideration (practice insights, and legal, tax, accounting and actuarial advice) and makes recommendations to the RPC concerning remuneration and people matters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Information exchange with other Board\n\ncommittees , notably the Audit and Risk committees, to ensure that all relevant matters are considered before the RPC makes remuneration recommendations and decisions.\n\n## Consultation with external stakeholders and shareholders\n\nRegular dialogue with shareholders and proxy advisors.\n\n## Independent remuneration advisors\n\nThe RPC appoints an external independent advisor to assist it with market and governance issues, benchmarking, best practice observations and general advice.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## 5.2 Remuneration advisors\n\nThe RPC engages external advisors from time to time to conduct benchmarking, advise on regulatory and market developments, and review proposals and reports. Protocols have been established for engaging and dealing with external advisors, including those defined as remuneration consultants for the purposes of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act). These protocols are to ensure independence and avoid conflicts of interest.\n\nThe protocols require that remuneration advisors are directly engaged by the RPC and act on instruction from its Chairman. Reports must be delivered directly to the RPC Chairman. The advisor is prohibited from communicating with Company management except as authorised by the Chairman, and even then limited to the provision or validation of factual and policy data. The advisor must furnish a statement confirming the absence of any undue influence from management.\n\nThe RPC generally seeks information rather than specific remuneration recommendations within the definition of the Act, and this was the case during FY2021. Guerdon Associates was appointed for this period; however, it did not provide any remuneration recommendations as defined under the Act.\n\nIn addition, the RPC makes use of general market trend information from a variety of commercial and industry sources and has access to in-house remuneration professionals who provide it with guidance and analysis on request.\n\nThe recommendations that the RPC makes to the Board are based on its own independent assessment of the advice and information received from these multiple sources, using its experience and having careful regard to the principles and objectives of the remuneration framework, Company performance, shareholder and community expectations, and good governance.\n\n## 5.3 Conduct, accountability and risk management\n\nEach year the full Board formally reviews the conduct, behaviour and risk management of the CEO and each member of the Executive Leadership Team, taking feedback from the Chairs of the Health, Safety & Environment Committee, Audit Committee, and the Risk Committee; from the internal auditor; and from the General Counsel and Executive General Manager Company Secretariat, Risk and Governance; and the Executive General Manager, People & Culture. The review considers conduct, behaviour, risk and reputation matters as well as operational performance and contribution.\n\nThis process is in addition to the behavioural assessment process which forms part of the company-wide performance management framework (see Section 2.2). The Board is guided by a set of overarching principles to apply in assessing items or events that impact risk (including non-financial risk) or performance. This ensures a consistent approach to determining whether discretionary adjustments to incentive outcomes are warranted (positive or negative modification) to achieve fairness for Executives and shareholders.\n\nIn addition to this process for moderation of award outcomes the RPC and the Board have wide discretionary tools to prevent the award (or retention) of inappropriate benefits, including malus and clawback.\n\n## Malus\n\nMalus refers to the reduction or cancellation of advised awards, or of unvested/unreleased equity or shares; or to a determination to reduce the level of vesting that would otherwise apply; or to extend the existing period of a holding lock or trading restriction.\n\nMalus has been applied over time, both to STI formulaic outcomes and to LTI allocations, to provide better alignment of variable pay outcomes with the broader context and overall circumstances of the Company.\n\n## Clawback\n\nClawback is a reference to the recovery of benefits after they have been paid, vested or released. The Board has power to exercise clawback to recover or cancel shares arising from equity awards, and to recover cash proceeds from the sale of such shares, or to recover cash awards. Recovery may be limited by law or regulation. There have been no circumstances to date in which the Board has sought to apply clawback.\n\nFraud, dishonesty, gross misconduct, negligence, breach of duties and other serious matters would have consequences additional to the sanctions and provisions referred to above.\n\n## 5.4 Change of control\n\nThe Board may determine that all or a specified number of unvested securities will vest or cease to be subject to restrictions where there is a change of control event.\n\n## 5.5 Capital reorganisation\n\nOn a capital reorganisation, the number of unvested share rights and Options held by participants may be adjusted in a manner determined by the Board, to minimise or eliminate any material advantage or disadvantage to the participant. If new awards are granted, they will, unless the Board determines otherwise, be subject to the same terms and conditions as the original awards.",

This ensures that NEDs are able to independently and objectively assess both Executive and Company performance.\n\nBoard and committee fees take into account market rates for similar positions at relevant Australian organisations (those of comparable size and complexity) and fairly reflect the time commitments and responsibilities involved. The aggregate cap for overall NED remuneration remains at $3.2 million p.a., as approved by shareholders in 2017.\n\nThe Origin Chairman receives a single fee that includes committee activities, while other NEDs receive a NED Base Fee and separate fees for their role on specific committees (other than the Nomination Committee, which is considered within the NED Base Fee). All fees include superannuation contributions.\n\nThe table below summarises the structure and level of NED fees. No change to the fee structure or quantum is proposed for FY2022.\n\n| Office                                         | FY2021 and FY2022 ($'000)   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Board - Chairman (inclusive of committee fees) | 677                         |\n| NED Base Fee (exclusive of committee fees)     | 196                         |\n| Audit - Chairman                               | 57                          |\n| Audit - Member                                 | 29                          |\n| RPC - Chairman                                 | 47                          |\n| RPC - Member                                   | 23.5                        |\n| HSE - Chairman                                 | 47                          |\n| HSE - Member                                   | 23.5                        |\n| Risk - Chairman                                | 47                          |\n| Risk - Member                                  | 23.5                        |\n| Nomination - Chairman                          | nil                         |\n| Nomination - Member                            | nil                         |\n\n## 6.2 Minimum shareholding requirement for Non-executive Directors\n\nTo align the interests of the Board and shareholders, NEDs are required to build and then maintain a minimum shareholding in the Company. The MSR reference for the Chairman is 200 per cent of the NED Base Fee, and for all other NEDs it is 100 per cent of the NED Base Fee. The Board sets the MSR from time to time as a number of shares determined by reference to the level and any movements in the NED Base Fee and/or the share price. 1 The numeric shareholding levels are currently set at 28,000 shares (56,000 for the Chairman) and will be redetermined during FY2022.\n\nNEDs are expected to reach the MSR within three years of their appointment and maintain it thereafter while in office. At the date of this report, all NEDs were above the relevant MSR level. Details of NED shareholdings are included in Table 7-3.\n\nA NED Share Plan (NEDSP) was approved by shareholders in 2018. The NEDSP is a salary sacrifice plan that allows NEDs to sacrifice up to 50 per cent of their annual NED Base Fee to acquire share rights. Each share right is a right to receive a fully-paid ordinary share in Origin, subject to the terms of the grant. The plan is intended to facilitate the acquisition of shares for new Directors to ensure they meet the obligations imposed under the MSR. As at the date of the report, and noting that all NEDs have met their MSR obligations, no share rights have been purchased and no shares allotted under the NEDSP.",

STI cash is paid after the end of the financial year to which it relates but is allocated to the earning year. The balance of the STI award is Deferred STI.\n- 4 Movement in leave provision over the reporting period. Negative movement indicates that leave taken during the year exceeded leave accrued during the current year.\n- 5 Includes Deferred STI and other equity arrangements subject to continuous employment. Deferred STI is that portion of the accounting value of equity granted or to be granted (RSs and/or DSRs) under the STI plan for the current and prior periods attributable to the reporting period. In following reporting periods, the accumulated expense is adjusted for the number of instruments then expected to be released or vested. In good leaver circumstances, a bring-forward of future-period accounting expense may occur where a cessation of employment occurs before the normal vesting date.\n- 6 LTI includes all long-term equity awards (those not pursuant to the STI Plan) and represents that portion of the accounting value of the awards made, or to be made, for the current and prior periods, which is attributable to the reporting period. See Note G3 for details on share-based remuneration accounting.\n- 7 The increase in base salary for J Briskin, G Jarvis and M Schubert reflects a mid-year change during FY2020. No increase applied for FY2021.\n- 8 'Other' includes accommodation benefits associated with travel from home base to the Brisbane office.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The address of the Company's registered office is Level 32, Tower 1, 100 Barangaroo Avenue, Barangaroo NSW 2000. The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Company and its controlled entities (the Group or Origin) are described in the segment information in note A1.\n\nOn 19 August 2021, the Directors resolved to authorise the issue of these consolidated general purpose financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2021.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared:\n\n- \u00b7 in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), Australian Accounting Standards and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB), and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board;\n- \u00b7 on a historical cost basis, except for derivatives and other financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value; and\n- \u00b7 on a going concern basis. As at 30 June 2021, the consolidated statement of financial position shows a net current liability position of $1,656 million. The deficit is primarily caused by the classification of capital markets debt maturing in the next 12 months as current liabilities. Notwithstanding the net current liability position, the Group has reasonable grounds to believe it will be able to pay its debts as and when they become due, based on the continued strong cash flows of the Group's existing operations, the Group's overall net asset position, and the Group's strong financial profile, which includes significant committed undrawn bank debt facilities and cash totalling $3,279 million.\n\nThe financial statements:\n\n- \u00b7 are presented in Australian dollars;\n- \u00b7 are rounded to the nearest million dollars, unless otherwise stated, in accordance with Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191; and\n- \u00b7 do not early adopt any Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have been issued or amended but are not yet effective.\n\n## Change to accounting policy not yet adopted - IFRIC agenda decision - Configuration or Customisation Costs in a Cloud Computing Arrangement\n\nIn April 2021, the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) published a decision relating to configuration and customisation costs incurred in implementing Software as a Service arrangements. The Group/ Company is assessing the impact of the IFRIC decision on its accounting policy, which may result in previously capitalised costs being recognised as an expense. The process to quantify the impact of the decision is ongoing, due to the effort required in obtaining the underlying information from historical records covering multiple projects, and assessing the nature of each of the costs. At the date of this report, the impact of the IFRIC agenda decision on the Group/Company is not reasonably estimable.\n\n## Use of judgements and estimates\n\nPreparing the financial statements in conformity with Australian Accounting Standards requires management to make judgements and apply estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions, which are based on historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, form the basis of judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Throughout the notes to the financial statements, further information is provided about key management judgements and estimates that we consider material to the financial statements.\n\n## The Group's operating environment and COVID-19\n\nThe Group's operating environment has been impacted by a significant reduction in commodity prices as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors have had wider impacts on consumers, businesses and the overall economy. The Group entered the 2021 financial year in a financially resilient position with significantly reduced upstream costs at APLNG, and materially reduced debt. This has enabled the Group to respond to the pandemic with a focus on safely maintaining energy supply and supporting customers who have been financially affected.\n\nThe economic impacts of the changes in the Group's operating environment due to commodity price and COVID-19 impacts have implications for various line\n\nitems in the financial statements, including revenue and receivables, equity accounted investments, carrying value of non-current assets, provisions, derivatives and other non-financial assets/liabilities.\n\n## Use of judgements and estimates relating to COVID-19\n\nIn the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, management has made a number of judgements and applied estimates in relation to changes in the Group's operating environment, the impact of the reduction in commodity prices and COVID-19. The judgements and estimates that are material to the financial report are discussed in the following notes:\n\n- \u00b7 A2 - Revenue\n- \u00b7 B2.2 - Summary APLNG statement of financial position\n- \u00b7 C1 - Trade and other receivables\n- \u00b7 C3 - Property, plant and equipment\n- \u00b7 C4 - Intangible assets\n- \u00b7 C6 - Provisions\n- \u00b7 C8 - Impairment of non-current assets",

        "page_content": "## Overview (continued)\n\n## Key judgements and estimates - Renewable Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)\n\nManagement judgement has been applied on the adoption of AASB 16 Leases to a number of the Group's renewable PPAs. In June 2021, IFRIC published a tentative agenda decision addressing whether an agreement for the use of a windfarm provides the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits to qualify as a lease. At the date of this report, this guidance is still a tentative decision and is open for comment. Once IFRIC has published a final decision, the Group will ensure the updated guidance is reflected in its accounting policy and financial statements.\n\nIf the PPAs had not been considered to meet the definition of a lease, net electricity derivative liabilities of $898 million would have been recognised in the statement of financial position at 30 June 2021. A $449 million loss would have been treated as an item excluded from underlying profit, consistent with other fair value movements.\n\nDuring the year, the Group recognised an impairment of goodwill allocated to the Energy Markets Retail CGU amounting to $830 million and the cash flows associated with the renewable PPAs are included in the calculation of the recoverable amount for the Retail CGU. Should IFRIC conclude that the PPAs are required to be classified as derivatives, this change in the Group's accounting policy will result in an income statement reclassification between impairment expense and the fair value loss related to the PPAs, representing the mark to market loss on the PPAs currently included in the $830m impairment. This reclassification forms part of the $449 million fair value loss noted above but will vary in quantum due to the different discount rates used in the derivative fair value and recoverable amount calculations.\n\nRegardless of whether the Group's renewable PPAs are classified as leases, recognition and measurement of the realised component, being the amount incurred for electricity purchased during the period, is the same. Consistent with prior periods, the realised component is recognised in expenses (refer to note A4) within the income statement. To determine the value of the electricity derivatives that would be recognised were the Group's renewable PPAs not classified as leases, significant management judgement is required to estimate future generation profiles and forward electricity spot prices relative to the terms of the individual contract for periods up to 15 years.\n\nPayments under the Group's leases of renewable power plants are entirely variable as they depend on the amount of energy produced in each period. Accordingly, such leases have nil lease liability balances and thus nil right-of-use asset balances. All payments made under these leases are recognised within operating expenses as incurred.\n\n## Reclassifications\n\nAt the date of signing the 30 June 2020 Group consolidated financial statements, the APLNG financial statements had not yet been finalised. The Group recorded an impairment of $746 million in relation to its equity accounted investment in APLNG, based on the Group's carrying value of its investment and its assessment of the recoverable amount. This was recorded as an impairment charge in the Group's income statement. Subsequently, the APLNG 30 June 2020 financial statements were finalised, including a US$251 million (A$366 million) (100 per cent APLNG) impairment charge within the joint venture. Accordingly, the Group's 30 June 2020 comparatives have been updated for this timing difference to reclassify $96 million (37.5 per cent of $366 million net of tax) of the impairment charge to loss from equity accounted investments. The total net impairment charge recorded by the Group has not changed.\n\nThe following disclosures have been amended to reflect the reclassification described above.\n\n## - Income Statement\n\n|                                       | 2020 $m   | Reclass- ification   | Restated 2020 $m   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------|--------------------|\n| Revenue                               | 13,157    |                      | 13,157             |\n| Other income                          | 54        |                      | 54                 |\n| Expenses                              | (13,514)  | 96                   | (13,418)           |\n| Results of equity accounted investees | 608       | (96)                 | 512                |\n| Interest income                       | 190       |                      | 190                |\n| Interest expense                      | (316)     |                      | (316)              |\n| Profit before income tax              | 179       |                      | 179                |\n| Income tax expense                    | (93)      |                      | (93)               |\n| Profit for the year                   | 86        |                      | 86                 |\n\n<!-- image -->",

This reflects the way the Group's businesses are managed, rather than the legal structure of the Group.\n\nThe reporting segments are organised according to the nature of the activities undertaken and are detailed below.\n\n- \u00b7 Energy Markets : Energy retailing and wholesaling, power generation and LPG operations predominantly in Australia. Also includes Origin's investment in Octopus Energy Holdings Limited (Octopus Energy).\n- \u00b7 Integrated Gas : Origin's investment in APLNG, growth opportunities and management of LNG hedging and trading activities. For greater transparency, the investment in APLNG is presented separately from the residual component of the segment in the following disclosures.\n- \u00b7 Corporate : Various business development and support activities that are not allocated to operating segments.\n\nUnderlying profit and underlying EBITDA are non-statutory (non-IFRS) measures. The objective of measuring and reporting underlying profit and underlying EBITDA is to provide a more meaningful and consistent representation of financial performance by removing items that distort performance or are non-recurring in nature.\n\nItems excluded from the calculation of underlying profit are reported to the Managing Director as not representing the underlying performance of the business and thus are excluded from underlying profit or underlying EBITDA. These items are determined after consideration of the nature of the item, the significance of the amount and the consistency in treatment from period to period.\n\nThe nature of items excluded from underlying profit and underlying EBITDA are:\n\n- \u00b7 Changes in the fair value of financial instruments not in accounting hedge relationships, to remove the significant volatility caused by timing mismatches in valuing financial instruments and the related underlying transactions. The valuation changes are subsequently recognised in underlying earnings when the underlying transactions are settled;\n- \u00b7 Realised and unrealised foreign exchange gains/losses on debt held to hedge USD-denominated APLNG MRCPS, for which fair value changes are excluded from underlying profit;\n- \u00b7 Redundancies and other costs in relation to business restructuring, transformation or integration activities;\n- \u00b7 Gains/losses on the sale or acquisition of an asset/entity;\n- \u00b7 Transaction costs incurred in relation to the sale or acquisition of an entity;\n- \u00b7 Impairments of assets;\n- \u00b7 Significant onerous contracts; and\n- \u00b7 Other significant non-recurring items.\n\n<!-- image -->",

When determining revenue for the financial period, management estimates the volume of energy supplied since a customer's last bill. The estimation of unbilled consumption requires judgement and is based on various assumptions including:\n\n- \u00b7 volume and timing of energy consumed by customers;\n- \u00b7 allocation of estimated electricity and gas volumes to various pricing plans;\n- \u00b7 discounts linked to customer payment patterns; and\n- \u00b7 loss factors.\n\nManagement also uses unbilled consumption volumes to accrue network expenses incurred by the Group for unread customer electricity and gas meters.\n\nThe government-imposed lockdown and social distancing restrictions in response to COVID-19 have generally resulted in increased residential household energy consumption as more people stay at home, while businesses have reduced energy consumption in certain sectors. Given the unprecedented operating environment, the calculation of unbilled revenue requires significant judgement in estimating the level of energy consumption by customers during the unbilled period to 30 June 2021. The Group uses a backcasting model and volume-matching process to provide a reliable estimate of unbilled revenue as at 30 June 2021. Refer to note C1 for the Group's consideration of the COVID-19 impact on its cash collection of trade receivables and unbilled revenue.\n\n## Retail contracts\n\nRetail electricity service is generally marketed through standard service offers that provide customers with discounts on published tariff rates. Contracts have no fixed duration, generally require no minimum consumption, and can be terminated by the customer at any time without significant penalty. The supply of energy is considered a single performance obligation for which revenue is recognised upon delivery to customers at the offered rate. Where customers are eligible to receive additional behavioural discounts, Origin considers this to be variable consideration, which is estimated as part of the unbilled process.\n\n## Business and wholesale contracts\n\nContracts with business and wholesale customers are generally medium to long-term, higher-volume arrangements with fixed or index-linked energy rates that have been commercially negotiated. The nature and accounting treatment of this revenue stream is largely consistent with retail sales. Some business and wholesale sales arrangements also include the transfer of renewable energy certificates (RECs), which represent an additional performance obligation. Revenue is recognised for these contracts when Origin has the 'right to invoice' the customer for consideration that corresponds directly with the value of units of energy delivered to the customer.\n\n## Pool revenue\n\nPool revenue relates to sales by Origin generation assets into the NEM, as well as revenue associated with gross settled PPAs. Origin has assessed it is acting as the principal in relation to transactions with the NEM and therefore recognises pool sales on a gross basis. Revenue from these sales is recognised at the spot price achieved when control of the electricity passes to the grid.",

At the same time, when APLNG paid interest to the Group on MRCPS, the amount was capitalised by APLNG. Therefore, these capitalised interest amounts form part of the cost of APLNG's assets and these assets have been depreciated since commencement of operations. The proportion attributable to the Group's own interest (37.5 per cent) is eliminated through the equity accounted investment balance.\n- 3 Includes a movement of $(674) million in foreign exchange that has been recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve.\n\nReporting date balances are converted from USD to AUD using an end-of-period exchange rate of 0.7516 (2020: 0.6862).\n\n## Key judgements and estimates\n\nThe carrying amount of the Group's equity accounted investment in APLNG is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made. The Group's assessment of the recoverable amount uses a discounted cash flow methodology and considers a range of macroeconomic and project assumptions, including oil and LNG price, AUD/USD exchange rates, discount rates and costs over the asset's life.",

        "page_content": "## B4 Transactions between the Group and equity accounted investees\n\n## APLNG\n\n## Service transactions\n\nThe Group provides services to APLNG including corporate services, upstream operating services related to the development and operation of APLNG's natural gas assets, and marketing services relating to coal seam gas (CSG). The Group incurs costs in providing these services and charges APLNG for them in accordance with the terms of the contracts governing those services.\n\n## Commodity transactions\n\nSeparately, the Group has entered agreements to purchase gas from APLNG (2021: $354 million; 2020: $339 million) and sell gas to APLNG (2021: $7 million; 2020: $32 million). At 30 June 2021, the Group's outstanding payable balance for purchases from APLNG was $55 million (2020: $33 million) and outstanding receivable balance for sales to APLNG was $7 million (2020: $1 million).\n\n## Funding transactions\n\nThe Group has invested in USD MRCPS issued by APLNG. The MRCPS are the mechanism by which the funding for the CSG to LNG Project has been provided by the shareholders of APLNG in proportion to their ordinary equity interests. The MRCPS have a 6.37 per cent fixed-rate dividend obligation based on the relevant observable market interest rates and estimated credit margin at the date of issue. Dividends are paid twice per year and recognised as interest income as they accrue (refer note A3). During the year Origin's share of the MRCPS balance reduced to US$963 million following APLNG share buy-backs of US$456 million. The mandatory redemption date for the MRCPS is 30 June 2026.\n\nThe MRCPS are measured at fair value through profit and loss in Origin's financial statements as disclosed in note C7. The carrying value was $1,296 million as at 30 June 2021 (2020: $2,109 million) reflecting the Group's view that APLNG will utilise cash flows generated from operations to redeem the MRCPS for their full issue price prior to their mandatory redemption date. In APLNG's financial statements the related liability is carried at amortised cost.\n\n## Octopus Energy\n\nOn 1 May 2020, the Group announced the acquisition of a 20 per cent equity stake in Octopus Energy for a total cash consideration of \u00a3215 million ($412 million), of which \u00a365 million was paid prior to 30 June 2020 and \u00a3150 million was deferred over two financial years. The Group has also entered into a licensing agreement for a total cash consideration of \u00a325 million, of which \u00a35 million was paid prior to 30 June 2020 and \u00a320 million was deferred over two financial years. During the year, the Group paid \u00a350 million ($95 million) to Octopus Energy in respect of the deferred consideration payable under the equity purchase agreement. A further \u00a320 million ($36 million) was also paid to Octopus Energy during the year, representing \u00a310 million of the deferred consideration payable under the licensing agreement and an additional \u00a310 million which became payable on achievement of certain milestones. The remaining \u00a3110 million ($202 million) of deferred consideration is payable within the next 12 months.\n\nOn 7 January 2021, the Group committed an additional investment of \u00a336 million (~A$65 million) to maintain its 20 per cent equity interest, following the announcement of an agreed partnership between Octopus Energy and Tokyo Gas. Subsequently, the Group has paid \u00a327 million ($48 million) in March 2021 as a result of relevant completions being satisfied. The remaining \u00a38.7 million ($16 million) is contingent in nature and will only become payable upon achievement of agreed milestones and is therefore not included in the deferred consideration balance as of 30 June 2021.\n\nDuring the year, Octopus Energy utilised the remaining available tranche of a working capital facility, for which the Group has provided a financial guarantee to Octopus Energy's financiers, in accordance with the agreement entered into with Octopus Energy in the prior year. During the year, $8 million (2020: $1 million) has been recognised within other income in respect of the financial guarantee income.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Unbilled receivables represent estimated gas and electricity supplied to customers since their previous bill was issued. The carrying value of all receivables (including unbilled revenue) reflects the amount anticipated to be collected.\n\n## Key judgements and estimates\n\nRecoverability of trade receivables : Judgement is required in determining the level of provisioning for customer debts. Impairment allowances take into account the age of the debt, historic collection trends and expectations about future economic conditions.\n\nUnbilled revenue : Unbilled gas and electricity revenue is not collectable until customers' meters are read and invoices issued. Refer to note A2 for judgement applied in determining the amount of unbilled energy revenue to recognise.\n\n## Credit risk and collectability\n\nThe Group minimises the concentration of credit risk by undertaking transactions with a large number of customers from across a broad range of industries. Credit approval processes are in place for large customers and all customers are required to pay in accordance with agreed payment terms. Depending on the customer segment, settlement terms are generally 14 to 30 days from the date of the invoice. For some debtors, the Group may also obtain security in the form of deposits, guarantees, deeds of undertaking or letters of credit, which can be called upon if the counterparty defaults.\n\nDebtor collectability is assessed on an ongoing basis and any resulting impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. The Group applies the simplified approach to providing for trade receivable and unbilled revenue impairment, which requires the 'expected lifetime credit losses' to be recognised when the receivable is initially recognised. To measure expected lifetime credit losses, trade receivables and unbilled revenue balances have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and ageing profiles. A debtor balance is written off when recovery is no longer assessed to be possible.\n\nWith the emergence of COVID-19, the government introduced lockdowns and other restrictions to combat the spread of the virus, which has had a wide-ranging impact on businesses and individuals, with job losses and business shutdowns in certain industries. This has placed increased pressure on businesses' ability to absorb these impacts, and on consumer budgets. Collectively, this impacts the Group's debt collection performance and any expected credit losses. At the date of this report, the Group has not experienced a significant impact on its debt collection as a result of COVID-19.\n\nDespite this, there remains future credit risk associated with trade receivable amounts due to:\n\n- \u00b7 The impact of the Australian Government stimulus packages and other relief measures coming to an end, coupled with continued uncertainty around the impacts of any additional lock-downs required;\n- \u00b7 The end of the COVID-19 disconnection freeze introduced by the Group, and the length of time for any impacts to be realised in the customer accounts; and\n- \u00b7 More broadly, the unprecedented nature of this event, such that historical performance cannot be used in isolation as an indicator of the future.

        "page_content": "## C1 Trade and other receivables (continued)\n\nThe Group has assessed its provision for bad and doubtful debts in accordance with AASB 9 Financial Instruments considering:\n\n- \u00b7 Current collection performance, including the COVID-19 period when lockdown restrictions and government stimulus measures were in place, and expected credit default frequencies;\n- \u00b7 Regulatory and economic outlook, including forecast unemployment rates and the timing and quantum of government stimulus packages and other relief measures provided by banks and landlords; and\n- \u00b7 Risk profile of customers and industry-specific risk assessments based on actual and forecasted volumes as a measure for credit risk.\n\nThese considerations require significant judgement. The Group models the expected credit loss by customer type and industry group. Each segment has been reviewed and a credit risk weighting has been applied depending on the extent COVID-19 has impacted the industry group and the level of significantly aged receivables outstanding. Where possible, publicly available information, such as expected default rates, has been applied. For residential customers, a higher allowance for impairment is included for those with significantly aged receivables.\n\nAs at 30 June 2021, the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables and unbilled revenue is $186 million (2020: $162 million), with $34 million (2020: $40 million) of this amount reflecting the increased potential impact of COVID-19.\n\nThe average age of trade receivables is 19 days (2020: 20 days). Other receivables are neither past due nor impaired, and relate principally to generation and hedge contract receivables. The ageing of trade receivables and unbilled revenue at the reporting date is detailed below.\n\n|                      | 2021   | 2021                  | 2020   | 2020                  |\n|----------------------|--------|-----------------------|--------|-----------------------|\n| $m                   | Gross  | Impairment  allowance | Gross  | Impairment  allowance |\n| Unbilled revenue     | 1,465  | (21)                  | 1,092  | (20)                  |\n| Not yet due          | 380    | (8)                   | 387    | (14)                  |\n| Less than 30 days    | 105    | (7)                   | 102    | (6)                   |\n| 31-60 days past due  | 45     | (9)                   | 46     | (8)                   |\n| 61-90 days past due  | 30     | (9)                   | 40     | (10)                  |\n| Greater than 91 days | 207    | (132)                 | 185    | (104)                 |\n| Total                | 2,232  | (186)                 | 1,852  | (162)                 |\n\nThe movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables and unbilled revenue during the year is shown below.\n\n| Balance as at 1 July         | 162   | 135   |\n|------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Impairment losses recognised | 88    | 124   |\n| Amounts written off          | (64)  | (97)  |\n| Balance as at 30 June        | 186   | 162   |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Expenditure incurred in each area of interest is accounted for using the successful efforts method. Under this method, all general exploration and evaluation costs are expensed as incurred except the direct costs of acquiring the rights to explore, drilling exploratory wells and evaluating the results of drilling. These direct costs are capitalised as exploration and evaluation assets pending the determination of the success of the well. If a well does not result in a successful discovery, the previously capitalised costs are immediately expensed.\n\nThe carrying amounts of exploration and evaluation assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether any of the following indicators of impairment are present:\n\n- \u00b7 the right to explore has expired, or will expire in the near future, and is not expected to be renewed;\n- \u00b7 further exploration for and evaluation of resources in the specific area is not budgeted or planned for;\n- \u00b7 the Group has decided to discontinue activities in the area; or\n- \u00b7 there is sufficient data to indicate the carrying value is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale.\n\nWhere an indicator of impairment exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. If it is concluded that the carrying value of an exploration and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered by future exploitation or sale, an impairment is recognised in the income statement for the difference.\n\n## Key judgement\n\n## Recoverability of exploration and evaluation assets\n\nAssessment of the recoverability of capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure requires certain estimates and assumptions to be made as to future events and circumstances, particularly in relation to whether economic quantities of reserves have been discovered. Such estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available.\n\nUpon approval of the commercial development of a project, the exploration and evaluation asset is classified as a development asset. Once production commences, development assets are transferred to PP&E.",

Cost includes the estimated future cost of required closure and rehabilitation.\n\nThe carrying amounts of assets are reviewed to determine if there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated and if required, an impairment is recognised in the income statement.\n\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost of each asset over its expected useful life. Leasehold improvements are amortised over the period of the relevant lease or estimated useful life, whichever is shorter.

ROU assets are initially valued at the corresponding lease liability amount adjusted for any payments already made, lease incentives received or initial direct costs incurred when entering into the lease. Where the Group is required to restore the ROU asset at the end of the lease, the cost of restoration is also included in the value of the ROU asset.\n\nROU assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the ROU asset. The carrying amounts of ROU assets are reviewed to determine if there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated, and if required, an impairment is recognised in the income statement.\n\nPayments under the Group's leases of renewable power plants are entirely variable as they depend on the amount of energy produced each period. Such leases have nil lease liability balances and thus nil ROU asset balances. All payments made under these leases are disclosed as variable lease expenses within note A4.\n\nRefer to note D2 for discussion of the recognition and measurement of associated lease liability balances.\n\n## Key judgements and estimates\n\nRecoverability of carrying values : Estimates of recoverable amounts are based on an asset's value-in-use or fair value less costs to sell, whichever is higher. The recoverable amount of these assets is sensitive to changes in key assumptions. Refer to note C8 for further details.\n\nEstimation of useful economic lives : A technical assessment of the operating life of an asset requires significant judgement. Useful lives are amended prospectively when a change in the operating life is determined.\n\nRestoration provisions : An asset's carrying value includes the estimated future cost of required closure and rehabilitation activities. Refer to note C6 for a judgement related to restoration provisions.\n\nLease term : Where lease arrangements contain options to extend the term or terminate the contract, the Group assesses whether it is 'reasonably certain' that the option to extend or terminate will be exercised. Consideration is given to all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to extend or terminate the contract.

Also included within this balance are rehabilitation provisions for contamination at existing and legacy operating sites.\n- 2 All contracts in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations exceed the economic benefits are deemed onerous and require a provision to be recognised up front. The closing balance includes an onerous contract provision of $398 million (US$299 million) for the Cameron LNG purchase contract and $13 million was recognised during the year in respect of a short-term LNG sales contract with ENN.\n- 3 The closing balance of other provisions primarily relates to costs for compliance with safety standard requirements relating to the Eraring ash dam wall, costs associated with the new Myuna Bay Recreation Centre facility, and a make good provision relating to existing property leases.\n\nRestoration provisions are initially recognised at the best estimate of the costs to be incurred in settling the obligation. Where restoration activities are expected to occur more than 12 months from the reporting period, the provision is discounted using a risk-free rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. The unwinding of the discount is recognised in each period as interest expense.\n\nAt each reporting date, the restoration provision is remeasured in line with changes in discount rates, and changes to the timing or amount of costs to be incurred, based on current legal requirements and technology. Any changes in the estimated future costs associated with:\n\n- \u00b7 Restoration and dismantling are added to or deducted from the related asset; and\n- \u00b7 Environmental rehabilitation are expensed in the current period.\n\n## Key estimate\n\n## Restoration, rehabilitation and dismantling costs\n\nThe Group estimates the cost of future site restoration activities at the time of installation or construction of an asset, or when an obligation arises. Restoration often does not occur for many years and thus significant judgement is required as to the extent of work, cost and timing of future activities.",

Subsequently, they are measured at either the amount of any determined loss allowance or at the amount initially recognised less any cumulative income recognised, whichever is larger. The above financial guarantee relates to the working capital facility entered into by Octopus Energy with its financiers, as referred to in note B4, for which the Group has provided a guarantee.\n\n## C8 Impairment of non-current assets\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's cash generating units (CGUs) are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. Where an indicator of impairment exists, or where goodwill is present, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made.\n\n## Cash-generating units\n\nAssets are grouped together into the smallest group of individual assets that generate largely independent cash inflows (cash generating unit or (CGU)). As a result of the impairment indications identified and the goodwill associated with each CGU in the Energy Market segment, an impairment assessment was performed at June 2021 in line with the requirements under the accounting standards.\n\nThe Energy Markets segment consists of the following materially distinct CGUs:\n\n- \u00b7 Retail CGU : incorporates Mass Market customers, Commercial & Industrial customers and the Wholesale & Trading businesses for electricity and natural gas commodities. The Wholesale & Trading business includes various electricity PPAs and major wholesale gas supply contracts.\n- \u00b7 Generation CGU : incorporates cash flows from Origin's power stations.\n- \u00b7 LPG CGU : supplies and distributes LPG to residential and business locations across Australia and the Pacific.\n\n## Impairment testing for the year ended 30 June 2021\n\nOrigin's assessment of the carrying value of its non-current assets in Energy Markets considers a range of macroeconomic factors, including market prices for wholesale electricity, large-scale generation certificate (LGCs) and gas, retail market dynamics, discount rates and costs. The principal changes since the last assessment at 30 June 2020 are a significant reduction in wholesale electricity prices and a contraction in near-term gas earnings as a result of higher procurement costs and subdued business customer demand.\n\nAs a result, Origin has recognised an impairment of $998 million in respect of the Generation CGU, consisting of $833 million of Generation PP&E and $165 million of allocated goodwill, with the lower outlook for wholesale electricity prices driven by new supply expected to come online, including both renewable and dispatchable capacity, impacting the valuation of the Generation fleet, particularly Eraring Power Station.",

The value-in-use calculations are sensitive to a number of key assumptions requiring management judgement, including future commodity prices, regulatory policies, and the outlook for the market supply-and-demand conditions. The key assumptions used by the Group in its impairment assessment are shown in the table below.\n\n| Key assumptions                  | Energy Markets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Commodity prices                 | Future commodity price assumptions impact the recoverability of carrying values and are reviewed at least twice annually.

The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the Retail CGU is $4,620 million. The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to each of the other CGUs is not significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nTo the extent the CGUs that include a significant portion of goodwill have been written down to their respective recoverable amounts in the current year, any change in key assumptions on which the valuations are based would further impact asset carrying values. When modelled in isolation, it is estimated that changes in the key assumptions would result in the following additional impairments in FY2021.\n\n| Sensitivity   | Discount rates  increase by 1%   | Long-term  growth rates  decrease by 1%   |\n|---------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Retail        | (606)                            | (428)                                     |",

Information is also presented about how the Group manages capital, and the various financial risks to which the Group is exposed through its operating and financing activities.\n\n## D1 Capital management\n\nThe Group's objective when managing capital is to make disciplined capital allocation decisions between debt reduction, investment in growth and distributions to shareholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure while maintaining access to capital. Management believes that a strong investment-grade credit rating (Baa2) through the cycle and an appropriate level of net debt are required to meet these objectives. The Group's current credit rating is Baa2 (stable outlook) from Moody's.\n\nKey factors considered in determining the Group's capital structure and funding strategy at any point in time include expected operating cash flows, capital expenditure plans, the maturity profile of existing debt facilities, the dividend policy, and the ability to access funding from banks, capital markets and other sources.\n\nThe Group monitors its capital requirements through a number of metrics including the gearing ratio (target range of approximately 20 to 30 per cent) and an adjusted net debt to adjusted underlying EBITDA ratio (target range of 2.0x to 3.0x). These targets are consistent with attaining a strong investment-grade rating. Underlying EBITDA is a non-statutory (non-IFRS) measure.\n\nThe gearing ratio is calculated as adjusted net debt divided by adjusted net debt plus total equity. Net debt, which excludes cash held by Origin to fund APLNG-related operations, is adjusted to take into account the effect of FX hedging transactions on the Group's foreign currency debt obligations. The adjusted net debt to adjusted underlying EBITDA ratio is calculated as adjusted net debt divided by adjusted underlying EBITDA (Origin's underlying EBITDA less Origin's share of APLNG underlying EBITDA plus net cash flow from APLNG) over the relevant rolling 12-month period.\n\nThe Group monitors its current and future funding requirements for at least the next five years and regularly assesses a range of funding alternatives to meet these requirements in advance of when the funds are required.\n\n|                                                                | 2021 $m   | 2020 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Borrowings                                                     | 4,765     | 6,338     |\n| Lease liabilities                                              | 463       | 514       |\n| Total interest-bearing liabilities                             | 5,228     | 6,852     |\n| Less: Cash and cash equivalents excluding APLNG-related cash 1 | (442)     | (1,164)   |\n| Net debt                                                       | 4,786     | 5,688     |\n| Fair value adjustments on FX hedging transactions              | (147)     | (530)     |\n| Adjusted net debt                                              | 4,639     | 5,158     |\n| Total equity                                                   | 9,815     | 12,701    |\n| Total capital                                                  | 14,454    | 17,859    |\n| Gearing ratio                                                  | 32%       | 29%       |\n| Ratio of adjusted net debt to adjusted underlying EBITDA       | 2.9x      | 2.1x      |\n\n- 1 This balance excludes $30 million (2020: $76 million) of cash held by Origin, as upstream operator, to fund APLNG-related operations.\n\nThe Group undertook a bank debt extension during the year ended 30 June 2021. This activity was aimed at strengthening the capital profile by extending the weighted average tenor of the Group's debt portfolio.\n\nA summary of key transactions is shown below.\n\n## Bank debt facility extension\n\n2 July 2020 - extended $1.1 billion of bank debt facilities from a FY2023 maturity date to a new maturity date in FY2025. A further $0.2 billion of surplus liquidity was cancelled as part of this transaction.\n\n- 31 August 2020 - extended US$200 million of a bank guarantee facility from a FY2023 maturity date to a new maturity date in FY2025.\n\n## Debt maturity\n\n23 October 2020 - repaid the \u20ac750 million seven-year note under the Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) program. The notes had been swapped to A$950 million.\n\n- 19 December 2020 - repaid the US$65 million seven-year US Private Placement note.",

After that date, the liability is amortised to face value at maturity using an effective interest rate method.\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of future lease payments discounted at the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Where a lease includes termination and/or extension options, the impact of these options on the amount of future payments is included where exercise of such options is considered reasonably certain to occur. Interest expense is charged on outstanding lease liabilities that reduce over time as periodic payments are made.\n\nThe lease liability is remeasured when certain events occur, including changes in the lease term or changes in future lease payments such as those resulting from inflation-linked indexation or market rate rent reviews. On remeasurement of lease liabilities, a corresponding adjustment is made to the ROU asset.\n\nThe Group's leases of renewable power plants are entirely variable as they depend on the amount of energy generation in the period and, as such, there are no lease liability amounts associated with these leases. The variable lease payments associated with these leases are disclosed in note A4.\n\nThe contractual maturity of lease liabilities is disclosed within the liquidity table in note D4.\n\nThe contractual maturities of non-current borrowings are as set out below.\n\n|                              | 2021 $m   | 2020 $m   |\n|------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| One to two years             | 237       | 2,069     |\n| Two to five years            | 534       | 356       |\n| Over five years              | 2,056     | 2,585     |\n| Total non-current borrowings | 2,827     | 5,010     |\n\nSome of the Group's borrowings are subject to terms that allow the lender to call on the debt in the event of a breach of covenants.

The table below summarises these risks by nature of exposure and provides information about the risk mitigation strategies being applied.\n\n| Nature           | Sources of financial exposure                                                                                                                                       | Risk management strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Commodity price  | Future commercial transactions and recognised assets and  liabilities exposed to changes in electricity, oil, gas, coal or  environmental scheme certificate prices | Due to vertical integration, a significant portion of the  Group's spot electricity purchases from the NEM are  naturally hedged by generation sales into the NEM at  spot prices. The Group manages its remaining exposure  to commodity price fluctuations beyond Board-approved  limits using a mix of commercial contracts (such as  fixed-price purchase contracts) and derivative instruments  (described below).                                                            |\n| Foreign exchange | Foreign-denominated borrowings and investments (e.g.,  APLNG MRCPS) and future foreign currency denominated  commercial transactions                                | The Group limits its exposure to changes in foreign  exchange rates through forward foreign exchange  contracts and cross-currency interest rate swaps. In certain  circumstances, borrowings are left in a foreign currency, or  swapped from one foreign currency to another, to hedge  expected future business cash flows in that currency.  Significant foreign-denominated transactions undertaken  in the normal course of operations are managed on a  case-by-case basis. |\n| Interest rate    | Variable-rate borrowings (cash flow risk) and fixed-rate  borrowings (fair value risk)                                                                              | Interest rate exposures are kept within an acceptable range  as determined by the Board. Risk limits are managed  through a combination of fixed-rate and fixed-to-floating  interest rate swaps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n\n## Derivatives to manage market risks\n\nDerivative instruments are contracts with values that are derived from an underlying price index (or other variable) that require little or no initial net investment, and that are settled at a future date.\n\nThe Group uses the following types of derivative instruments to mitigate market risk.\n\n| Forwards                         | A contract documenting the underlying reference rate (such as benchmark price or exchange rate) to be paid or received on  a notional principal obligation at a future date.                                                                                               |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Futures                          | An exchange-traded contract to buy or sell an asset for an agreed price at a future date. Futures are net-settled in cash without  physical delivery of the underlying asset.                                                                                              |\n| Swaps                            | A contract in which two parties exchange a series of cash flows for another (such as fixed-for-floating interest rate).                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Options                          | A contract in which the buyer has the right, but not the obligation, to buy (a call option) or sell (a put option) an instrument at  a fixed price in the future. The seller has the corresponding obligation to fulfil the transaction if the buyer exercises the option. |\n| Structured  electricity products | A non-standardised contract, generally with an energy market participant, to acquire long-term capacity. These contracts  typically contain features similar to swaps and call options.                                                                                    |\n\nDerivatives are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. Movements in the price of the underlying variables, which cause the value of the contract to fluctuate, are reflected in the fair value of the derivative.\n\nThe method of recognising changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated in an 'accounting' hedge relationship. Derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are referred to as 'economic' hedges.\n\nFair value gains and losses attributable to economic hedges are recognised in the income statement and resulted in a $377 million loss (2020: $292 million gain) for the year. Fair value gains and losses attributable to accounting hedges are discussed in the Hedge Accounting section.",

These instruments are included in level 1.\n- \u00b7 Level 2 : The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (such as over-the-counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques that maximise the use of observable market data. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices), the instrument is included in level 2.\n- \u00b7 Level 3 : If one or more of the significant inputs required to fair value an instrument is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.\n\n| 2021                                        | Note   | Level 1 $m   | Level 2 $m   | Level 3 $m   | Total $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------|\n| Derivative financial assets                 | D4     | 44           | 1,066        | 25           | 1,135      |\n| Other financial assets at fair value        | C7     | 328          | 77           | 1,369        | 1,774      |\n| Financial assets carried at fair value      |        | 372          | 1,143        | 1,394        | 2,909      |\n| Derivative financial liabilities            | D4     | (86)         | (1,097)      | (64)         | (1,247)    |\n| Other financial liabilities at fair value   | C7     | (321)        | -            | -            | (321)      |\n| Financial liabilities carried at fair value |        | (407)        | (1,097)      | (64)         | (1,568)    |\n| 2020                                        |        | Level 1 $m   | Level 2 $m   | Level 3 $m   | Total $m   |\n| Derivative financial assets                 | D4     | 20           | 1,004        | 134          | 1,158      |\n| Other financial assets at fair value        | C7     | 163          | 72           | 2,171        | 2,406      |\n| Financial assets carried at fair value      |        | 183          | 1,076        | 2,305        | 3,564      |\n| Derivative financial liabilities            | D4     | (202)        | (944)        | (69)         | (1,215)    |\n| Other financial liabilities at fair value   | C7     | (234)        | -            | -            | (234)      |\n| Financial liabilities carried at fair value |        | (436)        | (944)        | (69)         | (1,449)    |\n\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of movements in the fair value of level 3 instruments during the period.\n\n|                                                         | $m    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Balance as at 1 July 2020                               | 2,236 |\n| New instruments recognised in the period                | (12)  |\n| Instruments transferred out of level 3                  | (7)   |\n| Net cash settlements paid/(received)                    | (602) |\n| Gains/(losses) recognised in other comprehensive income | 2     |\n| Gains/(losses) recognised in profit or loss:            |       |\n| Change in fair value                                    | (290) |\n| Cost of sales                                           | (103) |\n| Interest income                                         | 106   |\n| Balance as at 30 June 2021                              | 1,330 |",

The head entity within the tax-consolidated group is Origin Energy Limited. Tax funding arrangement amounts are recognised as inter-entity amounts.\n\nIncome tax expense is made up of current tax expense and deferred tax expense. Current tax expense represents the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using current tax rates and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax expense reflects the temporary differences between the accounting carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and its tax base.",

Uncertainty arises due to the possibility that changes in tax law or other future circumstances can impact the tax balances recognised in the financial statements. Ultimate outcomes may vary.\n\nDeferred taxes : The recognition of deferred tax balances requires judgement as to whether it is probable such balances will be utilised and/or reversed in the foreseeable future and there will be sufficient future taxable profits against which the benefits can be utilised.\n\nA deferred tax liability is recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in joint ventures unless the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. During the year, the Group recognised a deferred tax liability amounting to $669 million in respect of the investment in APLNG, representing equity accounted earnings that are expected to be distributed to Origin via dividends from APLNG in the foreseeable of future. In determining the forecast distributions from APLNG, the Group's assessment of future cash flows considers a range of macroeconomic and project assumptions, including oil and LNG prices, AUD/USD exchange rates, discount rates and costs over the asset's life.\n\nAt 30 June 2021, none of the remaining unbooked balance is expected to reverse in the foreseeable future through the payment of future dividends, through sale or through a capital return. The unrecognised portion is disclosed in note E2.\n\n## Income tax expense recognised in other comprehensive income\n\n|                                                        | 2021   | 2021   | 2021   | 2020   | 2020   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| $m                                                     | Gross  | Tax    | Net    | Gross  | Tax    | Net    |\n| Investment valuation changes                           | (8)    | 2      | (6)    | 6      | (3)    | 3      |\n| Actuarial gain on defined benefit  superannuation plan | 4      | (1)    | 3      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Cash flow hedges:                                      |        |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Reclassified to income statement                       | 130    | (39)   | 91     | 5      | (1)    | 4      |\n| Effective portion of change in fair value              | 509    | (153)  | 356    | (705)  | 212    | (493)  |\n| Translation of foreign operations                      | (623)  | (16)   | (639)  | 125    | -      | 125    |\n| Other comprehensive income for the year                | 12     | (207)  | (195)  | (569)  | 208    | (361)  |\n\n## E2 Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax balances arise when there are temporary differences between accounting carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, other than where:\n\n- \u00b7 the difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 temporary differences relate to investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint arrangements, to the extent the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and\n- \u00b7 temporary differences arise on initial recognition of goodwill.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced if it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.",

The Group classifies its interests in joint arrangements as either joint operations or joint ventures, depending on its rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the arrangements.\n\nAssociates are entities, other than partnerships, for which the Group exercises significant influence, but no control, over the financial and operating policies, and which are not intended for sale in the near future.\n\nOf the Group's interests in joint arrangements and associates, only APLNG and Octopus Energy have a material impact on the Group at 30 June 2021 (refer to Section B).\n\n## Interests in unincorporated joint operations\n\nThe Group's interests in unincorporated joint operations are brought to account on a line-by-line basis in the income statement and statement of financial position. These interests are held on the following assets whose principal activities are oil and/or gas exploration, development and production; power generation; and geothermal power technology:\n\n- \u00b7 Beetaloo Basin\n- \u00b7 Browse Basin\n- \u00b7 Canning Basin\n- \u00b7 Innamincka Deeps Geothermal\n- \u00b7 Cooper-Eromanga Basin\n\nOn 18 December 2020, the Group reached an agreement with Buru Energy to acquire its 50 per cent interest in five exploration permits following the execution of a farm-in arrangement, and a 40 per cent interest in two permits with Buru Energy and Rey Resources that was effective from 15 April 2021.

In some circumstances, the Group may incur more than its proportionate share of such liabilities, but will have the right to recover the excess liability from the other joint arrangement participants.\n\nThe Group continues to provide parent company guarantees in excess of its 37.5 per cent shareholding in APLNG, in respect of certain historical domestic contracts.\n\nIn October 2018, Origin and the other APLNG shareholders agreed to indemnify one of APLNG's long-term LNG customers (following that customer's election to defer delivery of 30 cargoes over six years (2019-24)) should APLNG fail to supply make-up cargoes to that customer prior to the expiry of the LNG supply contract. The customer will pay APLNG for the deferred cargoes and APLNG expects to resell the gas to other customers, and deliver the deferred cargoes to the long-term LNG customer between 2025 and the end of the LNG supply contract. The indemnity was provided severally in accordance with each shareholder's proportionate shareholding in APLNG. At the inception of the agreement, any obligation or liability on the part of the shareholders will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of future events, and cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.\n\nThe Group has entered into a further agreement to provide a financial guarantee to Octopus Energy's financiers in respect of a working capital facility entered into by Octopus Energy. Under this agreement, the Group is required to make a payment to Octopus Energy's financiers should Octopus Energy not make payments under the working capital facility. In return, Octopus Energy is required to pay a monthly fee to the Group in respect of the guarantee facility. The guarantee has been accounted for as a Financial Guarantee Contract under AASB 9 Financial Instruments and has been initially recognised at fair value (refer to note C7) with reference to the guarantee amount in the facility agreement.\n\n## Legal and regulatory\n\nCertain entities within the Group (and joint venture entities, such as APLNG) are subject to various lawsuits and claims as well as audits and reviews by government, regulatory bodies or other joint venture partners. In most instances, it is not possible to reasonably predict the outcome of these matters or their impact on the Group. Where outcomes can be reasonably predicted, provisions are recorded.\n\nA number of sites owned/operated (or previously owned/operated) by the Group have been identified as potentially contaminated. For sites where it is likely that a present obligation exists, and it is probable that an outflow of resource will be required to settle the obligation, such costs have been expensed or provided for.\n\nWarranties and indemnities have also been given and/or received by entities in the Group in relation to environmental liabilities for certain properties divested and/or acquired.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nAs part of the acquisition of Browse Basin exploration permits in 2015, the Group agreed to pay cash consideration of US$75 million contingent upon a project Final Investment Decision (FID), and US$75 million contingent upon first production. The Group will pay further contingent consideration of up to US$50 million upon first production if 2P reserves, at the time of the FID, reach certain thresholds. These obligations have not been provided for at the reporting date as they are dependent upon uncertain future events not wholly within the Group's control.\n\n## Bank guarantees\n\nThere are no contingent liabilities arising from bank guarantees held by the Group that are required to be disclosed as at the reporting date, as these have either been provided for in the accounts or an outflow of economic benefits is considered remote.\n\nThe Group's share of guarantees for certain contractual commitments of its joint ventures is shown at note G2.\n\n## G2 Commitments\n\nDetailed below are the Group's contractual commitments that are not recognised as liabilities as there is no present obligation.\n\n|                                 |   2021 $m |   2020 $m |\n|---------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Capital expenditure commitments |       107 |       109 |\n| Joint venture commitments 1     |       208 |       340 |\n\n- 1 Includes $135 million (2020: $269 million) in relation to the Group's share of APLNG's capital and joint venture commitments.",

Participation in the plan is at the Board's discretion and no individual has a contractual right to participate or to receive any guaranteed benefits. Equity incentives granted prior to FY2018 were offered in the form of Options and/or Share Rights. From FY2019 onwards, equity incentives are granted in the form of Share Rights and/or Restricted Shares (RSs). Only RSs carry dividend and voting entitlements. To the extent that Share Rights ultimately vest, a dividend equivalent mechanism operates.\n\n## (i) Short Term Incentive\n\nShort Term Incentive (STI) includes the award of RSs, which are subject to trading restrictions for a set period of time (generally up to two years), after which they become unrestricted, provided that the employee remains employed with satisfactory performance. Once unrestricted, the shares are transferred into the employee's name at no cost. The face value of RSs measured at grant date is recognised as an employee expense over the related service period. RSs are forfeited if the service and performance conditions are not met. 1\n\n## (ii) Long Term Incentive\n\nThe Long Term Incentive (LTI) awards include the award of Share Rights, which vest subject to performance conditions. Generally half of each LTI award is made in the form of Performance Share Rights (PSRs) and is subject to a market hurdle, namely Origin's Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to a Reference Group of ASX-listed companies, as identified in the 2021 Remuneration Report. The remaining half of each LTI award is made in the form of Restricted Share Rights (RSRs), where vesting is subject to Board assessment with reference to, 'underpinning conditions', as set out in the 2021 Remuneration Report.\n\nThe number of awards that may vest are considered separately for PSRs and RSRs. For the PSR awards, which are subject to the relative TSR hurdle, vesting only occurs if Origin's TSR over the performance period ranks higher than the 50th percentile of the Reference Group. Half of the PSRs vest if that condition is satisfied. All the PSRs vest if Origin ranks at or above the 75th percentile of the Reference Group. Straight-line pro-rata vesting applies in between these two points. The PSR grants made in FY2021 have a performance period of three years. Vesting is into RSs with a trading restriction for a further two years (total deferral five years). For the RSR awards, the Board will determine the vesting outcome shortly before each of three progressive vesting dates at years three, four and five by reference to a broad range of performance indicators. Vesting is into RSs which all have trading restrictions until the end of the fifth year.\n\nPrior to FY2021, the LTI awards include the award of PSRs, such that half of the award is subject to the TSR hurdle, and the remaining half of each LTI award is subject to an internal hurdle, namely Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), as set out in the relevant remuneration report.\n\nFor awards granted in FY2017 and FY2018 that are subject to a ROCE hurdle, which are subject to testing or vesting in FY2021, vesting only occurs if two conditions are satisfied:\n\n- \u00b7 the average of the actual annual ROCE outcomes over the performance period meets or exceeds the average of the annual targets set in advance by the Board (Gate 1); and\n- \u00b7 the actual ROCE in either of the last two years of the performance period meets or exceeds Origin's pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) (Gate 2).\n\nHalf of the relevant PSRs will vest if Gate 1 is met and Origin's pre-tax WACC is met under Gate 2. All the PSRs will vest if Gate 1 is met and Origin's pre-tax WACC is exceeded by two percentage points or more under Gate 2. Straight-line pro-rata vesting applies in between.\n\nFor awards granted in FY2019 and FY2020 that are subject to the ROCE hurdle, half of the ROCE tranche is allocated to Energy Markets and the other half to Integrated Gas. Each tranche will be tested separately and vest separately. Vesting for each tranche only occurs if the average actual annual ROCE outcomes over the performance period for the relevant business meets or exceeds the average of the annual ROCE targets, which are reflective of delivering WACC for the relevant business. Half of the relevant PSRs will vest if the ROCE target is met. All the relevant PSRs will vest if the ROCE target is exceeded by two percentage points or more. Straight-line pro-rata vesting applies in between.\n\nVested share rights are automatically exercised upon vesting, and there is no exercise price. Upon exercise, a vested award is converted into one fully paid ordinary share that is subject to a post-vesting holding lock for a set period (generally up to two years) and carries voting and dividend entitlements.\n\nIn relation to SRs awarded since FY2021, upon vest, a dividend equivalent amount will be delivered in the form of additional shares equal in value (as determined by the Board) to the amount of dividends that would have been paid and re-invested had the participant held the underlying shares during the period from the grant date through to the relevant vesting date.",

In exceptional circumstances 1 , unvested Share Rights may be held 'on foot' subject to the specified performance hurdles and other plan conditions being met, or dealt with in an appropriate manner determined by the Board.\n\nFor PSRs subject to the relative TSR condition, fair value is measured at grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model that takes into account the exercise price, share price at grant date, price volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate for the term of the security, and the likelihood of meeting the TSR market condition.\n\nThe expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility over a period similar to the life of the options is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards that vest except where due to non-achievement of the TSR market condition. Set out below are the inputs used to determine the fair value of the PSRs granted during the year.\n\nFor RSRs subject to the underpinning conditions, the initial fair value at grant date is the market value of an Origin share, and the recognised expense is trued up at each reporting period to the expected outcome as assessed at that time.\n\nSet out below is a summary of RSRs and PSRs issued during the financial year.\n\n|                                   | RSRs        | PSRs        |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Grant date                        | 03 Nov 2020 | 03 Nov 2020 |\n| Grant date share price            | $4.28       | $4.28       |\n| Exercise price                    | Nil         | Nil         |\n| Volatility                        | -           | 35%         |\n| Risk-free rate 1                  | -           | 0.10%       |\n| Grant date fair value (per award) | $4.28       | $1.37       |\n\n## Equity Incentive Plan awards outstanding\n\nSet out below is a summary of awards outstanding at the beginning and end of the financial year.\n\n|                             | Options   | Weighted average exercise price   | PSRs      | RSRs      | DSRs      | RSs       |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Outstanding at 1 July 2020  | 3,259,381 | $6.33                             | 6,243,467 | -         | 213,038   | 4,523,573 |\n| Granted                     | -         | -                                 | 1,044,581 | 1,056,609 | -         | 4,216,362 |\n| Exercised/released          | -         | -                                 | 563,432   | -         | 167,482   | 1,758,548 |\n| Forfeited                   | 154,160   | -                                 | 1,054,312 | 61,440    | -         | 286,232   |\n| Outstanding at 30 June 2021 | 3,105,221 | $6.32                             | 5,670,304 | 995,169   | 45,556    | 6,695,155 |\n| Exercisable at 30 June 2021 | -         | -                                 | -         | -         | -         | -         |\n| Outstanding at 1 July 2019  | 5,565,803 | $6.51                             | 5,126,670 | -         | 1,920,849 | 1,867,476 |\n| Granted                     | -         | -                                 | 2,346,098 | -         | -         | 3,005,423 |\n| Exercised                   | -         | -                                 | -         | -         | 1,705,133 | 256,173   |\n| Forfeited                   | 2,306,422 | -                                 | 1,229,301 | -         | 2,678     | 93,153    |\n| Outstanding at 30 June 2020 | 3,259,381 | $6.33                             | 6,243,467 | -         | 213,038   | 4,523,573 |\n| Exercisable at 30 June 2020 | -         | -                                 | -         | -         | -         | -         |\n\nThe weighted average share price during 2021 was $4.75 (2020: $6.80).

The shares under this plan are allotted quarterly and are subject to a trading restriction for a set period (generally two years) or until cessation of employment. The Company matches the purchased shares on a one-for-two basis with allocation of additional MRs which vest at the same time as the restriction is lifted for the purchased shares. Vesting of MRs is conditional on the employee remaining in continuous employment at that time. MRs are forfeited if the service conditions are not met. 1\n\nDetails of the shares awarded under the GESP during the year are set out below.

This is a one-off occurrence due to transactional activities that took place in the prior year. As part of the acquisition of Octopus Energy and the associated retail transformation process, an external consulting firm was engaged by the Group to undertake advisory services in respect of this acquisition. In June 2020, midway through the project, the firm engaged by the Group was acquired by EY. As the Group decided it was in the best interest for the project to continue, the audit committee agreed to a one-off approval allowing for continuation of the work, provided the time period and fees were limited. This project completed in the current year and therefore these costs will not reoccur going forward.",

In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a net amount payable by one party to the other.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position, where the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The Group has also entered into arrangements that do not meet the criteria for offsetting, but still allow for the related amounts to be offset in certain circumstances, such as a loan default or the termination of a contract.\n\nThe following table presents the recognised financial instruments that are offset, or subject to master netting arrangements but not offset, as at the reporting date. The net amount column shows the impact on the Group's statement of financial position if all set-off rights were exercised.\n\n|                        | Gross amount $m   | Amount offset in  the statement of  financial  position $m   | Amount in the statement  of financial  position $m   | Related amount not offset $m   | Net amount $m   |\n|------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|\n| 2021                   |                   |                                                              |                                                      |                                |                 |\n| Derivative assets      | 1,488             | (353)                                                        | 1,135                                                | (867)                          | 268             |\n| Derivative liabilities | (1,600)           | 353                                                          | (1,247)                                              | 867                            | (380)           |\n| 2020                   |                   |                                                              |                                                      |                                |                 |\n| Derivative assets      | 1,543             | (385)                                                        | 1,158                                                | (650)                          | 508             |\n| Derivative liabilities | (1,600)           | 385                                                          | (1,215)                                              | 650                            | (565)           |\n\n## G9 Deed of Cross Guarantee\n\nThe parent entity has entered into a Deed of Cross Guarantee through which the Group guarantees the debts of certain controlled entities in the event that one of those entities is wound up.

Giving a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2021 and of its consolidated financial performance for the year ended on that date; and\n- b. Complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001 .\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor ' s responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board ' s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor ' s responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial report.",

The Group assesses the recoverable amount of each CGU using a discounted cash flow forecast to determine value in use.\n\nAs disclosed in Note C8 to the financial statements, as a result of changing market conditions and reduced pricing forecasts, the Group has recognised a $1,828 million impairment charge on its Retail and Generation CGUs, which form part of the Energy Markets group of CGUs.\n\nAssumptions used in the forecast cash flows are highly judgmental and inherently subjective. As disclosed in Note C8, small changes in key assumptions can lead to significant changes in the recoverable amount of these assets.\n\nAs a result, we considered the impairment testing of the Energy Markets group of CGUs and the related disclosures in the financial report to be particularly significant to our audit.\n\nOur audit procedures included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Assessed whether the methodology used by the Group met the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n- \u00b7 A ssessed the basis for the determination of the Group's CGUs based on our understanding of the nature of the Group's business, the interdependence of cash flows, and the economic environment in which it operates.\n- \u00b7 Tested the mathematical accuracy of the discounted cash flow models.\n- \u00b7 Assessed the cash flow forecasts with reference to historical budgeting accuracy and current trading performance, historical growth rates, historical operating results, market data and forecasts, ratio analysis, and discussions with Origin management and senior executives.\n- \u00b7 Where long term supply or sales contracts are in place, agreed the forecast revenue and costs to the contract terms and rates.\n- \u00b7 For Generation, compared the useful lives of assets to AEMO closure dates.\n- \u00b7 Involved our energy market modelling specialists to assess the conclusions reached by the Group's internal specialists in respect of forecast energy prices, forecast generation volumes, cap revenue and marginal loss factors.\n- \u00b7 Involved our valuation specialists to:\n- o Assess the discount rates, growth rates and terminal growth rates with reference to publicly available information on comparable companies in the industry and markets in which the Group operates; and\n- o Perform sensitivity analyses and evaluated whether any reasonably possible changes in assumptions could cause the carrying amount of the cash generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount.\n- \u00b7 Evaluated the adequacy of the related disclosure in the financial report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group estimated the recoverable amount of this investment, using a fair value less cost of disposal (FVLCD) approach and concluded that no impairment or impairment reversal was required.\n\nAs disclosed in Note B2.2, the estimate of FVLCD involves significant judgment and is based on modelling a range of forecast assumptions and estimates which are inherently difficult to determine with precision. Such forecasts include future oil and gas prices, foreign exchange rates, discount rates, production and development costs, and reserves and resources.\n\nOil price is a significant assumption used in the impairment testing and is inherently subjective. In times of economic uncertainty, as the COVID-19 pandemic has brought, the degree of subjectivity in determining forecast pricing is higher than it might otherwise be.  Changes in this assumption can lead to significant changes in the recoverable amount.\n\nDue to the significance of this investment relative to total assets and the inherent complexity and level of judgment required in forecasting future cash flows, we considered this to be a key audit matter\n\nIn completing our audit procedures, with the assistance of our valuation specialists, we:\n\n- \u00b7 Considered whether indicators of impairment (or reversal) were present in respect of the equity accounted investment.\n- \u00b7 Evaluated whether the methodology applied in determining FVLCD complied with the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n- \u00b7 Assessed the mathematical accuracy of the valuation model, the recoverable amount calculation and the headroom implied in the model.\n- \u00b7 Assessed the macroeconomic assumptions adopted, including oil price, gas price and foreign exchange, with reference to broker and analyst data and publicly available peer company information.\n- \u00b7 Evaluated the discount rate adopted with reference to external market data including government bond rates and comparable company data.\n- \u00b7 Agreed the production profile, operating cost and capital expenditure forecasts in the impairment model to the optimised Upstream Development Plan ('UDP'), prepared by the Group, in its capacity as the operator o f APLNG's upstream joint venture.\n- \u00b7 Considered the key assumptions in the UDP including:\n- o Comparison of forecast operating costs to APLNG's recent operating cost history;\n- o Consideration of timing and amount of forecast capital costs with reference to:\n- \u25aa APLNG's gas production profile, its existing inventory of producing wells and forecast development of production wells; and\n- \u25aa UDPs from previous financial years;\n- o Understood APL NG's process for gas reserve and resource measurement including its internal technical assurance processes and reconciliation to its most recent independent review of reserves and resources as at 30 June 2021; and\n- o Evaluated the competence, capabilities and objectivity of the internal and external experts used by the Group to measure its gas reserves and resources.\n- \u00b7 Considered available market information including trading and reserve multiples as a cross check of the carrying value of Origin' s equity accounted investment.",

The future cash flow modelling performed for the Carrying Value of APLNG Equity Accounted Investment assessment (as outlined above) forms the basis of this assessment.\n\nAs a result of the level of judgment required and the value of the DTL recognised, we considered this a key audit matter.\n\n## Unbilled Revenue\n\n## Why significant\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nAt 30 June 2021, the Group recognised unbilled revenue net of allowance for impairment of $1,444 million as disclosed in Note C1.\n\nUnbilled revenue represents the value of energy supplied to customers between the date of the last meter read and the reporting date where no bill has been issued to the customer at the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe estimation of unbilled revenue is considered a key audit matter due to the complex estimation process and significant audit effort required to address the estimation uncertainty. Key factors that require consideration impacting the complex estimation process include:\n\nOur audit procedures included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Assessed whether the methodology used to recognise unbilled revenue met the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n- \u00b7 Assessed the effectiveness of the Group's controls governing energy purchased, energy sold and the customer pricing process.\n- \u00b7 Tested the unbilled revenue calculation by :\n- o With the assistance of specialists, assessing the calculation methodology and calculation mechanics.\n- o Comparing inputs used in the calculation to supporting data such as historical temperature data and volume data provided by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).\n- o Compared the prices applied to customer consumption with historical and current data.\n\nOur audit procedures included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluated whether the methodology applied in determining the value of the DTL recognised, complied with the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n- \u00b7 Recalculated the total taxable temporary difference with reference to the carrying value of the investment in APLNG at 30 June 2021 and the tax cost base.\n- \u00b7 Assessed the forecast future dividends and forecast future profits from APLNG, using the cash flow modelling prepared and referred to above as part of the Carrying Value of APLNG Equity Accounted Investment assessment.\n- \u00b7 Tested the clerical accuracy of the $669 million DTL recognised based on the forecast dividends from APLNG and timing of when those dividends will be paid out of existing equity accounted earnings.\n- \u00b7 Assessed the timeframe the Group has applied when forecasting the expected dividends, including assessing the appropriateness of major operating and capex decisions and sales contracts currently in place.\n- \u00b7 Evaluated the adequacy of the related disclosure in the financial report .\n\n<!-- image -->",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u25ba Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u25ba Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group ' s internal control.\n- \u25ba Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.\n- \u25ba Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors ' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group ' s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor ' s report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor ' s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u25ba Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u25ba Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial report.

During FY2021, APLNG also achieved record daily production rates on two occasions. A detailed breakdown of movements in Origin's share of APLNG 2P reserves is as follows:\n- - 211 PJ (6 per cent) upward revision of operated 2P reserves before production reflecting strong field performance, resulting in improved estimated recovery from producing fields and maturation of resources to reserves;\n- - 35 PJ (5 per cent) increase in non-operated 2P reserves before production, primarily due to improved field performance in several areas; and\n- - 263 PJ of production that was stable with FY2020 despite a significant reduction in development activity and costs.\n- \u00b7 2P reserve life of 16 years as at 30 June 2021, based on FY2021 annual production of 701 PJ.\n- \u00b7 2P reserves replacement of 90 per cent in operated fields over the last four years, primarily driven by strong performance in producing fields, along with additional areas shown to be feasible for development through appraisal activities.\n- \u00b7 Developed 2P reserves accounted for 60 per cent of total 2P reserves as at 30 June 2021.\n- \u00b7 Origin's share of 1P (proved) reserves has continued to grow, with an increase of 9 per cent or 249 PJ before production as a result of development drilling. 1P reserves represent 60 per cent of total 3P (proved plus probable plus possible) reserves as at 30 June 2021.\n- \u00b7 APLNG also continues to mature its strong resource base with further exploration and appraisal activities, as well as technology trials and a continued focus on reducing operating and capital costs.\n\n## 1.2 2P reserves (Origin share)\n\n2P reserves decreased by 16 PJ after production to a total of 4,252 PJ, compared to 30 June 2020.\n\n## Origin 2P reserves by area\n\n| APLNG (PJ)                          | 2P 30/06/2020   | Acquisition/ divestment   | New booking/ discovery   |   Revisions/ extensions | Production   | 2P 30/06/2021   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| Operated Assets                     | 3,577           | -                         | -                        |                     211 | (201)        | 3,587           |\n| Spring Gully & Denison Asset        | 624             | -                         | -                        |                       4 | (36)         | 591             |\n| Condabri, Talinga & Orana Asset     | 1,411           | -                         | -                        |                     151 | (99)         | 1,463           |\n| Reedy Creek, Combabula & Peat Asset | 1,542           | -                         | -                        |                      57 | (66)         | 1,533           |\n| Non-Operated Assets                 | 691             | -                         | -                        |                      35 | (61)         | 665             |\n| Total 2P                            | 4,268           | -                         | -                        |                     247 | (263)        | 4,252           |\n\n- \u00b7 Summary of 2P reserves movement - key changes include:\n- - 263 PJ decrease due to production;\n- - 211 PJ positive revision across all operated areas, reflecting;\n- - improved understanding of field behaviour, coupled with strong field performance, which resulted in an increase in estimated recovery from producing fields in Combabula-Reedy Creek, Condabri and Talinga Orana areas; and\n- - the maturation of new areas from resources to reserves including Ramyard South (within Reedy Creek, Combabula and Peat) and the Spring Gully East Flank (within Spring Gully and Denison) following successful appraisal activities; and\n- - 35 PJ increase in non-operated areas, primarily due to improved field performance in several areas.\n- \u00b7 As at 30 June 2021, developed 2P reserves represented 60 per cent of total 2P reserves.\n- \u00b7 As at 30 June 2021, 100 per cent of Origin's share of 2P reserves are unconventional gas located in the Surat and Bowen Basins.",

        "page_content": "## Appendix B: Notes relating to this report\n\n## a. Methodology regarding reserves and resources\n\nThe Reserves Report has been prepared to be consistent with the Petroleum Resources Management System (PRMS) 2018 published by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE). This document may be downloaded from the SPE website: https://www.spe.org/en/industry/ reserves/. Additionally, this Reserves Report has been prepared to be consistent with the ASX reporting guidelines. For all assets, Origin reports reserves and resources consistent with SPE guidelines as follows: proved reserves (1P); proved plus probable reserves (2P); proved plus probable plus possible reserves (3P) and best estimate contingent resource (2C). Reserves must be discovered, recoverable, commercial and remaining.\n\nThe CSG reserves and resources held within APLNG's properties have either been independently prepared by NSAI or prepared by Origin. The reserves and resources estimates contained in this report have been prepared in accordance with the standards, definitions and guidelines contained within the PRMS and generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles as set out in the SPE Reserves Auditing Standards.\n\nOrigin does not intend to report prospective or undiscovered resources as defined by the SPE in any of its areas of interest on an ongoing basis.\n\n## b. Economic test for reserves\n\nThe assessment of reserves requires a commercial test to establish that reserves can be economically recovered. Within the commercial test, operating cost and capital cost estimates are combined with fiscal regimes and product pricing to confirm the economic viability of producing the reserves.\n\nGas reserves are assessed against existing contractual arrangements and local market conditions, as appropriate. In the case of gas reserves where contracts are not in place, a forward price scenario based on monetisation of the reserves through domestic markets has been used, including power generation opportunities, direct sales to LNG and other end users, and utilisation of Origin's wholesale and retail channels to market.\n\nFor CSG reserves that are intended to supply the APLNG CSG to LNG project, the economic test is based on a weighted average price across domestic, spot and LNG contracts, less short run marginal costs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## e. Rounding\n\nInformation on reserves is quoted in this report rounded to the nearest whole number. Some totals in tables in this report may not add due to rounding. Items that round to zero are represented by the number 0, while items that are actually zero are represented with a dash \"-\".\n\n## f. Abbreviations\n\n| bbl     | barrel                            |\n|---------|-----------------------------------|\n| Tscf    | trillion standard cubic feet      |\n| CSG     | coal seam gas                     |\n| kbbls   | kilo barrels = 1,000 barrels      |\n| ktonnes | kilo tonnes = 1,000 tonnes        |\n| mmboe   | million barrels of oil equivalent |\n| PJ      | petajoule = 1 x 10 15  joules     |\n| PJe     | petajoule equivalent              |\n\n## g. Conversion factors for PJe\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCSG\n\n1.038 PJ/Bscf\n\n## h. Reference point\n\nReference points for Origin's petroleum reserves and contingent resources are defined points within Origin's operations where normal exploration and production business ceases, and quantities of the produced product are measured under defined conditions prior to custody transfer. Fuel, flare and vent consumed to the reference points are excluded.\n\n## i. Preparing and aggregating petroleum resources\n\nPetroleum reserves and contingent resources are typically prepared by deterministic methods with support from probabilistic methods. Petroleum reserves and contingent resources are aggregated by arithmetic summation by category and as a result, proved reserves may be a conservative estimate due to the portfolio effects of the arithmetic summation. Proved plus probable plus possible may be an optimistic estimate due to the same aforementioned reasons.\n\n## j. Methodology and internal controls\n\nThe reserves estimates undergo an assurance process to ensure that they are technically reasonable given the available data and have been prepared according to our reserves and resources process, which includes adherence to the PRMS Guidelines. The assurance process includes peer reviews of the technical and commercial assumptions. The annual reserves report is reviewed by management with the appropriate technical expertise, including the Resource Assessment Lead and Integrated Gas General Managers.\n\nfor downstream transport and processing. This price is exposed to changes in the supply/demand balance in the market through oil price-linked LNG contracts.\n\n## c. Reversionary rights\n\nThe CSG interests that APLNG acquired from Tri-Star in 2002 are subject to reversionary rights. If triggered, these rights will require APLNG to transfer back to Tri-Star a 45 per cent interest in those CSG interests for no additional consideration. Origin has assessed the potential impact of these reversionary rights, based on economic tests consistent with the reserves and resources referable to the CSG interests, and based on that assessment does not consider that the existence of these reversionary rights impacts the reserves and resources quoted in this report. Tri-Star has commenced proceedings against APLNG claiming that reversion has occurred. APLNG denies that reversion has occurred and is defending the claim. 1\n\n## d. Information regarding the preparation of this Reserves Report\n\nThe CSG reserves and resources held within APLNG's properties have either been independently prepared by NSAI or by Origin. All assessments are based on technical, commercial and operational data provided by Origin on behalf of APLNG.\n\nThe statements in this Report relating to reserves and resources as at 30 June 2021 for APLNG's interests in non-operated assets are based on information in the NSAI report dated 4 August 2021. The data has been compiled by Mr John Hattner, a fulltime employee of NSAI. Mr Hattner has consented to the statements based on this information, and to the form and context in which these statements appear.\n\nThe statements in this Report relating to reserves and resources for other assets are based on, and fairly represent, information and supporting documentation prepared by, or under the supervision of qualified petroleum reserves and resource evaluators who are employees of Origin.\n\nThis Reserves Statement as a whole has been approved by Mr Alistair Jones CPEng RPEQ, who is a full-time employee of Origin. Mr Jones is Resource Assessment Lead, a qualified petroleum reserves and resources evaluator and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, has consented to the form and context in which these statements appear.",

Statutory financial measures also include measures that have been directly calculated from, or disaggregated directly from financial information included in the Financial Statements for the Origin Consolidated Group.\n\n| Term                                     | Meaning                                                                                                                                                         |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Cash flows from  investing activities    | Statutory cash flows from investing activities as  disclosed in the Statement of Cash Flows in the  Origin Consolidated Financial Statements.                   |\n| Cash flows from  operating activities    | Statutory cash flows from operating activities as  disclosed in the Statement of Cash Flows in the  Origin Consolidated Financial Statements.                   |\n| Cash flows used in  financing activities | Statutory cash flows used in financing activities as  disclosed in the Statement of Cash Flows in the  Origin Consolidated Financial Statements.                |\n| Net Debt                                 | Total current and non-current interest-bearing  liabilities only, less cash and cash equivalents  excluding cash to fund APLNG day-to- day operations.          |\n| Non- controlling interest                | Economic interest in a controlled entity of  the consolidated entity that is not held by  the Parent entity or a controlled entity of the  consolidated entity. |\n| Statutory  Profit/Loss                   | Net profit/loss after tax and non-controlling  interests as disclosed in the Income Statement  in the Origin Consolidated Financial Statements.                 |\n| Statutory earnings  per share            | Statutory Profit/Loss divided by weighted  average number of shares as disclosed in the  Income Statement in the Origin Consolidated  Financial Statements.     |\n\n## Non-IFRS financial measures\n\nNon-IFRS financial measures are defined as financial measures that are presented other than in accordance with all relevant Accounting Standards. Non-IFRS financial measures are used internally by management to assess the performance of Origin's business, and to make decisions on allocation of resources. The Non-IFRS financial measures have been derived from Statutory financial measures included in the Origin Consolidated Financial Statements, and are provided in this report, along with the Statutory financial measures to enable further insight and a different perspective into the financial performance, including profit and loss and cash flow outcomes, of the Origin business.\n\nThe principal Non-IFRS profit and loss measure of Underlying Profit has been reconciled to Statutory Profit in Section 4.1. The key NonIFRS financial measures included in this report are defined below.\n\n| Term                                                        | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| AASB                                                        | Australian Accounting Standards Board                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Adjusted  Net Debt                                          | Net Debt adjusted to remove fair value adjustments  on hedged borrowings                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Adjusted  Underlying  EBITDA                                | Origin Underlying EBITDA - Share of APLNG  Underlying EBITDA + net cash from APLNG over the  relevant 12 month period.                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Average  interest rate                                      | Interest expense divided by Origin's average drawn  debt during the period.                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| cps Free Cash Flow                                          | Cents per share.

A reference to Octopus Energy or Octopus is a reference to Octopus Energy Group Limited in which Origin holds a 20% shareholding. Origin's shareholding in APLNG and Octopus Energy is equity accounted.\n\nA reference to $ is a reference to Australian dollars unless specifically marked otherwise.\n\nAll references to debt are a reference to interest bearing debt only.\n\nIndividual items and totals are rounded to the nearest appropriate number or decimal. Some totals may not add due to rounding of individual components.\n\nWhen calculating a percentage change, a positive or negative percentage change denotes the mathematical movement in the underlying metric, rather than a positive or a detrimental impact. Percentage changes on measures for which the numbers change from negative to positive, or vice versa, are labelled as not applicable.",
