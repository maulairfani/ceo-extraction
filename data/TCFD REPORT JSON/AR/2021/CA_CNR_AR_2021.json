It begins with the pride I feel as the first Atlantic Canadian to chair the Board of this 103-year-old iconic Company. No matter the measurement, it has been a truly remarkable era, one defined by growth, profitability, and unfailing commitment to our core corporate values of sustainability, community and governance. Our geographic reach has grown exponentially, making CN truly North America's railway. From what was our east-west network stretching across the breadth of Canada from Atlantic to Pacific, CN now reaches into the U.S. heartland at Chicago and beyond, extending into the deep south to the Gulf of Mexico. Today, CN's three-coast network spans from Prince Rupert on the Pacific northwest coast of British Columbia, Halifax on the Atlantic, and New Orleans on the Gulf coast.\n\nThe growth of our geographic footprint of the past quarter century has translated into a consistent record of growth in profitability. Since our IPO in 1995, CN's dividend has increased by an average of 16% a year. Moreover, CN's market capitalization is more than 53 times higher than when we issued our IPO, and we are now the third-largest company on the Toronto Stock Exchange based on our market cap. Facing multiple industry-wide challenges in 2021, CN's solid financial performance continued, with our operating income rising 18% and adjusted diluted earnings per share 1 climbing 12%. As a result, the Board recently approved a 19% increase in our annual dividend for 2022, the 26th consecutive increase.\n\nA key dimension of our financial record has been our unstinting corporate commitment to efficiency. We were the leader in implementing Precision Scheduled Railroading, a tight and efficient operating system that has become the model for the industry; and we will be the leader in implementing the next generation of digital railroading.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## /two.smcp/zero.smcp/two.smcp/one.smcp: /a.smcp /y.smcp/e.smcp/a.smcp/r.smcp /o.smcp/f.smcp /r.smcp/e.smcp/s.smcp/i.smcp/l.smcp/i.smcp/e.smcp/n.smcp/c.smcp/y.smcp\n\nI have always believed the true measure of a corporation is how it, and its people, deal with adversity. I take great pride in how we met and overcame the daunting challenges of 2021. It was a year that severely tested both CN and the industry. The scale of the challenges cannot be overstated. There were devastating wildfires and floods in British Columbia, droughts across the Prairies and Hurricane Ida in the United States. At the same time, there were major supply chain challenges in a global economy going through wrenching change. They all came in the midst of the COVID pandemic, while we managed the escalation of economic activity as the public health crisis receded. Undaunted by these and countless other everyday challenges, CN's dedicated railroaders worked tirelessly to keep our customers' goods and the broader economy moving.\n\nMy pride in the CN family, and how every one of them responded to the catastrophic natural disasters of 2021, will stay with me forever. CNers stepped up to help their neighbours any way they could, providing much-needed supplies and access into isolated regions. I am proud to say our teams quickly restored the mainline to service and CN donated more than $1.6 million to assist the recovery of those who were hit the hardest.\n\n## /a.smcp /l.smcp/e.smcp/a.smcp/d.smcp/e.smcp/r.smcp /i.smcp/n.smcp /e.smcp/s.smcp/g.smcp /i.smcp/n.smcp /t.smcp/h.smcp/e.smcp /n.smcp/o.smcp/r.smcp/t.smcp/h.smcp /a.smcp/m.smcp/e.smcp/r.smcp/i.smcp/c.smcp/a.smcp/n.smcp /t.smcp/r.smcp/a.smcp/n.smcp/s.smcp/p.smcp/o.smcp/r.smcp/t.smcp/a.smcp/t.smcp/i.smcp/o.smcp/n.smcp /s.smcp/e.smcp/c.smcp/t.smcp/o.smcp/r.smcp\n\nAt the core of CN's corporate identity is its commitment to environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles. They serve as the framework to shape our decisions and guide our actions. I take pride in knowing that over the last 26 years CN has made significant progress implementing our ESG initiatives to become a leader in the North American transportation sector. In the past year, we have taken steps to reinforce CN's status as a leader in ESG among North American Class I railroads and across the transportation sector.",

        "page_content": "As such, the Board made a commitment that, by the end of 2022, at least half of the independent directors will come from diverse groups, including gender parity. Other new governance policies encompass lowering the retirement age for directors, confirming the tenure limit at 14 years for all directors, and setting a lower maximum number of public boards on which directors can serve. We also created a new Governance, Sustainability and Safety Committee to laser focus the Board on fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to governance, safety and sustainability of the Company's operations. These new governance practices are in keeping with our responsibility to all stakeholders, who rely on us to continue to evolve, modernize and lead over the next 25 years and beyond.\n\nOur focus on sustainability is long-standing. CN is pleased to have been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for 10 straight years. We have also earned a spot for the sixth time on CDP's prestigious 'A List' for our actions to cut emissions, mitigate climate risks and develop the low-carbon economy. In 2021, to underscore our ongoing dedication to sustainability, CN has also announced its commitment to setting an emissions target in line with a 1.5\u00b0C scenario and to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nA crucial priority for CN has been to strengthen our relations with Indigenous communities. In 2021, we took another step in this regard with the creation of a CN Indigenous Advisory Council (IAC), a new independent body co-chaired by Ms. Roberta Louise Jamieson, OC, Kanyen'keh\u00e0:ka and the Hon. Murray Sinclair, C.C., M.S.M., Mizhana Gheezhik. The IAC's mandate is to advise CN's Board and CEO on issues that are relevant to our relationship with the more than 200 Indigenous communities across our network.\n\n## /t.smcp/h.smcp/e.smcp /h.smcp/i.smcp/g.smcp/h.smcp/e.smcp/s.smcp/t.smcp /s.smcp/t.smcp/a.smcp/n.smcp/d.smcp/a.smcp/r.smcp/d.smcp/s.smcp /o.smcp/f.smcp /g.smcp/o.smcp/v.smcp/e.smcp/r.smcp/n.smcp/a.smcp/n.smcp/c.smcp/e.smcp\n\nGovernance is at the heart of corporate success. Because of that, all of us at CN take great pride that The Globe and Mail's Report on Business Magazine in 2021 ranked CN No. 1 in corporate board governance among all 220 companies listed on the S&P/TSX composite index. It is a reflection of CN's commitment since our IPO over 25 years ago to ongoing governance excellence and renewal.\n\n## /c.smcp/n.smcp'/s.smcp /n.smcp/e.smcp/w.smcp /c.smcp/h.smcp/i.smcp/e.smcp/f.smcp /e.smcp/x.smcp/e.smcp/c.smcp/u.smcp/t.smcp/i.smcp/v.smcp/e.smcp\n\nAs I step down from the CN Board, I leave knowing that the future is bright. We are thrilled to have Ms. Tracy Robinson join CN as our new President and CEO and are confident that CN has the right leader to take us to the next phase of sustainable growth. Currently, Tracy is the only female CEO among the top 50 Canadian companies by market cap as listed on the TSX. She brings more than 35 years of operational management, strategy development, and project execution experience to drive\n\ngrowth and profitability at CN. She has a proven track record as a corporate visionary and an extraordinary high-performing leader, including almost three decades as a railroader.\n\nAt the same time, on behalf of the Board and the entire CN family, we would like to thank Mr. JJ Ruest for his dedicated service to CN for over 25 years and as CEO since 2018. We want to wish him all the best in his well-earned retirement.\n\n## /b.smcp/o.smcp/a.smcp/r.smcp/d.smcp /r.smcp/e.smcp/n.smcp/e.smcp/w.smcp/a.smcp/l.smcp\n\nAllow me to say what an honour it has been to have served on the CN Board for more than 25 years. The directors I have worked with during my time with CN have unfailingly impressed me with their dedication to serve the best interests of CN and its stakeholders, and I have personally learned a great deal from their vast experience and knowledge.\n\nThe CN Board is in very good hands going forward. I want to congratulate Shauneen Bruder on her appointment as Vice-Chair and nomination to be next Chair of the Board. She is someone who will work tirelessly to ensure CN has the finest in Board governance and oversight. As well, Shauneen led the CEO Search Committee through a robust process that identified the right leader to drive continued growth, operational improvement, technological advancement, employee engagement, and shareholder value.\n\nI would like to welcome our new Board nominees: Mr. Dave Freeman, Mr. Rob Knight, and Ms. Susan C. Jones, as well as Ms. Jo-ann dePass Olsovsky who joined the Board in late 2021. These new directors bring extensive business, technology, operations, strategic planning and railroad experience to the CN Board.\n\nThe Board wishes to thank our distinguished directors who are not standing for re-election: Mr. Jim O'Connor and Ms. Laura Stein, as well as Ms. Julie Godin who stepped down earlier to focus on her executive role, for their many years of exemplary service to CN. The Board also thanks the Hon. Jean Charest, who recently stepped down from the Board to pursue public office.\n\nFinally, allow me to conclude by thanking all the CNers, Board members, customers, partners and shareholders I have had the pleasure to meet over the past quarter century. Each of you has been integral to CN's remarkable success. I leave with confidence in the future of CN, knowing our strategy will continue to unfold as we progress down the path of constant improvement, innovation and growth that has made CN a leader among North American railroads.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRobert Pace , /d.smcp./c.smcp/o.smcp/m.smcp/m.smcp., /c.smcp./m.smcp.\n\nChair of the Board",

The impact of the pandemic, the effects of climate change, and the uncertainty of global security have challenged our sense of safety and order and impacted the reliability of our supply chains.\n\nAs an important enabler of domestic freight movement and global trade links, it has never been more important for CN to deliver. We are uniquely positioned to power sustainable growth. We have North America's best network, spanning Canada from the Atlantic to the Pacific and through the American heartland to the Gulf of Mexico.

I am proud of the perseverance and resilience of our team, who power our performance and growth, and who increasingly represent the diversity of the communities we serve. We are welcoming the next generation of railroaders to our Company. They are helping us in our efforts to innovate, to continuously improve the safety of our employees and communities, to lighten our environmental footprint, to further engage with our Indigenous and community partners, and to develop the capabilities of our team.

Our objectives are clear: to grow faster than the markets we participate in and continuously improve our operating efficiency, all while maintaining our long-term commitment to safety, customer service and sustainable value creation, including decarbonization of the economy.\n\nCN aims to lead the industry toward a more customer-centric model of railroading, just as we pioneered Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR)\n\nwhen the industry needed to become more efficient.

It rests on a strong, sustainable foundation of moving our customers' goods safely, having the most talented and engaged people, being environmentally responsible, helping build stronger communities, all while adhering to the highest standards of governance. We call this Delivering Responsibly . Upon this solid strategic foundation rest four pillars: operational excellence every day, strong customer partnerships, growing our reach, and industry-leading innovation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

CN now has 10 fully autonomous railcars that are inspecting 100% of our mainline and 45% of the entire network on a consistent basis. Since the program launched in 2020, ATIP cars have inspected over 1.5 million miles of track. In 2021, some of our key corridors received up to 20 times more inspections than with previous methodologies.\n\n## Automated inspection portals\n\nAI technology is also changing how we inspect our railcar fleet. Ultra-high-definition cameras in our seven automated inspection portals capture a 360\u00b0 view of a train as it travels through at normal track speed. This method of railcar inspection, using machine-learning algorithms, improves inspection quality, frequency and railcar reliability. Once completed, the algorithms will locate defects with zero human interaction and produce automatically generated work orders for car repair. Through use of the inspection portals in 2021, many critical defects, which could have resulted in significant operational disruption or personal injury, were identified.\n\n## Handheld devices and process automation\n\nCN is also digitizing processes aimed at improving productivity, reducing costs and more accurately capturing revenues. To date, we have deployed over 10,000 handheld devices to train crews and 850 more to car and locomotive mechanics. In 2021, we continued to focus on digitizing reports and documentation for crews, customers, and mechanical work and ended the year with more than 90 process automations to eliminate repetitive tasks across all lines of business. In addition to increased efficiencies, these digitized processes enhanced safety by allowing us to deploy applications early in the pandemic, communicate information virtually, and keep frontline workers out of shared spaces. On the environmental front, digitizing and automating processes is saving over one million pages of paper each month.\n\n## Smart Network\n\nCN is using an integrated digital scenario analysis and simulation tool to improve insight and enhance capacity planning relative to changing demand. Smart Network simulates train movements on the network to gain insight on capacity, cost and operational fluidity. The tool can also stress-test scenarios to identify options to handle forecast volumes, including identification of specific pinch points on a timelier basis. The result is improved speed and accuracy of demand analysis for long-lead-time assets like locomotives, infrastructure and crews.\n\n## Smart Terminal\n\nWe are also investing in the intermodal supply chain of the future by using advanced technologies to improve decision-making, capacity, productivity and service levels, including new container slot locations, storage methods and traffic flows. We are using telematic sensors on cranes and shunt trucks to better locate containers within the yard. Smart screens and maps help visualize the inventory and equipment movements to reduce the number of lifts per container. Finally, a new mobile app for truck drivers provides seamless end-to-end visit details via a simple, intuitive experience. The result is speed - faster turnaround times for truck drivers to receive their container, more efficient operations, and increased terminal capacity and fluidity. Our first smart terminal is Brampton, the largest intermodal terminal on CN's system.",

By leveraging rail for the long haul, CN can help our customers reduce their overall transportation supply chain GHG emissions. As a result, CN is making a positive contribution in the urgent fight against climate change and playing a key role in the transition to a lower-carbon economy.\n\nCN was the first North American railway, and among the first 100 companies globally, to announce an approved science-based target. Our new 2030 science-based targets reflect a well-below 2\u00b0C scenario and were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in April 2021. CN also recently signed the 'Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C' and joined the 'Race to Zero' campaign, committing to setting targets in line with a 1.5\u00b0C scenario and achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nCN recognizes the importance of collaborating with customers, supply chain partners, suppliers, researchers, clean tech innovators and governments to accelerate the fight against climate change. Through the Railway Association of Canada, we have been actively working with our industry peers and the Government of Canada since 1995 to address the impacts of rail activities on the environment. In 2021, we announced important partnerships with our suppliers regarding renewable fuels testing and the purchase of a battery-electric locomotive for joint pilot projects.\n\nWe are reducing our non-rail carbon footprint by upgrading our ground fleet, as well as retrofitting yards and buildings. Our EcoConnexions Employee Engagement program focuses on embedding environmental sustainability into our corporate culture through targeted initiatives to reduce energy consumption, minimize waste and improve housekeeping practices at our yards and offices. Since 2011, we have reduced energy consumption by 30% and avoided 171,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions at key yards and facilities, diverted 200,000 tonnes of operational waste from municipal landfills, and completed over 1,500 projects to improve housekeeping and create cleaner, more efficient and safer workplaces.\n\nAnother example is our EcoConnexions Partnership Program , which has planted hundreds of thousands of trees to recognize our customers and supply chain partners for their sustainability efforts.\n\n## /a.smcp/w.smcp/a.smcp /r.smcp /d.smcp\n\nIn 2021, for the sixth time, CN was recognized for climate leadership by global environmental non-profit CDP, securing a place on its prestigious 'A List' for our actions to cut emissions, mitigate climate risks and develop the low-carbon economy.

We will lead the way with a multi-faceted, modern approach that uses a cloud- and platform-based IT architecture. For example, our Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offer robust supply chain visibility tools that demonstrate our commitment to managing customer supply chains through system integration and innovative data.\n\nA rail industry first, CN's API development platform offers customers data that was not previously available, such as GPS location of our customers' railcars and containers. CN APIs also provide key data such as Bill of Lading (BOL) information and shipment status to make it easy to query data from a wide variety of customer inputs, including equipment, BOL, vehicle ID number, reservation number, and more.\n\nFor example, Conuma, a leading Canadian producer and exporter of premium steelmaking coal, employs CN to deliver their product to Asian customers via the Port of Prince Rupert. Our tailor-made GPS API provides Conuma with very granular views of the location, speed and direction of movement of CN unit trains - with data that is refreshed every five minutes. Conuma's employees can see exactly where their\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrailcars are via a digital screen at the loading area, which helps Conuma with their mine production schedules and workforce planning - two key metrics that help them drive efficiency and improve their bottom line.\n\nCN APIs are also helping our customers automate routine manual tasks. Our customers no longer have to spend time pulling data into spreadsheets, enabling their teams to focus on higher-value work. One such customer is MSC. CN and MSC worked together to identify processes that could be digitized to help drive faster terminal operations. For example, CN quickly developed an API that allows short-haul drivers to identify their container directly from their own company's system.\n\n## /s.smcp/i.smcp/m.smcp/p.smcp/l.smcp/i.smcp/f.smcp/i.smcp/c.smcp/a.smcp/t.smcp/i.smcp/o.smcp/n.smcp /t.smcp/h.smcp/r.smcp/o.smcp/u.smcp/g.smcp/h.smcp /i.smcp/n.smcp/f.smcp/o.smcp/r.smcp/m.smcp/a.smcp/t.smcp/i.smcp/o.smcp/n.smcp\n\nCN is building a digital ecosystem that is signaling a new era of innovation, business transparency and seamless integration to help our customers succeed in their local and global markets.

Supply chain collaboration agreements with ports, terminal operators and customers help to drive down costs, improve visibility of the entire move with common metrics, and seamlessly integrate our services into their operations. All parties continually share information to understand and optimize supply chain performance, including scheduling railcar and container supply, planning loading and unloading, as well as managing the pipeline to avoid pinch points. Additionally, we are adjusting our service performance metrics to better reflect our customers' changing requirements. We are also taking an industry-leading focus on measuring customer satisfaction to consistently align to customer needs and maintain our everyday operational excellence.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA fine example of CN's supply chain mindset is our close relationship with Pembina, a leading Canadian transportation and midstream oil and gas service provider. As an integral part of Pembina's global supply chain, CN worked with them to develop the Port of Prince Rupert (Watson Island) as a 25,000-barrel-per-day export terminal for propane. Opened in April 2021, the new terminal provides Pembina with the option to access export markets in addition to domestic markets. Our investments in long-train operations - doubling the length of sidings to 12,000 feet, acquiring new high-horsepower locomotives and expanding the use of distributed power - enable a balanced flow of loads and empties in unit trains to/ from Pembina's Redwater fractionation facility north of Edmonton.\n\nAnother example: in 2021, CN introduced our Domestic Guaranteed Equipment Program, whereby customers can reserve intermodal equipment (including 53' intermodal containers - dry, heater or reefer) for guaranteed next-day service and same-day service, when available. The program enables customers with urgent shipping needs to secure service in high-demand markets.\n\n## /s.smcp/a.smcp/f.smcp/e.smcp/t.smcp /y.smcp /i.smcp/s.smcp /i.smcp/m.smcp/p.smcp/o.smcp/r.smcp/t.smcp/a.smcp/n.smcp/t.smcp /f.smcp/o.smcp/r.smcp /o.smcp/u.smcp/r.smcp /c.smcp/u.smcp/s.smcp/t.smcp/o.smcp/m.smcp/e.smcp/r.smcp/s.smcp, /t.smcp/o.smcp/o.smcp\n\nWith a hands-on approach, CN shares practical knowledge at the ground level with our customers, helping them manage their rail operations more efficiently and safely. Our safety experts work directly with our customers to train their personnel in safe railroading practices and audit the safety of their operations on site to eliminate derailment and injury hazards.

They power our success by caring passionately about railroading and bringing a high level of commitment and resilience to their daily tasks, even in challenging times. CN continues to attract, train and motivate top talent, with a renewed focus on a diverse, inclusive and winning culture. We also develop our employees with the necessary skills for an increasingly automated and data-driven work environment.\n\nAt CN, we are committed to developing the workplace of the future by being an employer of choice, ensuring our workforce reflects the diversity of the communities where we operate, and empowering all employees to embrace their full potential. CN welcomes and celebrates diversity in all its forms and fosters a culture of belonging where everyone feels included and valued without discrimination across race, gender, religion and identity.\n\nWe are nurturing a culture where difference is valued by taking concrete action to increase outreach to employees through Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) where employees with common identities, backgrounds and/or interests can gather to share ideas. Our employee-run, executive-sponsored ERGs create a culture of inclusion by providing open forums and safe spaces for employees to meet, advise on opportunities, reach out to communities, and be their authentic selves. Our ERGs embrace the diversity and individuality of CN employees and provide opportunities to propel innovation by bringing together different perspectives, experiences and ideas from CN employees at all levels.\n\nCN's Talent Acquisition team embeds our policies of inclusion and diversity into its recruitment practices. Through focus areas like targeted recruitment campaigns, strategic partnerships with diversity-focused agencies, and participation in key events, CN continues to present an increasingly representative and diverse pool of candidates to hiring managers.\n\nThe Company has set a target to attain, by 2022, and thereafter maintain, an executive management team comprised of at least 30% women. This target aligns with our pledge to accelerate the advancement of women in business, as set out in the Catalyst Accord 2022.\n\n## /a.smcp/w.smcp/a.smcp /r.smcp /d.smcp /s.smcp\n\nFor 2022, CN is proud to once again be named one of Canada's Top 100 Employers and a Top Montreal Employer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

With our tri-coastal network that spans North America, CN reaches farther, both physically and commercially, for our existing customers and to find new ones, by playing a lead role in connecting North America to the world. Having the capacity to move large volumes of goods is the result of the can-do attitude of our people supported by the investment of over $13 billion in capital between 2018 and 2021, which also kept our network well maintained, safe and robust.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In Eastern Canada, we aim to further densify our network by developing port and inland terminals to promote gateway growth and provide customers with a cost-advantageous intermodal route to Toronto and the American Midwest (e.g., Milton Logistics Hub). In the U.S., we intend to boost our competitive presence and capabilities in the Gulf region by partnering with non-rail technology companies specializing in hub-to-hub freight transport.\n\n## /b.smcp/u.smcp/i.smcp/l.smcp/d.smcp/i.smcp/n.smcp/g.smcp /r.smcp/e.smcp/l.smcp/i.smcp/a.smcp/b.smcp/l.smcp/e.smcp /s.smcp/u.smcp/p.smcp/p.smcp/l.smcp/y.smcp /c.smcp/h.smcp/a.smcp/i.smcp/n.smcp/s.smcp\n\nAfter several years of record capital investments to build the infrastructure and acquire the equipment needed to improve the safety and fluidity of our network to meet the growing demands of the North American economy, our investments have returned to a more traditional level. In 2021, we invested $2.9 billion (20% of revenues) to ensure the safety of the network, expand yards, lengthen sidings and twin sections of track, especially in our busy Edmonton/Winnipeg/Chicago, Edmonton/Vancouver and Edmonton/Prince Rupert corridors. We are also renewing our locomotive and railcar fleet and deploying advanced technologies to enhance safety, drive down costs and improve productivity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## /i.smcp/n.smcp/l.smcp/a.smcp/n.smcp/d.smcp /t.smcp/e.smcp/r.smcp/m.smcp/i.smcp/n.smcp/a.smcp/l.smcp /e.smcp/x.smcp/p.smcp/a.smcp/n.smcp/s.smcp/i.smcp/o.smcp/n.smcp/s.smcp\n\nIn 2021, we opened a new distribution terminal in New Richmond, WI. The multipurpose facility includes an automotive compound for finished vehicles and an intermodal terminal to serve the growing needs of our customers in Minneapolis-Saint Paul, MN, and the Upper Midwest.\n\nWe are also breaking ground on our new logistics hub in Milton, ON, which recently received all required federal regulatory approvals. CN continues to work diligently with regulators to ensure the project meets all conditions of approval. The facility will benefit our customers and the regional economy by providing much-needed inland terminal capacity, thereby improving Central Canada's access to key transborder markets and the coastal gateways we serve. The facility will also benefit the environment by converting truck traffic to more carbon-efficient rail. Construction began in January 2022 and the hub is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n## /m.smcp/a.smcp/s.smcp/s.smcp/i.smcp/v.smcp/e.smcp /i.smcp/n.smcp/v.smcp/e.smcp/s.smcp/t.smcp/m.smcp/e.smcp/n.smcp/t.smcp/s.smcp /i.smcp/n.smcp /t.smcp/h.smcp/e.smcp /c.smcp/a.smcp/n.smcp/a.smcp/d.smcp/i.smcp/a.smcp/n.smcp /g.smcp/r.smcp/a.smcp/i.smcp/n.smcp /s.smcp/u.smcp/p.smcp/p.smcp/l.smcp/y.smcp /c.smcp/h.smcp/a.smcp/i.smcp/n.smcp\n\nInvestments by CN and our customers are achieving synergies across the entire grain supply chain. Grain handling capacity in Western Canada is increasing rapidly to meet positive trends in grain production and demand. Our direct-served customers at the Port of Vancouver, including G3, Fraser, Richardson, Cargill and Fibreco, have significantly increased nameplate grain-handling capacity through the construction or expansion of grain export terminals. Of the 42 new high-throughput elevators on the Prairies, many with loop tracks enabling faster grain loading, 30 have been or are being built on CN lines (29 exclusively). Our investments in long sidings, double track and tunnel ventilation will help serve this increased capacity.",

There are 36 petrochemical manufacturers currently operating in central Alberta, 85% of which are located on CN's rail lines. Methane, ethane, ethylene and propane are some of the petrochemicals produced in Alberta that are used as building blocks for manufacturing. Our capital investments in key natural gas liquids corridors coupled with customer investment in their facilities allow CN to provide a balanced flow of loads and empties for our customers.\n\nThe two new propane export terminals at the Port of Prince Rupert are exclusively served by CN. The successful opening of these export facilities, which are already exceeding targets, provides our customers with the option of serving the domestic or export market.\n\nOther less carbon-intensive products are also being developed in the Alberta Heartland, such as biodiesel and other renewable fuels, glycol, blue methanol and blue ammonia (used in Asia for decarbonization of power generation).\n\n## /f.smcp/l.smcp/o.smcp/o.smcp/d.smcp/i.smcp/n.smcp/g.smcp /i.smcp/n.smcp /b.smcp/r.smcp/i.smcp/t.smcp/i.smcp/s.smcp/h.smcp /c.smcp/o.smcp/l.smcp/u.smcp/m.smcp/b.smcp/i.smcp/a.smcp\n\nDuring the three weeks between November 14 and December 4, 2021, CN's network in southern B.C. was shut down when we experienced 58 washouts over a 150-mile stretch following record rainfall. The railroad mobilized more than 400 employees and contractors as well as over 110 pieces of heavy equipment, operating 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to get the rail line back into service. 282,000 cubic yards of rock and soil were moved to rebuild damaged locations, the equivalent of over 25,000 truckloads. Operating metrics returned to normal only two weeks after the network reopened.\n\nDuring the outage, CN was able to use our exclusive access to the Port of Prince Rupert to move goods. Equipment and staffing levels were increased to keep Canadian natural resources moving to markets and consumer goods from overseas flowing to communities across North America.\n\nCN employees also worked closely with emergency management officials to aid British Columbians impacted by the weather. Working with partners, CN helped evacuate hundreds of stranded residents and brought urgent medical care and equipment to areas cut off by high water. CN also donated $100,000 to the Canadian Red Cross. This is in addition to the $1.5 million CN contributed following the B.C. wildfires last summer.",

In 2021 alone, CN moved over 300 million tonnes of cargo, spent $10.9 billion in local communities, paid $2.9 billion in wages and benefits to our more than 22,000 employees, invested $2.9 billion in capital projects and paid $1.4 billion in taxes.\n\nCN engages openly and proactively with communities to help drive progress and foster mutual respect. For example, under CN's Community Engagement program, we meet with municipal officers and their first responders to assist them in their emergency planning.\n\nAll Aboard for Safety is CN's flagship community education program. Every year, CN employees make hundreds of presentations and talk to thousands of children and adults at schools and community events in Canada and the U.S. about the importance of rail safety and the dangers of walking or playing on or near railway tracks.\n\nThe CN Police Service continues to be active in communities across our network to promote safe behaviour around railway property by conducting enforcement activities and delivering safety presentations. During the industry's annual Rail Safety Week campaign, CN police officers and other employees, in partnership with Operation Lifesaver \u00ae , participate in many safety initiatives to raise awareness about preventing accidents.\n\nWe believe another way to help build more sustainable communities is to actively contribute millions of dollars each year through our CN Stronger Communities Fund to organizations, programs and initiatives that promote the health and safety of young people, transportation research and education, environmental sustainability, and diversity.\n\nWe are proud of our employees, retirees and their families who volunteer to make their communities better places to live, work and play. The CN Railroaders in the Community program recognizes these acts of kindness by providing grants to the community-based not-for-profit organizations our employees choose to support through their volunteer efforts.\n\nThe CN Employees' and Pensioners' Community Fund , which has been in existence for more than 50 years, organizes fundraising activities in support of many Canadian charities. Despite the pandemic, the most recent campaign met with excellent success, raising over $1.5 million. During the past 10 years, the Fund has raised $18.3 million in donations to assist more than 500 charities specializing in health and research, community well-being, child support and humanitarian aid. The Fund directs every dollar donated directly to the designated organizations.\n\n## /a.smcp/w.smcp/a.smcp /r.smcp /d.smcp\n\nCN partners with Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response ( TRANS CAER \u00ae ), through which we help communities in Canada and the U.S. understand the movement of hazardous materials and what is required in the event of an incident.\n\nCN earned the prestigious TRANS CAER National Achievement Award from the American Chemistry Council for the 12th consecutive year.",

How we deliver success is just as important as what we achieve. Therefore, we work diligently to bring integrity and excellence into everything we do. As a Canadian reporting issuer with securities listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), CN ensures its corporate governance practices comply with the highest standards and rules adopted by the Canadian Securities Administrators, applicable provisions of the U.S. Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. CN is exempted from complying with many of the NYSE corporate governance rules, provided it complies with Canadian governance requirements. Except as summarized on our website at www.cn.ca/governance, CN's governance practices comply with the NYSE corporate governance rules in all significant respects.\n\nConsistent with the belief that ethical conduct goes beyond compliance and resides in a comprehensive governance culture, CN publishes and enforces its Corporate Governance Manual, Code of Business Conduct, Anti Corruption Policy, Supplier Code of Conduct and Human Rights Policy. We also maintain several methods for employees and third parties to anonymously report accounting, auditing and other concerns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN is proud of the leadership demonstrated by its Board of Directors with respect to diversity and is a proud signatory to the Catalyst Accord 2022. In 2021, the Board set a new target that at least 50% of the independent directors will come from diverse groups, including gender parity by the end of 2022.\n\nReflecting evolving best practice trends in Canada and the U.S., CN's Board of Directors updated its corporate governance policies in 2021 to:\n\n- \u00b7  Confirm that all directors are subject to a 14-year tenure limit.\n- \u00b7  Lower the retirement age for directors from 75 to 72.\n- \u00b7  Permit directors to serve on a maximum of three public boards, including CN.\n\nIn 2021, CN also created a new Governance, Sustainability and Safety Committee, chaired by Shauneen Bruder, to assist the Board in overseeing policies and practices relating to ESG matters.\n\nCN is in daily contact with Indigenous communities across our network, identifying and fostering business opportunities, increasing employee awareness, and promoting employment opportunities within these communities. In February 2021, CN announced the creation of an Indigenous Advisory Council (IAC), an independent body comprised of Indigenous leaders from across Canada. The IAC's mandate is to provide advice to CN's Board and CEO on relevant issues such as reinforcing diversity and inclusion through policies and procedures that reflect these principles.\n\nOur approach to sustainability is aligned with international standards, including the United Nations Global Compact and Sustainable Development Goals, the Global Reporting Initiative, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, the World Bank Mobility Goals, and the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures. These expectations are integrated into our five sustainability pillars: Environment, Safety, People, Communities, and Governance.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) dated February 1, 2022, relates to the consolidated financial position and results of operations of Canadian National Railway Company, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, collectively \"CN\" or the \"Company,\" and should be read in conjunction with the Company's 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. All financial information reflected herein is expressed in Canadian dollars and prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), unless otherwise noted.\n\nCN's common shares are listed on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges. Additional information about CN filed with Canadian securities regulatory authorities and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the Company's 2021 Annual Information Form and Form 40-F, may be found online on SEDAR at www.sedar.com, on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov through EDGAR, and on the Company's website at www.cn.ca in the Investors section. Printed copies of such documents may be obtained by contacting CN's Corporate Secretary's Office.\n\n## Business profile\n\nCN is engaged in the rail and related transportation business. CN's network of 19,500 route miles of track spans Canada and the United States of America (U.S.); the only railroad connecting Canada's Eastern and Western coasts with the U.S. South. CN's extensive network and efficient connections to all Class I railroads provide CN customers access to Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. Essential to the economy, to the customers, and to the communities it serves, CN safely transports more than 300 million tons of cargo, serving exporters, importers, retailers, farmers and manufacturers. CN and its affiliates have been contributing to community prosperity and sustainable trade since 1919. CN is committed to programs supporting social responsibility and environmental stewardship.\n\nCN's freight revenues are derived from seven commodity groups representing a diversified and balanced portfolio of goods transported between a wide range of origins and destinations. This product and geographic diversity better position the Company to face economic fluctuations and enhances its potential for growth opportunities. For the year ended December 31, 2021, CN's largest commodity group accounted for 28% of total revenues. From a geographic standpoint, 16% of revenues relate to U.S. domestic traffic, 31% transborder traffic, 18% Canadian domestic traffic and 35% overseas traffic. The Company is the originating carrier for over 85%, and the originating and terminating carrier for over 65%, of traffic moving along its network, which allows it both to capitalize on service advantages and build on opportunities to efficiently use assets.\n\n## Corporate organization\n\nThe Company manages its rail operations in Canada and the U.S. as one business segment. Financial information reported at this level, such as revenues, operating income and cash flow from operations, is used by the Company's corporate management in evaluating financial and operational performance and allocating resources across CN's network. The Company's strategic initiatives are developed and managed centrally by corporate management and are communicated to its regional activity centers (the Western Region and Eastern Region), whose role is to manage the day-to-day service requirements of their respective territories, control direct costs incurred locally, and execute the strategy and operating plan established by corporate management.\n\nSee Note 23 - Segmented information to the Company's 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's corporate organization, as well as selected financial information by geographic area.\n\n## Strategy overview\n\nCN has long been a nation builder and trade enabler, and is essential to the North American economy. The Company's strengths are many: a unique tri-coastal network; a highly diverse customer base; an early mover advantage on sustainability, including fuel efficiency and environmental stewardship; a proven ability to innovate, including pioneering Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR); and a focus on safety.\n\nCN's strategic plan is about redefining railroading. The objective is clear: to deliver profitable growth by growing faster than the markets the Company participates in and continuously improving its operating efficiency, while being a leader in sustainability. This is expected to drive consistent shareholder returns and earnings growth.\n\nCN's business strategy is anchored on the Company's vision of Powering Sustainable Growth for our customers, people and communities . This strategy rests on a strong commitment to moving its customers' goods safely and efficiently, having talented and engaged employees, being environmentally responsible, helping build safer and stronger communities, all while adhering to the highest ethical standards of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\ngovernance. CN calls this Delivering Responsibly . Upon its solid strategic foundation rest four pillars: operational excellence every day, strong customer partnerships, growing its reach, and industry-leading innovation.\n\nCN's strategy creates value for its shareholders by striving for sustainable financial performance, including profitable top-line growth, strong free cash flow generation and return on invested capital well above the Company's cost of capital. CN also returns value to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. Through its strategic vision, CN is demonstrating the foresight, flexibility and resilience necessary to continue to create sustainable value for all its stakeholders by redefining railroading for the 21st century.\n\n- \u00b7 CN is going digital as the digital revolution transforms North American business.\n- \u00b7 CN is using data as an asset for better operational efficiency.\n- \u00b7 CN is focused on being part of the climate change solution.\n- \u00b7 CN is creating new relationships with customers and new customer service models.\n- \u00b7 CN is building a diverse and talented North American workforce of committed railroaders.\n\nCN's strategy harnesses new technologies, opportunities, and relationships to 'Power Sustainable Growth for our customers, people, and communities\".\n\n## Operational excellence every day\n\nCN's goal is to deliver reliable, efficient and cost-effective transportation services for its customers. CN continues to improve its service productivity and safety, with a focus on investments in network fluidity, automation, big data analytics and the digital customer experience. CN's PSR operating model focuses on improving every aspect of railroad operations to meet customer commitments efficiently and profitably. This calls for the continuous measurement of results and the use of such information to generate further improvements in the service provided to customers and in the efficiency of operations. The Company strives to run longer trains, reduce terminal dwell times and improve overall network velocity. PSR is a disciplined operating methodology that CN executes with a sense of urgency and accountability.\n\n## Strong customer partnerships\n\nCN aims to provide the best customer service by anticipating its customers' needs, understanding their growth plans, earning their trust, becoming a truly customer-centric organization and demonstrating agility. CN is developing deeper and stronger customer partnerships, putting its customers, and ultimately their end customers, at the center of its operations.\n\nCN's focus is on end-to-end collaboration with its customers and supply chain partners to help them grow their markets while leveraging technological innovation to deliver value. Supply chain collaboration agreements with ports, terminal operators and customers leverage key performance metrics that drive efficiencies within CN's operations and across the entire supply chain. CN's goal is to ensure a seamless end-toend customer experience by digitizing its operations, bringing transparency to the supply chain and adjusting its service performance measures to better reflect its customers' changing requirements.\n\nCN is digitalizing the way it does business, including sharing data through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and improving its communications and service performance through the use of mobile reporting and enhanced digital customer interfaces. CN will take an industry-leading focus on measuring customer satisfaction to consistently align to customer needs and maintain its everyday operational excellence.\n\n## Grow its reach\n\nCN facilitates the end-to-end supply chain to unlock long-term, profitable growth. With its unique tri-coastal network that spans North America, CN reaches farther, both physically and commercially, for its existing customers and to find new ones by playing a lead role in connecting North America to the world. To grow its reach for carload customers, CN is expanding its network of transload facilities across North America. In Western Canada, CN invests in infrastructure and equipment to grow its capacity and increase its share of new industrial production while also responding to shifting demands in commodities (e.g., transition to green energy). In Eastern Canada, CN aims to further densify its network by potentially developing, through partnerships, port and inland terminals to promote gateway growth and provide customers with a costadvantageous intermodal route to Toronto and the American Midwest.\n\n## Industry-leading innovation\n\nCN proactively pursues an ambitious innovation strategy using technology, analytics and automation to increase safety and efficiency as well as deliver a reliable, low-carbon, seamless service to its customers. As a pioneer of PSR, CN is well positioned to drive the next wave of change with Digital Scheduled Railroading (DSR). DSR applies technology tools and new ways of working to unlock further operational excellence, customer service and employee engagement. DSR features:\n\n- \u00b7 Improved simplicity, reliability and predictability: Use advanced digital technologies, big data, artificial intelligence (AI) and predictive analytics for better planning, efficiency, and safety.\n- \u00b7 Better decision-making: Improved real-time data and analytical support tools available 24/7.",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n- \u00b7 Enhanced visibility: More accurate, consistent and relevant information provided to all stakeholders (e.g., customers, employees, communities).\n- \u00b7 Digitized work: Automate manual processes to improve efficiency and safety.\n- \u00b7 Enhanced cybersecurity protections: Protect the Company's physical assets and data to keep its network safe.\n- \u00b7 Improved analytics with a focus on sustainability (e.g., safety, environment, people, communities).\n\nIn December 2021, CN announced a seven-year strategic partnership with Google Cloud to transform CN's supply chain to deliver new customer experiences, and modernize its technology infrastructure in the cloud.\n\n## Sustainability leadership\n\nSustainability is at the heart of how CN is building for the future. Delivering Responsibly , the encapsulation of the Company's sustainability leadership, underpins all of CN's decisions, commitments and investments. The Company is focused on transporting goods safely, engaging the best diverse team of railroaders, protecting the environment, helping neighboring communities, and adhering to stringent ethical standards. CN understands that transparency is essential for stakeholder trust concerning the Company's Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) commitments. In that regard, CN seeks to align its ESG disclosures with global best practice frameworks.\n\n## Safety is a core value\n\nCN is intensely focused on its uncompromising commitment to the health and safety of its employees, the communities and environment in which it operates and the customers it serves. The Company embraces a safety culture based on the fundamental belief that all injuries and accidents are preventable. CN's objective is simple: reduce on-the-job fatalities and serious injuries to zero. The Company is employing advanced technology and innovative training models to help achieve this goal. CN also continues to train its people and build its infrastructure toward its goal of being the safest railroad in North America. More specifically, CN is:\n\n- \u00b7 Fostering an engaged workforce that respects Life Critical Rules .\n- \u00b7 Embedding a mindset whereby employees take ownership for their own safety and the safety of others by Looking Out for Each Other .\n- \u00b7 Training employees to identify and mitigate exposures.\n- \u00b7 Using advanced technologies to proactively mitigate human error and reduce risk.\n- \u00b7 Maintaining reliable and safe equipment and infrastructure.\n- \u00b7 Investing in employee training, coaching, recognition and engagement initiatives.\n- See the section entitled Human capital management -Health and safety of this MD&A for additional information regarding CN's safety\n\ninitiatives.\n\n## Building the talent and culture to drive CN performance in a DSR world\n\nCN people have always been the Company's most important differentiator, caring passionately about railroading and bringing optimism, commitment and resilience to daily tasks. CN aims to attract, retain and train the very best talent, with a renewed focus on a diverse, inclusive and winning culture to enhance employee engagement. The Company aspires to have workforce diversity that reflects the communities in which it operates. CN develops its employees with the necessary skills for an increasingly automated and data-driven work environment.\n\nSee the section entitled Human capital management of this MD&A for additional information regarding CN's human capital initiatives.\n\n## Tackling the impact of climate change\n\nThe Company's goal is to conduct its operations with minimal environmental impact, while offering a carbon-efficient and sustainable way to move goods. CN is making a positive contribution in the fight against climate change and playing a key role in the transition to a lower-carbon economy.\n\nWith approximately 85% of its direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated from rail operations, CN believes the best way to reduce its carbon footprint is by continuously improving fuel efficiency. Over the years, this focus has resulted in significant progress in decoupling volume growth from carbon emissions. CN continues to maintain its leadership position among Class I North American railways, consuming approximately 15% less locomotive fuel per gross ton mile than the industry average. CN was also the first North American railway, and among the first 100 companies globally, to announce an approved science-based carbon reduction plan. CN will continue to raise the bar for climate leadership and intends to reduce its carbon footprint in line with the Paris Agreement and by continuing to drive fuel and carbon efficiency in its own fleets, and across the supply chain on a path toward net-zero by 2050.\n\nCN is building decarbonization partnerships with customers, locomotive manufacturers, supply chain partners, researchers, clean-tech innovators and government regulators to deliver on its climate vision and help drive economic prosperity in a low-carbon environment. To achieve its decarbonization targets, CN will need to continue to improve the fuel efficiency of its fleets, increase its use of sustainable renewable fuels and test innovative propulsion technologies while working collaboratively to bring low-carbon alternatives to market.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nAs part of CN's comprehensive Climate Action Plan , the Company engages in several best-practice initiatives, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Using cleaner, more fuel-efficient locomotives that emit less GHG.\n- \u00b7 Exploring and investing in innovative technologies, such as locomotive energy management and data telemetry systems as well as distributed power functionality.\n- \u00b7 Leveraging the principles of PSR to use fewer railcars and locomotives to ship more freight in a tight, reliable and efficient operation.\n- \u00b7 Layering advanced technology and automation onto every aspect of its operation, such as DSR.\n- \u00b7 Increasing its use of sustainable renewable fuel blends in its fleets.\n- \u00b7 Reducing CN's non-rail carbon footprint by upgrading its ground fleet, retrofitting yards and buildings, and meeting strict requirements for its vessel fleet.\n- \u00b7 Working with its customers to help them reduce their transportation supply chain GHG emissions by leveraging rail for the long haul and trucking over shorter distances.\n\nThe Company combines its expert resources, environmental management procedures, as well as training and audits for employees and contractors to help ensure it conducts its operations while protecting the natural environment and biodiversity. The Company's environmental activities include:\n\n- \u00b7 Monitoring and reporting on its environmental impact in Canada and the U.S.\n- \u00b7 Identifying and managing environmental issues in accordance with its environmental policy, which is overseen by the Governance, Sustainability and Safety Committee of the Board of Directors.\n- \u00b7 Putting in place risk mitigation strategies to minimize environmental risks to the Company.\n- \u00b7 Engaging openly and proactively with customers, supply chain partners, communities and governments to deliver on its target and help drive economic prosperity in a low-carbon environment.\n- \u00b7 Protecting biodiversity and managing the land in the various habitats through which its network runs are important aspects of CN's corporate culture and are aligned with its community efforts to protect the environment.\n\nThe Company's CDP Report, Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures report, sustainability report entitled \" Delivering\n\nResponsibly \" and the Company's Corporate Governance Manual, which outlines the role and responsibilities of the Governance, Sustainability and Safety Committee of the Board of Directors, are available on CN's website in the Delivering Responsibly section.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement and regulatory\n\nCN does not operate in isolation. It is tightly integrated with the rest of society, providing vital links spanning eight provinces, 16 states, 200 First Nation and M\u00e9tis communities, and more than 2,000 towns and cities across its network. As such, CN continues to play an essential role and contributes to economic prosperity through job creation, investments and freight transportation services. However, CN believes it is not just what it does but how it does it that matters for its long-term success. The Company seeks to enhance its reputation through open and proactive engagement to ensure its stakeholders are aware of its strategy. CN engages externally across a wide spectrum of initiatives and fosters effective two-way communications that ensure a respectful and beneficial exchange.\n\nCN believes the rail industry can enhance safety by working closely with communities. Under CN's structured Community Engagement program, the Company engages with municipal officers and their emergency responders to assist them in their emergency response planning. During this frequent outreach, CN discusses:\n\n- \u00b7 Its comprehensive safety programs and performance.\n- \u00b7 The nature, volume and economic importance of dangerous goods it transports through their communities.\n- \u00b7 Emergency response planning.\n- \u00b7 Training sessions for emergency responders.\n\nThe outreach builds on CN's involvement in Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response (TRANSCAER \u00ae ), through which the Company has been working for many years to help communities in Canada and the U.S. understand the movement of hazardous materials and what is required in the event of transportation incidents. All Aboard for Safety is CN's flagship community education program. Every year, CN employees make hundreds of presentations and talk to thousands of children and adults at schools and community events in Canada and the U.S. about the importance of rail safety and the dangers of walking or playing on or near railway tracks.\n\nAs part of CN's year-round outreach effort, the CN Police Service continues to be active in communities across the CN network to promote safe behavior around railroad infrastructure. Activities include conducting enforcement initiatives with external agencies and delivering safety presentations to high-risk groups. During the industry's annual Rail Safety Week campaign, CN police officers and other employees, in partnership with Operation Lifesaver \u00ae , participate in numerous safety initiatives to raise awareness about preventing accidents and injuries around railway property.\n\nCN believes another way to help build more sustainable communities is to actively contribute millions of dollars each year through its CN Stronger Communities Fund to organizations, programs and initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion, innovation and safety, education,\n\n|",

The CN Railroaders in the Community program recognizes these acts of kindness by providing grants to the community-based not-for-profit organizations employees (current, retired or family) choose to support through their volunteer efforts. CN also encourages employee community involvement through its annual volunteer CN In Your Community Day .\n\nOperating within or adjacent to the reserve lands of 110 First Nations and M\u00e9tis peoples, CN is in daily contact with Indigenous communities across its network, identifying and fostering business opportunities, increasing employee awareness, and promoting employment opportunities within these communities. In February 2021, CN announced the creation of an Indigenous Advisory Council (IAC), an independent body comprised of Indigenous leaders from across Canada. The IAC's mandate is to provide advice to CN's Board and to the company's CEO on relevant issues such as reinforcing diversity and inclusion through policies and procedures that reflect these principles.\n\n## Disciplined capital allocation and execution\n\nCN's success depends on a steady stream of capital investments that are aligned with and support its business strategy. These investments cover a wide range of areas, from track infrastructure and rolling stock to information and operating technologies, as well as other equipment and assets that improve the safety, efficiency, capacity and reliability of CN's service offering. Investments in track infrastructure enhance the safety and integrity of the physical plant, increase the capacity and fluidity of the network, promote service excellence, and support growth. New locomotives equipped with distributed power increase capacity, fuel productivity and efficiency, and improve service reliability, particularly in cold weather, while improving train handling and safety. Targeted railcar acquisitions aim to tap growth opportunities, complementing the fleet of privately owned railcars that traverse CN's network. CN is also investing in and deploying advanced technologies to automate labor-intensive tasks like track and railcar inspections, as well as to improve the customer experience through 'track and trace' functionality. CN's long-term economic viability depends on the presence of a supportive regulatory and government policy environment that encourages investment and innovation.\n\nThe multi-year implementation of CN's strategic plan requires a disciplined, analysis-driven approach to capital allocation. Talent,\n\ntechnology and capital all need to be fully aligned. The Company's capital allocation roadmap includes several core elements:\n\n- \u00b7 Investing in the maintenance of a safe and reliable network, enabled by technologies such as the Autonomous Track Inspection Program and Automated Inspection Portals.\n- \u00b7 Investing in asset infrastructure to strengthen its tri-coastal network.\n- \u00b7 Growing its physical and commercial reach through strategic partnerships and acquisitions.\n- \u00b7 Developing a portfolio approach to technology with business-led investment decisions, delivering value at each stage of implementation.\n- \u00b7 Deepening supply chain partnerships with its customers, including road-to-rail conversion.\n- \u00b7 Investing in data analytic systems, including AI, to support data-driven decision-making.\n- \u00b7 Investing in technologies and capital assets to support decarbonization of its footprint.\n\n## Near term - 2022: CN's performance improvement plan\n\nOn September 17, 2021, CN announced details of its strategic and financial value creation plan for 2022, 'Full Speed Ahead - Redefining Railroading,' which advances CN's strategic plan to lead on safety, customer value, operational excellence, sustainability and social inclusion, while continuing to deliver high-quality service to customers and generating profitable growth and enhanced returns to shareholders.\n\nIn 2022, CN's performance improvement plan is committed to operational excellence and delivering value for its shareholders by:\n\n- \u00b7 Prioritizing rail operations, including car velocity, train speed and train length;\n- \u00b7 Rationalizing its cost structure by streamlining the management hierarchy, particularly within support functions, to improve labor productivity by accelerating speed and quality of decision making; and\n- \u00b7 Producing compelling financial return through organic revenue growth driven by CN's intermodal business and continuous improvement on its operating margins.\n\nCN's performance in the fourth quarter of 2021 demonstrated solid progress towards this plan, despite the washouts in British Columbia caused by severe rain and flooding, resulting in a network shutdown in the region for three weeks in the fourth quarter (\"B.C. washouts\"). The performance in the fourth quarter was mainly due to pricing and yield optimization as well as cost reduction efforts largely driven by a headcount reduction of approximately 1,150 employees from the end of the third quarter as well as cost containment efforts in Purchased services and materials.\n\nCN has also demonstrated a commitment to shareholder returns through completion of the 2021 share buyback program, announcing a new share buyback program for 2022 of approximately $5 billion and a 19% dividend increase for 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Tracy was identified as the right leader to drive sustainable growth, continued operational improvement, technological advancement and shareholder value, and retain and attract a world-class workforce. Jean-Jacques Ruest will remain at CN in an advisory role until March 31, 2022 to ensure a seamless transition.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\n## Terminated CN KCS merger agreement\n\nOn September 15, 2021, Kansas City Southern ('KCS') notified CN that it terminated the previously announced May 21, 2021 definitive merger agreement (the 'CN Merger Agreement\") under which CN would have acquired KCS for an implied total transaction value of US$33.6 billion, including the assumption of US$3.8 billion of debt.\n\nOn August 31, 2021, the Surface Transportation Board (\"STB\") rejected the joint motion by CN and KCS to approve a proposed voting trust\n\nagreement. On September 15, 2021, KCS and its Board of Directors announced that the revised acquisition proposal of September 12, 2021 from Canadian Pacific Railway Limited ('CP') constituted a \"Company Superior Proposal\" as defined in the CN Merger Agreement. Consequently, KCS entered into a waiver letter agreement with CN under which KCS agreed to terminate the CN Merger Agreement in order to enter into a merger agreement with CP. As a result, CN received from KCS a merger termination fee of US$700 million ($886 million), recorded in Merger termination fee within the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and reflected in Operating activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In addition, KCS also refunded Brooklyn US Holdings, Inc. (\"Holdco\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, US$700 million ($886 million) that CN had previously paid as an advance to KCS of US$700 million ($845 million) in connection with KCS's payment of the termination fee to CP under KCS's original merger agreement with CP that was terminated on May 21, 2021. The refund received in the third quarter was recorded in Transaction-related costs within the Consolidated Statements of Income and reflected in Investing activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash flows. The US$700 million ($845 million) advance had been recorded in Advance to KCS\n\n|",

This advance, along with $63 million of transaction-related costs paid in the second quarter, have been reflected in Investing activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash flows.\n\nThe Company incurred $84 million of transaction-related costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 recorded in Transaction-related costs within the Consolidated Statements of Income. This included $125 million of transaction-related costs, consisting of a $76 million expense for costs previously capitalized to Advance to KCS and other transaction costs within the Consolidated Balance Sheets in the second quarter of 2021 in accordance with the expected application of equity method accounting and $49 million of additional transaction-related costs incurred in the third quarter of 2021; partially offset by $41 million of income generated as a result of the applicable foreign exchange rates prevailing at the time of payment of the US dollar denominated advance to KCS and receipt of the related refund.\n\nThe Company also paid $97 million of bridge financing and other fees (See Note 15 -Debt, Credit facilities to the Company's 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements) which were recorded in Interest expense within the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, after accounting for all direct and incremental expenses as well as income generated from the merger termination fee, CN recorded additional income of $705 million ($616 million after-tax), as a result of its strategic decision to bid for KCS.\n\n## Massena rail line\n\nOn April 6, 2020, the STB issued its decision conditionally approving the acquisition of the Massena rail line in New York from CSX Corporation (\"CSX\"), which the Company announced its agreement to purchase on August 29, 2019. On June 6, 2020, CN and CSX sought reconsideration asking the STB to remove its condition which requires the parties to propose a change to the line sale agreement for the STB's review. On February 25, 2021, the STB denied the parties' petitions for reconsideration. On April 23, 2021, the Company appealed the STB's condition in its April 6, 2020 and February 25, 2021 decisions. The case is pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Briefing is suspended while the parties participate in the circuit mediation process.\n\n## COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic necessitated governments, institutions and communities to take extraordinary actions, resulting in a partial economic shutdown and severe contraction in the global economy through 2020 and into 2021. By December 2020, vaccines began to be approved for use in North America and around the world, with vaccination programs accelerating in the first half of 2021 in many countries.\n\nTransport Canada's Ministerial Order published on October 29, 2021 mandated that employers in the federally regulated air, rail, and marine transportation sectors would be required to establish vaccination policies for their employees. In compliance with this directive, CN required all Canadian employees to have received their first dose by November 15, 2021 and be fully vaccinated by January 24, 2022.\n\nNew variants of the virus, including the Omicron variant which was first reported in late 2021, have led to the re-imposition of restrictive measures across North America and in other parts of the world.\n\nThe long-term implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the extent of the impact on the business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity of the Company, remain unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic as well as additional actions taken by governmental authorities and other parties in response to the pandemic.\n\n## Assets held for sale\n\nIn the second quarter of 2020, the Company committed to a plan and was actively marketing for sale for on-going rail operations, certain noncore lines in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ontario representing approximately 850 miles and has met the criteria for classification of the related assets as assets held for sale. Accordingly, a $486 million loss ($363 million after-tax) was recorded to adjust the carrying amount of these track and roadway assets to their estimated net selling price.\n\nOn March 31, 2021, CN entered into an agreement with a short line operator, for the sale of the non-core lines plus an additional 50 miles of track and roadway assets not originally included within assets held for sale, subject to various conditions including regulatory authorization by the STB. The carrying amount of assets held for sale was adjusted in the first quarter of 2021 to $260 million ($90 million as at December 31, 2020), to reflect the contractual selling price net of estimated transaction costs and the additional track and roadway assets included as part of the agreement. The increase of $170 million included a $137 million recovery of the loss ($102 million after-tax) on the non-core lines and $33 million for the additional track and roadway assets. The carrying amount of assets held for sale was included in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 10 - Other current assets to the Company's 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information . As at December 31, 2021, the criteria for the classification of assets held for sale continued to be met and there was no change to the carrying amount of assets held for sale.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

CN's capital spending also included $0.8 billion for strategic initiatives to increase capacity, enable growth and improve network resiliency, including line capacity upgrades and information technology initiatives, and $0.4 billion on equipment capital expenditures, including the acquisition of 69 high-horsepower locomotives and 491 new grain hopper cars.\n\n## Shareholder returns\n\nCN increased its quarterly dividend per share by 7% to $0.6150 from $0.5750 in 2020, effective for the first quarter of 2021, and paid $1.7 billion in dividends in 2021.\n\nThe Company repurchased 10.3 million of its common shares during the year, returning $1.6 billion to its shareholders. The Company\n\nsuspended its share repurchase program at the end of March 2020 due to the economic circumstances resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company resumed its share repurchases in February 2021 and suspended the share repurchases at the end of April 2021 in connection with the CN Merger Agreement with KCS. Following the termination of the CN Merger Agreement, the Company resumed share repurchases at the end of September 2021.\n\n## Sustainability recognition\n\nThe Company's sustainability practices earned it a place on the Dow Jones Sustainability World and North American Indices, for the 10 th and 13 th consecutive year, respectively. CN is the only Canadian company and the only North American railroad, listed in the DJSI Transportation and Transportation Infrastructure sector World Index. CN was also recognized for its actions to cut emissions, mitigate climate risks and develop the low carbon economy, earning a spot on the CDP 'A' List for sixth time, as well as being recognized for the 12 th time. CN was one of only three Canadian companies to earn a spot on the prestigious 'A' List in 2021. In addition, CN earned a #1 position in the Globe and Mail's comprehensive 2021 ranking of Canada's corporate boards.\n\n## 2022 Business outlook and assumptions\n\nFor 2022, the Company expects volume growth in terms of Revenue ton miles (RTMs) in the low single-digit range. The Company expects growth across a range of commodities, particularly in Canadian coal exports, intermodal traffic, lumber and panels, refined petroleum products, crude oil, plastics and chemicals, as well as significantly lower volumes of Canadian grain and lower volumes of potash.\n\nUnderpinning the 2022 business outlook, the Company assumes that North American industrial production will increase in the mid singledigit range. For the 2021/2022 crop year, the grain crop in Canada was below its three-year average and the U.S. grain crop was in line with its three-year average. The Company assumes that the 2022/2023 grain crops in both Canada and the U.S. will be in line with their respective three-year averages.\n\nIn 2022, the Company expects to invest approximately 17% of revenues in its capital program.\n\n## Future value creation\n\n## Shareholder returns\n\nOn January 25, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB) that allows for the repurchase of up to 42.0 million common shares between February 1, 2022 and January 31, 2023. In addition, on that same day, the Company's Board of Directors approved an increase of 19% to the quarterly dividend to common shareholders, from $0.6150 per share in 2021 to $0.7325 per share in 2022, effective for the first quarter.\n\nThe forward-looking statements discussed in this section are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements and are based on certain factors and assumptions which the Company considers reasonable about events, developments, prospects and opportunities that may not materialize or that may be offset entirely or partially by other events and developments.

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Human capital management\n\nCN's ability to develop the best railroaders in the industry has been a key contributor to the Company's success. CN recognizes that without the right people, no matter how good a service plan or business model a company may have, it will not be able to fully execute. The Company continues to focus on hiring the right people, onboarding them successfully, helping them build positive relationships with their colleagues and supporting all employees to grow and develop, while deepening its commitment to develop talent and plan for the future.\n\n## Governance\n\nCN's Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer has leadership accountability for the Company's workforce policies and programs and reports directly to the CEO. CN's Board and its committees, including the Governance, Sustainability and Safety Committee and Human Resources and Compensation Committee (HRCC) provide oversight of the Company's human capital management strategies, programs, practices and performance. The HRCC is responsible for monitoring executive management's performance assessment, compensation and succession planning as well as ensuring effective talent management through engagement surveys and monitoring union relations and strategy for consistency with CN's strategic direction. The HRCC also has the mandate to review human resources practices and policies by ensuring, amongst other things, that appropriate human resources systems are in place so that the Company can attract, motivate and retain the quality and diversity of personnel required to meet its business objectives. The Company's senior management provides regular briefings on human capital matters to the Board and its Committees to facilitate oversight.\n\nThe Board of Directors and management are committed to maintaining and instilling a strong ethical culture at CN, and as such, have developed a solid ethics program based on CN's core values of integrity and respect. Each director, executive officer and management employee must certify annually his or her compliance with the Code of Business Conduct and employees are required to complete an on-line training course on the Code of Business Conduct. Integrity training is also part of every new employee's onboarding program. In addition, AntiFraud Policy and Guidelines apply to all employees of CN and its wholly owned subsidiaries and set out steps to be taken in response to reported or suspected fraud in all its forms, as well as measures that are taken to identify, prevent and manage fraud-related risks.\n\n## Total employees\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, CN employed a total of 16,314 employees in Canada (2020 - 17,645), of which 11,878, or 73%, were unionized employees (2020 - 12,585, or 71%) and 6,290 employees in the U.S. (2020 - 6,736) of which 5,289, or 84%, were unionized employees (2020 5,624, or 83%). Within Canada, there are 26 bargaining units and in the U.S., there are currently 43 active bargaining units. See the section entitled Business risks of this MD&A for additional information regarding labor negotiations.\n\n## Health and safety\n\nCN has an uncompromising commitment to the health and safety of its employees, the customers it serves, and the communities and environments in which it operates. The Company's long-term safety improvement is driven by continued investments in infrastructure, rigorous safety processes and exposure reduction efforts, as well as efforts to continue deepening the Company's safety culture. The attainment of annual accident and injury targets is a component of management's annual incentive bonus plan. The Company's injury frequency rate and accident rate, defined according to the criteria of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), are provided for the entire company's operations and are publicly disclosed on a quarterly basis. See the section entitled Selected railroad statistics for additional information on CN's safety measures.\n\nCN's culture and commitment to safety is supported by its focus on training, leadership, and technology. The Looking Out For Each Other peer-to-peer engagement program focuses on raising awareness among all employees of the top causes of incidents and injuries, identifying and reviewing safe work procedures, training employees to be aware of their surroundings and recognize potential at-risk work practices, teaching employees how to provide constructive feedback to their peers and learning from past incidents. The Company's Life Critical Rules address the day-to-day activities that have the potential to cause serious harm or even loss of life. They are based on past incidents and are designed to help ensure they do not happen again. CN's safety leadership training program is heavily focused on teaching employees the importance of controlling exposures to risk and on developing the attitudes and behaviors required for a values-driven safety culture.\n\nCN is also leveraging new technology to drive improved safety performance including installing powerful sensor and Artificial Intelligence (\"AI\") technology into specially equipped automated track inspection cars positioned in existing train service, enabling track inspections at normal track speed. AI technology is also changing how CN inspects its railcar fleet. The new automated inspection portals feature ultra-highdefinition cameras that capture a 360\u00b0 view of a train as it travels through at full track speed. Both these innovations in automation, the track inspection railcars and train inspection portals, increase inspection frequency and quality and play an essential role in preventing incidents.\n\nCN's Safety Management System is the framework for putting safety at the center of its day-to-day operations.

CN works closely with its customers and suppliers to ensure adherence to Life Critical Rules where applicable, and to encourage a shared commitment to a values-based safety culture.\n\nCN believes that the rail industry can also enhance safety by working more closely with communities. Under CN's structured Community Engagement program, the Company engages with municipal officers and their emergency responders in an effort to assist them in their emergency response planning. In many cases, this outreach includes meetings, during which CN discusses its comprehensive safety programs, its safety performance, the nature, volume and economic importance of dangerous commodities it transports through their communities, a review of emergency response planning and arranging for training sessions for emergency responders. The outreach builds on CN's involvement in the Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response (TRANSCAER \u00ae ) initiative, through which the Company has been working for many years to help communities in Canada and the U.S. understand the movement of hazardous materials and what is required in the event of transportation incidents.\n\n## Pandemic Plan\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, CN deployed its multi-phase Pandemic Plan in March of 2020 and continues to institute various measures to protect its employees, customers, and the communities in which CN operates:\n\n- \u00b7 CN's medical team and occupational health department, who are members of the Association of American Railroads Health Committee, have played a pivotal role in CN's pandemic planning, taking direction from the World Health Organization, as well as federal, provincial and state authorities, as required, and offering best practices shared amongst North American railroads.\n- \u00b7 CN implemented preventative measures to ensure the safety of its employees and by extension, of its customers and communities. These measures included a work from home policy for employees not required on site, restriction of employee travel, social distancing measures at CN locations, segregating mission critical rail traffic control employees, and amplifying cleaning regimens on trains, in terminals, in crew accommodation facilities, and in offices.\n- \u00b7 In line with Transport Canada's Ministerial Order published on October 29, 2021 mandating vaccinations for employees of federally regulated railways in Canada to enhance the safety and reliability of Canada's transportation system, CN has put in place a mandatory vaccination policy for all employees in Canada and those required to travel to Canada. The Ministerial Order requires CN to have a company-wide vaccination policy that requires all persons employed by the Company to have received their first dosage of an approved COVID-19 vaccine by no later than November 15, 2021, unless they fall within an exception. The Order also requires all employees to be fully vaccinated by no later than January 24, 2022. Effectively, the Ministerial Order applies to all CN employees working in Canada. CN's policy also extends to employees of its wholly owned subsidiaries who perform work in Canada including US-based crews who work in Canada, as well as CN's contractors, consultants, agents and suppliers and anyone who accesses CN properties in Canada.\n- \u00b7 In the U.S., OSHA's emergency temporary standard requiring all employers with 100 or more employees to ensure their workforce is fully vaccinated or require any workers who remain unvaccinated to produce a negative test result on at least a weekly basis before coming to work was stayed by a court. The Executive Order on Ensuring Adequate COVID Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors requiring mandatory vaccination policies for all parties that contract with the Federal Government was also stayed by a court. CN continues to monitor the situation.\n- \u00b7 At different moments during the year, certain provinces mandated work from home and CN complied with these mandates. For the officebased employees returning to the office when allowed, safety measures are in place and aligned with the recommendations of the relevant Public Health authorities.\n- \u00b7 CN has deployed a dedicated team to manage employees showing COVID-19 symptoms or in close contact with COVID-19 positive cases. This includes nurses who assess employees and proactively request contact tracing, a contact tracing team to ensure timely isolation of any potential close contacts and targeted disinfection on top of the regular enhanced cleaning, as well as a team to answer all COVID-19 related questions from employees, management or Public Health authorities.\n- \u00b7 Understanding the importance of timely and reliable information, CN increased employee communications by providing frequent updates on the state of the Company's operations, as well as employee support for any questions or concerns.\n\n## Talent management\n\n## Attraction and recruitment\n\nCN is taking steps to further align its business and talent strategies by placing a greater emphasis on skills required to deliver on business strategies, and focusing on continued leadership development. CN recruits and hires leading talent with a broad range of strengths, perspectives and experiences, leveraging a wide array of partners to ensure diverse populations are aware of and attracted to the opportunities that the Company offers.\n\nFor the year 2021, CN was recognized as one of Canada's Top 100 Employers and Montreal's Top Employers, for the fourth consecutive year. In addition, CN was also listed as one of Canada's Best Employers for Recent Graduates by the Career Directory.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Training and development\n\nCN offers a variety of training courses, including mandatory and voluntary courses in order for employees to succeed in their current role and prepare for career advancement opportunities.\n\nThe Company offers trainings in technical, business and leadership programs, mostly focusing on using online virtually facilitated sessions and e-Learning courses, or, when possible or necessary, through in-person sessions. A revised leadership curriculum was launched in 2021 to support people leaders in building the skills and knowledge needed to successfully perform at each level, while in their current role as well as preparing for career advancement opportunities. The focus of our leadership development program is anchored on ensuring solid communication capabilities, increased collaboration across teams and creating a strong base of inclusive leadership throughout our workforce, which also incorporates training on unconscious bias and inclusion to address potential gaps. The Company is also expanding its online and curated playlists/curricula for more self-guided and self-paced learning, so development is a more holistic journey over an employee's lifecycle and tenure at CN. For the Operations group, CN has various leadership programs for front line management that focus on providing those leaders with a comprehensive understanding of railway operations, sales, and people leadership. The programs last between six to 12 months and upon completion, these individuals are placed in front line positions across the network.\n\nFurthermore, CN also supports its employees through a structured performance management process. At the beginning of each year, the non-unionized employees set goals for the year that align to its business strategy and objectives. At the mid and year-end, there is a discussion and review of progress against these goals as well as how they were achieved, so the focus is to continue to garner a performance-based culture. In addition, there are also discussions related to development plans that help to enhance skills, capabilities and experience across the talent pools.\n\n## Compensation\n\nCN's approach to compensation continues to be driven by our goal to deliver sustainable value creation, while ensuring that target compensation supports the attraction and retention of talent. Compensation programs are designed to encourage appropriate behaviors and include appropriate risk mitigation mechanisms. In addition, compensation best practices adopted by CN include industry benchmarking and pay positioning as well as pay equity reviews.\n\nCN offers a competitive compensation portfolio that consists of base salary, employee share investment plan, short-term and long-term incentives (applicable to certain employees only), benefits, retirement plans and other non-monetary elements.\n\n## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I)\n\nAt CN, employees are the Company's single greatest asset and the importance of creating a work environment that welcomes the contribution and uniqueness of every employee is recognized. CN is committed to creating a workforce of top talent that reflects the diversity of the population and stakeholders it serves. The Diversity and Inclusion Plan (\"Diversity Plan\") focuses on developing a more inclusive workplace by increasing the representation of women, people of color, Indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities and veterans. The plan applies at all levels within the organization and includes strategies on sourcing (among others, early career sourcing through internships, co-op and new graduate programs), selection, hiring, training and development of diverse candidates, anchoring CN's commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.\n\nThe Company has embedded diversity in its policy regarding composition of the Board and executive management. The Diversity Policy, which also applies to executive management, states that in fulfilling its oversight role, the HRCC regularly reviews CN's integrated approach to executive and high-potential talent management and succession planning, in order to ensure that CN has diverse candidate pools for potential successors for executive roles.\n\nCN is undertaking various initiatives aimed at better promoting and reinforcing diversity, equity and inclusion which are strongly supported through active involvement by management and the Board. Some examples include:\n\n- \u00b7 executing on a renewed DE&I vision whereby CN is determined to reflect the communities in which it operates;\n- \u00b7 conducting regular reviews of pay equity and defining a roadmap to address identified gaps;\n- \u00b7 refocusing our sponsorships and donations budget to better align with our strategic DE&I vision;\n- \u00b7 assessing hiring practices to leverage diversity focused recruitment agencies and requiring diverse candidate slates for all recruitment mandates;\n- \u00b7 developing inclusive leaders through targeted training and education, including unconscious bias and inclusive leadership training, as leaders will be critical in creating and sustaining an inclusive environment;\n- \u00b7 continuing to support and leverage the Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) that have been initiated and are backed by executive sponsors (currently seven ERGs); and\n- \u00b7 having dedicated resources to support our DE&I vision.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

CN has set a target that by the end of 2022, it would achieve and thereafter maintain, a Board composition in which at least 50% of the independent Board members are to come from diverse groups, including gender parity. In addition, presently 18% of independent Board members are from underrepresented groups. CN has also elected to set a gender diversity target for executive management (comprising all Vice-Presidents and more senior positions), whereby at the end of 2022, at least 30% of this group will be women. This aligns to the targets as set out in the Catalyst Accord 2022, to which CN is a signatory. At present, of the 34 current executive management roles, six, or 18% are held by women. Additionally, on January 25, 2022, CN announced the appointment of a female CEO effective on February 28, 2022.\n\n## Forward-looking statements\n\nCertain statements included in this MD&A are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and under Canadian securities laws, including statements based on management's assessment and assumptions and publicly available information with respect to CN.

The 2021 actual results were higher than the Company's last 2021 outlook that was issued on October 19, 2021, mainly driven by strong pricing and yield and cost reduction efforts; partly offset by lower volumes as a result of the B.C. washouts.\n\n## Financial highlights\n\nThe following table lists key measures of the Company's financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n\n|                                                   |           |           |           | Change Favorable/(Unfavorable)   | Change Favorable/(Unfavorable)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| In millions, except percentage and per share data | 2021      | 2020      | 2019      | 2021 vs 2020                     | 2020 vs 2019                     |\n| Revenues                                          | $  14,477 | $  13,819 | $  14,917 | 5%                               | (7%)                             |\n| Operating income                                  | $  5,616  | $  4,777  | $  5,593  | 18%                              | (15%)                            |\n| Adjusted operating income  (1)(2)                 | $  5,622  | $  5,263  | $  5,708  | 7%                               | (8%)                             |\n| Net income                                        | $  4,892  | $  3,562  | $  4,216  | 37%                              | (16%)                            |\n| Adjusted net income  (1)(2)                       | $  4,218  | $  3,784  | $  4,189  | 11%                              | (10%)                            |\n| Basic earnings per share                          | $  6.90   | $  5.01   | $  5.85   | 38%                              | (14%)                            |\n| Diluted earnings per share                        | $  6.89   | $  5.00   | $  5.83   | 38%                              | (14%)                            |\n| Adjusted diluted earnings per share  (1)(2)       | $  5.94   | $  5.31   | $  5.80   | 12%                              | (8%)                             |\n| Dividends declared per share                      | $  2.46   | $  2.30   | $  2.15   | 7%                               | 7%                               |\n| Operating ratio  (3)                              | 61.2%     | 65.4%     | 62.5%     | 4.2 -pts                         | (2.9) -pts                       |\n| Adjusted operating ratio  (1)(2)                  | 61.2%     | 61.9%     | 61.7%     | 0.7 -pts                         | (0.2) -pts                       |\n| Total assets                                      | $  48,538 | $  44,804 | $  43,784 | 8%                               | 2%                               |\n| Total long-term financial liabilities  (4)        | $  22,674 | $  21,879 | $  21,456 | (4%)                             | (2%)                             |\n| Net cash provided by operating activities         | $  6,971  | $  6,165  | $  5,923  | 13%                              | 4%                               |\n| Net cash used in investing activities             | $  2,873  | $  2,946  | $  4,190  | 2%                               | 30%                              |\n| Free cash flow  (1)(5)                            | $  3,296  | $  3,227  | $  1,992  | 2%                               | 62%                              |\n\n## 2021 compared to 2020\n\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $14,477 million compared to $13,819 million in 2020. The increase of $658 million, or 5%, was mainly attributable to freight rate increases, higher applicable fuel surcharge rates and an increase in intermodal ancillary services; partly offset by the negative translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar and lower volumes of Canadian grain in terms of RTMs compared to record volumes in 2020.\n\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $8,861 million compared to $9,042 million in 2020. The decrease of $181 million, or 2%, was mainly due to the $137 million recovery recorded in the first quarter of 2021 related to the $486 million loss on assets held for sale recorded in the second quarter of 2020, as well as the positive translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar; partly offset by higher fuel costs due to rising fuel prices, higher incentive compensation and $84 million of transaction-related costs resulting from the terminated CN Merger Agreement with KCS.\n\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $839 million, or 18%, to $5,616 million, an all-time record. Adjusted (1)\n\noperating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $5,622 million, an increase of $359 million, or 7%, when compared to 2020. The operating ratio was 61.2% in 2021, compared to 65.4% in 2020, a 4.2-point improvement. The adjusted operating ratio was 61.2% in 2021 compared to 61.9% in 2020, a 0.7-point improvement. (1)\n\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $4,892 million, an increase of $1,330 million, or 37%, when compared to 2020, and diluted earnings per share increased by 38% to $6.89. The increase was mainly driven by a merger termination fee of $886 million ($770 million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

The Company capitalized on its prior year's strategic investments in its infrastructure and its continued focus on efficiency and network fluidity. In addition, the Company's fuel initiatives allowed it to achieve an alltime record fuel efficiency of 0.867.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to 2019, GTMs were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the reduction in volumes, the Company increased efficiencies with increased train weight and train length, which negatively impacted through dwell, car velocity, and through network train speed. However, this allowed the Company to achieve an all-time record fuel efficiency of 0.894.\n\n|",

From management's perspective, these non-GAAP measures are useful measures of performance and provide investors with supplementary information to assess the Company's results of operations and liquidity. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nFor further details of these non-GAAP measures, including a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, refer to the sections entitled Adjusted performance measures, Constant currency, ROIC and adjusted ROIC, and Liquidity and capital resources .\n\n## Adjusted performance measures\n\nAdjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating expenses and adjusted operating ratio are non-GAAP measures that are used to set performance goals and to measure CN's performance. Management believes that these adjusted performance measures provide additional insight to management and investors into the Company's operations and underlying business trends as well as facilitate period-to-period comparisons, as they exclude certain significant items that are not reflective of CN's underlying business operations and could distort the analysis of trends in business performance. These items may include:\n\n- i. operating expense adjustments: workforce reduction program, depreciation expense on the deployment of replacement system, advisory fees related to shareholder matters, losses and recoveries from assets held for sale, business acquisition-related costs;\n- ii. non-operating expense adjustments: business acquisition-related financing fees, merger termination income, gains and losses on disposal of property; and\n- iii. the effect of tax law changes and rate enactments.\n\nThese measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company reported adjusted net income of $4,218 million, or $5.94 per diluted share, which excludes:\n\n- \u00b7 employee termination benefits and severance costs related to a workforce reduction program of $39 million, or $29 million after-tax ($0.04 per diluted share) recorded in the third quarter in Labor and fringe benefits within the Consolidated Statements of Income;\n- \u00b7 advisory fees related to shareholder matters of $20 million, or $15 million after-tax ($0.02 per diluted share) of which $13 million, or $10 million after-tax ($0.02 per diluted share) was recorded in the fourth quarter and $7 million, or $5 million after-tax ($0.01 per diluted share) was recorded in the third quarter in Casualty and other within the Consolidated Statements of Income;\n- \u00b7 the recovery of $137 million, or $102 million after-tax ($0.14 per diluted share) recorded in the first quarter related to the loss on assets held for sale in the second quarter of 2020, to reflect an agreement for the sale for on-going rail operations, certain non-core rail lines in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ontario to a short line operator;\n- \u00b7 transaction-related costs, consisting of an advance to Kansas City Southern (KCS) and a related refund, net of transaction costs, of $84 million, or $70 million after-tax ($0.10 per diluted share), recorded in the third quarter resulting from the terminated CN Merger Agreement with KCS;\n- \u00b7 amortization of bridge financing and other fees of $65 million, or $60 million after-tax ($0.08 per diluted share) recorded in the third quarter and $32 million, or $24 million after-tax ($0.03 per diluted share) recorded in the second quarter, resulting from the KCS transaction, recorded in Interest expense within the Consolidated Statements of Income; and\n- \u00b7 merger termination fee paid by KCS to CN of $886 million, or $770 million after-tax ($1.08 per diluted share), recorded in the third quarter resulting from KCS' notice of termination of the CN Merger Agreement with KCS.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reported adjusted net income of $3,784 million, or $5.31 per diluted share, which excludes a loss of $486 million, or $363 million after-tax ($0.51 per diluted share) in the second quarter, resulting from the Company's decision to market for sale for on-going rail operations, certain non-core lines in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ontario, and a current income tax recovery of $141 million ($0.20 per diluted share) in the first quarter resulting from the enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act , a U.S. tax-and-spending package aimed at providing additional stimulus to address the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

The Company calculates ROIC as return divided by average invested capital, both of which are non-GAAP measures. Return is defined as Net income plus interest expense after-tax, calculated using the Company's effective tax rate. Average invested capital is defined as the sum of Total shareholders' equity, Long-term debt and Current portion of long-term debt less Cash and cash equivalents, and Restricted cash and cash equivalents, averaged between the beginning and ending balance over the last twelve-month period. The Company calculates adjusted ROIC as adjusted return divided by average invested capital, both of which are non-GAAP measures. Adjusted return is defined as adjusted net income plus interest expense after-tax, calculated using the Company's adjusted effective tax rate. Return, average invested capital, ROIC, adjusted return and adjusted ROIC do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Net income and adjusted net income to return and adjusted return, respectively, as well as the calculation of average invested capital, which have been used to calculate ROIC and adjusted ROIC:\n\n| In millions, except percentage                                                                                                   | As at and for the year ended December 31,   | 2021         | 2020          | 2019          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Net income                                                                                                                       |                                             | $  4,892     | $  3,562      | $  4,216      |\n| Interest expense                                                                                                                 |                                             | 610          | 554           | 538           |\n| Tax on interest expense  (1)                                                                                                     |                                             | (139)        | (120)         | (120)         |\n| Return                                                                                                                           |                                             | $  5,363     | $  3,996      | $  4,634      |\n| Average total shareholders' equity                                                                                               |                                             | $  21,198    | $  18,846     | $  17,841     |\n| Average long-term debt                                                                                                           |                                             | 11,987  709  | 11,931  1,420 | 11,626  1,557 |\n| Average current portion of long-term debt Less:  Average cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents |                                             | (1,221)      | (844)         | (674)         |\n| Average invested capital                                                                                                         |                                             | $  32,673    | $  31,353     | $  30,350     |\n| ROIC                                                                                                                             |                                             | 16.4%  4,218 | 12.7%         | 15.3%  4,189  |\n| Adjusted net income  (2)                                                                                                         |                                             | $  610       | $  3,784  554 | $  538        |\n| Interest expense Less:  Amortization of bridge financing and other fees                                                          | (3)                                         | (97)         | -             | -             |\n| Tax on interest expense less amortization of bridge financing and other fees                                                     | (4)                                         | (123)        | (137)         | (131)         |\n| Adjusted return                                                                                                                  |                                             | $  4,608     | $  4,201      | $  4,596      |\n| Average invested capital                                                                                                         |                                             | $  32,673    | $  31,353     | $  30,350     |\n| Adjusted ROIC                                                                                                                    |                                             | 14.1%        | 13.4%         | 15.1%         |\n\n|",

Measures at constant currency are considered nonGAAP measures and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Financial results at constant currency are obtained by translating the current period results denominated in US dollars at the weighted average foreign exchange rates used to translate transactions denominated in US dollars of the comparable period of the prior year.\n\nThe average foreign exchange rates were $1.25 and $1.34 per US$1.00, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. On a constant currency basis, the Company's Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 would have been higher by $166 million ($0.23 per diluted share).\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the impact of constant currency and related percentage change at constant currency on the financial results, as reported for the year ended December 31, 2021:\n\n| In millions, except per share data              | Year ended December 31,   | 2021     | Constant  currency impact   | 2020   | % Change at  constant  currency  Fav (Unfav)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------|-----------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Revenues                                        |                           |          |                             |        |                                                |\n| Petroleum and chemicals                         |                           | $  2,816 | $  128  $                   | 2,631  | 12%                                            |\n| Metals and minerals                             |                           | 1,548    | 83                          | 1,409  | 16%                                            |\n| Forest products                                 |                           | 1,740    | 93                          | 1,700  | 8%                                             |\n| Coal                                            |                           | 618      | 17                          | 527    | 20%                                            |\n| Grain and fertilizers                           |                           | 2,475    | 80                          | 2,609  | (2%)                                           |\n| Intermodal                                      |                           | 4,115    | 95                          | 3,751  | 12%                                            |\n| Automotive                                      |                           | 576      | 32                          | 591    | 3%                                             |\n| Total freight revenues                          |                           | 13,888   | 528                         | 13,218 | 9%                                             |\n| Other revenues                                  |                           | 589      | 29                          | 601    | 3%                                             |\n| Total revenues                                  |                           | 14,477   | 557                         | 13,819 | 9%                                             |\n| Operating expenses                              |                           |          |                             |        |                                                |\n| Labor and fringe benefits                       |                           | 2,879    | 65                          | 2,723  | (8%)                                           |\n| Purchased services and material                 |                           | 2,082    | 60                          | 2,152  | -%                                             |\n| Fuel                                            |                           | 1,513    | 94                          | 1,152  | (39%)                                          |\n| Depreciation and amortization                   |                           | 1,598    | 44                          | 1,589  | (3%)                                           |\n| Equipment rents                                 |                           | 336      | 19                          | 432    | 18%                                            |\n| Casualty and other                              |                           | 506      | 27                          | 508    | (5%)                                           |\n| Loss (recovery) on assets held for sale         |                           | (137)    | (12)                        | 486    | 131%                                           |\n| Transaction-related costs                       |                           | 84       | 47                          | -

The increase of $658 million, or 5%, was mainly attributable to freight rate increases, higher applicable fuel surcharge rates and an increase in intermodal ancillary services; partly offset by the negative translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar and lower volumes of Canadian grain in terms of RTMs compared to record volumes in 2020. Fuel surcharge revenues increased by $301 million in 2021, mainly due to higher applicable fuel surcharge rates.\n\nIn 2021, RTMs, measuring the weight and distance of freight transported by the Company, increased by 1% relative to 2020, despite the unfavorable impact of the ongoing supply chain challenges, the polar vortex in February, the forest fires and drought in Western Canada over the summer and the B.C. washouts in the fourth quarter of 2021. Freight revenue per RTM increased by 4% in 2021 when compared to 2020, mainly driven by a decrease in the average length of haul, freight rate increases and higher applicable fuel surcharge rates; partly offset by the negative translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar.\n\n## Petroleum and chemicals\n\n|                       | 2021     | 2020     | % Change   | % Change at constant currency   |\n|-----------------------|----------|----------|------------|---------------------------------|\n| Revenues  (millions)  | $  2,816 | $  2,631 | 7%         | 12%                             |\n| RTMs  (millions)      | 42,436   | 43,556   | (3%)       | (3%)                            |\n| Revenue/RTM  (cents)  | 6.64     | 6.04     | 10%        | 15%                             |\n| Carloads  (thousands) | 596      | 597      | -%         | -%                              |\n\nThe petroleum and chemicals commodity group comprises a wide range of commodities, including chemicals and plastics, refined petroleum products, natural gas liquids, crude oil and sulfur. The primary markets for these commodities are within North America, and as such, the performance of this commodity group is closely correlated with the North American economy as well as oil and gas production. Most of the Company's petroleum and chemicals shipments originate in Western Canada, a key oil and gas development area and a major center for natural gas feedstock and world-scale petrochemicals and plastics; in eastern Canadian regional plants; and in the Louisiana petrochemical corridor between New Orleans and Baton Rouge.\n\n|",

The Company provides unique rail access to base metals, iron ore and frac sand mining as well as aluminum and steel producing regions, which are among the most important in North America. This strong origin franchise, coupled with the Company's access to port facilities and the end markets for these commodities, has made CN a leader in the transportation of metals and minerals products. The key drivers for this market segment are oil and gas development, automotive production, and non-residential construction.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, revenues for this commodity group increased by $139 million, or 10%, when compared to 2020, mainly due to increased export volumes of iron ore via the Gulf Coast, higher volumes of frac sand, higher shipments of semi-finished steel products, higher applicable fuel surcharge rates and freight rate increases; partly offset by the negative translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar.\n\nRevenue per RTM decreased by 11% in 2021 when compared to 2020, mainly due to a significant increase in the average length of haul and the negative translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar; partly offset by higher applicable fuel surcharge rates and freight rate increases.\n\n| Percentage of commodity group revenues   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Metals                                   | 31 %   | 31 %   |\n| Minerals                                 | 26 %   | 28 %   |\n| Energy materials                         | 22 %   | 21 %   |\n| Iron ore                                 | 21 %   | 20 %   |\n\n## Forest products\n\n|                       | 2021     | 2020     | % Change   | % Change at constant currency   |\n|-----------------------|----------|----------|------------|---------------------------------|\n| Revenues  (millions)  | $  1,740 | $  1,700 | 2%         | 8%                              |\n| RTMs  (millions)      | 25,948   | 25,602   | 1%         | 1%                              |\n| Revenue/RTM  (cents)  | 6.71     | 6.64     | 1%         | 6%                              |\n| Carloads  (thousands) | 339      | 342      | (1%)       | (1%)                            |\n\nThe forest products commodity group includes various types of lumber, panels, paper, board and wrapping paper, wood pulp and other fibers such as logs, recycled paper, wood chips, and wood pellets.

In the U.S., the Company is strategically located to serve both the Midwest and southern U.S. corridors with interline connections to other Class I railroads. The key drivers for the various commodities are: for lumber and panels, housing starts and renovation activities primarily in the U.S.; for fibers (mainly wood pulp), the consumption of paper, pulpboard and tissue in North American and offshore markets; and for newsprint, advertising lineage, non-print media and overall economic conditions, primarily in the U.S.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, revenues for this commodity group increased by $40 million, or 2%, when compared to 2020, mainly due to freight rate increases, higher volumes of lumber and panels and higher applicable fuel surcharge rates; partly offset by the negative translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar and lower volumes of woodpulp.\n\nRevenue per RTM increased by 1% in 2021 when compared to 2020, mainly due to freight rate increases and higher applicable fuel surcharge rates; partly offset by the negative translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar.\n\n| Percentage of commodity group revenues   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Lumber                                   | 40 %   | 39 %   |\n| Pulp                                     | 29 %   | 30 %   |\n| Paper                                    | 16 %   | 17 %   |\n| Panels                                   | 15 %   | 14 %   |\n\n## Coal\n\n| Year ended December 31,   | 2021   | 2020   | % Change   | % Change at constant currency   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|------------|---------------------------------|\n| Revenues  (millions)      | $  618 | $  527 | 17%        | 20%                             |\n| RTMs  (millions)          | 18,471 | 16,173 | 14%        | 14%                             |\n| Revenue/RTM  (cents)      | 3.35   | 3.26   | 3%         | 6%                              |\n| Carloads  (thousands)     | 379    | 289    | 31%        | 31%                             |\n\nThe coal commodity group consists of thermal grades of bituminous coal, metallurgical coal and petroleum coke. Canadian thermal and metallurgical coal are largely exported via terminals on the west coast of Canada to offshore markets. In the U.S., thermal coal is transported from mines served in southern Illinois, or from western U.S. mines via interchange with other railroads, to major utilities in the Midwest and Southeast U.S., as well as offshore markets via terminals on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Petroleum coke, a by-product of the oil refining process, is exported to offshore markets via terminals on the west coast of Canada and the U.S. Gulf Coast, as well as shipped to industrial users in domestic markets. The key drivers for this market segment are weather conditions, environmental regulations, global energy, coal and steel supply and demand conditions, and for U.S. domestic utility coal, the price of natural gas.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, revenues for this commodity group increased by $91 million, or 17%, when compared to 2020, mainly due to increased exports of U.S. thermal coal via the Gulf Coast, higher applicable fuel surcharge rates and freight rate increases; partly offset by the negative translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar.\n\nRevenue per RTM increased by 3% in 2021 when compared to 2020, mainly due to a significant decrease in the average length of haul, higher applicable fuel surcharge rates and freight rate increases; partly offset by the negative translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar.\n\n| Percentage of commodity group revenues   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Canadian coal - export                   | 45 %   | 49 %   |\n| Petroleum coke                           | 25 %   | 25 %   |\n| U.S. coal - domestic                     | 14 %   | 17 %   |\n| U.S. coal - export                       | 16 %   | 9 %    |\n\n|",

The grain segment consists of wheat, oats, barley, flaxseed, rye, peas, lentils, corn, corn meal, ethanol, dried distillers grain, canola seed and canola products, soybeans, soybean products, sweeteners and animal fat. Production of grain varies considerably from year to year, affected primarily by weather conditions, seeded and harvested acreage, the mix of grains produced and crop yields. Grain exports are sensitive to the size and quality of the crop produced, international market conditions and foreign government policy. The majority of grain produced in Western Canada and moved by CN is exported via the ports of Vancouver, Prince Rupert and Thunder Bay. These rail movements are subject to government regulation that establishes a maximum revenue entitlement that railways can earn. Although railway companies are free to set freight rates for western grain shipments, total revenue is limited based on a formula that takes into account tonnage, length of haul, and a specified price index. Shipments of grain that are exported to the U.S. are not regulated. Grain grown in the U.S. Midwest is exported as well as transported to domestic processing facilities and feed markets. The Company also serves major producers of potash in Canada, as well as producers of ammonium nitrate, anhydrous ammonia, urea and other fertilizers across Canada and the U.S. The key drivers for fertilizers are input prices, demand, government policies, and international competition.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, revenues for this commodity group decreased by $134 million, or 5%, when compared to 2020, mainly due to lower export volumes of Canadian grain compared to prior period record volumes and the negative translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar; partly offset by higher potash volumes, higher export volumes of U.S. grain, freight rate increases and higher applicable fuel surcharge rates.\n\nRevenue per RTM remained flat in 2021 when compared to 2020.\n\n| Percentage of commodity group revenues   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Canadian grain - regulated               | 39 %   | 47 %   |\n| U.S. grain - domestic                    | 19 %   | 18 %   |\n| Fertilizers - potash                     | 14 %   | 10 %   |\n| Canadian grain - commercial              | 12 %   | 11 %   |\n| Fertilizers - other                      | 9 %    | 9 %    |\n| U.S. grain - exports                     | 7 %    | 5 %    |\n\n## Intermodal\n\n|                       | 2021     | 2020     | % Change   | % Change at constant currency   |\n|-----------------------|----------|----------|------------|---------------------------------|\n| Revenues  (millions)  | $  4,115 | $  3,751 | 10%        | 12%                             |\n| RTMs  (millions)      | 58,412   | 59,165   | (1%)       | (1%)                            |\n| Revenue/RTM  (cents)  | 7.04     | 6.34     | 11%        | 14%                             |\n| Carloads  (thousands) | 2,611    | 2,582    | 1%         | 1%                              |\n\nThe intermodal commodity group includes rail and trucking services and is comprised of two markets: domestic intermodal and international intermodal. Domestic intermodal transports consumer products and manufactured goods, serving retail, wholesale and logistics provider channels, within domestic Canada, domestic U.S., Mexico and transborder, while international intermodal handles import and export container traffic, serving the major ports of Vancouver, Prince Rupert, Montreal, Halifax, New Orleans and Mobile. CN's network of inland intermodal terminals, located near ports and large urban centers, connects customers to major markets in North America and overseas. Domestic intermodal is driven by consumer markets, with growth generally tied to the economy. International intermodal is driven by North American economic and trade conditions as well as global trade patterns. Revenues for CN owned trucking companies TransX and H&R are included in this commodity group within the domestic market.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

The Company also serves vehicle distribution facilities in Canada and the U.S., as well as parts production facilities in Michigan and Ontario. The Company serves shippers of finished vehicle imports via the ports of Halifax and Vancouver, and through interchange with other railroads. CN's broad network of auto compounds is used to facilitate distribution of vehicles throughout Canada and the U.S. Midwest. The primary drivers for this market are automotive production and sales in North America, which are driven by the average age of vehicles in North America and the price of fuel.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, revenues for this commodity group decreased by $15 million, or 3%, when compared to 2020, mainly due to lower volumes of finished vehicles shipped primarily due to a semiconductor chip shortage impacting the automotive industry production and lower volumes of Vancouver imports and the negative translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar; partly offset by higher applicable fuel surcharge rates and freight rate increases.\n\nRevenue per RTM increased by 6% in 2021 when compared to 2020, mainly due to a decrease in the average length of haul, higher applicable fuel surcharge rates and freight rate increases; partly offset by the negative translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar.\n\n| Percentage of commodity group revenues   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Finished vehicles                        | 91 %   | 92 %   |\n| Auto parts                               | 9 %    | 8 %    |\n\n## Other revenues\n\n| Year ended December 31,   | 2021   |   2020 | % Change   | % Change at constant currency   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|------------|---------------------------------|\n| Revenues  (millions)      | $  589 |    601 | (2%)       | 3%                              |\n\nOther revenues are derived from non-rail logistics services that support the Company's rail business including vessels and docks, transloading and distribution, automotive logistics, and freight forwarding and transportation management.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, Other revenues decreased by $12 million, or 2%, when compared to 2020, mainly due to lower revenues for automotive logistics primarily due to a semiconductor chip shortage impacting the automotive industry production and the negative translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar; partly offset by higher revenues from international freight forwarding and vessels.\n\n|",

Certain incentive compensation plans are based mainly on financial performance targets and the related expense is recorded in relation to the attainment of such targets.\n\nLabor and fringe benefits expense increased by $156 million, or 6%, in 2021 when compared to 2020. The increase was mainly due to higher incentive compensation, general wage increases, as well as $39 million of employee termination benefits and severance costs related to a workforce reduction program in the third quarter; partly offset by the positive translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar.\n\n## Purchased services and material\n\nPurchased services and material expense includes the cost of services purchased from outside contractors; materials used in the maintenance of the Company's track, facilities and equipment; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; utility costs; and the net costs of operating facilities jointly used by the Company and other railroads.\n\nPurchased services and material expense decreased by $70 million, or 3%, in 2021 when compared to 2020. The decrease was mainly due to the positive translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar and lower material costs as a result of cost reduction efforts.\n\n## Fuel\n\nFuel expense includes fuel consumed by assets, including locomotives, vessels, vehicles and other equipment as well as federal, provincial and state fuel taxes.\n\nFuel expense increased by $361 million, or 31%, in 2021 when compared to 2020. The increase was mainly due to higher fuel prices; partly offset by the positive translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar and fuel efficiency gains resulting in an all-time record fuel efficiency.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

Depreciation expense is affected by capital additions, railroad property retirements from disposal, sale and/or abandonment and other adjustments including asset impairments.\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $9 million, or 1%, in 2021 when compared to 2020. The increase was mainly due to a higher depreciable asset base; partly offset by the positive translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar.\n\n## Equipment rents\n\nEquipment rents expense includes rental expense for the use of freight cars owned by other railroads (car hire) or private companies and for the lease of freight cars, locomotives and intermodal equipment, net of rental income from other railroads for the use of the Company's freight cars (car hire) and locomotives.\n\nEquipment rents expense decreased by $96 million, or 22%, in 2021 when compared to 2020. The decrease was mainly due to lower car hire expense as a result of price incentives on railcars and the positive translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar.\n\n## Casualty and other\n\nCasualty and other expense includes expenses for personal injuries, environmental, freight and property damage, insurance, bad debt, operating taxes, computer software and support costs, advisory fees related to shareholder matters as well as travel expenses.\n\nCasualty and other expense remained flat in 2021 when compared to 2020. Lower incident costs and the positive translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar were offset by an increase in insurance premiums and $20 million of advisory fees related to shareholder matters.\n\n## Loss (recovery) on assets held for sale\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, the Company recovered $137 million of the $486 million loss on assets held for sale recorded in the second quarter of 2020, resulting from the Company entering into an agreement for the sale of non-core lines. See Note 5 - Assets held for sale to the Company's 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Transaction-related costs\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company incurred transaction costs related to the terminated CN Merger Agreement of $84 million, consisting of $125 million of transaction-related costs; US$700 million ($845 million) paid to KCS; and the related refund received of US$700 million ($886 million) in the third quarter. See Note 3 - Acquisitions to the Company's 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Other income and expenses\n\n## Interest expense\n\nIn 2021, Interest expense was $610 million compared to $554 million in 2020. The increase was mainly due to amortization of bridge financing and other fees of $97 million; partly offset by a lower average level of debt and a positive translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar.\n\n## Other components of net periodic benefit income\n\nIn 2021, Other components of net periodic benefit income was $398 million compared to $315 million in 2020. The increase was mainly due to lower interest cost, partly offset by higher amortization of net actuarial loss and lower expected return on plan assets.\n\n## Merger termination fee\n\nIn 2021, the Company received a US$700 million ($886 million) termination fee resulting from KCS terminating the CN Merger Agreement and entering into a merger agreement with CP. See Note 3 - Acquisitions to the Company's 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Other income\n\nIn 2021, Other income was $43 million compared to $6 million in 2020. The increase was mainly due to fluctuations in the fair value of the equity investment in autonomous driving technology and higher gains on disposal of land.\n\n|",

Included in the 2020 figure was a current income tax recovery of $141 million recorded in the first quarter, resulting from the enactment of the CARES Act.\n\nOn March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the CARES Act, which included corporate income tax measures allowing U.S. federal net operating losses (NOLs) arising in tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020 to be fully carried back to each of the five tax years preceding the tax year of the NOL. As a result of the CARES Act, the Company reclassified its 2019 deferred income tax asset of $213 million on the NOL that arose in 2019, to a current income tax receivable and recorded a current income tax recovery of $141 million in 2020 to reflect an amount recoverable at the higher U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 35% applicable to pre-2018 tax years.\n\nThe effective tax rate for 2021 was 22.8% compared to 21.6% in 2020. Excluding the aforementioned income tax recovery, the adjusted effective tax rate for 2020 was 24.7%. (1) The decrease in the effective tax rate was mainly attributable to the merger termination fee, transaction-related costs, and bridge financing and other fees resulting from the KCS transaction recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income, taxed at a lower inclusion rate.\n\nFor 2022, the Company anticipates the estimated annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 24.0% to 25.0%.\n\n- (1) The adjusted effective tax rate is a Non-GAAP measure, defined as the effective tax rate adjusted to exclude the effect of the 2020 income tax recovery as it is not reflective of CN's underlying business operations. This measure does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to a similar measure presented by other companies.\n\n## 2020 compared to 2019\n\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $13,819 million compared to $14,917 million in 2019. The decrease of $1,098 million, or 7%, was mainly attributable to lower volumes across most commodity groups, primarily in the second and third quarter, caused by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lower applicable fuel surcharge rates, partly offset by freight rate increases as well as record shipments of Canadian grain.\n\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $9,042 million compared to $9,324 million in 2019. The decrease of $282 million, or 3%, was mainly due to lower fuel and labor costs and decreased purchased services and material expense; partly offset by a loss on assets held for sale, resulting from the Company's decision to market for sale for on-going rail operations, certain non-core lines.\n\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $816 million, or 15%, to $4,777 million. The decrease mainly reflects lower volumes across most commodity groups and a loss on assets held for sale, partly offset by freight rate increases and lower fuel prices. The operating ratio was 65.4% in 2020, compared to 62.5% in 2019.\n\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3,562 million, a decrease of $654 million, or 16%, when compared to 2019, and diluted earnings per share decreased by 14% to $5.00.\n\nThe Company generated record free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $3,227 million compared to $1,992 million in 2019. The increase of $1,235 million, or 62%, was mainly due to lower property additions in 2020 compared to the record 2019 capital expenditure program, lower income tax instalment payments and a U.S. tax refund received in 2020 as a result of the CARES Act, partly offset by lower earnings excluding non-cash items.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

Financial results at constant currency are obtained by translating the current period results denominated in US dollars at the weighted average foreign exchange rates used to translate transactions denominated in US dollars of the comparable period of the prior year.\n\nThe average foreign exchange rates were $1.34 and $1.33 per US$1.00, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nOn a constant currency basis, the Company's Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have been lower by $13 million ($0.02 per diluted share).\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the impact of constant currency and related percentage change at constant currency on the financial results, as reported for the year ended December 31, 2020:\n\n| In millions, except per share data              | Year ended December 31,   | 2020     | Constant  currency impact   | 2019    | % Change at  constant  currency  Fav (Unfav)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------|-----------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Revenues                                        |                           |          |                             |         |                                                |\n| Petroleum and chemicals                         |                           | $  2,631 | $  (16)  $                  | 3,052   | (14%)                                          |\n| Metals and minerals                             |                           | 1,409    | (9)                         | 1,643   | (15%)                                          |\n| Forest products                                 |                           | 1,700    | (12)                        | 1,808   | (7%)                                           |\n| Coal                                            |                           | 527      | (1)                         | 658     | (20%)                                          |\n| Grain and fertilizers                           |                           | 2,609    | (11)                        | 2,392   | 9%                                             |\n| Intermodal                                      |                           | 3,751    | (11)                        | 3,787   | (1%)                                           |\n| Automotive                                      |                           | 591      | (2)                         | 858     | (31%)                                          |\n| Total freight revenues                          |                           | 13,218   | (62)                        | 14,198  | (7%)                                           |\n| Other revenues                                  |                           | 601      | (5)                         | 719     | (17%)                                          |\n| Total revenues                                  |                           | 13,819   | (67)                        | 14,917  | (8%)                                           |\n| Operating expenses                              |                           |          |                             |         |                                                |\n| Labor and fringe benefits                       |                           | 2,723    | (9)                         | 2,922   | 7%                                             |\n| Purchased services and material                 |                           | 2,152    | (8)                         | 2,267   | 5%                                             |\n| Fuel                                            |                           | 1,152    | (7)                         | 1,637   | 30%                                            |\n| Depreciation and amortization                   |                           | 1,589    | (7)                         | 1,562   | (1%)                                           |\n| Equipment rents                                 |                           | 432      | (4)                         | 444     | 4%                                             |\n| Casualty and other                              |                           | 508      | (4)                         | 492     | (2%)                                           |\n| Loss (recovery) on assets held for sale         |                           | 486      | (6)                         | -

The decrease of $1,098 million, or 7%, was mainly attributable to lower volumes across most commodity groups, primarily in the second and third quarter, caused by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lower applicable fuel surcharge rates, partly offset by freight rate increases as well as record shipments of Canadian grain. Fuel surcharge revenues decreased by $330 million in 2020, mainly as a result of lower applicable fuel surcharge rates and lower volumes.\n\nIn 2020, RTMs declined by 5% relative to 2019. Freight revenue per RTM decreased by 2% in 2020 when compared to 2019, mainly driven by lower applicable fuel surcharge rates, partly offset by freight rate increases.\n\n## Petroleum and chemicals\n\n|                       | 2020     | 2019     | % Change   | % Change at constant currency   |\n|-----------------------|----------|----------|------------|---------------------------------|\n| Revenues  (millions)  | $  2,631 | $  3,052 | (14%)      | (14%)                           |\n| RTMs  (millions)      | 43,556   | 53,989   | (19%)      | (19%)                           |\n| Revenue/RTM  (cents)  | 6.04     | 5.65     | 7%         | 6%                              |\n| Carloads  (thousands) | 597      | 688      | (13%)      | (13%)                           |\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues for this commodity group decreased by $421 million, or 14%, when compared to 2019, mainly due to lower volumes of petroleum crude, chemicals and plastic products, refined petroleum products and natural gas liquids due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partly offset by liquidated damages relating to volume commitments under customer contracts.\n\nRevenue per RTM increased by 7% in 2020 when compared to 2019, mainly due to the decrease in the average length of haul and liquidated damages relating to volume commitments under customer contracts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

The decrease of $282 million, or 3%, was mainly due to lower fuel and labor costs and decreased purchased services and material expense; partly offset by a loss on assets held for sale, resulting from the Company's decision to market for sale for on-going rail operations, certain non-core lines.\n\nThe following table provides the components of total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\n| In millions                     | 2020     | 2019     | % Change   | % Change at constant currency  (1)   |\n|---------------------------------|----------|----------|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Labor and fringe benefits       | $  2,723 | $  2,922 | 7%         | 7%                                   |\n| Purchased services and material | 2,152    | 2,267    | 5%         | 5%                                   |\n| Fuel                            | 1,152    | 1,637    | 30%        | 30%                                  |\n| Depreciation and amortization   | 1,589    | 1,562    | (2%)       | (1%)                                 |\n| Equipment rents                 | 432      | 444      | 3%         | 4%                                   |\n| Casualty and other              | 508      | 492      | (3%)       | (2%)                                 |\n| Loss on assets held for sale    | 486      | -        | N/A        | N/A                                  |\n| Total operating expenses        | $  9,042 | $  9,324 | 3%         | 4%                                   |\n\n## Labor and fringe benefits\n\nLabor and fringe benefits expense decreased by $199 million, or 7%, in 2020 when compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower average headcount and the impact of the 2019 employee termination benefits and severance costs related to a workforce reduction program; partly offset by general wage increases, higher incentive compensation, and higher pension expense.\n\n## Purchased services and material\n\nPurchased services and material expense decreased by $115 million, or 5%, in 2020 when compared to 2019. The decrease was mainly due to lower costs for services purchased from outside contractors and lower material costs, driven by lower volumes.\n\n## Fuel\n\nFuel expense decreased by $485 million, or 30%, in 2020 when compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the favorable impact of lower fuel prices, lower volumes due to decreased workload, as measured by GTMs, as well as fuel efficiency gains, achieving a new record fuel efficiency.\n\n## Depreciation and amortization\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $27 million, or 2%, in 2020 when compared to 2019. The increase was mainly due to a higher depreciable asset base resulting from increased capital expenditures in recent years, partly offset by the impact of the 2019 expense of $84 million related to costs previously capitalized for a PTC back office system following the deployment of a replacement system.\n\n## Equipment rents\n\nEquipment rents expense decreased by $12 million, or 3%, in 2020 when compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower rail car lease costs driven by lower volumes, as well as lower car hire expense; partly offset by higher locomotive horsepower-hour expense.\n\n## Casualty and other\n\nCasualty and other expense increased by $16 million, or 3%, in 2020 when compared to 2019. The increase was mainly due to lower recoveries of costs from passenger trains using CN's system and higher property taxes, partly offset by lower travel expenses and legal provisions.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\nIn the second quarter of 2020, the Company recorded a loss of $486 million on assets held for sale, resulting from the Company's decision to market for sale for on-going rail operations, certain non-core lines in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ontario. See Note 5 - Assets held for sale to the Company's 2020 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the valuation of assets held for sale.\n\n|",

The increase was mainly due to a higher average level of debt, partly offset by a lower weighted-average interest rate.\n\n## Other components of net periodic benefit income\n\nIn 2020, Other components of net periodic benefit income was $315 million compared to $321 million in 2019. The decrease was mainly due to higher amortization of net actuarial loss, partly offset by lower interest cost.\n\n## Other income\n\nIn 2020, Other income was $6 million compared to $53 million in 2019, primarily due to lower gains on sale of land.\n\n## Income tax expense\n\nThe enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"U.S. Tax Reform\") in 2017 brought about significant tax law changes, which included a reduction to the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and allowed the immediate capital expensing of new investments in certain qualified depreciable assets which will be phased down starting in 2023. The U.S. Tax Reform also introduced the creation of a Base Erosion Anti-abuse Tax (BEAT) that subjects certain payments from U.S. corporations to foreign related parties to additional taxes, and limitations to the deduction for net interest expense incurred by U.S. corporations. Since the enactment of the U.S. Tax Reforms, U.S. authorities have issued various proposed and finalized regulations and guidance interpreting its provisions. These interpretations have been taken into account in calculating the Company's current year income tax provision and tax payments. The U.S. Tax Reform and these regulations are also expected to impact the Company's income tax provisions and tax payments in future years.\n\nOn March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the CARES Act, which included corporate income tax measures allowing U.S. federal net operating losses (NOLs) arising in tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020 to be fully carried back to each of the five tax years preceding the tax year of the NOL.\n\nIn 2020, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $982 million compared to an income tax expense of $1,213 million in 2019. Included in the 2020 figure was a current income tax recovery of $141 million recorded in the first quarter, resulting from the enactment of the CARES Act; the Company reclassified its 2019 deferred income tax asset of $213 million on the NOL that arose in 2019, to a current income tax receivable and recorded a current income tax recovery of $141 million to reflect an amount recoverable at the higher U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 35% applicable to pre-2018 tax years. Included in the 2019 figure was a deferred income tax recovery of $112 million recorded in the second quarter, resulting from the enactment of a lower provincial corporate income tax rate.\n\nThe effective tax rate for 2020 was 21.6% compared to 22.3% in 2019. Excluding the aforementioned income tax recoveries, the effective tax rate for 2020 was 24.7% compared to 24.4% in 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

Operating expenses reflect the impact of freight volumes, seasonal weather conditions, labor costs, fuel prices, and the Company's productivity initiatives. Fluctuations in the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar have also affected the conversion of the Company's US dollar-denominated revenues and expenses and resulted in fluctuations in Net income in the rolling eight quarters presented above.\n\n## Summary of fourth quarter 2021\n\nRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2021 increased by $97 million, or 3%, to $3,753 million, when compared to the same period in 2020. The increase was mainly attributable to higher applicable fuel surcharge rates, freight rate increases and an increase in intermodal ancillary services; partly offset by lower volumes of Canadian grain in terms of RTMs compared to record volumes in the fourth quarter of 2020, the impact of the B.C. washouts and the negative translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar. Fuel surcharge revenues increased by $177 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, mainly due to higher applicable fuel surcharge rates. RTMs in the fourth quarter of 2021 declined by 11% when compared to the same period in 2020. Freight revenue per RTM increased by 14% in the fourth quarter of 2021 when compared to the same period in 2020, mainly driven by a significant decrease in the average length of haul, higher applicable fuel surcharge rates and freight rate increases; partly offset by the negative translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar.\n\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2021 decreased by $58 million, or 3%, to $2,187 million, when compared to the same period in 2020. The decrease was mainly due to lower average headcount due to cost reduction initiatives and lower volumes, as well as the positive translation impact of a stronger Canadian dollar; partly offset by higher fuel costs.\n\nOperating income for the fourth quarter of 2021 increased by $155 million, or 11%, to $1,566 million, when compared to the same period in 2020. The increase mainly reflects higher applicable fuel surcharge rates, freight rate increases; partly offset by higher fuel costs and the negative translation impact of of a stronger Canadian dollar. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $1,579 million, an increase of $168 million, or 12%, when compared to the same period in 2020. (1)\n\nThe operating ratio was 58.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 61.4% in the fourth quarter of 2020, a 3.1-point improvement. The adjusted operating ratio was 57.9%, a fourth quarter record, compared to 61.4% in the fourth quarter of 2020, a 3.5-point improvement. (1)\n\nNet income for the fourth quarter 2021 was $1,199 million, an increase of $178 million, or 17%, when compared to the same period in 2020, and diluted earnings per share increased by 18% to $1.69. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $1,209 million, an increase of $188 million, or 18%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 20% to $1.71, when compared to the same period in 2020.

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Liquidity and capital resources\n\nThe Company's principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operations, which is supplemented by borrowings in the money markets and capital markets. To meet its short-term liquidity needs, the Company has access to various financing sources, including unsecured revolving credit facilities, equipment loans, commercial paper programs, and an accounts receivable securitization program. In addition to these sources, the Company can issue debt securities to meet its longer-term liquidity needs. The strong focus on cash generation from all sources gives the Company increased flexibility in terms of meeting its financing requirements.\n\nThe Company's primary short-term and long-term cash requirements are discussed below:\n\n- \u00b7 Short-term cash requirements: includes working capital requirements, such as labor and fringe benefits, fuel, income tax instalments, pension contributions, and contractual obligations; interest and principal payments on current debt financing; dividends; and share repurchases.\n- \u00b7 Long-term cash requirements: includes capital expenditures relating to track infrastructure and other, interest and principal repayments of long-term debt financing, operating and finance lease obligations; business acquisitions and long-term contractual obligations.\n\nThe Company sets priorities on its uses of available funds based on short-term operational requirements, expenditures to continue to operate a safe railway and pursue strategic initiatives, while also considering its long-term contractual obligations and returning value to its shareholders; and as part of its financing strategy, the Company regularly reviews its capital structure, cost of capital, and the need for additional debt financing. For a summary of short-term and long-term contractual obligations, including material cash requirements related to such obligations, refer to the table within the section titled Contractual obligations.\n\nAlthough the Company has a working capital surplus, a deficit is common in the capital-intensive rail industry, and is not an indication of a lack of liquidity. The Company maintains adequate resources to meet daily cash requirements, and has sufficient financial capacity to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and current obligations. As at December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had Cash and cash equivalents of $838 million and $569 million, respectively; Restricted cash and cash equivalents of $503 million and $531 million, respectively; and a working capital surplus of $306 million and a deficit $172 million, respectively (1) . The cash and cash equivalents pledged as collateral for a minimum term of one month pursuant to the Company's bilateral letter of credit facilities are recorded as Restricted cash and cash equivalents. There are currently no specific requirements relating to working capital other than in the normal course of business as discussed herein.\n\nThe Company's U.S. and other foreign subsidiaries maintain sufficient cash to meet their respective operational requirements. If the Company should require more liquidity in Canada than is generated by its domestic operations, the Company could decide to repatriate funds associated with undistributed earnings of its foreign operations, including its U.S. and other foreign subsidiaries. The impact on liquidity resulting from the repatriation of funds held outside Canada would not be significant as such repatriation of funds would not cause significant tax implications to the Company under the tax laws of Canada and the U.S. and other foreign tax jurisdictions, and the tax treaties currently in effect between them.\n\nThe Company expects cash from operations and its various sources of financing to be sufficient to meet its ongoing obligations. The Company is not aware of any trends or expected fluctuations in its liquidity that would impact its ongoing operations or financial condition as of the date of this MD&A.\n\n- (1)     Working capital is a Non-GAAP measure which management believes is a useful measure of liquidity. The Company defines working capital as current assets of $3,426 million (2020 - $3,102 million) less current liabilities of $3,120 million (2020 - $3,274 million). Working capital does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to a similar measure presented by other companies.\n\n## Available financing sources\n\n## Shelf prospectus and registration statement\n\nUnder its current shelf prospectus with Canadian securities regulators and registration statement with the SEC, the Company may issue up to $6.0 billion of debt securities in the Canadian and U.S. capital markets over the 25 months from the filing date, February 11, 2020.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, the remaining capacity of this shelf prospectus and registration statement was $5.2 billion. Access to the Canadian and U.S. capital markets under the shelf prospectus and registration statement is dependent on market conditions.\n\nThe Company's access to long-term funds in the capital markets depends on its credit ratings and market conditions. The Company believes that it continues to have access to the capital markets. If the Company were unable to borrow funds at acceptable rates in the capital markets, the Company could borrow under its credit facilities, draw down on its accounts receivable securitization program, raise cash by disposing of surplus properties or otherwise monetizing assets, reduce discretionary spending or take a combination of these measures to assure that it has adequate funding for its business.\n\n|",

On March 31, 2021, the Company's revolving credit facility agreement had been amended to extend the term of the credit facility by approximately two years and to adopt a sustainability linked loan structure whereby its applicable margins are adjusted upon achievement of certain sustainability targets, starting in 2022. The amended credit facility of $2.5 billion consists of a $1.25  billion tranche maturing on March 31, 2024 and a $1.25 billion tranche maturing on March 31, 2026. The credit facility provides for borrowings at various benchmark interest rates, including the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus applicable margins, based on CN's credit ratings and sustainability targets.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this revolving credit facility and there were no draws in 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Credit facilities\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2021, in connection with the proposed KCS transaction, the Company obtained commitments for a US$14.3 billion 364-day senior unsecured bridge loan facility and for a US$5 billion term loan credit agreement.\n\nOn September 15, 2021, upon termination of the CN Merger Agreement with KCS, the bridge loan facility and the term loan credit agreement were terminated. There were no draws in 2021.\n\n## Equipment loans\n\nThe Company has a non-revolving term loan credit facility for financing or refinancing the purchase of equipment, where US$300 million was available to be drawn upon through March 31, 2020 and US$310 million was available to be drawn upon through March 31, 2021 . The equipment loans made under the non-revolving credit facility have a tenor of 20 years, bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a margin, are repayable in equal quarterly installments, are prepayable at any time without penalty, and are secured by rolling stock.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding borrowings of US$572 million ($723 million) and had no further amount available under this non-revolving term loan facility. As at December 31, 2020, the Company had outstanding borrowings of US$289 million ($368 million) and had US$310 million available under this non-revolving term loan facility.\n\n## Commercial paper\n\nThe Company has a commercial paper program in Canada and in the U.S. Both programs are backstopped by the Company's revolving credit facility. The maximum aggregate principal amount of commercial paper that can be issued is $2 billion, or the US dollar equivalent, on a combined basis. The commercial paper programs, which are subject to market rates in effect at the time of financing, provide the Company with a flexible financing alternative, and can be used for general corporate purposes. The cost of commercial paper and access to the commercial paper market in Canada and the U.S. are dependent on credit ratings and market conditions. If the Company were to lose access to its commercial paper program for an extended period of time, the Company could rely on its $2.5 billion revolving credit facility to meet its short-term liquidity needs.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had total commercial paper borrowings of US$111 million ($140 million) and US$44 million ($56 million), respectively, presented in Current portion of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Accounts receivable securitization program\n\nThe Company has an agreement to sell an undivided co-ownership interest in a revolving pool of accounts receivable to unrelated trusts for maximum cash proceeds of $450 million. On December 20, 2021, the Company extended the term of its agreement by one year to February 1, 2024. The trusts are multi-seller trusts and the Company is not the primary beneficiary. Funding for the acquisition of these assets is customarily through the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper notes by the unrelated trusts.\n\nThe Company has retained the responsibility for servicing, administering and collecting the receivables sold. The average servicing period is approximately one month and the interest on borrowings under the Accounts receivable securitization program is renewed based on commercial paper or LIBOR rates then in effect. Subject to customary indemnifications, each trust's recourse is limited to the accounts receivable transferred.\n\nThe accounts receivable securitization program provides the Company with readily available short-term financing for general corporate use. In the event the program is terminated before its scheduled maturity, the Company expects to meet its future payment obligations through its various sources of financing including its revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program, and/or access to capital markets.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, and 2020 the Company had no borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization program and there were no activities in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

On March 31, 2021, the Company extended the maturity date of the committed bilateral letter of credit facility agreements to April 28, 2024. The agreements are held with various banks to support the Company's requirements to post letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. Under these agreements, the Company has the option from time to time to pledge collateral in the form of cash or cash equivalents, for a minimum term of one month, equal to at least the face value of the letters of credit issued.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding letters of credit of $394 million (2020 - $421 million) under the committed facilities from a total available amount of $518 million (2020 - $492 million) and $158 million (2020 - $165 million) under the uncommitted facilities.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, included in Restricted cash and cash equivalents was $396 million (2020 - $424 million) and $100 million (2020 $100 million) pledged as collateral under the committed and uncommitted bilateral letter of credit facilities, respectively.\n\nAdditional information relating to the Company's financing sources is provided in Note 15 - Debt to the Company's 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Credit ratings\n\nThe Company's ability to access funding in the debt capital markets and the cost and amount of funding available depends in part on its credit ratings.

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Free cash flow\n\nFree cash flow is a useful measure of liquidity as it demonstrates the Company's ability to generate cash for debt obligations and for discretionary uses such as payment of dividends, share repurchases and strategic opportunities. The Company defines its free cash flow measure as the difference between net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing activities, adjusted for the impact of business acquisitions and merger transaction-related payments and cash receipts, which are items that are not indicative of operating trends. Free cash flow does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Net cash provided by operating activities in accordance with GAAP, as reported for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, to the non-GAAP free cash flow presented herein:\n\n| In millions                                   | Year ended December 31,   | 2021     | 2020     | 2019     |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Net cash provided by operating activities     |                           | $  6,971 | $  6,165 | $  5,923 |\n| Net cash used in investing activities         |                           | (2,873)  | (2,946)  | (4,190)  |\n| Net cash provided before financing activities |                           | 4,098    | 3,219    | 1,733    |\n| Adjustments:                                  |                           |          |          |          |\n| Transaction-related costs  (1)                |                           | 125      | -        | -        |\n| Advance for acquisition  (2)                  |                           | 845      | -        | -        |\n| Refund of advance for acquisition             |                           | (886)    | -        | -        |\n| Merger termination fee                        |                           | (886)    | -        | -        |\n| Acquisition, net of cash acquired  (3)        |                           | -        | 8        | 259      |\n| Total adjustments                             |                           | $  (802) | $  8     | $  259   |\n| Free cash flow                                |                           | $  3,296 | $  3,227 | $  1,992 |\n\n## Operating activities\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $806 million in 2021 when compared to 2020, mainly due to higher cash earnings, primarily resulting from the merger termination fee of $886 million received from KCS.\n\n## Pension contributions\n\nThe Company's contributions to its various defined benefit pension plans are made in accordance with the applicable legislation in Canada and the U.S. and such contributions follow minimum and maximum thresholds as determined by actuarial valuations. Pension contributions for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 of $127 million and $115 million, respectively, primarily represent contributions to the CN Pension Plan, for the current service cost as determined under the Company's current actuarial valuations for funding purposes. Based on the anticipated results of the Company's next actuarial valuations for funding purposes, the CN Pension Plan is expected to be fully funded and at a level such that the Company would be prohibited from making contributions to the CN Pension Plan once the actuarial valuation report is filed in 2022. As such, the Company expects to make total cash contributions of approximately $70 million for all pension plans in 2022.\n\nSee the section of this MD&A entitled Critical accounting estimates - Pensions and other postretirement benefits for additional information pertaining to the funding of the Company's pension plans. Additional information relating to the pension plans is provided in Note 17 - Pensions and other postretirement benefits to the Company's 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Income tax payments\n\nThe Company is required to make scheduled instalment payments as prescribed by the tax authorities. In Canada, the Company's domestic jurisdiction, tax instalments in a given year are generally based on the prior year's taxable income whereas in the U.S., the Company's predominant foreign jurisdiction, they are based on forecasted taxable income of the current year.\n\nIn 2021, net income tax payments were $759 million (2020 - $353 million). The increase was mainly due to the $329 million income tax refund received in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to the carryback of U.S. federal net operating losses permitted under the CARES Act.\n\nFor 2022, the Company's net income tax payments are expected to be approximately $1.25 billion. The increase is primarily due to higher required instalment payments caused by the merger termination fee and higher pre-tax income.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple\n\nManagement believes that the adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple is a useful credit measure because it reflects the Company's ability to service its debt and other long-term obligations. The Company calculates the adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple as adjusted debt divided by the last twelve months of adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted debt is defined as the sum of Long-term debt and Current portion of long-term debt as reported on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as well as Operating lease liabilities, including current portion and pension plans in deficiency recognized on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets due to the debt-like nature of their contractual and financial obligations. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Net income excluding Interest expense, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization, operating lease cost, Other components of net periodic benefit income, Other income, and other significant items that are not reflective of CN's underlying business operations and which could distort the analysis of trends in business performance. Adjusted debt and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures used to compute the Adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple. These measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of debt and Net income in accordance with GAAP, reported as at and for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, to adjusted debt and adjusted EBITDA, which have been used to calculate the non-GAAP adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple:\n\n| In millions, unless otherwise indicated                      | As at and for the year ended December 31,                    | 2021      | 2020      | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|--------|\n| Debt                                                         | Debt                                                         | $  12,485 | $  12,906 | 13,796 |\n| Adjustments:                                                 | Adjustments:                                                 |           |           |        |\n| Operating lease liabilities, including current portion   (1) | Operating lease liabilities, including current portion   (1) | 430       | 418       | 501    |\n| Pension plans in deficiency  (2)                             | Pension plans in deficiency  (2)                             | 447       | 553       | 521    |\n| Adjusted debt                                                | Adjusted debt                                                | $  13,362 | $  13,877 | 14,818 |\n| Net income $                                                 | Net income $                                                 | 4,892     | $  3,562  | 4,216  |\n| Interest expense                                             | Interest expense                                             | 610       | 554       | 538    |\n| Income tax expense                                           | Income tax expense                                           | 1,441     | 982       | 1,213  |\n| Depreciation and amortization                                | Depreciation and amortization                                | 1,598     | 1,589     | 1,562  |\n| Operating lease cost  (3)                                    | Operating lease cost  (3)                                    | 131       | 143       | 171    |\n| Other components of net periodic benefit income              | Other components of net periodic benefit income              | (398)     | (315)     | (321)  |\n| Other income                                                 | Other income                                                 | (43)      | (6)       | (53)   |\n| Adjustments:                                                 | Adjustments:                                                 |           |           |        |\n| Workforce reduction program  (4)                             | Workforce reduction program  (4)                             | 39        | -         | 31     |\n| Advisory fees related to shareholder matters  (5)            | Advisory fees related to shareholder matters  (5)            | 20        | -         | -      |\n| Loss (recovery) on assets held for sale                      | Loss (recovery) on assets held for sale                      | (137)     | 486       | -      |\n| Transaction-related costs                                    | Transaction-related costs                                    | 84        | -         | -      |\n| Merger termination fee                                       | Merger termination fee                                       | (886)     | -         | -      |\n| Adjusted EBITDA  (6)                                         | Adjusted EBITDA  (6)                                         | $  7,351  | $  6,995  | 7,357  |\n| Adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple  (times)           | Adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple  (times)           | 1.82      | 1.98      | 2.01   |\n\nAll forward-looking statements discussed in this section are subject to risks and uncertainties and are based on assumptions about events and developments that may not materialize or that may be offset entirely or partially by other events and developments.

These include, but are not limited to, standby letters of credit, surety and other bonds, and indemnifications that are customary for the type of transaction or for the railway business. As at December 31, 2021, the Company has not recorded a liability with respect to guarantees and indemnifications. Additional information relating to guarantees and indemnifications is provided in Note 21 - Major commitments and contingencies to the Company's 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Outstanding share data\n\nAs at February 1, 2022, the Company had 699.8 million common shares and 3.9 million stock options outstanding.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\n## Risk management\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to various risks from its use of financial instruments. To manage these risks, the Company follows a financial risk management framework, which is monitored and approved by the Company's Audit, Finance and Risk Committee, with a goal of maintaining a strong balance sheet, optimizing earnings per share and free cash flow, financing its operations at an optimal cost of capital and preserving its liquidity. The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments in the management of its risks and does not hold or issue them for trading or speculative purposes.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk arises from cash and temporary investments, accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments. To manage credit risk associated with cash and temporary investments, the Company places these financial assets with governments, major financial institutions, or other creditworthy counterparties, and performs ongoing reviews of these entities. To manage credit risk associated with accounts receivable, the Company reviews the credit history of each new customer, monitors the financial condition and credit limits of its customers, and keeps the average daily sales outstanding within an acceptable range. The Company works with customers to ensure timely payments, and in certain cases, requires financial security, including letters of credit. CN also obtains credit insurance for certain high risk customers. Although the Company believes there are no significant concentrations of customer credit risk, economic conditions can affect the Company's customers and can result in an increase to the Company's credit risk and exposure to business failures of its customers. A widespread deterioration of customer credit and business failures of customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity. The Company considers the risk due to the possible non-performance by its customers to be remote.\n\nThe Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments, however from time to time, it may enter into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. To manage the counterparty risk associated with the use of derivative financial instruments, the Company enters into contracts with major financial institutions that have been accorded investment grade ratings. Though the Company is exposed to potential credit losses due to non-performance of these counterparties, the Company considers this risk to be remote.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that sufficient funds will not be available to satisfy financial obligations as they come due. In addition to cash generated from operations, which represents its principal source of liquidity, the Company manages liquidity risk by aligning other external sources of funds which can be obtained upon short notice, such as revolving credit facilities, commercial paper programs, and an accounts receivable securitization program. As well, the Company can issue debt securities in the Canadian and U.S. capital markets under its shelf prospectus and registration statement. The Company's access to long-term funds in the debt capital markets depends on its credit ratings and market conditions. The Company believes that its investment grade credit ratings contribute to reasonable access to capital markets. See the section of this MD&A entitled Liquidity and capital resources for additional information relating to the Company's available financing sources and its credit ratings.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Company conducts its business in both Canada and the U.S. and as a result, is affected by currency fluctuations. Changes in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the US dollar affect the Company's revenues and expenses. To manage foreign currency risk, the Company designates US dollar-denominated debt of the parent company as a foreign currency hedge of its net investment in foreign operations. As a result, from the dates of designation, foreign exchange gains and losses on translation of the Company's US dollardenominated debt are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, which minimizes volatility of earnings resulting from the conversion of US dollar-denominated debt into the Canadian dollar.\n\nThe Company also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk. As at December 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts with a notional value of US$910 million (2020 - US$397 million) at a weighted-average exchange rate of $1.27 per US$1.00 (2020 - $1.32 per US$1.00) for a weighted-average term of 251 days (2020 - 151 days). Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts, resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates, are recognized in Other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income as they occur. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a loss of $18 million (2020 - loss of $3 million; 2019 - loss of $75 million), related to foreign exchange forward contracts. These losses were largely offset by the re-measurement of US dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities recognized in Other income. As at December 31, 2021, the fair value of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts included in Other current assets and Accounts payable and other was $nil and $2 million, respectively (2020 - $nil and $18 million, respectively).\n\nThe estimated annual impact on Net income of a one-cent change in the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar is approximately $30 million.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk, which is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will vary as a result of changes in market interest rates. Such risk exists in relation to the Company's debt. The Company mainly issues fixed-rate debt, which exposes the Company to variability in the fair value of the debt. The Company also issues debt with variable interest rates, which exposes the Company to variability in interest expense.\n\nTo manage interest rate risk, the Company manages its borrowings in line with liquidity needs, maturity schedule, and currency and interest rate profile. In anticipation of future debt issuances, the Company may use derivative instruments such as forward rate agreements. The Company does not currently hold any significant derivative instruments to manage its interest rate risk.\n\nThe estimated annual impact on Net income of a one-percent change in the interest rate on floating rate debt is approximately $9 million.\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to commodity price risk related to purchases of fuel and the potential reduction in Net income due to increases in the price of diesel. Fuel prices are impacted by geopolitical events, changes in the economy or supply disruptions. Fuel shortages can occur due to refinery disruptions, production quota restrictions, climate, and labor and political instability.\n\nThe Company manages fuel price risk by offsetting the impact of rising fuel prices with the Company's fuel surcharge program. The surcharge applied to customers is determined in the second calendar month prior to the month in which it is applied, and is generally calculated using the average monthly price of On-Highway Diesel, and, to a lesser extent, West-Texas Intermediate crude oil.\n\nWhile the Company's fuel surcharge program provides effective coverage, residual exposure remains given that fuel price risk cannot be completely managed due to timing and given the volatility in the market. As such, the Company may enter into derivative instruments to manage such risk when considered appropriate.\n\n## Fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe financial instruments that the Company measures at fair value on a recurring basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition are categorized into the following levels of the fair value hierarchy based on the degree to which inputs are observable:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: Inputs are quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets\n- \u00b7 Level 2: Significant inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are observable\n- \u00b7 Level 3: Significant inputs are unobservable\n\nThe carrying amounts of Cash and cash equivalents and Restricted cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value. These financial instruments include highly liquid investments purchased three months or less from maturity, for which the fair value is determined by reference to quoted prices in active markets.\n\nThe carrying amounts of Accounts receivable, Other current assets and Accounts payable and other approximate fair value due to their short maturity, unless otherwise specified. The fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values, included in Intangible assets, goodwill and other, is classified as Level 1 with gains and losses being recorded in Other income within the Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of derivative financial instruments, included in Other current assets and Accounts payable and other is classified as\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

The fair value is measured by discounting future cash flows using a discount rate derived from market data for financial instruments subject to similar risks and maturities. The fair value of assets held for sale, included in Other current assets is classified as Level 3. Additional disclosures are provided in Note 5 - Assets held for sale to the Company's 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe carrying amount of the Company's debt does not approximate fair value. The fair value is estimated based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt instruments, as well as discounted cash flows using current interest rates for debt with similar terms, company rating, and remaining maturity. The Company classifies debt as Level 2. As at December 31, 2021, the Company's debt, excluding finance leases, had a carrying amount of $12,475 million (2020 - $12,832 million) and a fair value of $14,424 million (2020 - $16,046 million).\n\n## Recent accounting pronouncements\n\nThe following recent Accounting Standards Update (ASU) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) came into effect in 2020, was amended in 2021 and has not been adopted by the Company:\n\n## ASU 2020-04 Reference rate reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting and related amendments\n\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a benchmark interest rate referenced in a variety of agreements that are used by all types of entities. The administrator of LIBOR has ceased the publication of one week and two month USD LIBOR rates on January 1, 2022 and intends to discontinue the remaining USD LIBOR rates immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023.\n\nThe ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. These transactions include contract modifications, hedging relationships, and sale or transfer of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity.\n\nThe ASU was effective starting on March 12, 2020, and is available to be adopted on a prospective basis no later than December 31, 2022, when the reference rate replacement activity is expected to be completed. The Company currently has outstanding loans referencing LIBOR, that were not impacted by the administrator of LIBOR ceasing publication of one week and two month USD LIBOR rates, totaling US$572 million that would be affected by the provisions of this ASU. The Company also has a revolving credit facility and an accounts receivable securitization program that reference LIBOR (See Note 15 -Debt to the Company's 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company had no outstanding borrowing under these credit facilities as at December 31, 2021. The Company has fallback language to allow for the succession of a clearly defined alternative reference rate within the contracts that reference LIBOR. The Company is evaluating the effects that the adoption of the ASU will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures, and whether it will elect to apply any of the optional expedients and exceptions provided in the ASU.\n\nOther recently issued ASUs required to be applied on or after December 31, 2021 have been evaluated by the Company and are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates based upon available information. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The Company's policies for income taxes, capital expenditures, depreciation, pensions and other postretirement benefits, personal injury and other claims and environmental matters, require management's more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements and, as such, are considered to be critical. The following information should be read in conjunction with the Company's 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.\n\nManagement discusses the development and selection of the Company's critical accounting policies, including the underlying estimates and assumptions, with the Audit, Finance and Risk Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. The Audit, Finance and Risk Committee has reviewed the Company's related disclosures.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Income taxes\n\nThe Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, the change in the net deferred income tax asset or liability is included in the computation of Net income or Other comprehensive income (loss). Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. As a result, a projection of taxable income is required for those years, as well as an assumption of the ultimate recovery/settlement period for temporary differences. The projection of future taxable income is based on management's best estimate and may vary from actual taxable income.\n\nOn an annual basis, the Company assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance for its deferred income tax assets, and if it is deemed more likely than not that its deferred income tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income, of the necessary character, during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, the available carryback and carryforward periods, and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. As at December 31, 2021, in order to fully realize all of the deferred income tax assets, the Company will need to generate future taxable income of approximately $2.2 billion, and, based upon the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income of the necessary character over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, and the reversal of taxable temporary differences, management believes, following an assessment of the current economic environment, it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences.\n\nIn addition, Canadian, or domestic, tax rules and regulations, as well as those relating to foreign jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and require judgment by the Company that may be challenged by the taxation authorities upon audit of the filed income tax returns. Tax benefits are recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxation authorities. As at December 31, 2021, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $64 million, before considering tax treaties and other arrangements between taxation authorities. The amount of net unrecognized tax benefits as at December 31, 2021 was $47 million. If recognized, $12 million of the net unrecognized tax benefits as at December 31, 2021 would affect the effective tax rate.\n\nThe Company believes that it is reasonably possible that $14 million of the net unrecognized tax benefits as at December 31, 2021 related to Canadian and U.S. federal, state, and provincial income tax matters, each of which are individually insignificant, may be recognized over the next twelve months as a result of settlements and a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations, and will not significantly affect the effective tax rate as they mostly relate to temporary differences.\n\nThe Company's deferred income tax assets are mainly composed of temporary differences related to lease liabilities, the pension liability, accruals for personal injury and other claims, net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, compensation reserves, and other postretirement benefits liability. The Company's deferred income tax liabilities are mainly composed of temporary differences related to properties, the pension asset and operating lease right-of-use assets. These deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded at the enacted tax rates of the periods in which the related temporary differences are expected to reverse. As a result, fiscal budget changes and/or changes in income tax laws that affect a change in the timing, the amount, and/or the income tax rate at which the temporary difference components will reverse, could materially affect deferred income tax expense as recorded in the Company's results of operations. The reversal of temporary differences is expected at future-enacted income tax rates which could change due to fiscal budget changes and/or changes in income tax laws. As a result, a change in the timing and/or the income tax rate at which the components will reverse, could materially affect deferred income tax expense as recorded in the Company's results of operations. From time to time, the federal, provincial, and state governments enact new corporate income tax rates resulting in either lower or higher tax liabilities. A one-percentage-point change in the Canadian and U.S. statutory federal tax rate would have the effect of changing the deferred income tax expense by $205 million and $141 million in 2021, respectively.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $1,441 million, of which $511 million was a deferred income tax expense.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $982 million, of which $487 million was a deferred income tax expense. The current income tax expense included a recovery of $141 million resulting from the enactment of the CARES Act.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $1,213 million, of which $569 million was a deferred income tax expense. The deferred income tax expense included a recovery of $112 million resulting from the enactment of a lower provincial corporate income tax rate.\n\nThe Company's net deferred income tax liability as at December 31, 2021 was $9,303 million (2020 - $8,271 million). Additional disclosures are provided in Note 7 - Income taxes to the Company's 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Depreciation\n\nProperties are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation including asset impairment write-downs. The Company has a process in place to determine whether or not costs qualify for capitalization, which requires judgment. The cost of properties, including those under finance leases, net of asset impairment write-downs, is depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated service lives, measured in years, except for rail and ballast whose services lives are measured in millions of gross tons. The Company follows the group method of depreciation whereby a single composite depreciation rate is applied to the gross investment in a class of similar assets, despite small differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same asset class. The Company uses approximately 40 different depreciable asset classes.\n\nFor all depreciable assets, the depreciation rate is based on the estimated service lives of the assets. Assessing the reasonableness of the estimated service lives of properties requires judgment and is based on currently available information, including periodic depreciation studies conducted by the Company. The Company's U.S. properties are subject to comprehensive depreciation studies as required by the STB and are conducted by external experts. Depreciation studies for Canadian properties are not required by regulation and are conducted internally. Studies are performed on specific asset groups on a periodic basis. Changes in the estimated service lives of the assets and their related composite depreciation rates are implemented prospectively.\n\nThe studies consider, among other factors, the analysis of historical retirement data using recognized life analysis techniques, and the forecasting of asset life characteristics. Changes in circumstances, such as technological advances, changes to the Company's business strategy, changes in the Company's capital strategy or changes in regulations can result in the actual service lives differing from the Company's estimates.\n\nA change in the remaining service life of a group of assets, or their estimated net salvage value, will affect the depreciation rate used to amortize the group of assets and thus affect depreciation expense as reported in the Company's results of operations. A change of one year in the composite service life of the Company's fixed asset base would impact annual depreciation expense by approximately $66 million.\n\nDepreciation studies are a means of ensuring that the assumptions used to estimate the service lives of particular asset groups are still valid and where they are not, they serve as the basis to establish the new depreciation rates to be used on a prospective basis. In 2021, the Company completed depreciation studies for road properties and as a result, the Company changed the estimated service lives for various types of road assets and their related composite depreciation rates. The results of these depreciation studies did not materially affect the Company's annual depreciation expense.\n\nGiven the nature of the railroad and the composition of its network which is made up of homogeneous long-lived assets, it is impractical to maintain records of specific properties at their lowest unit of property.\n\nRetirements of assets occur through the replacement of an asset in the normal course of business, the sale of an asset or the abandonment of a section of track. For retirements in the normal course of business, generally the life of the retired asset is within a reasonable range of the expected useful life, as determined in the depreciation studies, and, as such, no gain or loss is recognized under the group method. The asset's cost is removed from the asset account and the difference between its cost and estimated related accumulated depreciation (net of salvage proceeds), if any, is recorded as an adjustment to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. The historical cost of the retired asset is estimated by using deflation factors or indices that closely correlate to the properties comprising the asset classes in combination with the estimated age of the retired asset using a first-in, first-out approach, and applying it to the replacement value of the asset.\n\nIn each depreciation study, an estimate is made of any excess or deficiency in accumulated depreciation for all corresponding asset classes to ensure that the depreciation rates remain appropriate. The excess or deficiency in accumulated depreciation is amortized over the remaining life of the asset class.\n\nFor retirements of depreciable properties that do not occur in the normal course of business, the historical cost, net of salvage proceeds, is recorded as a gain or loss in income. A retirement is considered not to be in the normal course of business if it meets the following criteria: (i) it is unusual, (ii) it is significant in amount, and (iii) it varies significantly from the retirement pattern identified through depreciation studies. A gain or loss is recognized in Other income for the sale of land or disposal of assets that are not part of railroad operations.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded total depreciation expense of $1,593 million (2020 - $1,583 million; 2019 $1,559 million). As at December 31, 2021, the Company had Properties of $41,178 million, net of accumulated depreciation of $15,093 million (2020 - $40,069 million, net of accumulated depreciation of $14,443 million). Additional disclosures are provided in Note 11 - Properties to the Company's 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nGAAP requires the use of historical cost as the basis of reporting in financial statements. As a result, the cumulative effect of inflation, which has significantly increased asset replacement costs for capital-intensive companies such as CN, is not reflected in operating expenses. Depreciation charges on an inflation-adjusted basis, assuming that all operating assets are replaced at current price levels, would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts.\n\n|",

The following table provides the Company's pension asset, pension liability and other postretirement benefits liability as at December 31, 2021, and 2020:\n\n| In millions                                  | 2021     | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------|--------|\n| Pension asset                                | $  3,050 | $  777 |\n| Pension liability                            | $  447   | $  553 |\n| Other postretirement benefits liability  (1) | $  212   | $  228 |\n\nThe descriptions in the following paragraphs pertaining to pensions relate generally to the Company's main pension plan, the CN Pension Plan, unless otherwise specified.\n\n## Curtailment event\n\nOn October 31, 2021, the CN Board of Directors approved changes affecting non-unionized members participating in the Company's defined benefit pension plans. Effective April 1, 2024, the affected defined benefit pension plans will be amended to cease benefits accruals for nonunionized members, generally known as a delayed hard freeze. Effective April 1, 2024, all non-unionized members will be transferred to the Company's defined contribution pension plans for their future service. This delayed hard freeze constitutes a plan curtailment event recognized on October 31, 2021 resulting in a $52 million reduction to the Projected benefit obligation, recorded in Other comprehensive income as an actuarial gain, mostly due to reflecting projected future salary increases and service only up to April 1, 2024. The curtailment event also triggered an interim re-measurement of the funded status of the affected defined benefit pension plans resulting in an actuarial gain of $1,915 million recorded in Other comprehensive income composed of i) an actuarial gain on the Projected benefit obligation of $1,808 million substantially all due to the 84 basis point increase in the end of period discount rate between the prior year end (2.55%) and October 31, 2021 (3.39%), and ii) an actuarial gain on the Plan assets of $107 million due to higher actual returns ($982 million) compared to expected returns ($875 million) over that same ten-month period. Due to the interim re-measurement, the resulting Net periodic benefit income recorded during the fourth quarter of 2021 increased by $25 million composed of i) a decrease to Current service cost of $9 million, and ii) an increase to Other components of net periodic benefit income of $16 million.\n\n## Calculation of net periodic benefit cost (income)\n\nIn accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, assumptions are required for, among other things, the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increase, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, employee early retirements, terminations and disability. Changes in these assumptions result in actuarial gains or losses, which are recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss). The Company generally amortizes these gains or losses into net periodic benefit cost (income) over the expected average remaining service life of the employee group covered by the plans only to the extent that the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses are in excess of the corridor threshold, which is calculated as 10% of the greater of the beginning-of-year balances of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets. The Company's net periodic benefit cost (income) for future periods is dependent on demographic experience, economic conditions and investment performance. Recent demographic experience has revealed no material net gains or losses on termination, retirement, disability and mortality. Experience with respect to economic conditions and investment performance is further discussed herein.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the consolidated net periodic benefit cost (income) for pensions and other postretirement benefits were as follows:\n\n| In millions                                                 | 2021     | 2020     | 2019     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Net periodic benefit income for pensions                    | $  (201) | $  (141) | $  (183) |\n| Net periodic benefit cost for other postretirement benefits | $  2     | $  3     | $  7     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nAs at December 31, 2021 and 2020, the projected pension benefit obligation and accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation were as follows:\n\n| In millions                                         | 2021      | 2020      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Projected pension benefit obligation                | $  17,813 | $  19,499 |\n| Accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation | $  212    | $  228    |\n\n## Discount rate assumption\n\nThe Company's discount rate assumption, which is set annually at the end of each year, is determined by management with the aid of thirdparty actuaries. The discount rate is used to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with a rating of AA or better, would provide the necessary cash flows to pay for pension benefits as they become due. For the Canadian pension and other postretirement benefit plans, future expected benefit payments are discounted using spot rates based on a derived AA corporate bond yield curve for each maturity year. A year-end discount rate of 3.15% based on bond yields prevailing at December 31, 2021 (2020 - 2.55%) was considered appropriate by the Company.\n\nThe Company uses the spot rate approach to measure current service cost and interest cost for all defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Under the spot rate approach, individual spot discount rates along the same yield curve used in the determination of the projected benefit obligation are applied to the relevant projected cash flows for current service cost at the relevant maturity. More specifically, current service cost is measured using the cash flows related to benefits expected to be accrued in the following year by active members of a plan and interest cost is measured using the projected cash flows making up the projected benefit obligation multiplied by the corresponding spot discount rate at each maturity.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, a 0.25% decrease in the 3.15% discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation would have resulted in a decrease of approximately $545 million to the funded status for pensions and would result in a decrease of approximately $20 million to the 2022 projected net periodic benefit income. A 0.25% increase in the discount rate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $515 million to the funded status for pensions and would result in an increase of approximately $20 million to the 2022 projected net periodic benefit income.\n\n## Expected long-term rate of return assumption\n\nThe expected long-term rate of return is determined based on expected future performance for each asset class and is weighted based on the investment policy. Consideration is taken of the historical performance, the premium return generated from an actively managed portfolio, as well as current target asset allocations, published market return expectations, economic developments, inflation rates and administrative expenses. Based on these factors, the rate is determined by the Company. For the January to October and November to December periods of 2021, the Company used a long-term rate of return assumption of 6.75% and 7.00% respectively on the market-related value of plan assets prevailing for those same periods to compute net periodic benefit cost (income). The Company has elected to use a market-related value of assets whereby realized and unrealized gains/losses and appreciation/depreciation in the value of the investments are recognized over a period of five years, while investment income is recognized immediately. The increase to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 25 basis points to 7.00% for the November to December period of 2021 reflects management's current view of long-term investment returns. In 2022, the Company will maintain the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.00% as management's current view of long-term investment returns remains unchanged from what was existing on October 31, 2021.\n\nThe assets of the Company's various plans are primarily held in separate trust funds (\"Trusts\") which are diversified by asset type, country, sector and investment strategy. Each year, the CN Board of Directors reviews and confirms or amends the Statement of Investment Policies and Procedures (\"SIPP\") which includes the plans' long-term target asset allocation (\"Policy\") and related benchmark indices. This Policy is based on the long-term expectations of the economy and financial market returns and considers the dynamics of the plans' benefit obligations. In 2021, the Policy was amended to implement a target asset allocation change to bonds and mortgages, emerging market debt, private debt, resource and royalties (formerly oil and gas) and absolute return. In addition, the specialty portfolio was approved as a new investment strategy.These changes were taken into account in the determination of the Company's expected long-term rate of return assumption. In 2021, the Policy was: 2% cash and short-term investments, 37% bonds and mortgages, 2% emerging market debt, 3% private debt, 35% equities, 4% real estate, 5% resource and royalties, 4% infrastructure, 2% specialty portfolio, 12% absolute return investments and negative 6% for investment-related liabilities.\n\nAnnually, the CN Investment Division (\"Investment Manager\"), a division of the Company created to invest and administer the assets of the plans, can also implement an investment strategy (\"Strategy\") which can lead the Plan's actual asset allocation to deviate from the Policy due to changing market risks and opportunities. The Pension and Investment Committee of the Board of Directors (\"Committee\") regularly compares the actual plan asset allocation to the Policy and Strategy and compares the actual performance of the Company's pension plan assets to the performance of the benchmark indices.\n\n|",

The SIPP allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to implement strategies, to hedge and to adjust existing or anticipated exposures. The SIPP prohibits investments in securities of the Company or its subsidiaries.\n\nThe actual, market-related value and expected rates of return on plan assets for the last five years were as follows:\n\n|                      | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Actual               | 8.7%   | 12.5%  | 12.2%  | (2.4%) | 9.2%   |\n| Market-related value | 8.0%   | 7.1%   | 6.1%   | 5.7%   | 9.1%   |\n| Expected             | 6.79%  | 7.00%  | 7.00%  | 7.00%  | 7.00%  |\n\nThe Company's expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects management's view of long-term investment returns and the effect of\n\na 1% variation in such rate of return would result in a change to the net periodic benefit cost (income) of approximately $100 million. Management's assumption of the expected long-term rate of return is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual rate of return to differ materially from management's assumption. There can be no assurance that the plan assets will be able to earn the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.\n\n## Net periodic benefit income for pensions for 2022\n\nIn 2022, the Company expects net periodic benefit income to be $291 million (2021 - $201 million) for all its defined benefit pension plans.\n\n## Plan asset allocation\n\nBased on the fair value of the assets held as at December 31, 2021, the assets of the Company's various plans are comprised of 2% in cash and short-term investments, 37% in bonds and mortgages, 2% in emerging market debt, 3% in private debt, 40% in equities, 2% in real estate, 5% in resource and royalties, 3% in infrastructure, 2% in specialty portfolio, 11% in absolute return investments, 1% in alternative risk premia investments and negative 8% in investment-related liabilities. See Note 17 - Pensions and other postretirement benefits to the Company's 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the fair value measurements of such assets.\n\nA significant portion of the plans' assets are invested in publicly traded equity securities whose return is primarily driven by stock market performance. Debt securities also account for a significant portion of the plans' investments and provide a partial offset to the variation in the pension benefit obligation that is driven by changes in the discount rate. The funded status of the plan fluctuates with market conditions and impacts funding requirements. The Company will continue to make contributions to the pension plans that as a minimum meet pension legislative requirements.\n\n## Rate of compensation increase\n\nThe rate of compensation increase is determined by the Company based upon its long-term plans for such increases. For 2021, a basic rate of compensation increase of 2.75% was used to determine the projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost (income).\n\n## Mortality\n\nThe Canadian Institute of Actuaries (CIA) published in 2014 a report on Canadian Pensioners' Mortality (\"Report\"). The Report contained Canadian pensioners' mortality tables and improvement scales based on experience studies conducted by the CIA. The CIA's conclusions were taken into account in selecting management's best estimate mortality assumption used to calculate the projected benefit obligation as at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Funding of pension plans\n\nThe Company's main Canadian defined benefit pension plan, the CN Pension Plan, accounts for 93% of the Company's pension obligation and can produce significant volatility in pension funding requirements, given the pension fund's size, the many factors that drive the plan's funded status, and Canadian statutory pension funding requirements. Adverse changes to the assumptions used to calculate the plan's funding status, particularly the discount rate used for funding purposes, as well as changes to existing federal pension legislation, regulation and guidance could significantly impact the Company's future contributions.\n\nFor accounting purposes, the funded status is calculated under generally accepted accounting principles for all pension plans. For funding purposes, the funded status is also calculated under going concern and solvency scenarios as prescribed under pension legislation and subject to guidance issued by the CIA and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (\"OSFI\") for all registered Canadian defined benefit pension plans. The Company's funding requirements are determined upon completion of actuarial valuations. Actuarial valuations are generally required on an annual basis for all Canadian defined benefit pension plans, or when deemed appropriate by the OSFI. Actuarial valuations are also required annually for the Company's U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nThe Company's most recently filed actuarial valuations for funding purposes for its Canadian registered defined pension plans conducted as at December 31, 2020 indicated a funding excess on a going concern basis of approximately $3.4 billion and a funding excess on a solvency basis of approximately $0.4 billion, calculated using the three-year average of the plans' hypothetical wind-up ratio in accordance with the Pension Benefit Standards Regulations, 1985 . The federal pension legislation requires funding deficits, if any, to be paid over a number of years, as calculated under current pension regulations. Alternatively, a letter of credit can be subscribed to fulfill required solvency deficit payments.\n\nIn November 2021, the OSFI issued a revised instruction guide for the Preparation of Actuarial Reports for Defined Benefit Pension Plans (\"Guide\") to be used for the December 31, 2021 actuarial valuations. The revised Guide is not expected to have a significant impact on the solvency status of the Company's defined benefit pension plans, and is not expected to trigger additional pension contributions in 2022.\n\nThe Company's next actuarial valuations for funding purposes for its Canadian registered defined benefit pension plans required as at December 31, 2021 will be performed in 2022. These actuarial valuations are expected to identify a funding excess on a going concern basis of approximately $3.9 billion, while on a solvency basis a funding excess of approximately $1.1 billion is expected.\n\nBased on the anticipated results of these valuations, the CN Pension Plan is expected to be fully funded and at a level such that the Company would be prohibited from making contributions to the CN Pension Plan once the actuarial valuation report is filed in 2022. As such, the Company expects to make total cash contributions of approximately $70 million for all of the Company's pension plans in 2022. The Company expects cash from operations and its other sources of financing to be sufficient to meet its 2022 funding obligations.\n\n## Information disclosed by major pension plan\n\nThe following table provides the Company's plan assets by category, projected benefit obligation at end of year, as well as Company and employee contributions by major defined benefit pension plan:\n\n| In millions                                 | December 31, 2021   | CN  Pension Plan   | BC Rail  Pension Plan   | U.S. and other plans   | Total     |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|-----------|\n| Plan assets by category                     |                     |                    |                         |                        |           |\n| Cash and short-term investments             |                     | $  395             | $  11                   | 4                      | $  410    |\n| Bonds                                       |                     | 6,882              | 352                     | 205                    | 7,439     |\n| Mortgages                                   |                     | 19                 | -                       | -                      | 19        |\n| Emerging market debt                        |                     | 357                | 6                       | 2                      | 365       |\n| Private debt                                |                     | 705                | 14                      | 4                      | 723       |\n| Public equities                             |                     | 7,679              | 133                     | 98                     | 7,910     |\n| Private equities                            |                     | 610                | 12                      | 3                      | 625       |\n| Real estate                                 |                     | 361                | 7                       | 2                      | 370       |\n| Resource and royalties                      |                     | 954                | 19                      | 5                      | 978       |\n| Infrastructure                              |                     | 638                | 13                      | 3                      | 654       |\n| Absolute return                             |                     | 2,325              | 40                      | 12                     | 2,377     |\n| Alternative risk premia                     |                     | 234                | 4                       | 1                      | 239       |\n| Total investments                           |                     | 21,159             | 611                     | 339                    | 22,109    |\n| Investment-related liabilities  (1)         |                     | (1,741)            | (30)                    | (9)                    | (1,780)   |\n| Other  (2)                                  |                     | 67                 | 4                       | 16                     | 87        |\n| Total plan assets                           |                     | $  19,485          | $  585                  | 346                    | $  20,416 |\n| Projected benefit obligation at end of year |                     | $  16,557          | $  464                  | 792                    | $  17,813 |\n| Company contributions in 2021               |                     | $  81              | $  -                    | 23                     | $  104    |\n| Employee contributions in 2021              |                     | $  61              | $  -                    | -                      | $  61     |\n\nAdditional disclosures are provided in Note 17 - Pensions and other postretirement benefits to the Company's 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Personal injury and other claims\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company becomes involved in various legal actions seeking compensatory and occasionally punitive damages, including actions brought on behalf of various purported classes of claimants and claims relating to employee and third-party personal injuries, occupational disease and property damage, arising out of harm to individuals or property allegedly caused by, but not limited to, derailments or other accidents.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Canada\n\nEmployee injuries are governed by the workers' compensation legislation in each province whereby employees may be awarded either a lump sum or a future stream of payments depending on the nature and severity of the injury. As such, the provision for employee injury claims is discounted. In the provinces where the Company is self-insured, costs related to employee work-related injuries are accounted for based on actuarially developed estimates of the ultimate cost associated with such injuries, including compensation, health care and third-party administration costs. An actuarial study is generally performed at least on a triennial basis. For all other legal actions, the Company maintains, and regularly updates on a case-by-case basis, provisions for such items when the expected loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimated based on currently available information.\n\nIn 2021, 2020 and 2019 the Company recorded a decrease of $11 million, $13 million and $7 million, respectively, to its provision for personal injuries in Canada as a result of actuarial valuations for employee injury claims.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company's provision for personal injury and other claims in Canada was as follows:\n\n| In millions                   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Beginning of year             | $  206 | $  207 | $  207 |\n| Accruals and other            | 12     | 31     | 29     |\n| Payments                      | (36)   | (32)   | (29)   |\n| End of year                   | $  182 | $  206 | $  207 |\n| Current portion - End of year | $  50  | $  68  | $  55  |\n\nThe assumptions used in estimating the ultimate costs for Canadian employee injury claims include, among other factors, the discount rate, the rate of inflation, wage increases and health care costs. The Company periodically reviews its assumptions to reflect currently available information. Over the past three years, the Company has not had to significantly change any of these assumptions. Changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect Casualty and other expense as reported in the Company's results of operations.\n\nFor all other legal claims in Canada, estimates are based on the specifics of the case, trends and judgment.\n\n## United States\n\nPersonal injury claims by the Company's employees, including claims alleging occupational disease and work-related injuries, are subject to the provisions of the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA). Employees are compensated under FELA for damages assessed based on a finding of fault through the U.S. jury system or through individual settlements. As such, the provision is undiscounted. With limited exceptions where claims are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, the Company follows an actuarial-based approach and accrues the expected cost for personal injury, including asserted and unasserted occupational disease claims, and property damage claims, based on actuarial estimates of their ultimate cost. An actuarial study is performed annually.\n\nFor employee work-related injuries, including asserted occupational disease claims, and third-party claims, including grade crossing, trespasser and property damage claims, the actuarial valuation considers, among other factors, the Company's historical patterns of claims filings and payments. For unasserted occupational disease claims, the actuarial valuation includes the projection of the Company's experience into the future considering the potentially exposed population. The Company adjusts its liability based upon management's assessment and the results of the study. On an ongoing basis, management reviews and compares the assumptions inherent in the latest actuarial valuation with the current claim experience and, if required, adjustments to the liability are recorded.\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainty involved in projecting future events, including events related to occupational diseases, which include but are not limited to, the timing and number of actual claims, the average cost per claim and the legislative and judicial environment, the Company's future payments may differ from current amounts recorded.\n\nIn 2021, the Company recorded a decrease of $20 million to its provision for U.S. personal injury and other claims attributable to nonoccupational disease claims, third-party claims and occupational disease claims pursuant to the 2021 actuarial valuation. In 2020 and 2019, actuarial valuations resulted in a decrease of $10 million and an increase of $2 million, respectively. The prior years' adjustments from the actuarial valuations were mainly attributable to non-occupational disease claims, occupational disease claims and third-party claims, reflecting changes in the Company's estimates of unasserted claims and costs related to asserted claims. The Company has an ongoing risk mitigation strategy focused on reducing the frequency and severity of claims through injury prevention and containment; mitigation of claims; and lower settlements of existing claims.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company's provision for personal injury and other claims in the U.S. was as follows:\n\n| In millions                   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Beginning of year             | $  141 | $  145 | $  139 |\n| Accruals and other            | 30     | 28     | 44     |\n| Payments                      | (45)   | (29)   | (31)   |\n| Foreign exchange              | (1)    | (3)    | (7)    |\n| End of year                   | $  125 | $  141 | $  145 |\n| Current portion - End of year | $  25  | $  41  | $  36  |\n\nFor the U.S. personal injury and other claims liability, historical claim data is used to formulate assumptions relating to the expected number of claims and average cost per claim for each year. Changes in any one of these assumptions could materially affect Casualty and other expense as reported in the Company's results of operations. A 5% change in the asbestos average claim cost would result in an increase or decrease in the liability recorded of approximately $1 million and a 1% change in the inflation trend rate for all injury types would result in an increase or decrease in the liability recorded of approximately $2 million.\n\n## Environmental matters\n\n## Known existing environmental concerns\n\nThe Company is or may be liable for remediation costs at individual sites, in some cases along with other potentially responsible parties, associated with actual or alleged contamination. The ultimate cost of addressing these known contaminated sites cannot be definitively established given that the estimated environmental liability for any given site may vary depending on the nature and extent of the contamination; the nature of anticipated response actions, taking into account the available clean-up techniques; evolving regulatory standards governing environmental liability; and the number of potentially responsible parties and their financial viability. As a result, liabilities are recorded based on the results of a four-phase assessment conducted on a site-by-site basis. A liability is initially recorded when environmental assessments occur, remedial efforts are probable, and when the costs, based on a specific plan of action in terms of the technology to be used and the extent of the corrective action required, can be reasonably estimated. The Company estimates the costs related to a particular site using cost scenarios established by external consultants based on the extent of contamination and expected costs for remedial efforts. In the case of multiple parties, the Company accrues its allocable share of liability taking into account the Company's alleged responsibility, the number of potentially responsible parties and their ability to pay their respective share of the liability. Adjustments to initial estimates are recorded as additional information becomes available.\n\nThe Company's provision for specific environmental sites is undiscounted and includes costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as monitoring costs. Environmental expenses, which are classified as Casualty and other in the Consolidated Statements of Income, include amounts for newly identified sites or contaminants as well as adjustments to initial estimates. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company's provision for specific environmental sites was as follows:\n\n| In millions                   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Beginning of year             | $  59  | $  57  | $  61  |\n| Accruals and other            | 23     | 44     | 31     |\n| Payments                      | (26)   | (42)   | (34)   |\n| Foreign exchange              | -      | -      | (1)    |\n| End of year                   | $  56  | $  59  | $  57  |\n| Current portion - End of year | $  38  | $  46  | $  38  |\n\nThe Company anticipates that the majority of the liability at December 31, 2021 will be paid out over the next five years. Based on the information currently available, the Company considers its provisions to be adequate.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Unknown existing environmental concerns\n\nWhile the Company believes that it has identified the costs likely to be incurred for environmental matters based on known information, the discovery of new facts, future changes in laws, the possibility of releases of hazardous materials into the environment and the Company's ongoing efforts to identify potential environmental liabilities that may be associated with its properties may result in the identification of additional environmental liabilities and related costs. The magnitude of such additional liabilities and the costs of complying with future environmental laws and containing or remediating contamination cannot be reasonably estimated due to many factors, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the lack of specific technical information available with respect to many sites;\n- \u00b7 the absence of any government authority, third-party orders, or claims with respect to particular sites;\n- \u00b7 the potential for new or changed laws and regulations and for development of new remediation technologies and uncertainty regarding the timing of the work with respect to particular sites; and\n- \u00b7 the determination of the Company's liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties and the ability to recover costs from any third parties with respect to particular sites.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of any such costs being incurred or whether such costs would be material to the Company cannot be determined at this time. There can thus be no assurance that liabilities or costs related to environmental matters will not be incurred in the future, or will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year, or that the Company's liquidity will not be adversely impacted by such liabilities or costs, although management believes, based on current information, that the costs to address environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or liquidity. Costs related to any unknown existing or future contamination will be accrued in the period in which they become probable and reasonably estimable.\n\n## Future occurrences\n\nIn railroad and related transportation operations, it is possible that derailments or other accidents, including spills and releases of hazardous materials, may occur that could cause harm to human health or to the environment. As a result, the Company may incur costs in the future, which may be material, to address any such harm, compliance with laws and other risks, including costs relating to the performance of cleanups, payment of environmental penalties and remediation obligations, and damages relating to harm to individuals or property.\n\n## Regulatory compliance\n\nThe Company may incur significant capital and operating costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance and clean-up requirements, in its railroad operations and relating to its past and present ownership, operation or control of real property. Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed unless they relate to an improvement to the property. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and which are not expected to contribute to current or future operations are expensed. Operating expenses related to regulatory compliance activities for environmental matters for the year ended December 31, 2021 amounted to $27 million (2020 - $25 million; 2019 - $25 million). For 2022, the Company expects to incur operating expenses relating to environmental matters in the same range as 2021. In addition, based on the results of its operations and maintenance programs, as well as ongoing environmental audits and other factors, the Company plans for specific capital improvements on an annual basis. Certain of these improvements help ensure facilities, such as fueling stations, waste water and storm water treatment systems, comply with environmental standards and include new construction and the updating of existing systems and/or processes. Other capital expenditures relate to assessing and remediating certain impaired properties. The Company's environmental capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2021 amounted to $18 million (2020 $20 million; 2019 - $25 million). For 2022, the Company expects to incur capital expenditures relating to environmental matters in the same range as 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Business risks\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to various business risks and uncertainties that can have an effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. While some exposures may be reduced by the Company's risk management strategies, many risks are driven by external factors beyond the Company's control or are of a nature which cannot be eliminated. The key areas of business risks and uncertainties described in this section are not the only ones that can affect the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to management or that may currently not be considered material by management, could nevertheless also have an adverse effect on the Company's business.\n\n## Pandemic risk and economic downturn\n\nSevere disruptions in regional economies and the world economy can be caused by the outbreak of a contagious illness, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. The transmission of COVID-19 and efforts to contain its spread have resulted in international, national and local border closings, travel restrictions, significant disruptions to business operations, supply chains, customer activity and demand, service cancellations, reductions and other changes, significant challenges in healthcare service preparation and delivery, and quarantines, as well as considerable general concern and uncertainty, all of which have negatively affected the economic environment and may in the future have further impacts. It is not possible to predict what additional measures and restrictions will be imposed by governmental authorities and the period in time during which those measures and restrictions will apply. Economic and supply chain disruptions, including temporary staff shortages resulting from the pandemic, could further materially affect the Company's financial results and operations. The COVID-19 pandemic could also further and significantly impact freight demand and commodity prices in connection with ensuing economic disruption, supply shortages, trade disruption, temporary staff shortages and temporary closures of facilities in geographic locations more importantly impacted by the outbreak. The scope and severity of such disruptions and their impact on the Company's financial results and operations have been, and may continue to be material.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe Company faces significant competition, including from rail carriers and other modes of transportation, and is also affected by its customers' flexibility to select among various origins and destinations, including ports, in getting their products to market. Specifically, the Company faces competition from CP, which operates the other major rail system in Canada and services most of the same industrial areas, commodity resources and population centers as the Company; major U.S. railroads and other Canadian and U.S. railroads; long-distance trucking companies, transportation via the St. Lawrence-Great Lakes Seaway and the Mississippi River and transportation via pipelines. In addition, while railroads must build or acquire and maintain their rail systems, motor carriers and barges are able to use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by public entities without paying fees covering the entire costs of their usage.\n\nCompetition is generally based on the quality and the reliability of the service provided, access to markets, as well as price. Factors affecting the competitive position of customers, including exchange rates and energy cost, could materially adversely affect the demand for goods supplied by the sources served by the Company and, therefore, the Company's volumes, revenues and profit margins. Factors affecting the general market conditions for the Company's customers can result in an imbalance of transportation capacity relative to demand. An extended period of supply/demand imbalance could negatively impact market rate levels for all transportation services, and more specifically the Company's ability to maintain or increase rates. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations or financial position.\n\nPrevious consolidation of rail systems in the U.S. have resulted in larger rail systems that are in a position to compete effectively with the Company in numerous markets.\n\nOn September 15, 2021, KCS entered into a merger agreement with CP and filed an amended notice of intent to file a merger application. On September 30, 2021, the STB found that the agency's prior voting trust approval for CP and KCS would apply to the voting trust described in the amended notice. On November 23, 2021, the STB accepted the joint CP-KCS merger application as complete and set a procedural schedule for comments opposing the merger and seeking conditions. On December 14, 2021, CP acquired and deposited the securities of KCS into a voting trust. On January 12, 2022, CN filed a description of anticipated responsive application to provide notice that it intends to seek a condition requiring CP and KCS to divest the KCS lines between Kansas City, Missouri and Springfield, Illinois/East St. Louis, Illinois. CN expects to file its application on February 28, 2022. If the merger is approved, this may impact the Company's competitive position.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete effectively against current or future competitors in the transportation industry, or that further consolidation within the transportation industry and legislation allowing for more leniency in size and weight for motor carriers will not adversely affect the Company's competitive position. No assurance can be given that competitive pressures in transportation markets will not lead to reduced revenues, profit margins or both.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Environmental matters\n\nThe Company's operations are subject to numerous federal, provincial, state, municipal and local environmental laws and regulations in Canada and the U.S. concerning, among other things, emissions into the air; discharges into waters; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste, hazardous substances and other materials; decommissioning of underground and aboveground storage tanks; and soil and groundwater contamination. A risk of environmental liability is inherent in railroad and related transportation operations; real estate ownership, operation or control; and other commercial activities of the Company with respect to both current and past operations. As a result, the Company incurs significant operating and capital costs, on an ongoing basis, associated with environmental regulatory compliance and clean-up requirements in its railroad operations and relating to its past and present ownership, operation or control of real property.\n\nWhile the Company believes that it has identified the costs likely to be incurred for environmental matters in the next several years based on known information, the discovery of new facts, future changes in laws, the possibility of releases of hazardous materials into the environment and the Company's ongoing efforts to identify potential environmental liabilities that may be associated with its properties may result in the identification of additional environmental liabilities and related costs.\n\nIn railroad and related transportation operations, it is possible that derailments or other accidents, including spills and releases of hazardous materials, may occur that could cause harm to human health or to the environment. In addition, the Company is also exposed to potential catastrophic liability risk, faced by the railroad industry in general, in connection with the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard materials such as chlorine and anhydrous ammonia, or other dangerous commodities such as crude oil and propane that the Company may be required to transport as a result of its common carrier obligations. Therefore, the Company may incur costs in the future, which may be material, to address any such harm, compliance with laws or other risks, including costs relating to the performance of clean-ups, payment of environmental penalties and remediation obligations, and damages relating to harm to individuals or property.\n\nThe environmental liability for any given contaminated site varies depending on the nature and extent of the contamination; the available clean-up techniques; evolving regulatory standards governing environmental liability; and the number of potentially responsible parties and their financial viability. As such, the ultimate cost of addressing known contaminated sites cannot be definitively established. Also, additional contaminated sites yet unknown may be discovered or future operations may result in accidental releases.\n\nWhile some exposures may be reduced by the Company's risk mitigation strategies (including periodic audits, employee training programs, emergency plans and procedures, and insurance), many environmental risks are driven by external factors beyond the Company's control or are of a nature which cannot be completely eliminated. Therefore, there can be no assurance, notwithstanding the Company's mitigation strategies, that liabilities or costs related to environmental matters will not be incurred in the future or that environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity, or reputation.\n\n## Personal injury and other claims\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company becomes involved in various legal actions seeking compensatory and occasionally punitive damages, including actions brought on behalf of various purported classes of claimants and claims relating to employee and third-party personal injuries, occupational disease, and property damage, arising out of harm to individuals or property allegedly caused by, but not limited to, derailments or other accidents. The Company maintains provisions for such items, which it considers to be adequate for all of its outstanding or pending claims and benefits from insurance coverage for occurrences in excess of certain amounts. The final outcome with respect to actions outstanding or pending at December 31, 2021, or with respect to future claims, cannot be predicted with certainty, and therefore there can be no assurance that their resolution will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity, in a particular quarter or fiscal year.\n\n## Labor negotiations\n\nThe working conditions of the Company's unionized workforce are governed by collective agreements which are negotiated from time to time. Disputes relating to the renewal of collective agreements could potentially result in strikes, lockouts, slowdown of the business and ultimately loss of business. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to renew and have its collective agreements ratified without a strike or lockout or that the resolution of these negotiations will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results or financial position. Future labor agreements could increase labor and fringe benefits and related expenses.\n\n## Canadian workforce\n\nOn September 13, 2021, the Company served notice to commence bargaining for the renewal of the collective agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) governing approximately 700 signals and communications workers, which expired on December 31, 2021. The collective agreement remains in effect until the parties reach a new collective agreement.\n\nOn December 1, 2021, CN filed an application with the Canadian Industrial Relations Board pursuant to Section 18.1. of the Canada Labor Code to review the current bargaining unit structure applicable to running trades on its Canadian railway. There are currently 12 bargaining units, and 16 collective agreements covering Locomotive Engineers and Conductors. CN believes that this structure is no longer appropriate for\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

A consolidated unit of Locomotive Engineers and Conductors governed by one collective agreement will address these issues and would be a more appropriate bargaining unit structure. The timeline for a decision from the Canadian Industrial Relations Board is uncertain at this time.\n\n## U.S. workforce\n\nAs of February 1, 2022, collective agreements covering all non-operating and operating craft employees at Grand Trunk Western Railroad Company (GTW), companies owned by Illinois Central Corporation (ICC), companies owned by Wisconsin Central Ltd. (WC) and Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad Company (BLE), and all employees at Pittsburgh and Conneaut Dock Company (PCD) were ratified and remain in place. The agreements in place have various moratorium provisions, which preserve the status quo with respect to the given collective agreement during the terms of such moratoriums. Where negotiations are ongoing, the terms and conditions of existing agreements generally continue to apply until new agreements are reached or the processes of the Railway Labor Act have been exhausted.\n\nThe general approach to labor negotiations by U.S. Class I railroads is to bargain on a collective national basis with the industry, which GTW, ICC, WC and BLE currently participate in, for collective agreements covering all non-operating and operating employees, with the exception of two employee groups working at PCD covering fewer than 35 employees. The national bargaining negotiations are underway.\n\n## Regulation\n\nIn order to facilitate the continued movement of goods during the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory agencies in the U.S. and Canada have issued waivers or exemptions to railway companies providing relief from the strict application of some regulations. These reliefs were provided to facilitate social distancing and compliance with other constraints associated with the COVID-19 pandemic that would prevent railways from complying with requirements in a manner consistent with existing provisions.\n\n## Economic regulation - Canada\n\nThe Company's rail operations in Canada are subject to economic regulation by the Canadian Transportation Agency under the Canada Transportation Act , which provides rate and service remedies, including final offer arbitration, long-haul interswitching rates and mandatory interswitching. It also regulates the maximum revenue entitlement for the movement of regulated grain, charges for railway ancillary services and noise-related disputes. In addition, various Company business transactions must gain prior regulatory approval, with attendant risks and uncertainties, and the Company is subject to government oversight with respect to rate, service and business practice issues.\n\nNo assurance can be given that any current or future regulatory or legislative initiatives by the Canadian federal government and agencies will not materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or its competitive and financial position.\n\n## Economic regulation - U.S.\n\nThe Company's U.S. rail operations are subject to economic regulation by the STB. The STB serves as both an adjudicatory and regulatory body and has jurisdiction over certain railroad rate and service issues and rail restructuring transactions such as mergers, line sales, line construction and line abandonments. As such, various Company business transactions must gain prior regulatory approval and aspects of its pricing and service practices may be subject to challenge, with attendant risks and uncertainties. Recent proceedings undertaken by the STB in a number of significant matters remain pending.\n\nThe Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 (PRIIA) required Amtrak and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to jointly promulgate the PRIIA performance standards. The prior metrics were vacated and the arbitration provision in the statute was severed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. On November 16, 2020, the FRA adopted metrics for measuring performance, which included non-binding dispute resolution for schedules that are disputed. In April 2021, CN provided notice to Amtrak concerning which passenger schedules are ready to be certified and which are to be disputed. As part of PRIIA, U.S. Congress authorized the STB to investigate any railroad over whose track Amtrak operates that fails to meet the performance standards under PRIIA and the STB is authorized to assess damages against the host railroad. On April 15, 2021, the Company provided notice to Amtrak that passenger schedules for certain trains hosted by Illinois Central and Grand Trunk Western are disputed. Disputing schedules is the first step of a non-binding dispute resolution process with Amtrak. For the schedules that the Company disputed, the Company proposed schedules for Amtrak's consideration and offered to continue working with Amtrak. Amtrak has stated that eight schedules are disputed and 18 schedules are certified.\n\nOn December 30, 2020, the STB instituted a rulemaking proceeding to consider a petition by three Class I railroads to change the Board's procedures for determining annually which Class I railroads are revenue adequate by examining the railroads in comparison to the performance of S&P 500 companies. On February 4, 2021, the Board requested comments on the petition as well as responses to specific questions posed by the Board. The railroads filed their responses to the questions, and comments have been filed. Reply comments were due on August 16, 2021.\n\n|",

The Company previously obtained approval from FRA to conduct the test program in April 2020. The test program has been extended to November 23, 2022. On November 23, 2021, the FRA granted the Company's request to move from Phase 2 to Phase 3 of the Company's automated track inspection test program.\n\nOn July 9, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy. The order affirms the policy to enforce antitrust laws to oppose excessive industry concentration and abuse of market power. The order establishes a White House Competition Counsel. The order encourages the Chair of the STB to consider several steps, including rulemakings on reciprocal switching and competitive access. The Chairman of the STB encouraged Board members to reform competitive access policies; increase customer visibility into first mile/last mile, and increase the availability of rate relief methods in instances where a railroad has market dominance.\n\nIn 2019, the STB proposed rules to establish a new rate case method for smaller cases known as Final Offer Rate Review. On November 15, 2021, the STB issued a supplemental proposed rulemaking to invite comments on certain modifications to the new final offer rate reasonableness procedure proposed by the STB in 2019. Comments are due in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nOn November 12, 2021, the STB announced that it will hold a public hearing on March 15, 2022 and March 16, 2022 concerning a proposal by the STB in 2016 to amend its regulations regarding reciprocal switching. Written testimony and comments are due on February 14, 2022.\n\nOn November 15, 2021, the STB proposed rules to modify its regulations and establish a voluntary arbitration program for small rate disputes in response to a joint petition for rulemaking filed by five Class I railroads, including the Company. On December 29, 2021, the STB denied a request by shipper associations to hold the proceeding in abeyance. Comments are due in the first and second quarters of 2022.\n\nOn November 23, 2021, the STB instituted a proceeding to consider a proposal by shipper associations to adopt regulations governing railroads' use of private freight cars to assess a \"private railcar delay charge\" when a private railcar does not move for more than 72 consecutive hours between when it is released for transportation and the time it is placed. The STB will issue a future decision with procedures for further public comment.\n\nNo assurance can be given that these and any other current or future regulatory or legislative initiatives by the U.S. federal government and agencies will not materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or its competitive and financial position.\n\n## Safety regulation - Canada\n\nThe Company's rail operations in Canada are subject to safety regulation by the Minister under the Railway Safety Act as well as the rail portions of other safety-related statutes, which are administered by Transport Canada. The Company may be required to transport toxic inhalation hazard materials as a result of its common carrier obligations and, as such, is also subject to additional regulatory oversight in Canada. The Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act , also administered by Transport Canada, establishes the safety requirements for the transportation of goods classified as dangerous and enables the adoption of regulations for security training and screening of personnel working with dangerous goods, as well as the development of a program to require a transportation security clearance for dangerous goods, the tracking of dangerous goods during transport and the development of an emergency response plan.\n\nOn October 6, 2020, Transport Canada issued new Passenger Rail Security Regulations, with their provisions coming into force in sequence. These regulations required passenger railway and host companies to effectively manage their security risks by implementing riskbased security practices, including security awareness training, security risk assessments, security plans and security inspections by July 6, 2021, the designation of a rail security coordinator and security incident reporting by October 6, 2021 and security plan training and security exercises by January 6, 2022. CN has implemented all requirements applicable to its operations.\n\nOn February 22, 2021, the Minister approved revisions to the Rules Respecting Key Trains and Key Routes proposed by the Canadian railway industry in response to the request to do so issued on April 1, 2020. The speed of key trains carrying dangerous goods is based on cold temperature conditions and depends on the safety measures implemented by railway companies to be detailed into a Winter Operation Risk Mitigation Plan. The maximum speed also varies based on the type of railway signal and traffic control systems present on the railway networks, which take into account the substantial investments made to equip main line tracks with automated signaling technology, on which the vast majority of CN's traffic is handled. In addition, the new rules require railways to have in place a maintenance and inspection plan for permanent rail joints and temporary rail joints. Considering that speed restrictions applicable to a single category of trains nevertheless affect the speed of all trains operating on a rail network, the revised rules allow CN to maintain normal speed operations unless the conditions require speed restrictions in the interest of safety. The revisions came into force on August 22, 2021.\n\nOn March 10, 2021, the Minister issued two orders respecting railway uncontrolled movements. The first order imposes special interim procedures aimed at reducing the risks of uncontrolled movements. The second order requires the Canadian railway industry to revise existing rules to incorporate design and performance parameters for locomotives with roll-away protection, to develop a precise definition of attended versus unattended equipment as well as incorporate requirements on the use of roll-away protection to reduce the risks of an uncontrolled movement. The revisions must be filed with the Minister by March 10, 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nOn May 31, 2021, the Minister of Transport approved changes to the Rules Respecting Track Safety, which specify safety requirements that railway companies must follow when inspecting and maintaining their railway track infrastructure. As a result of the new changes to the Rules, railway companies will be required to put in place a certification process for employees who inspect tracks and supervise the restoration of tracks to make sure their personnel have the proper knowledge and experience to carry out their safety duties. Railway companies must also establish a process to ensure that track maintenance and repair work meets regulatory requirements and the railway companies' own standards to improve accountability. Finally, railway companies must develop and implement comprehensive plans to manage rail wear and the condition of the rail surface, which are to be approved by a professional engineer to improve the integrity of railway tracks. These new rules came into force on February 1, 2022.\n\nOn July 9 and 11, 2021, Transport Canada issued orders pursuant to the Railway Safety Act in response to wildfires in British Columbia. In addition to requiring the implementation of specific measures aimed at reducing the risk of fires and improving their detection, the Order directed railway companies to complete and implement a Final Extreme Weather Fire Risk Mitigation Plan (\"Final Plan\") within 60 days following the issuance of these orders. In accordance with this requirement, CN filed its Final Plan on September 9, 2021. This Final Plan addresses fire detection, monitoring and response measures and was prepared after consulting municipal and other levels of local government, including Indigenous government or other Indigenous governing bodies. On October 14, 2021, the Transportation Safety Board confirmed that its investigation of the Lytton fire had not revealed any evidence to link railway operations to the fire.\n\nOn July 30, 2021, Transport Canada issued Ministerial Order 21-04 pursuant to the Railway Safety Act . This Order provides for reporting requirements respecting the occurrence of an emergency brake application that occurs when a train is stopped on heavy or mountain grade. Initially made mandatory between July 1, 2020 and July 1, 2021, the requirements began to apply again under the Order on September 1, 2021, and last for 12 months until September 1, 2022.\n\nOn July 30, 2021, Transport Canada approved amendments to the Canadian Railway Operating Rules proposed by the Railway Association of Canada on behalf of its members. The amendments prescribe: 1) when air brakes must be used during switching operations (i.e. process of rearranging rail cars in a train yard) to ensure a consistent approach across the railway system; 2) measures to ensure that stationary equipment is secured during switching operations to prevent uncontrolled movements; and 3) speed restrictions when switching is conducted with a remotely controlled locomotive. The new provisions are designed to improve safety and prevent uncontrolled movement while conducting switching operations, and to ensure that equipment is properly secured while switching.\n\nTransport Canada issued an order effective October 30, 2021 requiring employers in the federally regulated rail sectors to either establish mandatory vaccination policies for all employees in their organizations or require rail crew and track employees submit to rigorous testing protocols. Each railway that implements a mandatory vaccination policy must include a provision for employee attestation/declaration of their vaccination status; include a description of consequences for employees who do not comply or who falsify information; and meet standards consistent with the approach taken by the Government of Canada for the Core Public Administration. After November 15, 2021, each railway is required to guarantee employees have at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine or they will be unable to work. All employees were required to be fully vaccinated by January 24, 2022.\n\nOn November 15, 2021, CN filed with Transport Canada its Winter Operation Risk Mitigation Plan in accordance with the Rules Respecting Key Trains and Key Routes. This Plan deals with specific measures associated with the movement of trains carrying crude oil or liquefied petroleum gases.\n\nOn November 25, 2020, the Minister approved the new Duty and Rest Period Rules for Operating Employees subject to conditions clarifying some aspects of the Rules. In accordance with the new Rules, CN filed with Transport Canada on November 25, 2021, its Fatigue Management Plan containing an extensive set of prescriptive requirements for processes around scheduling, fitness for duty, deadheading, and other requirements of the new rules. The other provisions of the Rules applicable to CN will come into effect on May 25, 2023.\n\nOn November 26, 2021, Transport Canada adopted regulations revising the scope of application of the Grade Crossing Regulations by setting requirements for grade crossings according to a risk-based model. Under this model, existing crossings considered to be low risk are exempted from upgrade requirements. The amendments also extend the compliance deadline for upgrade requirements (previously November 28, 2021) on the basis of the risk-based model. For crossings considered to be high priority, the deadline is extended by one year (until November 28, 2022), and for all other crossings (i.e., crossings that do not meet the threshold criteria for low-risk or high priority) by three years (until November 28, 2024).\n\nNo assurance can be given that these and any other current or future regulatory or legislative initiatives by the Canadian federal government and agencies will not materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or its competitive and financial position.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Safety regulation - U.S.\n\nThe Company's U.S. rail operations are subject to safety regulation by the FRA under the Federal Railroad Safety Act as well as rail portions of other safety statutes, with the transportation of certain hazardous commodities also governed by regulations promulgated by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). PHMSA requires carriers operating in the U.S. to report annually the volume and routespecific data for cars containing these commodities; conduct a safety and security risk analysis for each used route; identify a commercially practicable alternative route for each used route; and select for use the practical route posing the least safety and security risk. In addition, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires rail carriers to provide upon request, within five minutes for a single car and 30 minutes for multiple cars, location and shipping information on cars on their networks containing toxic inhalation hazard materials and certain radioactive or explosive materials; and ensure the secure, attended transfer of all such cars to and from shippers, receivers and other carriers that will move from, to, or through designated high-threat urban areas.\n\nOn February 18, 2020, the FRA issued a final rule that requires each Class I railroad and certain shortline railroads to develop a Railroad Risk Reduction Program in a written plan that will be reviewed and approved by the FRA and will be subject to audit. CN submitted its plan on August 16, 2021. Rail labor previously challenged aspects of the FRA rule in the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, including protection from discovery for information compiled by railroads for purposes of implementing the rule. On August 20, 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit denied the challenge filed by rail labor to the FRA's final rule concerning the risk reduction programs. In November 2021, the FRA denied the Class I risk reduction program plans with comments. The Class I railroads will submit revised plans by February 7, 2022.\n\nOn February 23, 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated an FRA order from May 2019, which had withdrawn an agency proposed rule relating to crew size. On April 9, 2021, the Association of American Railroads sought rehearing from the court. On May 6, 2021, the Ninth Circuit denied the petition for rehearing. In a separate matter, a federal court in Illinois previously concluded that the Illinois crew size statute was preempted under the FRA's May 2019 order, and the Illinois Commerce Commission appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. That appeal was stayed pending resolution of the Ninth Circuit case. On July 2, 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit remanded the case to the district court so that the district court will vacate its prior decision based on the FRA's May 2019 order and decide AAR's other preemption arguments. On December 21, 2021, the district court held that the Illinois crew size statute was preempted by the Regional Rail Reorganization Act (known as the 3R Act).\n\nOn March 1, 2021, the FRA implemented an emergency order governing the use of face masks in railroad operations. On June 10, 2021, FRA issued a Statement of Enforcement Discretion Regarding FRA's Emergency Order Requiring Face Mask Use in Railroad Operations that is focused on passenger transportation and will exercise enforcement discretion while outdoors on a transportation conveyance or while outdoors at transportation hubs. FRA has not updated its views on masks in the freight transportation context.\n\nThe US government announced that it would impose vaccine mandates. The Biden Administration issued the Executive Order on Ensuring Adequate COVID-19 Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors and COVID-19 workplace safety guidance for federal contractors and subcontractors from the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force, which is scheduled to go into effect on January 10, 2022 and the US Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) will not issue citations for noncompliance until February 9, 2022. The OSHA issued an emergency temporary standard that would require employers with 100 or more employees to ensure their workforce is fully vaccinated or subject to periodic testing. Opponents challenged the vaccine mandates in court. The federal contractor mandate is subject to a nationwide injunction, which has been appealed, and oral argument will be scheduled by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The OSHA temporary standard was reinstated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and allowed the OSHA rule to take effect. Applicants sought emergency relief from the United States Supreme Court to stay the OSHA rule. On January 13, 2022, the Supreme Court stayed the OSHA temporary standard pending the disposition of the Applicants' petition for review pending before the Sixth Circuit. The Supreme Court concluded that the Applicants were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the agency lacked authority to impose the mandate.\n\nNo assurance can be given that these and any other current or future regulatory or legislative initiatives by the U.S. federal government and agencies will not materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or its competitive and financial position.\n\n## Regulation - Vessels\n\nThe Company's vessel operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Coast Guard and the Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration, which regulate the ownership and operation of vessels operating on the Great Lakes and in U.S. coastal waters. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency has authority to regulate air emissions from these vessels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Security\n\nThe Company is subject to statutory and regulatory directives in the U.S. addressing homeland security concerns. In the U.S., safety matters related to security are overseen by the TSA, which is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and PHMSA, which, like the FRA, is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Border security falls under the jurisdiction of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which is part of the DHS. In Canada, the Company is subject to regulation by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). Matters related to agriculture-related shipments crossing the Canada/U.S. border also fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S. and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) in Canada. More specifically, the Company is subject to:\n\n- \u00b7 border security arrangements, pursuant to an agreement the Company and CP entered into with the CBP and the CBSA;\n- \u00b7 the CBP's Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program and designation as a low-risk carrier under CBSA's Customs Self-Assessment (CSA) program;\n- \u00b7 regulations imposed by the CBP requiring advance notification by all modes of transportation for all shipments into the U.S. The CBSA is also working on similar requirements for Canada-bound traffic;\n- \u00b7 inspection for imported fruits and vegetables grown in Canada and the agricultural quarantine and inspection (AQI) user fee for all traffic entering the U.S. from Canada; and\n- \u00b7 gamma ray screening of cargo entering the U.S. from Canada, and potential security and agricultural inspections at the Canada/U.S. border.\n\nThe Company has worked with the AAR to develop and put in place an extensive industry-wide security plan to address terrorism and security-driven efforts by state and local governments seeking to restrict the routings of certain hazardous materials. If such state and local routing restrictions were to go into force, they would be likely to add to security concerns by foreclosing the Company's most optimal and secure transportation routes, leading to increased yard handling, longer hauls, and the transfer of traffic to lines less suitable for moving hazardous materials, while also infringing upon the exclusive and uniform federal oversight over railroad security matters.\n\nWhile the Company will continue to work closely with the CBSA, CBP, and other Canadian and U.S. agencies, as described above, no assurance can be given that these and future decisions by the U.S., Canadian, provincial, state, or local governments on homeland security matters, legislation on security matters enacted by the U.S. Congress or Parliament, or joint decisions by the industry in response to threats to the North American rail network, will not materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations, or its competitive and financial position.\n\n## Transportation of hazardous materials\n\nAs a result of its common carrier obligations, the Company is legally required to transport toxic inhalation hazard materials regardless of risk or potential exposure or loss. A train accident involving the transport of these commodities could result in significant costs and claims for personal injury, property damage, environmental penalties and remediation in excess of insurance coverage for these risks, which may materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations, or its competitive and financial position.\n\n## Economic conditions\n\nThe Company is susceptible to changes in the economic conditions of the industries and geographic areas that produce and consume the freight it transports or the supplies it requires to operate. In addition, many of the goods and commodities carried by the Company experience cyclical demand. For example, the volatility in domestic and global energy markets could impact the demand for transportation services as well as impact the Company's fuel costs and surcharges. In addition, the volatility in other commodity markets such as coal and iron ore could have an impact on volumes. Many of the bulk commodities the Company transports move offshore and are affected more by global rather than North American economic conditions. Adverse North American and global economic conditions, or economic or industrial restructuring, that affect the producers and consumers of the commodities carried by the Company, including customer insolvency, may have a material adverse effect on the volume of rail shipments and/or revenues from commodities carried by the Company, and thus materially and negatively affect its results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. Moreover, supply chain disruptions in North America and internationally may adversely affect volumes of goods and timelines, and therefore adversely affect CN's operations and financial results.\n\n## Pension funding volatility\n\nThe Company's funding requirements for its defined benefit pension plans are determined using actuarial valuations. See the section of this MD&A entitled Critical accounting estimates - Pensions and other postretirement benefits for information relating to the funding of the Company's defined benefit pension plans. Adverse changes with respect to pension plan returns and the level of interest rates as well as changes to existing federal pension legislation and regulation may significantly impact future pension contributions and have a material adverse effect on the funding status of the plans and the Company's results of operations.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nThere can be no assurance that the Company's pension expense and funding of its defined benefit pension plans will not increase in the future and thereby negatively impact earnings and/or cash flow.\n\n## Reliance on technology and related cybersecurity risk\n\nThe Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. The company depends on the proper functioning and availability of its information technology, including communications systems and data processing systems. The company's information technology systems are critical in meeting customer expectations, tracking, maintaining, and operating trains and related vehicles, managing employees, and interfacing with customers, suppliers, vendors, and other third parties.\n\nSecurity threats continue to grow and can come from nation states, organized criminals, hacktivists and others, and the Company is at risk of and may be impacted by cyber attacks or security incidents, whether accidental or malicious. While the Company has business continuity and disaster recovery plans, other security and mitigation programs in place to protect its operations, as well as information and technology assets, a cybersecurity attack, significant disruption or failure of its information technology and communications systems or those of its vendors or service providers, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware or other damage could interrupt or delay the Company's operations, result in service interruptions, safety failures, security violations, regulatory compliance failures or other operational difficulties, damage its reputation, cause a loss of customers, vendors, suppliers, agents, or third-party capacity providers and lead to misappropriation of assets, data corruption, unauthorized system and data access or disclosures. A cyber incident or interruption of information technology systems could expose the Company to a risk of loss, litigation, regulatory oversight, enforcement actions or cause it to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event, any of which could have a material adverse impact on its operational and financial position.\n\nThe Company is investing to meet evolving network and data security expectations and regulations in an effort to mitigate the impact a security incident might have on the Company, including its results of operations, financial position or liquidity. The final outcome of a potential security incident, however, cannot be predicted with certainty. Therefore, there can be no assurance that its resolution will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's reputation, goodwill, results of operations, financial position or liquidity, in any particular quarter or fiscal year. New regulatory obligations related to cybersecurity and technology risk may impose additional costs and obligations on the Company and may lead to government inquiries or requests for information. This includes, but is not limited to, a December 2021 Security Directive from the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requiring rail operators to take several actions in 2022 to enhance rail cybersecurity.\n\n## Trade restrictions\n\nGlobal as well as North American trade conditions, including trade barriers on certain commodities, may interfere with the free circulation of goods across Canada and the U.S. or the cost associated therewith.\n\nOn November 30, 2018, the U.S., Canada and Mexico signed the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), a new trade agreement to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. All three countries have ratified the agreement which came into force on July 1, 2020.\n\nOn November 24, 2021, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued the final results of its second administrative review of anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders regarding softwood lumber products from Canada, by applying a 17.9% combined duty rate, approximately twice the current combined duty rate of 8.99%. Following completion of any legal challenges under the CUSMA or USMCA Chapter 10 or in U.S. courts, these new duty rates will apply retroactively. The Government of Canada has stated that it still believes this is entirely unjustified and will hurt consumers, businesses and workers on both sides of the border. The decision will be challenged while a negotiated solution to this longstanding trade issue is pursued.\n\nIt remains too early to assess the potential outcome of other ongoing various trade actions taken by governments and agencies. As such, there can be no assurance that trade actions will not materially adversely affect the volume of rail shipments and/or revenues from commodities carried by the Company, and thus materially and negatively impact earnings and/or cash flow.\n\n## Terrorism and international conflicts\n\nPotential terrorist actions can have a direct or indirect impact on the transportation infrastructure, including railway infrastructure in North America, and can interfere with the free flow of goods. Rail lines, facilities and equipment could be directly targeted or become indirect casualties, which could interfere with the free flow of goods. International conflicts can also have an impact on the Company's markets. Government response to such events could adversely affect the Company's operations. Insurance premiums could also increase significantly or coverage could become unavailable.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Customer credit risk\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company monitors the financial condition and credit limits of its customers and reviews the credit history of each new customer. Although the Company believes there are no significant concentrations of credit risk, economic conditions can affect the Company's customers and can result in an increase to the Company's credit risk and exposure to the business failures of its customers. A widespread deterioration of customer credit and/or business failures of customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nDisruptions in financial markets or deterioration of the Company's credit ratings could hinder the Company's access to external sources of funding to meet its liquidity needs. There can be no assurance that changes in the financial markets will not have a negative effect on the Company's liquidity and its access to capital at acceptable terms and rates.\n\n## Supplier concentration\n\nThe Company operates in a capital-intensive industry where the complexity of rail equipment limits the number of suppliers available. The supply market could be disrupted if changes in the economy caused any of the Company's suppliers to cease production or to experience capacity or supply shortages. The supply market could become further concentrated and could result in changes to the product or service offerings by suppliers. This could also result in cost increases to the Company and difficulty in obtaining and maintaining the Company's rail equipment and materials. Since the Company also has foreign suppliers, international relations, trade restrictions and global economic and other conditions may potentially interfere with the Company's ability to procure necessary equipment and materials. Widespread business failures of, or restrictions on suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial position.\n\n## Availability of qualified personnel\n\nThe Company may experience demographic challenges in the employment levels of its workforce. Changes in employee demographics, training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel, particularly locomotive engineers and conductors and information technologists, could negatively impact the Company's ability to meet demand for rail service. The Company monitors employment levels and seeks to ensure that there is an adequate supply of personnel to meet rail service requirements. However, the Company's efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel may be hindered by specific conditions in the job market. No assurance can be given that demographic or other challenges will not materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or its financial position.\n\n## Fuel costs\n\nThe Company is susceptible to the volatility of fuel prices due to changes in the economy or supply disruptions. Fuel shortages can occur due to refinery disruptions, production quota restrictions, climate, as well as labor and political instability. Increases in fuel prices or supply disruptions may materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\n\n## Foreign exchange\n\nThe Company conducts its business in both Canada and the U.S. and as a result, is affected by currency fluctuations. Changes in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and other currencies (including the US dollar) make the goods transported by the Company more or less competitive in the world marketplace and thereby may adversely affect the Company's revenues and expenses.\n\n## Interest rates\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk relating to the Company's debt. The Company mainly issues fixed-rate debt, which exposes the Company to variability in the fair value of the debt. The Company also issues debt with variable interest rates, which exposes the Company to variability in interest expense. Adverse changes to market interest rates may significantly impact the fair value or future cash flows of the Company's financial instruments. There can be no assurance that changes in the market interest rates will not have a negative effect on the Company's results of operations or liquidity.\n\n## Transportation network disruptions\n\nDue to the integrated nature of the North American freight transportation infrastructure, the Company's operations may be negatively affected by service disruptions of its own network, including illegal blockades, as well as of other transportation links such as ports and other railroads which interchange with the Company. A significant prolonged service disruption of CN's network or one or more of these entities could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Furthermore, deterioration in the cooperative relationships with the Company's connecting carriers could directly affect the Company's operations.\n\n|",

Severe weather and natural disasters, such as extreme cold or heat, flooding, droughts, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes, can disrupt operations and service for the railroad, affect the performance of locomotives and rolling stock, as well as disrupt operations for both the Company and its customers. Business interruptions resulting from severe weather could result in increased costs, increased liabilities and lower revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\n\n## Climate change\n\nClimate change, including the impacts of global warming, has the potential physical risks of increasing the frequency of adverse weather events, which can disrupt the Company's operations and damage its infrastructure or properties. It could also affect the markets for, or the volume of, the goods the Company carries or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Government action or inaction to address climate change could also affect CN. The Company is currently subject to climate change and other emissions-related laws and regulations that have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, provincial and state levels. While CN is continually focused on efficiency improvements and reducing its carbon footprint, cap and trade systems, carbon taxes, or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases imposed by various government bodies could increase the Company's capital and operating costs. The Company may not be able to offset such impacts, including, for example, through higher freight rates. Climate change legislation and regulation could also affect CN's customers; make it difficult for CN's customers to produce products in a cost-competitive manner due to increased energy costs; and increase legal costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change.\n\n## Controls and procedures\n\nThe Company's Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2021, have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021, there were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021, and issued Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting dated February 1, 2022 to that effect.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors Canadian National Railway Company:\n\n## Opinion on the consolidated financial statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Canadian National Railway Company (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\"), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 1, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical audit matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Evaluation of income taxes\n\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the net deferred income tax liability was $9,303 million as of December 31, 2021 and income tax expense was $1,441 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company operates in different tax jurisdictions which requires the Company to make significant judgments and estimates in relation to its tax positions.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the net deferred income tax liability and income tax expense as a critical audit matter due to the magnitude of these tax balances and complexities in the evaluation of the application of the relevant tax regulations applicable to the Company. A high degree of auditor judgment was required in assessing certain of the Company's tax positions and balances.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company's reconciliation and analysis of its deferred income tax balances. We involved income tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in: (1) assessing the Company's interpretation of the relevant tax regulations; (2) evaluating the reasonability of the Company's tax positions; and (3) analyzing the Company's deferred income tax balances by comparing prior year tax estimates to actual tax returns filed, and evaluating the Company's reconciliation of the deferred income tax balances to the underlying temporary differences.\n\n\u00a9 2021 KPMG LLP, an Ontario limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, expenditures related to self-constructed properties include direct material, labor, and contracted services, as well as other allocated costs.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of capitalization of costs relating to track and railway infrastructure as a critical audit matter. The magnitude and complexities in self-constructed properties, as well as the judgments involved in determining whether the expenditure met the Company's pre-determined capitalization criteria required subjective auditor judgment.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company's capital additions process, including controls related to the monitoring of budget versus actual costs on capital projects and the Company's assessment that the expenditures charged to projects meet the Company's pre-determined capitalization criteria. For a sample of capital expenditure additions, we examined underlying documentation and assessed whether the expenditure met the Company's pre-determined capitalization criteria. The testing was performed at a disaggregated level by type of cost (including direct material, labor, and contracted services), and for rail, included comparisons to prior period per unit measures by region. In addition, we examined the Company's budget versus actual analysis on capital projects and assessed the Company's explanations of differences exceeding pre-determined testing thresholds.\n\n(s) KPMG LLP*\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditors since 1992.\n\nMontr\u00e9al, Canada February\u00a01, 2022\n\n- * CPA auditor, CA, public accountancy permit No. A122596\n\n|",

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\"), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively the \"consolidated financial statements'), and our report dated February 1, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n(s) KPMG LLP*\n\nMontr\u00e9al, Canada February 1, 2022\n\n* CPA auditor, CA, public accountancy permit No. A122596\n\n\u00a9 2021 KPMG LLP, an Ontario limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nCanadian National Railway Company, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, collectively \"CN\" or the \"Company\", is engaged in the rail and related transportation business. CN spans Canada and the United States of America (U.S.), the only railroad connecting Canada's Eastern and Western coasts with the U.S. South. CN's freight revenues are derived from the movement of a diversified and balanced portfolio of goods, including petroleum and chemicals, grain and fertilizers, coal, metals and minerals, forest products, intermodal and automotive.\n\n## 1 - Summary of significant accounting policies\n\n## Basis of presentation\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise indicated, and have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC).\n\n## Principles of consolidation\n\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries and variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company is the primary beneficiary of the Employee Benefit Plan Trusts (\"Share Trusts\") as the Company has the direct ability to make decisions regarding the Share Trusts' principal activities. The Company's investments in which it has significant influence are accounted for using the equity method and all other investments for which fair value is not readily determinable are accounted for at cost minus impairment, plus or minus observable price changes.\n\n## Use of estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, including those related to goodwill, intangible assets, identified assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, income taxes, depreciation, pensions and other postretirement benefits, personal injury and other claims, and environmental matters, based upon available information. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\n## Revenues\n\n## Nature of services\n\nThe Company's revenues consist of freight revenues and other revenues. Freight revenues include revenue from the movement of freight over rail and are derived from the following seven commodity groups:\n\n- \u00b7 Petroleum and chemicals, which includes chemicals and plastics, refined petroleum products, crude and condensate, and sulfur;\n- \u00b7 Metals and minerals, which includes energy materials, metals, minerals, and iron ore;\n- \u00b7 Forest products, which includes lumber, pulp, paper, and panels;\n- \u00b7 Coal, which includes coal and petroleum coke;\n- \u00b7 Grain and fertilizers, which includes Canadian regulated grain, Canadian commercial grain, U.S. grain, potash and other fertilizers;\n- \u00b7 Intermodal, which includes rail and trucking services for domestic and international traffic; and\n- \u00b7 Automotive, which includes finished vehicles and auto parts.\n\nFreight revenues also comprise revenues for optional services beyond the basic movement of freight including asset use, switching, storage, and other services.\n\nOther revenues are derived from non-rail logistics services that support the Company's rail business including vessels and docks, transloading and distribution, automotive logistics, and freight forwarding and transportation management.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when control of promised services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those services.\n\nThe Company accounts for contracts with customers when it has approval and commitment from both parties, each party's rights have been identified, payment terms are defined, the contract has commercial substance and collection is probable. For contracts that involve multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract based on relative standalone selling prices and recognizes revenue when, or as, performance obligations in the contract are satisfied.\n\nRevenues are presented net of taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Freight revenues\n\nFreight services are arranged through publicly-available tariffs or customer-specific agreements that establish the pricing, terms and conditions for freight services offered by the Company. For revenue recognition purposes, a contract for the movement of freight over rail exists when shipping instructions are sent by a customer and have been accepted by the Company in connection with the relevant tariff or customerspecific agreement.\n\nRevenues for the movement of freight over rail are recognized over time due to the continuous transfer of control to the customer as freight moves from origin to destination. Progress towards completion of the performance obligation is measured based on the transit time of freight from origin to destination. The allocation of revenues between periods is based on the relative transit time in each period with expenses recorded as incurred. Revenues related to freight contracts that require the involvement of another rail carrier to move freight from origin to destination are reported on a net basis. Freight movements are completed over a short period of time and are generally completed before payment is due. Freight receivables are included in Accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Company has no material contract assets associated with freight revenues.\n\nContract liabilities represent consideration received from customers for which the related performance obligation has not been satisfied. Contract liabilities are recognized into revenues when or as the related performance obligation is satisfied. The Company includes contract liabilities within Accounts payable and other and Other liabilities and deferred credits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nRevenues for optional services are recognized at a point in time or over time as performance obligations are satisfied, depending on the nature of the service.\n\nFreight contracts may be subject to variable consideration in the form of volume-based incentives, rebates, or other items, which affect the transaction price. Variable consideration is recognized as revenue to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Variable consideration is accrued on the basis of management's best estimate of the expected amount, which is based on available historical, current and forecasted information.\n\n## Other revenues\n\nOther revenues are recognized at a point in time or over time as performance obligations are satisfied, depending on the nature of the service.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nThe Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, the change in the net deferred income tax asset or liability is included in the computation of Net income or Other comprehensive income (loss). Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of basic shares outstanding during the period. The weighted-average number of basic shares outstanding excludes shares held in the Share Trusts and includes vested equity settled stock-based compensation awards other than stock options. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of diluted shares outstanding during the period, applying the treasury stock method. The weighted-average number of diluted shares outstanding includes the dilutive effects of common shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options and nonvested equity settled awards.\n\n## Foreign currency\n\nAll of the Company's foreign subsidiaries use the US dollar as their functional currency. Accordingly, the foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into Canadian dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and the revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the year. All adjustments resulting from the translation of the foreign operations are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss).\n\nThe Company designates the US dollar-denominated debt of the parent company as a foreign currency hedge of its net investment in foreign operations. Accordingly, foreign exchange gains and losses, from the dates of designation, on the translation of the US dollardenominated debt are included in Other comprehensive income (loss).\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments purchased three months or less from maturity and are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.\n\n|",

Restricted cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments purchased three months or less from maturity and are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.\n\n## Accounts receivable\n\nAccounts receivable are recorded at cost net of billing adjustments and an allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount. When a receivable is deemed uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to bad debt expense in Casualty and other in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## Material and supplies\n\nMaterial and supplies, which consist mainly of rail, ties, and other items for construction and maintenance of property and equipment, as well as diesel fuel, are measured at weighted-average cost.\n\n## Assets held for sale\n\nAssets that are classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less expected selling costs ('estimated selling price') with a loss recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated selling price. The classification is applicable at the date upon which the sale of assets is probable, and the assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition. The transfer of the assets must also be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within the year following the date of classification.\n\nAssets once classified as held for sale, are not subject to depreciation or amortization and both the assets and any liabilities directly associated with the assets held for sale are classified as current in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nSubsequent changes to the estimated selling price of assets held for sale are recorded as recoveries or losses to the Consolidated Statements of Income wherein the recognition of subsequent gains is limited to the cumulative loss previously recognized.\n\n## Properties\n\n## Capitalization of costs\n\nThe Company's railroad operations are highly capital intensive. The Company's properties mainly consist of homogeneous or network-type assets such as rail, ties, ballast and other structures, which form the Company's Track and roadway properties, and Rolling stock. The Company's capital expenditures are for the replacement of existing assets and for the purchase or construction of new assets to enhance operations or provide new service offerings to customers. A large portion of the Company's capital expenditures are for self-constructed properties, including the replacement of existing track and roadway assets and track line expansion, as well as major overhauls and large refurbishments of rolling stock.\n\nExpenditures are capitalized if they extend the life of the asset or provide future benefits such as increased revenue-generating capacity, functionality or service capacity. The Company has a process in place to determine whether or not costs qualify for capitalization, which requires judgment. For Track and roadway properties, the Company establishes basic capital programs to replace or upgrade the track infrastructure assets which are capitalized if they meet the capitalization criteria.\n\nIn addition, for Track and roadway properties, expenditures that meet the minimum level of activity as defined by the Company are also capitalized as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 grading : installation of road bed, retaining walls, and drainage structures;\n- \u00b7 rail and related track material : installation of 39 or more continuous feet of rail;\n- \u00b7 ties : installation of five or more ties per 39 feet; and\n- \u00b7 ballast : installation of 171 cubic yards of ballast per mile.\n\nFor purchased assets, the Company capitalizes all costs necessary to make the assets ready for their intended use. For self-constructed properties, expenditures include direct material, labor, and contracted services, as well as other allocated costs. These allocated costs include, but are not limited to, project supervision, fringe benefits, maintenance on equipment used on projects as well as the cost of small tools and supplies. The Company reviews and adjusts its allocations, as required, to reflect the actual costs incurred each year.\n\nFor the rail asset, the Company capitalizes the costs of rail grinding which consists of restoring and improving the rail profile and removing irregularities from worn rail to extend the service life. The service life of the rail asset is increased incrementally as rail grinding is performed\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nthereon, and as such, the costs incurred are capitalized given that the activity extends the service life of the rail asset beyond its original or current condition as additional gross tons can be carried over the rail for its remaining service life.\n\nFor the ballast asset, the Company engages in shoulder ballast undercutting that consists of removing some or all of the ballast, which has deteriorated over its service life, and replacing it with new ballast. When ballast is installed as part of a shoulder ballast undercutting project, it represents the addition of a new asset and not the repair or maintenance of an existing asset. As such, the Company capitalizes expenditures related to shoulder ballast undercutting given that an existing asset is retired and replaced with a new asset. Under the group method of accounting for properties, the deteriorated ballast is retired at its historical cost.\n\nCosts of deconstruction and removal of replaced assets, referred to herein as dismantling costs, are distinguished from installation costs for self-constructed properties based on the nature of the related activity. For Track and roadway properties, employees concurrently perform dismantling and installation of new track and roadway assets and, as such, the Company estimates the amount of labor and other costs that are related to dismantling. The Company determines dismantling costs based on an analysis of the track and roadway installation process.\n\nExpenditures relating to the Company's properties that do not meet the Company's capitalization criteria are expensed as incurred. For Track and roadway properties, such expenditures include but are not limited to spot tie replacement, spot or broken rail replacement, physical track inspection for detection of rail defects and minor track corrections, and other general maintenance of track infrastructure.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nProperties are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation including asset impairment write-downs. The cost of properties, including those under finance leases, net of asset impairment write-downs, is depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated service lives, measured in years, except for rail and ballast whose service lives are measured in millions of gross tons. The Company follows the group method of depreciation whereby a single composite depreciation rate is applied to the gross investment in a class of similar assets, despite small differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same asset class. The Company uses approximately 40 different depreciable asset classes.\n\nFor all depreciable asset classes, the depreciation rate is based on the estimated service lives of the assets. Assessing the reasonableness of the estimated service lives of properties requires judgment and is based on currently available information, including periodic depreciation studies conducted by the Company. The Company's United States (U.S.) properties are subject to comprehensive depreciation studies as required by the Surface Transportation Board (STB) and are conducted by external experts. Depreciation studies for Canadian properties are not required by regulation and are conducted internally. Studies are performed on specific asset groups on a periodic basis. Changes in the estimated service lives of the assets and their related composite depreciation rates are implemented prospectively.\n\nThe service life of the rail asset is based on expected future usage of the rail in its existing condition, determined using railroad industry research and testing (based on rail characteristics such as weight, curvature and metallurgy), factoring in the rail asset's usage to date. The annual composite depreciation rate for the rail asset is determined by dividing the estimated annual number of gross tons carried over the rail by the estimated service life of the rail measured in millions of gross tons. The Company amortizes the cost of rail grinding over the remaining life of the rail asset, which includes the incremental life extension generated by rail grinding.\n\nGiven the nature of the railroad and the composition of its network which is made up of homogeneous long-lived assets, it is impractical to maintain records of specific properties at their lowest unit of property.\n\nRetirements of assets occur through the replacement of an asset in the normal course of business, the sale of an asset or the abandonment of a section of track. For retirements in the normal course of business, generally the life of the retired asset is within a reasonable range of the expected useful life, as determined in the depreciation studies, and, as such, no gain or loss is recognized under the group method. The asset's cost is removed from the asset account and the difference between its estimated historical cost and estimated related accumulated depreciation (net of salvage proceeds and dismantling costs), if any, is recorded as an adjustment to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. The estimated historical cost of the retired asset is estimated by using deflation factors or indices that closely correlate to the properties comprising the asset classes in combination with the estimated age of the retired asset using a first-in, firstout approach, and applying it to the replacement value of the asset.\n\nIn each depreciation study, an estimate is made of any excess or deficiency in accumulated depreciation for all corresponding asset classes to ensure that the depreciation rates remain appropriate. The excess or deficiency in accumulated depreciation is amortized over the remaining life of the asset class.\n\nFor retirements of depreciable properties that do not occur in the normal course of business, the historical cost, net of salvage proceeds, is recorded as a gain or loss in income. A retirement is considered not to be in the normal course of business if it meets the following criteria: (i) it is unusual, (ii) it is significant in amount, and (iii) it varies significantly from the retirement pattern identified through depreciation studies. A gain or loss is recognized in Other income for the sale of land or disposal of assets that are not part of railroad operations.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Company engages in short and long-term leases for rolling stock including locomotives and freight cars, equipment, real estate and service contracts that contain embedded leases. The Company determines whether or not a contract contains a lease at inception. Leases with a term of twelve months or less are not recorded by the Company on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nFinance and operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. Where the implicit interest rate is not determinable from the lease, the Company uses internal incremental borrowing rates by tenor and currency to initially measure leases in excess of twelve months on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe Company's lease contracts may contain termination, renewal, and/or purchase options, residual value guarantees, or a combination thereof, all of which are evaluated by the Company on a quarterly basis. The majority of renewal options available extend the lease term from one to five years. The Company accounts for such contract options when the Company is reasonably certain that it will exercise one of these options.\n\nLease contracts may contain lease and non-lease components that the Company generally accounts for separately, with the exception of the freight car asset category for which the Company has elected to not separate the lease and non-lease components.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets consist mainly of customer contracts and relationships acquired through business acquisitions. Intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, ranging from 20 to 50 years. If a change in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is determined, amortization is adjusted prospectively.\n\nWith respect to impairment, the Company tests the recoverability of its intangible assets held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, based on future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe Company recognizes goodwill as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the business acquisition. The carrying amount of goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is tested for impairment annually as of the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount.\n\nWith respect to impairment, the Company may first assess certain qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, or proceed directly to a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Qualitative factors include but are not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions, cost factors and overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and events such as changes in management or customers. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test must be performed. The quantitative impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill, and an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, up to the value of goodwill. The Company defines the fair value of a reporting unit as the price that would be received to sell the reporting unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the impairment date. To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, the Company uses the discounted cash flow method using the pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or group of assets.\n\n## Accounts receivable securitization\n\nBased on the structure of its accounts receivable securitization program, the Company accounts for the proceeds received as secured borrowings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Pensions\n\nPension costs are determined using actuarial methods. Net periodic benefit cost (income) includes the current service cost of pension benefits provided in exchange for employee service rendered during the year, which is recorded in Labor and fringe benefits expense. Net periodic benefit cost (income) also includes the following, which are recorded in Other components of net periodic benefit income (cost):\n\n- \u00b7 the interest cost of pension obligations;\n- \u00b7 the expected long-term return on pension fund assets;\n- \u00b7 the amortization of prior service costs and amendments over the expected average remaining service life of the employee group covered by the plans; and\n- \u00b7 the amortization of cumulative net actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the beginning of year balances of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets, over the expected average remaining service life of the employee group covered by the plans.\n\nThe pension plans are funded through contributions determined in accordance with the projected unit credit actuarial cost method.\n\n## Postretirement benefits other than pensions\n\nThe Company accrues the cost of postretirement benefits other than pensions using actuarial methods. These benefits, which are funded as they become due, include life insurance programs, medical benefits and, for a closed group of employees, free rail travel benefits.\n\nThe Company amortizes the cumulative net actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year, over the expected average remaining service life of the employee group covered by the plan.\n\n## Additional paid-in capital\n\nAdditional paid-in capital includes the stock-based compensation expense on equity settled awards and other items relating to equity settled awards. Upon the exercise of stock options, the stock-based compensation expense related to those awards is reclassified from Additional paid-in capital to Common shares. Upon settlement of all other equity settled awards, the Company reclassifies from Additional paid-in capital to Retained Earnings the stock-based compensation expense and other items related to equity settled awards, up to the amount of the settlement cost. The excess, if any, of the settlement cost over the stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Retained Earnings.\n\n## Stock-based compensation\n\nFor equity settled awards, stock-based compensation costs are accrued over the requisite service period based on the fair value of the awards at the grant date. The grant date fair value of performance share unit (PSU) awards is dependent on the type of PSU award. The grant date fair value of PSU-ROIC awards is determined using a lattice-based model incorporating a minimum share price condition and the grant date fair value of PSU-TSR awards is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The grant date fair value of equity settled deferred share unit (DSU) awards is determined using the stock price at the grant date. The grant date fair value of stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For cash settled awards, stock-based compensation costs are accrued over the requisite service period based on the fair value determined at each period-end. The fair value of cash settled DSU awards is determined using their intrinsic value.\n\n## Personal injury and other claims\n\nIn Canada, the Company accounts for costs related to employee work-related injuries based on actuarially developed estimates on a discounted basis of the ultimate cost associated with such injuries, including compensation, health care and third-party administration costs. In the U.S., the Company accrues the expected cost for personal injury, property damage and occupational disease claims, based on actuarial estimates of their ultimate cost on an undiscounted basis. For all other legal actions in Canada and the U.S., the Company maintains, and regularly updates on a case-by-case basis, provisions for such items when the expected loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimated based on currently available information.\n\n## Environmental expenditures\n\nEnvironmental expenditures that relate to current operations, or to an existing condition caused by past operations, are expensed as incurred. Environmental expenditures that provide a future benefit are capitalized. Environmental liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments occur, remedial efforts are probable, and when the costs, based on a specific plan of action in terms of the technology to be used and the extent of the corrective action required, can be reasonably estimated. The Company accrues its allocable share of liability taking into account the Company's alleged responsibility, the number of potentially responsible parties and their ability to pay their respective shares of the liability. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable.\n\n|",

The administrator of LIBOR has ceased the publication of one week and two month USD LIBOR rates on January 1, 2022 and intends to discontinue the remaining USD LIBOR rates immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023.\n\nThe ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. These transactions include contract modifications, hedging relationships, and sale or transfer of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity.\n\nThe ASU was effective starting on March 12, 2020, and is available to be adopted on a prospective basis no later than December 31, 2022, when the reference rate replacement activity is expected to be completed. The Company currently has outstanding loans referencing LIBOR, that were not impacted by the administrator of LIBOR ceasing publication of one week and two month USD LIBOR rates, totaling US$572 million that would be affected by the provisions of this ASU. The Company also has a revolving credit facility and an accounts receivable securitization program that reference LIBOR (See Note 15 -Debt ). The Company had no outstanding borrowing under these credit facilities as at December 31, 2021. The Company has fallback language to allow for the succession of a clearly defined alternative reference rate within the contracts that reference LIBOR. The Company is evaluating the effects that the adoption of the ASU will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures, and whether it will elect to apply any of the optional expedients and exceptions provided in the ASU.\n\nOther recently issued ASUs required to be applied on or after December 31, 2021 have been evaluated by the Company and are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 3 - Acquisitions\n\n## 2021\n\n## Terminated CN KCS merger agreement\n\nOn September 15, 2021, Kansas City Southern ('KCS') notified CN that it terminated the previously announced May 21, 2021 definitive merger agreement (the 'CN Merger Agreement\") under which CN would have acquired KCS for an implied total transaction value of US$33.6 billion, including the assumption of US$3.8 billion of debt.\n\nOn August 31, 2021, the Surface Transportation Board (\"STB\") rejected the joint motion by CN and KCS to approve a proposed voting trust\n\nagreement. On September 15, 2021, KCS and its Board of Directors announced that the revised acquisition proposal of September 12, 2021 from Canadian Pacific Railway Limited ('CP') constituted a \"Company Superior Proposal\" as defined in the CN Merger Agreement. Consequently, KCS entered into a waiver letter agreement with CN under which KCS agreed to terminate the CN Merger Agreement in order to enter into a merger agreement with CP. As a result, CN received from KCS a merger termination fee of US$700 million ($886 million), recorded in Merger termination fee within the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and reflected in Operating activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In addition, KCS also refunded Brooklyn US Holdings, Inc. (\"Holdco\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, US$700 million ($886 million) that CN had previously paid as an advance to KCS of US$700 million ($845 million) in connection with KCS's payment of the termination fee to CP under KCS's original merger agreement with CP that was terminated on May 21, 2021. The refund received in the third quarter was recorded in Transaction-related costs within the Consolidated Statements of Income and reflected in Investing activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash flows. The US$700 million ($845 million) advance had been recorded in Advance to KCS and other transaction costs within the Consolidated Balance Sheets in the second quarter of 2021 and has been expensed to Transaction-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

Accordingly, a $486 million loss ($363 million after-tax) was recorded to adjust the carrying amount of these track and roadway assets to their estimated net selling price.\n\nOn March 31, 2021, CN entered into an agreement with a short line operator, for the sale of the non-core lines plus an additional 50 miles of track and roadway assets not originally included within assets held for sale, subject to various conditions including regulatory authorization by the STB. The carrying amount of assets held for sale was adjusted in the first quarter of 2021 to $260 million ($90 million as at December 31, 2020), to reflect the contractual selling price net of estimated transaction costs and the additional track and roadway assets included as part of the agreement. The increase of $170 million included a $137 million recovery of the loss ($102 million after-tax) on the non-core lines and $33 million for the additional track and roadway assets. The carrying amount of assets held for sale was included in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 10 - Other current assets. As at December 31, 2021, the criteria for the classification of assets held for sale continued to be met and there was no change to the carrying amount of assets held for sale.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the STB approved the Company's agreement with the short line operator without condition and the transaction closed on January 28, 2022 and January 31, 2022 for the U.S. and Canadian assets, respectively.\n\n## 6 - Other income\n\nThe following table provides the breakdown of Other income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n\n| In millions              | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Gain on disposal of land | $  23  | $  11  | $  50  |\n| Other (1)                | 20     | (5)    | 3      |\n| Total other income       | $  43  | $  6   | $  53  |\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 7 - Income taxes\n\nThe Company's consolidated effective income tax rate differs from the Canadian, or domestic, statutory federal tax rate. The effective tax rate is affected by recurring items in provincial, U.S. federal, state and other foreign jurisdictions, such as tax rates and the proportion of income earned in those jurisdictions. The effective tax rate is also affected by discrete items such as income tax rate enactments, and lower corporate income tax rates on capital dispositions and other transactions that may occur in any given year.\n\nOn March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act , a tax-and-spending package aimed at providing additional stimulus to address the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act corporate income tax measures allow for U.S. federal net operating losses (NOLs) arising in tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020 to be fully carried back to each of the five tax years preceding the tax year of the NOL. As a result of the CARES Act, the Company reclassified its 2019 deferred income tax asset of $213 million on the NOL that arose in 2019, to a current income tax receivable and recorded a current income tax recovery of $141 million in 2020 to reflect an amount recoverable at the higher U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 35% applicable to pre-2018 tax years.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n\n| In millions                                                            | Year ended December 31,   | 2021     | 2020   | 2019     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------|--------|----------|\n| Canadian statutory federal tax rate                                    |                           | 15%      | 15%    | 15%      |\n| Income tax expense at the Canadian statutory federal tax rate          |                           | $  950   | $  682 | $  814   |\n| Income tax expense resulting from:                                     |                           |          |        |          |\n| Provincial and foreign income taxes  (1)                               |                           | 616      | 416    | 551      |\n| Income tax adjustments due to rate enactments and tax law changes  (2) |                           | -        | (141)  | (112)    |\n| Non-taxable portion of merger termination fee  (3)                     |                           | (116)    | -      | -        |\n| Other  (4)                                                             |                           | (9)      | 25     | (40)     |\n| Income tax expense                                                     |                           | $  1,441 | $  982 | $  1,213 |\n| Net cash payments for income taxes                                     |                           | $  759   | $  353 | $  822   |\n\nThe following table provides tax information on a domestic and foreign basis for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n\n| In millions                           | 2021     | 2020     | 2019     |\n|---------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Income before income taxes            |          |          |          |\n| Domestic                              | $  4,717 | $  3,637 | $  4,162 |\n| Foreign                               | 1,616    | 907      | 1,267    |\n| Total income before income taxes      | $  6,333 | $  4,544 | $  5,429 |\n| Current income tax expense (recovery) |          |          |          |\n| Domestic                              | $  763   | $  616   | $  608   |\n| Foreign                               | 167      | (121)    | 36       |\n| Total current income tax expense      | $  930   | $  495   | $  644   |\n| Deferred income tax expense           |          |          |          |\n| Domestic                              | $  358   | $  389   | $  423   |\n| Foreign                               | 153      | 98       | 146      |\n| Total deferred income tax expense     | $  511   | $  487   | $  569   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income, of the necessary character, during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, the available carryback and carryforward periods, and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. As at December 31, 2021, in order to fully realize all of the deferred income tax assets, the Company will need to generate future taxable income of approximately $2.2 billion, and, based upon the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income of the necessary character over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, and the reversal of taxable temporary differences, management believes, following an assessment of the current economic environment, it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences. As at December 31, 2021, the Company has not recognized a deferred income tax asset of $264 million (2020 - $259 million) on the unrealized foreign exchange loss recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss relating to its net investment in U.S. subsidiaries, as the Company does not expect this temporary difference to reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits on the Company's domestic and foreign tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n\n| In millions                                                | Year ended December 31,   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Gross unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year       |                           | $  92  | $  62  | $  74  |\n| Increases for:                                             |                           |        |        |        |\n| Tax positions related to the current year                  |                           | 4      | 17     | 5      |\n| Tax positions related to prior years                       |                           | -      | 28     | -      |\n| Decrease for:                                              |                           |        |        |        |\n| Tax positions related to prior years                       |                           | (32)   | (15)   | (17)   |\n| Gross unrecognized tax benefits at end of year             |                           | 64     | 92     | 62     |\n| Adjustments to reflect tax treaties and other arrangements |                           | (17)   | (25)   | (2)    |\n| Net unrecognized tax benefits at end of year               |                           | $  47  | $  67  | $  60  |\n\n|",

If recognized, $12 million of the net unrecognized tax benefits as at December 31, 2021 would affect the effective tax rate.\n\nThe Company believes that it is reasonably possible that $14 million of the net unrecognized tax benefits as at December 31, 2021 related to Canadian and U.S. federal, state, and provincial income tax matters, each of which are individually insignificant, may be recognized over the next twelve months as a result of settlements and a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations, and will not significantly affect the effective tax rate as they mostly relate to temporary differences.\n\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in Income tax expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company recorded a tax recovery of $2 million related to a net reversal of interest and penalties for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a tax expense of $16 million and $1 million related to net interest and penalties expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As at December 31, 2021, the Company had accrued interest and penalties of $25 million (2020 $27 million).\n\nIn Canada, the Company's federal and provincial income tax returns filed for the years 2014 to 2020 remain subject to examination by the taxation authorities. Examinations of the Company's federal income tax returns for the years 2014 to 2017 are currently in progress and are expected to be completed during 2022. In 2020, the tax authorities proposed certain audit adjustments and, as a result, the Company recorded a $25 million deferred tax expense which is comprised of net unrecognized tax benefits and related interest expenses. During 2021, the tax authorities revised their proposed audit adjustment and as a result, the Company re-evaluated the relevant tax positions for all open years and recorded an $8 million deferred tax recovery reducing net unrecognized tax benefits and related interest expenses. In the U.S., the federal income tax returns filed for the years 2013 to 2020 and the state income tax returns filed for the years 2017 to 2020 remain subject to examination by the taxation authorities. Examination of certain of the Company's state income tax returns are currently in progress. The Company does not anticipate any additional significant impacts to its results of operations or financial position as a result of the final resolutions of such matters.\n\n## 8 - Earnings per share\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation between basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n\n| In millions, except per share data                                                      | 2021                                                                                    | 2020     | 2019     |    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----|\n| Net income                                                                              | $  4,892                                                                                | $  3,562 | $  4,216 |    |\n| Weighted-average basic shares outstanding                                               | 708.5                                                                                   | 711.3    | 720.1    |    |\n| Dilutive effect of stock-based compensation                                             | 1.8                                                                                     | 1.7      | 2.5      |    |\n| Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding                                             | 710.3                                                                                   | 713.0    | 722.6    |    |\n| Basic earnings per share                                                                | $  6.90                                                                                 | $  5.01  | $  5.85  |    |\n| Diluted earnings per share                                                              | $  6.89                                                                                 | $  5.00  | $  5.83  |    |\n| Units excluded from the calculation as their inclusion would not have a dilutive effect | Units excluded from the calculation as their inclusion would not have a dilutive effect |          |          |    |\n| Stock options                                                                           | 0.5                                                                                     | 0.7      | 0.5      |    |\n| Performance share units                                                                 | 0.1                                                                                     | 0.3      | 0.2      |    |\n\n## 9 - Accounts receivable\n\nThe following table provides the breakdown of Accounts receivable as at December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\n| In millions                 | 2021     | 2020     |\n|-----------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Freight                     | $  877   | $  869   |\n| Non-freight                 | 225      | 211      |\n| Gross accounts receivable   | 1,102    | 1,080    |\n| Allowance for credit losses | (28)     | (26)     |\n| Net accounts receivable     | $  1,074 | $  1,054 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

These postretirement benefits are funded as they become due. The information in the tables that follow pertains to all of the Company's defined benefit plans. However, the following descriptions relate solely to the Company's main pension plan, the CN Pension Plan, unless otherwise specified.\n\n|",

Effective April 1, 2024, the affected defined benefit pension plans will be amended to cease benefits accruals for nonunionized members, generally known as a delayed hard freeze. Effective April 1, 2024, all non-unionized members will be transferred to the Company's defined contribution pension plans for their future service. This delayed hard freeze constitutes a plan curtailment event recognized on October 31, 2021 resulting in a $52 million reduction to the Projected benefit obligation, recorded in Other comprehensive income as an actuarial gain, mostly due to reflecting projected future salary increases and service only up to April 1, 2024. The curtailment event also triggered an interim re-measurement of the funded status of the affected defined benefit pension plans resulting in an actuarial gain of $1,915 million recorded in Other comprehensive income composed of i) an actuarial gain on the Projected benefit obligation of $1,808 million substantially all due to the 84 basis point increase in the end of period discount rate between the prior year end (2.55%) and October 31, 2021 (3.39%), and ii) an actuarial gain on the Plan assets of $107 million due to higher actual returns ($982 million) compared to expected returns ($875 million) over that same ten-month period. Due to the interim re-measurement, the resulting Net periodic benefit income recorded during the fourth quarter of 2021 increased by $25 million composed of i) a decrease to Current service cost of $9 million, and ii) an increase to Other components of net periodic benefit income of $16 million.\n\n## Description of the CN Pension Plan\n\nThe CN Pension Plan is a contributory defined benefit pension plan that covers the majority of CN employees. It provides for pensions based mainly on years of service and final average pensionable earnings and is generally applicable from the first day of employment. Indexation of pensions is provided after retirement through a gain/loss sharing mechanism, subject to guaranteed minimum increases. An independent trust company is the Trustee of the Company's pension trust funds (which includes the CN Pension Trust Fund). As Trustee, the trust company performs certain duties, which include holding legal title to the assets of the CN Pension Trust Fund and ensuring that the Company, as Administrator, complies with the provisions of the CN Pension Plan and the related legislation. The Company utilizes a measurement date of December 31 for the CN Pension Plan.\n\n## Funding policy\n\nEmployee contributions to the CN Pension Plan are determined by the plan rules. Company contributions are in accordance with the requirements of the Government of Canada legislation, the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 , including amendments and regulations thereto, and such contributions follow minimum and maximum thresholds as determined by actuarial valuations. Actuarial valuations are generally required on an annual basis for all Canadian defined benefit pension plans, or when deemed appropriate by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. These actuarial valuations are prepared in accordance with legislative requirements and with the recommendations of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries for the valuation of pension plans. Actuarial valuations are also required annually for the Company's U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans.\n\nThe Company's most recently filed actuarial valuations for funding purposes for its Canadian registered defined benefit pension plans conducted as at December 31, 2020 indicated a funding excess on a going concern basis of approximately $3.4 billion and a funding excess on a solvency basis of approximately $0.4 billion, calculated using the three-year average of the plans' hypothetical wind-up ratio in accordance with the Pension Benefit Standards Regulations, 1985 . The federal pension legislation requires funding deficits, if any, to be paid over a number of years, as calculated under current pension regulations. Alternatively, a letter of credit can be subscribed to fulfill required solvency deficit payments.\n\nThe Company's next actuarial valuations for funding purposes for its Canadian registered defined benefit pension plans required as at December 31, 2021 will be performed in 2022. These actuarial valuations are expected to identify a funding excess on a going concern basis of approximately $3.9 billion, while on a solvency basis a funding excess of approximately $1.1 billion is expected. Based on the anticipated results of these valuations, the CN Pension Plan is expected to be fully funded and at a level such that the Company would be prohibited from making contributions to the CN Pension Plan once the actuarial valuation report is filed in 2022. As such, the Company expects to make total cash contributions of approximately $70 million for all of the Company's pension plans in 2022. As at February 1, 2022 the Company had contributed $20 million to its defined benefit pension plans for 2022.\n\n## Plan assets\n\nThe assets of the Company's various Canadian defined benefit pension plans are primarily held in separate trust funds (\"Trusts\") which are diversified by asset type, country, sector and investment strategy. Each year, the CN Board of Directors reviews and confirms or amends the Statement of Investment Policies and Procedures (\"SIPP\") which includes the plans' long-term target asset allocation (\"Policy\") and related benchmark indices. This Policy is based on the long-term expectations of the economy and financial market returns and considers the dynamics of the plans' pension benefit obligations. In 2021, the Policy was amended to implement a target asset allocation change to bonds\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

In addition, the specialty portfolio was approved as a new investment strategy.\n\nThe CN Investment Division (\"Investment Manager\"), a division of the Company created to invest and administer the assets of the plan, can also implement an investment strategy (\"Strategy\") which can lead the Plan's actual asset allocation to deviate from the Policy due to changing market risks and opportunities. The Pension and Investment Committee of the Board of Directors (\"Committee\") regularly compares the actual plan asset allocation to the Policy and Strategy and compares the actual performance of the Company's pension plan assets to the performance of the benchmark indices. The Company's 2021 Policy and actual asset allocation for the Company's pension plans based on fair value are as follows:\n\n|                                 |        | Actual plan asset allocation   | Actual plan asset allocation   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                 | Policy | 2021                           | 2020                           |\n| Cash and short-term investments | 2 %    | 2 %                            | 3 %                            |\n| Bonds and mortgages             | 37 %   | 37 %                           | 37 %                           |\n| Emerging market debt            | 2 %    | 2 %                            | 2 %                            |\n| Private debt                    | 3 %    | 3 %                            | 3 %                            |\n| Equities                        | 35 %   | 40 %                           | 38 %                           |\n| Real estate                     | 4 %    | 2 %                            | 2 %                            |\n| Resource and royalties  (1)     | 5 %    | 5 %                            | 3 %                            |\n| Infrastructure                  | 4 %    | 3 %                            | 3 %                            |\n| Specialty portfolio  (2)        | 2 %    | 2 %                            | - %                            |\n| Absolute return                 | 12 %   | 11 %                           | 10 %                           |\n| Alternative risk premia         | - %    | 1 %                            | 1 %                            |\n| Investment-related liabilities  | (6) %  | (8) %                          | (2) %                          |\n| Total                           | 100 %  | 100 %                          | 100 %                          |\n\nThe Committee's approval is required for all major investments in illiquid securities. The SIPP allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to implement strategies, hedge and adjust existing or anticipated exposures. The SIPP prohibits investments in securities of the Company or its subsidiaries. Investments held in the Company's pension plans consist mainly of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Cash and short-term investments consist of highly liquid securities which ensure adequate cash flows are available to cover near-term benefit payments as well as anticipated cash requirements needed to support derivative instruments or any other contractual commitment. Short-term investments are mainly obligations issued by Canadian chartered banks and by Canadian governments.\n- \u00b7 Bonds include bond instruments, issued or guaranteed by governments and non-government entities. As at December 31, 2021, 80% (2020 - 80%) of bonds were issued or guaranteed by Canadian, U.S. or other governments. Mortgages consist of mortgage bonds, interest in mortgages or in funds making loans, all of which are secured by real estate. On an exposure basis, the Plan's Policy for bonds and mortgages is 42%. This comprises a 37% allocation mainly to government and corporate bonds and a 5% allocation to derivative financial instruments related to bond exposure.\n- \u00b7 Emerging market debt consists of units of co-mingled funds or in separate accounts managed by external managers whose mandate is to invest in debt instruments of emerging market countries.\n- \u00b7 Private debt includes participations in private debt securities and funds focused on generating steady yields.\n- \u00b7 Equity investments include publicly traded securities diversified by industry sector, country and issuer and investments in private equity funds. As at December 31, 2021, the most significant allocation to an individual issuer of a publicly traded security was 4% (2020 - 3%) and the most significant allocation to an industry sector was 22% (2020 - 17%). On an exposure basis, the Plan's Policy for equities is 40%. This comprises a 35% allocation to equities and a 5% allocation to derivative financial instruments related to equity exposure.\n- \u00b7 Real estate is a diversified portfolio of Canadian land and commercial properties and investments in global real estate private equity funds.\n- \u00b7 Resource and royalties investments include petroleum and natural gas properties and listed and non-listed securities of resource and royalties companies.\n- \u00b7 Infrastructure investments include participations in private infrastructure funds, term loans and notes of infrastructure companies.\n- \u00b7 Specialty portfolio consists of mainly private equity, private debt and absolute return investments. Exposure to public assets may be included to manage the risk-return profile and tactical allocation relative to the Policy portfolio weight.\n- \u00b7 Absolute return investments are primarily a portfolio of units of externally managed hedge funds, which are invested in various long/short and derivatives strategies within multi-strategy, fixed income, commodity, equity, global macro funds and downside protection (formerly growth insurance). Managers are monitored on a continuous basis through investment and operational due diligence.\n\n|",

When investing in foreign securities, the plans are exposed to foreign currency risk that may be adjusted or hedged; the effect of which is included in the valuation of the foreign securities. Net of the adjusted or hedged amount, the plans were 62% exposed to the Canadian dollar, 23% to the US dollar, 7% to European currencies, 2% to the Japanese Yen and 6% to various other currencies as at December 31, 2021. Interest rate risk represents the risk that the fair value of the investments will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. Sensitivity to interest rates is a function of the timing and amount of cash flows of the interest-bearing assets and liabilities of the plans. Derivatives are contractual agreements whose value is derived from interest rates, foreign currencies, commodities, or equities, among other fluctuating inputs and factors. They may include forwards, futures, options, and swaps. Derivatives are included in the investment asset classes based on their underlying exposure and are used from time to time to synthetically replace any investment activity that would otherwise be accomplished through a direct investment in any investment asset class. When derivatives are used for hedging purposes, the gains or losses on the derivatives are offset by a corresponding change in the value of the hedged assets. To manage counterparty credit risk, established policies require dealing with counterparties considered to be of high credit quality. Adequate liquidity is maintained to cover cash flows by monitoring factors such as fair value, collateral pledged and received, repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements.\n\nOverall return in the capital markets and the level of interest rates affect the funded status of the Company's pension plans, particularly the Company's main Canadian pension plan. Adverse changes with respect to pension plan returns and the level of interest rates from the date of the last actuarial valuations may have a material adverse effect on the funded status of the plans and on the Company's results of operations.

Land is valued based on the fair value of comparable assets, and income producing properties are valued based on the present value of estimated future net cash flows or the fair value of comparable assets. Independent valuations of all immoveable properties are performed triennially on a rotational basis. The fair value of real estate investments categorized as NAV consists mainly of investments in real estate private equity funds and is based on the net asset value as reported by each fund's manager, generally using a discounted cash flow analysis or earnings multiples.\n\n## Obligations and funded status for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans\n\n|                                                                                                                   |                         | Pensions   | Pensions   | Other postretirement benefits   | Other postretirement benefits   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------|------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| In millions                                                                                                       | Year ended December 31, | 2021       | 2020       | 2021                            | 2020                            |\n| Change in benefit obligation                                                                                      |                         |            |            |                                 |                                 |\n| Projected benefit obligation at beginning of year                                                                 | $                       | 19,499     | $  18,609  | $  228                          | $  227                          |\n| Curtailments                                                                                                      |                         | (52)       | -

Under the Share Units Plan, the Company grants performance share unit (PSU) awards.\n\nPSU-ROIC awards settle depending on the level of attainment of a target return on invested capital (ROIC) performance condition, as defined by the award agreement, over the plan period of three years. The level of attainment of the performance condition results in a performance factor that ranges from 0% to 200%. Settlement is also conditional upon the attainment of a minimum share price market condition, calculated using the average of the last three months of the plan period.\n\nPSU-TSR awards settle depending on the level of attainment of a target total shareholder return (TSR) market condition, as defined by the award agreement, over the plan period of three years. The level of attainment of the market condition results in a performance factor that ranges from 0% to 200% depending on the Company's TSR relative to a Class I Railways peer group and the S&P/TSX 60 companies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

A DSU is equivalent to a common share of the Company and also earns dividends when normal cash dividends are paid on common shares. The number of DSUs received by each participant is established at the time of deferral. For each participant, the Company will grant a further 25% of the amount elected in DSUs, which will vest over a period of four years. The election to receive eligible incentive payments in DSUs is no longer available to a participant when the value of the participant's vested DSUs is sufficient to meet the Company's stock ownership guidelines.\n\n## Equity settled awards\n\nDSUs are settled in common shares of the Company at the time of cessation of employment by way of an open market purchase by the Company. The number of shares remitted to the participant is equal to the number of DSUs awarded less shares withheld to satisfy the participant's withholding tax requirement.\n\n## Cash settled awards\n\nThe value of each participant's DSUs is payable in cash at the time of cessation of employment.\n\n## Stock price volatility\n\nThe Company's liability for the cash settled VIDP is marked-to-market at each period-end and varies with the Company's share price. Fluctuations in the Company's share price cause volatility to stock-based compensation expense as recorded in Net income.

The right to exercise options generally accrues over a period of four years of continuous employment for options granted prior to 2020, and five years for options granted in 2020 and onwards. Options are not generally exercisable during the first 12 months after the date of grant and expire after 10 years. As at December 31, 2021, 13.6 million common shares remained authorized for future issuances under these plans.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company granted 0.7 million (2020 - 0.7 million; 2019 - 0.9 million) stock options.\n\nThe following table provides the activity of stock option awards during 2021, and for options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2021, the weighted-average exercise price:\n\n|                                        | Options outstanding            | Options outstanding              | Nonvested options              | Nonvested options                       |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|                                        | Number of  options In millions | Weighted-average  exercise price | Number of  options In millions | Weighted-average  grant date fair value |\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2020   (1) | 3.6                            | $  97.15                         | 1.9                            | $  17.04                                |\n| Granted  (2)                           | 0.7                            | $  133.56                        | 0.7                            | $  20.50                                |\n| Forfeited/Cancelled                    | -                              | $  122.66                        | -                              | $  18.92                                |\n| Exercised  (3)                         | (0.7)                          | $  82.96                         | N/A                            | N/A                                     |\n| Vested  (4)                            | N/A                            | N/A                              | (0.8)                          | $  16.14                                |\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2021  (1)  | 3.6                            | $  105.32                        | 1.8                            | $  18.69                                |\n| Exercisable at December 31, 2021  (1)  | 1.8                            | $  90.38                         | N/A                            | N/A                                     |\n\nThe following table provides the number of stock options outstanding and exercisable as at December 31, 2021 by range of exercise price and their related intrinsic value, and for options outstanding, the weighted-average years to expiration.

They may also elect to receive their common share grant retainer in DDSUs. Each DDSU entitles the beneficiary thereof to receive upon resignation, retirement or death, one common share of the Company purchased on the open market, plus additional DDSUs reflecting dividend equivalents.\n\nIn 2021, eligible awards were settled net of the remittance of the directors' withholding tax obligation by purchasing $22 million worth of common shares on the open market. These settlements resulted in an excess tax benefit recognized in income of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 21 - Major commitments and contingencies\n\n## Purchase commitments\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, the Company had fixed and variable commitments to purchase information technology services and licenses, wheels, locomotives, railroad cars, rail, engineering services, rail ties as well as other equipment and services with a total estimated cost of $1,784 million. Costs of variable commitments were estimated using forecasted prices and volumes.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company becomes involved in various legal actions seeking compensatory and occasionally punitive damages, including actions brought on behalf of various purported classes of claimants and claims relating to employee and third-party personal injuries, occupational disease and property damage, arising out of harm to individuals or property allegedly caused by, but not limited to, derailments or other accidents.\n\n## Canada\n\nEmployee injuries are governed by the workers' compensation legislation in each province whereby employees may be awarded either a lump sum or a future stream of payments depending on the nature and severity of the injury. As such, the provision for employee injury claims is discounted. In the provinces where the Company is self-insured, costs related to employee work-related injuries are accounted for based on actuarially developed estimates of the ultimate cost associated with such injuries, including compensation, health care and third-party administration costs. An actuarial study is generally performed at least on a triennial basis. For all other legal actions, the Company maintains, and regularly updates on a case-by-case basis, provisions for such items when the expected loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimated based on currently available information.\n\nIn 2021, 2020 and 2019 the Company recorded a decrease of $11 million, $13 million and $7 million, respectively, to its provision for personal injuries in Canada as a result of actuarial valuations for employee injury claims.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company's provision for personal injury and other claims in Canada was as follows:\n\n| In millions                   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Beginning of year             | $  206 | $  207 | $  207 |\n| Accruals and other            | 12     | 31     | 29     |\n| Payments                      | (36)   | (32)   | (29)   |\n| End of year                   | $  182 | $  206 | $  207 |\n| Current portion - End of year | $  50  | $  68  | $  55  |\n\n## United States\n\nPersonal injury claims by the Company's employees, including claims alleging occupational disease and work-related injuries, are subject to the provisions of the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA). Employees are compensated under FELA for damages assessed based on a finding of fault through the U.S. jury system or through individual settlements. As such, the provision is undiscounted. With limited exceptions where claims are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, the Company follows an actuarial-based approach and accrues the expected cost for personal injury, including asserted and unasserted occupational disease claims, and property damage claims, based on actuarial estimates of their ultimate cost. An actuarial study is performed annually.\n\nFor employee work-related injuries, including asserted occupational disease claims, and third-party claims, including grade crossing, trespasser and property damage claims, the actuarial valuation considers, among other factors, the Company's historical patterns of claims filings and payments. For unasserted occupational disease claims, the actuarial valuation includes the projection of the Company's experience into the future considering the potentially exposed population. The Company adjusts its liability based upon management's assessment and the results of the study. On an ongoing basis, management reviews and compares the assumptions inherent in the latest actuarial valuation with the current claim experience and, if required, adjustments to the liability are recorded.\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainty involved in projecting future events, including events related to occupational diseases, which include but are not limited to, the timing and number of actual claims, the average cost per claim and the legislative and judicial environment, the Company's future payments may differ from current amounts recorded.\n\nIn 2021, the Company recorded a decrease of $20 million to its provision for U.S. personal injury and other claims attributable to nonoccupational disease claims, third-party claims and occupational disease claims pursuant to the 2021 actuarial valuation. In 2020 and 2019, actuarial valuations resulted in a decrease of $10 million and an increase of $2 million, respectively. The prior years' adjustments from the actuarial valuations were mainly attributable to non-occupational disease claims, occupational disease claims and third-party claims, reflecting changes in the Company's estimates of unasserted claims and costs related to asserted claims. The Company has an ongoing risk mitigation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nstrategy focused on reducing the frequency and severity of claims through injury prevention and containment; mitigation of claims; and lower settlements of existing claims.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company's provision for personal injury and other claims in the U.S. was as follows:\n\n| In millions                   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Beginning of year             | $  141 | $  145 | $  139 |\n| Accruals and other            | 30     | 28     | 44     |\n| Payments                      | (45)   | (29)   | (31)   |\n| Foreign exchange              | (1)    | (3)    | (7)    |\n| End of year                   | $  125 | $  141 | $  145 |\n| Current portion - End of year | $  25  | $  41  | $  36  |\n\nAlthough the Company considers such provisions to be adequate for all its outstanding and pending claims, the final outcome with respect to actions outstanding or pending at December 31, 2021, or with respect to future claims, cannot be reasonably determined. When establishing provisions for contingent liabilities the Company considers, where a probable loss estimate cannot be made with reasonable certainty, a range of potential probable losses for each such matter, and records the amount it considers the most reasonable estimate within the range. However, when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. For matters where a loss is reasonably possible but not probable, a range of potential losses cannot be estimated due to various factors which may include the limited availability of facts, the lack of demand for specific damages and the fact that proceedings were at an early stage. Based on information currently available, the Company believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against the Company will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, due to the inherent inability to predict with certainty unforeseeable future developments, there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\n\n## Environmental matters\n\nThe Company's operations are subject to numerous federal, provincial, state, municipal and local environmental laws and regulations in Canada and the U.S. concerning, among other things, emissions into the air; discharges into waters; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste, hazardous substances, and other materials; decommissioning of underground and aboveground storage tanks; and soil and groundwater contamination. A risk of environmental liability is inherent in railroad and related transportation operations; real estate ownership, operation or control; and other commercial activities of the Company with respect to both current and past operations.\n\n## Known existing environmental concerns\n\nThe Company is or may be liable for remediation costs at individual sites, in some cases along with other potentially responsible parties, associated with actual or alleged contamination. The ultimate cost of addressing these known contaminated sites cannot be definitively established given that the estimated environmental liability for any given site may vary depending on the nature and extent of the contamination; the nature of anticipated response actions, taking into account the available clean-up techniques; evolving regulatory standards governing environmental liability; and the number of potentially responsible parties and their financial viability. As a result, liabilities are recorded based on the results of a four-phase assessment conducted on a site-by-site basis. A liability is initially recorded when environmental assessments occur, remedial efforts are probable, and when the costs, based on a specific plan of action in terms of the technology to be used and the extent of the corrective action required, can be reasonably estimated. The Company estimates the costs related to a particular site using cost scenarios established by external consultants based on the extent of contamination and expected costs for remedial efforts. In the case of multiple parties, the Company accrues its allocable share of liability taking into account the Company's alleged responsibility, the number of potentially responsible parties and their ability to pay their respective share of the liability. Adjustments to initial estimates are recorded as additional information becomes available.\n\nThe Company's provision for specific environmental sites is undiscounted and includes costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as monitoring costs. Environmental expenses, which are classified as Casualty and other in the Consolidated Statements of Income, include amounts for newly identified sites or contaminants as well as adjustments to initial estimates. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company's provision for specific environmental sites was as follows:\n\n| In millions                   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Beginning of year             | $  59  | $  57  | $  61  |\n| Accruals and other            | 23     | 44     | 31     |\n| Payments                      | (26)   | (42)   | (34)   |\n| Foreign exchange              | -      | -      | (1)    |\n| End of year                   | $  56  | $  59  | $  57  |\n| Current portion - End of year | $  38  | $  46  | $  38  |\n\nThe Company anticipates that the majority of the liability at December 31, 2021 will be paid out over the next five years. Based on the information currently available, the Company considers its provisions to be adequate.\n\n## Unknown existing environmental concerns\n\nWhile the Company believes that it has identified the costs likely to be incurred for environmental matters based on known information, the discovery of new facts, future changes in laws, the possibility of releases of hazardous materials into the environment and the Company's ongoing efforts to identify potential environmental liabilities that may be associated with its properties may result in the identification of additional environmental liabilities and related costs. The magnitude of such additional liabilities and the costs of complying with future environmental laws and containing or remediating contamination cannot be reasonably estimated due to many factors, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the lack of specific technical information available with respect to many sites;\n- \u00b7 the absence of any government authority, third-party orders, or claims with respect to particular sites;\n- \u00b7 the potential for new or changed laws and regulations and for development of new remediation technologies and uncertainty regarding the timing of the work with respect to particular sites; and\n- \u00b7 the determination of the Company's liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties and the ability to recover costs from any third parties with respect to particular sites.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of any such costs being incurred or whether such costs would be material to the Company cannot be determined at this time. There can thus be no assurance that liabilities or costs related to environmental matters will not be incurred in the future, or will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year, or that the Company's liquidity will not be adversely impacted by such liabilities or costs, although management believes, based on current information, that the costs to address environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or liquidity. Costs related to any unknown existing or future contamination will be accrued in the period in which they become probable and reasonably estimable.\n\n## Future occurrences\n\nIn railroad and related transportation operations, it is possible that derailments or other accidents, including spills and releases of hazardous materials, may occur that could cause harm to human health or to the environment. As a result, the Company may incur costs in the future, which may be material, to address any such harm, compliance with laws and other risks, including costs relating to the performance of cleanups, payment of environmental penalties and remediation obligations, and damages relating to harm to individuals or property.\n\n## Regulatory compliance\n\nThe Company may incur significant capital and operating costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance and clean-up requirements, in its railroad operations and relating to its past and present ownership, operation or control of real property. Operating expenses related to regulatory compliance activities for environmental matters for the year ended December 31, 2021 amounted to $27 million (2020 $25 million; 2019 - $25 million). In addition, based on the results of its operations and maintenance programs, as well as ongoing environmental audits and other factors, the Company plans for specific capital improvements on an annual basis. Certain of these improvements help ensure facilities, such as fueling stations, waste water and storm water treatment systems, comply with environmental standards and include new construction and the updating of existing systems and/or processes. Other capital expenditures relate to assessing and remediating certain impaired properties. The Company's environmental capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2021 amounted to $18 million (2020 $20 million; 2019 - $25 million).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Guarantees and indemnifications\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company enters into agreements that may involve providing guarantees or indemnifications to third parties and others, which may extend beyond the term of the agreements. These include, but are not limited to, standby letters of credit, surety and other bonds, and indemnifications that are customary for the type of transaction or for the railway business.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding letters of credit of $394 million (2020 - $421 million) under the committed bilateral letter of credit facilities and $158 million (2020 - $165 million) under the uncommitted bilateral letter of credit facilities, and surety and other bonds of $150 million (2020 - $168 million), all issued by financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings to third parties to indemnify them in the event the Company does not perform its contractual obligations.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, the maximum potential liability under these guarantee instruments was $702 million (2020 - $754 million), of which $659 million (2020 - $688 million) related to other employee benefit liabilities and workers' compensation and $43 million (2020 - $66 million) related to other liabilities. The guarantee instruments expire at various dates between 2022 and 2025.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, the Company had not recorded a liability with respect to guarantees as the Company did not expect to make any payments under its guarantees.\n\n## General indemnifications\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company provides indemnifications, customary for the type of transaction or for the railway business, in various agreements with third parties, including indemnification provisions where the Company would be required to indemnify third parties and others. During the year, the Company entered into various contracts with third parties for which an indemnification was provided. Due to the nature of the indemnification clauses, the maximum exposure for future payments cannot be reasonably determined. To the extent of any actual claims under these agreements, the Company maintains provisions for such items, which it considers to be adequate. As at December 31, 2021, the Company had not recorded a liability with respect to any indemnifications.\n\n## 22 - Financial instruments\n\n## Risk management\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to various risks from its use of financial instruments. To manage these risks, the Company follows a financial risk management framework, which is monitored and approved by the Company's Audit, Finance and Risk Committee, with a goal of maintaining a strong balance sheet, optimizing earnings per share and free cash flow, financing its operations at an optimal cost of capital and preserving its liquidity. The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments in the management of its risks and does not hold or issue them for trading or speculative purposes.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Company conducts its business in both Canada and the U.S. and as a result, is affected by currency fluctuations. Changes in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the US dollar affect the Company's revenues and expenses. To manage foreign currency risk, the Company designates US dollar-denominated debt of the parent company as a foreign currency hedge of its net investment in foreign operations. As a result, from the dates of designation, foreign exchange gains and losses on translation of the Company's US dollardenominated debt are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, which minimizes volatility of earnings resulting from the conversion of US dollar-denominated debt into the Canadian dollar.\n\nThe Company also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk. As at December 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts with a notional value of US$910 million (2020 - US$397 million) at a weighted-average exchange rate of $1.27 per US$1.00 (2020 - $1.32 per US$1.00) for a weighted-average term of 251 days (2020 - 151 days). Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts, resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates, are recognized in Other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income as they occur. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a loss of $18 million (2020 - loss of $3 million; 2019 - loss of $75 million) related to foreign exchange forward contracts. These losses were largely offset by the re-measurement of US dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities recognized in Other income. As at December 31, 2021, the fair value of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts included in Other current assets and Accounts payable and other was $nil and $2 million, respectively (2020 - $nil and $18 million, respectively).",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk, which is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will vary as a result of changes in market interest rates. Such risk exists in relation to the Company's debt. The Company mainly issues fixed-rate debt, which exposes the Company to variability in the fair value of the debt. The Company also issues debt with variable interest rates, which exposes the Company to variability in interest expense.\n\nTo manage interest rate risk, the Company manages its borrowings in line with liquidity needs, maturity schedule, and currency and interest rate profile. In anticipation of future debt issuances, the Company may use derivative instruments such as forward rate agreements. The Company does not currently hold any significant derivative instruments to manage its interest rate risk.\n\n## Fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe financial instruments that the Company measures at fair value on a recurring basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition are categorized into the following levels of the fair value hierarchy based on the degree to which inputs are observable:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: Inputs are quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets\n- \u00b7 Level 2: Significant inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are observable\n- \u00b7 Level 3: Significant inputs are unobservable\n\nThe carrying amounts of Cash and cash equivalents and Restricted cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value. These financial instruments include highly liquid investments purchased three months or less from maturity, for which the fair value is determined by reference to quoted prices in active markets.\n\nThe carrying amounts of Accounts receivable, Other current assets and Accounts payable and other approximate fair value due to their short maturity, unless otherwise specified. The fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values, included in Intangible assets, goodwill and other, is classified as Level 1 with gains and losses being recorded in Other income within the Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of derivative financial instruments, included in Other current assets and Accounts payable and other is classified as Level 2 and is used to manage the Company's exposure to foreign currency risk. The fair value is measured by discounting future cash flows using a discount rate derived from market data for financial instruments subject to similar risks and maturities. The fair value of assets held for sale, included in Other current assets is classified as Level 3. Additional disclosures are provided in Note 5 - Assets held for sale.\n\nThe carrying amount of the Company's debt does not approximate fair value. The fair value is estimated based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt instruments, as well as discounted cash flows using current interest rates for debt with similar terms, company rating, and remaining maturity. The Company classifies debt as Level 2. As at December 31, 2021, the Company's debt, excluding finance leases, had a carrying amount of $12,475 million (2020 - $12,832 million) and a fair value of $14,424 million (2020 - $16,046 million).\n\n## 23 - Segmented information\n\nThe Company manages its operations as one business segment over a single network that spans vast geographic distances and territories, with operations in Canada and the U.S. Financial information reported at this level, such as revenues, operating income, and cash flow from operations, is used by the Company's management, including its chief operating decision-maker, in evaluating financial and operational performance and allocating resources across CN's network.\n\nThe Company's strategic initiatives, which drive its operational direction, are developed and managed centrally by management and are communicated to its regional activity centers (the Western Region and Eastern Region). The Company's management is responsible for, among others, CN's marketing strategy, the management of large customer accounts, overall planning and control of infrastructure and rolling stock, the allocation of resources, and other functions such as financial planning, accounting and treasury.\n\nThe role of each region is to manage the day-to-day service requirements within their respective territories and control direct costs incurred locally. Such cost control is required to ensure that pre-established efficiency standards set at the corporate level are met. The regions execute the overall corporate strategy and operating plan established by the Company's management, as the regions' management of throughput and control of direct costs does not serve as the platform for the Company's decision-making process. Approximately 95% of the Company's freight revenues are from national accounts for which freight traffic spans North America and touches various commodity groups. As a result, the Company does not manage revenues on a regional basis since a large number of the movements originate in one region and pass through and/ or terminate in another region.\n\nThe regions also demonstrate common characteristics in each of the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 each region's sole business activity is the transportation of freight over the Company's extensive rail network;\n- \u00b7 the regions service national accounts that extend over the Company's various commodity groups and across its rail network;\n- \u00b7 the services offered by the Company stem predominantly from the transportation of freight by rail with the goal of optimizing the rail network as a whole; and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN\n\n|",
