        "page_content": "## Message from the chair of the board\n\n## Dear fellow investors,\n\nAt the time of publishing this annual report, we are deeply concerned for the people suffering from the invasion of Ukraine. Equinor has made swift decisions to stop trading Russian oil and investments into Russia and has started the process of exiting the company's joint ventures in the country. We are committed to complying with relevant sanctions and continue to take actions to protect our people and operations.\n\nIn the situation we are in, Equinor holds an important role as a reliable provider of energy. In September 2022, Equinor celebrates its 50-year anniversary. The company has created value as an early mover and industry shaper for decades, and we are proud of this legacy and our purpose to turn natural resources into energy for people and progress for society. Looking ahead, we have a strategy to drive the energy transition and capture the opportunities that lie in front of us.\n\nSafety is the highest priority for the company and the board of directors. Last year, our serious incident frequency improved compared to 2020, but we still have too many personal injuries related to our activities. The board is therefore working closely with the administration to turn the trend. Strong collaboration with employee representatives, partners and suppliers is key to further improve our safety performance.\n\nIn 2021, we have seen a significant increase in commodity prices compared to 2020, with a surge in natural gas prices that had a direct impact on people and societies. This is an important reminder of the significance of our industry, underlining the need for a reliable and affordable supply of energy through the transition.\n\nAt our capital markets day in June 2021, we launched our updated strategy to accelerate our transition while growing cashflow and returns. With our highly valuable upstream portfolio and our premium project pipeline we have an advantaged starting point. This gives us a solid platform for funding profitable growth in renewables and shaping new markets within low carbon solutions. All to build the company and the industry of tomorrow.\n\nIn line with our strategy and ambitions, we launched the Norway energy hub. This is an industrial plan for Norway as an energy nation. Equinor invites partners and governments to collaborate on creating the energy systems of the future. We aim to decarbonise oil and gas, industrialise offshore wind and hydrogen, and provide commercial carbon capture and storage. This will build new value chains and facilitate industrial development, investments, and jobs.\n\nDuring 2021, Equinor reached important milestones. We made the final investment decision for the projects Bacalhau in Brazil and Troll West electrification in Norway. We have also focused the international oil and gas portfolio by exiting several assets and countries. This improves robustness and profitability and enables us to capitalise on our legacy business while transitioning to new activities.\n\nEquinor delivered strong financial results in 2021, as a result of higher commodity prices, continued improvements, and strict capital discipline. We achieved a total shareholder return of 62%, bringing us to the first quartile in our peer group 1 . Our net income was around USD 8.6 billion, compared to negative USD 5.5 billion in 2020. Driven by high cashflow we have improved our adjusted net debt ratio from 32% in 2020 to below zero in 2021.\n\nDuring the year we have increased our cash dividend, from USD 0.15 per share in the first quarter to USD 0.18 per share in the third. In addition, we have executed our share buyback programme as part of our capital distribution. For the fourth quarter of the year, the board proposes to the AGM a cash dividend of USD 0.20 per share, and an extraordinary quarterly dividend of the same amount.\n\nLast year, we announced that we will submit our energy transition plan for advisory vote to shareholders at the annual general meeting in May 2022. Sustainability has been integrated in our business for many years, and this plan outlines how we will progress our efforts towards 2030 and beyond. At our capital markets update in February 2022, we announced a step-up in our climate ambitions, as we aim to reduce our groupwide net emissions by 50% within 2030.\n\nEquinor's transition is well underway. We have taken important steps to deliver on our 2050 net zero ambition, while continuing to create high value. I would like to express my appreciation for our employees' hard work and dedication and thank our shareholders for their continued investment.\n\nJon Erik Reinhardsen Chair of the board",

        "page_content": "## Chief executive letter\n\n## Dear fellow shareholder,\n\nWe submit our annual report at a time when the situation in Europe, and the markets we operate in, have changed significantly. Our thoughts are with all those suffering the consequences from the invasion of Ukraine. The safety and security of our people and ensuring stable deliveries of energy to Europe under these circumstances are our top priorities. The conditions for civilians are devastating, and Equinor has committed to contributing to the humanitarian efforts in the region. The invasion and subsequent sanctions from the international community will affect the global economy and energy markets going forward. It is, however, too early to foresee the total effects.\n\nIn 2021, Equinor laid the foundation for long-term value-creation and continued growth. We launched our updated strategy to capitalise on an advantaged oil and gas portfolio, accelerate high value growth in renewables, and shape new markets within low carbon solutions. The strategy will enable us to develop the industrial solutions needed to support societies towards a low carbon future, and to position Equinor as a leading company in the energy transition.\n\nLast year, the world saw increased economic activity, growing demand for energy and rising commodity prices. Regrettably, we also had recurring waves of Covid-19 infections affecting people and societies.\n\nMy number one priority during the year was to keep everyone working for Equinor safe. It is encouraging to see a declining trend in the serious incident frequency compared to 2020. However, we have seen a slight increase in the total injury frequency. Going forward, we will continue working systematically to improve these results and ensure the safety of everyone working for us. In 2021, we launched a new framework for major accident prevention, representing a key milestone in the way we work to safeguard our people, assets, and the environment.\n\nWe have delivered forcefully on our strategy and ambitions in 2021. In the North Sea, we brought new gas with low CO2 emissions on stream from the Troll phase 3 project. The asset has large recoverable volumes, a breakeven price below USD 10 per barrel, and will extend the field's life by decades. Driven by our purpose of turning natural resources into energy for people and progress for society, Equinor was a reliable supplier of gas to Europe during the year, increasing production to meet rising demand.\n\nIn 2021, we continued the development of Equinor as a leading company within renewables. We booked substantial capital gains of USD 1.4 billion, demonstrating how we add value through early access, project maturation and divestments. Our largest project under construction is now Dogger Bank, the giant wind farm. The full development will have capacity of around 3.6 gigawatt, about 5% of the total UK power demand.\n\nWithin low carbon solutions, we are contributing to decarbonisation of industries and sustainable growth. In Norway, construction started on the onshore facilities for Northern Lights CO2 transport and storage. This is one of the world's first projects to offer this solution as a service to industrial customers and demonstrates our ability to develop full scale systems. On the UK east coast, we are building a net zero industrial cluster in collaboration with authorities, customers, partners, and suppliers. Together, we will deliver hydrogen and carbon capture and storage for a low carbon future.\n\nOur investments in renewables and low carbon solutions increased from 4% to 11% of gross capex 2 , demonstrating our commitment to drive the energy transition. We expect a further increase to more than 30% in 2025, and above 50% in 2030. We also have a profitable pipeline of oil and gas projects coming on stream by 2030, with low emissions, short payback time, and average breakeven price below USD 35 per barrel.\n\nIn 2021, we demonstrated Equinor's ability to generate value for our shareholders and for the societies where we operate. We delivered strong financial results, with a net operating income of USD 34 billion. Return on average capital employed increased from 2% to 23% compared to the previous year, and the rebased production growth of oil and gas increased by around 3%. The adjusted earnings were USD 33 billion before tax, and USD 10 billion after tax 2 .\n\nWe have maintained a continuous cost focus and captured higher prices through solid operating performance. I am deeply thankful and proud of the work our people have done to achieve this.\n\nIn 2022, it is 50 years since Equinor was founded. Throughout our history, we have been a partner for governments and society, pioneering the field of offshore energy production. We will build upon this legacy as a key industrial company when we progress on our ambition to become a net-zero company by 2050.\n\nAnders Opedal President and CEO",

During 2021 further steps were taken on the path from recovery to expansion, and the economic growth for the full year was 5.6% year on year according to IMF 3 . However, the rapid demand recovery generated significant imbalances in several markets, resulting in climbing inflation across countries. Moreover, supply shortages and transport bottlenecks triggered by the pandemic response proved far more persistent than anticipated, and labour shortages and a confluence of other factors evoked surging energy prices.\n\nDespite ongoing concerns about new Covid variants, comprehensive vaccination programmes in western economies allowed for economies to open and growth to pick up. A sharp recovery, particularly in the first half of the year was led by an upswing in aggregate demand boosted by households' release of excess savings and pent-up demand for goods and services. Entering the autumn, the built-up imbalances became more evident, and threats of new Covid variants were looming. In 3Q 2021 the global expansion weakened, due to the Delta variant disruptions, rising inflation and broadening supply shortages slowing the activity level in the industrial sector.\n\nAmidst record high inflation, increasing labour market tightness and fiscal policy hurdles, the US economy rebounded sharply, and 2021 GDP growth was at 5.6% year on year. The Eurozone's 2021 GDP growth was at 5.2% year on year, backed by solid\n\nincrease in demand, but the energy crisis and mobility restrictions during the autumn dampened growth. China's growth rate for 2021 was 8.1% year on year, but economic activity abated during the year, faced with headwinds from the real estate sector, an energy crunch and intermediate goods shortages limiting manufacturing output and growth.\n\nEconomic development in 2021 was strong, but major uncertainties remain as the pandemic still maintains its grip. Furthermore, the energy crisis seen during the year may reflect conflicting objectives of the energy transition. Current renewable energy generation capacity has not yet proven to be of sufficient size to meet demand, and that potentially points to higher and more energy inflation ahead. Given the softer pace of growth in 4Q 2021 the handoff to 2022 was weak. Broad price pressures continue to eat into purchasing power and could spill over to wage rises in tight labour markets. Inflationary concerns have led major central banks towards faster monetary tightening, and the pace of US monetary tightening could have widespread impact on global financial markets and economic growth. The near-term outlook hinges on the spread of Omicron and corresponding restrictions on economic activity, with China's zero Covid-tolerance being a potential threat to growth with international repercussions. Despite expectations of gradual easing, continued upward inflationary pressures from supply chain disruptions and elevated energy prices could also dampen growth momentum. Global growth in 2022 is expected to be 4.2% year on year, with risks skewed towards the downside.\n\n## Oil prices and refinery margins\n\nOil prices were on a rising trend throughout 2021, although not a smooth and steady one. Dated Brent rose from 50 USD/ barrel in early January to 77 USD/barrel by the end of",

        "page_content": "## Strategic report\n\nDecember, with a peak of 86 USD/barrel in late October. The annual average price rose from 41.7 USD/barrel in 2020 to 70.7 USD/barrel in 2021. Global crude oil balances were generally in deficit throughout the year. The IEA shows the deficit at -1.1 million barrels/day, or -400 million barrels throughout the year. This resulted in the large storage build-up during 2020, gradually being reversed. By the end of the year, global stocks were at the low end of a 5-year range, and the oil market was perceived to be tight.\n\nA main contribution to the tightness was that Opec+ agreed in July to keep raising their output level by 0.4 million barrels/day each month through September 2022, when output is expected to return to the same level as in October 2018. Opec+ is the cooperation between Opec and Russia, plus nine other states. As part of the agreement, monthly meetings were held to evaluate the need for changes to this plan based on market developments. This brought some predictability to the market, resulting in less volatility when compared to 2020. Another contribution was that US shale oil companies were under pressure from their shareholders to use their higher cashflow to pay debt and dividends, rather than to drill more wells and increase production.\n\nIn 1Q 2021, prices rose in January as Saudi Arabia announced an extra voluntary cut of 1 million barrels/day. This led to a scramble for alternative supply. Much ended up being taken from the US, leading to additional stock draws. However, prices stalled at 55 USD/barrel as the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA) talks regarding Iran's nuclear program resumed, leading to increased likelihood over an immediate end to US sanctions on Iranian oil exports and significant supply returning to market. The round of negotiations ended without result, but Iran was seen to raise crude oil supply to China anyway without obvious impact on prices. In February, prices continued to rise as vaccination programs started in earnest and expectations of an end to mobility restrictions. Along with further cuts announced by Saudi Arabia in early March, this pushed the price up to 69 USD/ barrel. However, in late March, news of potential problems with the AstraZeneca vaccine and a dip in Chinese buying led to a drop to 64 USD/ barrel.\n\nIn 2Q 2021, prices rose again, reaching 70 USD/ barrel by midMay. Demand rose while Opec and Russian supply remained restricted. However, market concerns persisted, with new virus outbreaks in Asia, and a new round of JCPOA talks leading again to expectations of additional crude oil from Iran returning to market. The level at 70 USD/ barrel was largely related to investor's positions, but as prices did not break the 70 USD/ barrel mark, the underlying futures contracts were sold, leading to a drop to 66 USD/ barrel in late May. Also, the Colonial pipeline, the main product pipeline from Houston to New York suffered a hacker attack, leading to stock builds on the Gulf Coast. In June, easing of mobility restrictions led to a demand rise that was higher than the restricted supply growth from Saudi Arabia and Russia, taking prices up to 76 USD/ barrel by end of June. The tight market led the Biden Administration to ask Opec to raise output just after the IEA released their Net Zero Emission report.\n\nIn 3Q 2021, prices fell gradually back to 66 USD/ barrel in midAugust, before rising again to 78 USD/ barrel by endSeptember. In early July, the Opec+ cooperation was formalized,\n\nsaying that output from the group each month would rise by 0.4 million barrel/d. The fall in price to 66 USD/ barrel was largely due to uncertainty over demand, caused by the outbreak of the Covid-19 Delta variant. Adding to the weakness, China started to restrict product export quotas, leading to lower crude oil intake. In late August, the hurricane Ida hit the US Gulf coast, leading to a loss of around 30 million barrels of Gulf of Mexico production. Along with stagnant shale oil production, this led to low stocks in the US. European stocks had fallen to 2019 levels at the end of the quarter, supporting a price rise in September. Gas prices saw a significant increase to levels above those for oil products. This led to expectations for a shift in demand from gas to oil in power plants and for heating.\n\nIn 4Q 2021, prices first rose to 86 USD/ barrel in late October, then tapered off, before falling to below 70 USD/ barrel in late December, finally ending the volatile year at 77 USD/ barrel. The rise was caused by concern that several Opec countries appeared to no longer have the production capacity that the Opec+ production quota increase was based on. This was mainly due to low field investments and maintenance issues. Even Russia was seen close to actual capacity. That raised questions over where supply in 2022 should come from. Price reactions were still muted by expectations for a strong rise in US shale oil supply at this price level. On November 25, news of the Omicron virus emerged. The next day, oil prices had their largest single-day drop ever, by 9 USD/ barrel. Prices stayed low in December on fears of new lockdowns which would reduce demand. The rise at year-end was a paper market effect. Investors who held equities and bonds feared that the high inflation in the US would lead to rising interest rates, which would reduce values of equities and fixed-rate bonds. They therefore shifted portfolios toward commodities that would follow or drive inflation, including oil.\n\n## Refinery margins\n\nRefinery margins in North-West Europe stayed low in 1Q 2021 and moderate in 2Q 2021. They then rose sharply throughout 3Q 2021, while the level in 4Q 2021 was the highest for at least the past 10 years. The development largely followed the growth in products demand, as virus restrictions were eased and vaccination programs gained speed. IEA shows global demand rising by 5.7 million barrels per day from 93.3 in 1Q 2021 to 99.0 in 4Q 2021. Refinery intake only rose by 4.5 million barrels per day. A reason for the lower intake growth was developments in China. In June, authorities put taxes on imports of gasoline and diesel components, which had earlier let independent refineries have a margin advantage on such components. In 4Q 2021, they also reduced the crude import and product export quotas for domestic refineries as part of efforts to reduce carbon emissions. As a result, Chinese refinery intake did not rise from 1Q 2021 to 4Q 2021, despite the start-up of two large new refineries. US Gulf Coast capacity was also hit first by a cold snap in February and then by Hurricane Ida in September, both leading to periods of outage.\n\nThe very high margins in 4Q 2021 mask a much higher operating cost level. Gas prices rose sharply, and many refineries are fuelled with grid gas. Many also use gas to produce hydrogen, which is used for desulphurisation of products, and in certain upgrading units. High gas prices also led to higher prices of electricity and for carbon emission allowances, as more of the electricity came from coal-fired plants. Effects were then",

The cost level led to a preference for light, low-sulphur crudes that require little hydrogen use. Margins peaked in October, as the emergence of the Omicron virus in late November led to concerns about demand ahead.\n\n## Natural gas prices\n\n## Gas prices - Europe\n\nThe European gas market experienced an unprecedented price rally in 2021 only a year after a strong drop in demand and an oversupplied market. The average gas price in 2021 rallied to 15.8 USD/mmBtu TTF, which is five times higher than the average gas price in 2020 of 3.2 USD/mmBtu. The combination of robust demand growth as economies recovered from the Covid pandemic, prolonged winter, dry summer, and unplanned supply outages led to tight markets. The continuation of strong Asian and South American demand for LNG in the summer, combined with continued supply constraints for LNG and European production, meant that Europe was unable to restock at anywhere near a normal rate, thus putting upward pressure on gas prices. The real shock for the market came, however, in Q4 2021 when Russian pipeline supply via the Yamal-Europe route dropped sharply to less than a third of normal levels. In the second part of December, the shipments via the Yamal-Europe switched to reverse flows from Germany to Poland. That, together with French nuclear issues, and below than normal temperatures drew European storage stocks significantly down below their 5-year average in mid-December and resulted in a record gas price of above 60 USD/mmBtu on 21 December 2021.\n\n## Gas prices - North America\n\nT he Henry Hub spot price averaged 3.9 USD/mmBtu for the year, nearly doubling from 2.0 USD/mmBtu in 2020. Modest production growth, resilient demand and strong LNG exports were key factors driving the price increase. Despite higher oil and gas prices, producers kept focus on free cash flow and balance sheet repairs rather than production growth. Drilling activity increased in 4Q21, but overall growth remained below 2% year-over-year . On the demand side, low coal inventory forced the thermal power market to burn more natural gas than coal-to-gas switching economics would normally incentivise . Residential, commercial, and industrial demand remained unchanged. US LNG exports grew by 50% year-over-year, from 64 Bcm to 96 Bcm. In addition to new export capacity on the US Gulf Coast, favorable international gas prices , in Europe and Japan in particular, drove terminal utilization up and exports to record highs\n\n## Global LNG prices\n\nThe global LNG market has seen extraordinary high prices during 2021. This was caused by a cold winter with power shortages in the Far East as well as strong Chinese buying during the spring months, which are usually a period with seasonally low imports, as well as a series of both planned and unforeseen outages (Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway and the US).  While around 170 to 180 cargoes were cancelled in 2020 as prompt price fell below what was needed to cover marginal cost of production, none were cancelled in 2021 for that reason. It has been a year of extreme price movements ,\n\nwith the lowest reported price at 5.56 USD/mmBtu and the highest reported price at 56.33 USD/mmBtu , with an average of 18.6 USD/mmBtu. It was the year when natural gas became a premium product compared to crude oil as gas overtook oil in price per energy content . A key market driver of price has been the volatility in the European gas markets as the Far East and Europe compete for the same cargoes globally. As an effect, European price shocks have filtered into the Asian LNG price.\n\n## European electric power and CO2 prices\n\nElectric power prices in the major Western European markets (UK, France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Spain and Italy) averaged 112.5 EUR/MWh in 2021, more than a trebling compared to 2020. While the Covid-19 crisis dampened demand and prices in 2020, 2021 was characterised by surging commodity and EU ETS prices, lower than expected wind output and recovering electric power demand as Covid-19 measures eased. Power prices were relatively stable in the first half of the year, before skyrocketing after the summer. December ended up with a staggering average price of 256 EUR/MWh, more than a quadrupling since January. Gas prices saw a similar increase as power in the same period, while the EU ETS price more than doubled. The EU ETS reached record highs in 2021, with the price reaching a peak of 90 EUR/t on 8 December. The surge in allowance prices was driven by several factors, including 1) reduced number of allowances through the market stability reserve mechanism, 2) expectations of future market tightness through the EU 'Fit-for-55' package, and 3) fuel-switching to more carbon intensive coal due to high gas prices, thus increasing emissions and the demand for allowances. The German electricity sector emissions rose for the first time since 2013 causing them to miss 2021 climate targets, even if more than 40% of the sector's electric power generation came from renewables. In the EU, installations of new renewable capacity were record high in 2021, adding 24 GW of solar and 17 GW of wind capacity.\n\n## Equinor's corporate strategy\n\nEquinor is an international energy company committed to long term value creation in a low carbon future. Equinor is inspired by its vision of being a leading company in the energy transition on a path to net zero. Therefore:\n\nEquinor's updated strategy is to create value as a leader in the energy transition by pursuing high-value growth in renewables and new markets opportunities in low carbon solutions at the same time as it optimises its oil and gas portfolio. Equinor's strategy continues to be guided by the three strategic pillars: Always safe, High value, Low carbon.\n\nEquinor is changing from a position of strength. With a highly competent organisation, our values at the core and a long history of technology and innovation, Equinor is in a unique position to become a leading company in the energy transition. Nevertheless, Equinor recognises that climate change has become the major challenge in the energy context which remains volatile. The world's energy systems are in rapid transition to meet the challenge. The journey towards net zero",

As Equinor transforms, it must strike the right balance between generating cashflow to enable the transition, supporting our core business, growing in new energy areas and continuing as an attractive investment for our shareholders. To do so, Equinor is concentrating its strategy realisation and development around the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Optimised oil and gas portfolio - strengthening competitiveness and value creation with reducing emissions from operations as top priority. New exploration acreage will be focused on areas with existing infrastructure, limiting our frontier exploration.\n- \u00b7 High value growth in renewables - building a profitable business and looking to increase returns on offshore wind through regional synergies, project financing, strategic farm downs to be among the top global players in offshore wind and test future business in selected onshore markets.\n- \u00b7 New market opportunities in low carbon solutions - using our capabilities and operational experience from carbon capture and storage at Sleipner and Sn\u00f8hvit to develop low carbon solutions and value chains aiming for a leadership position in the European CCS market with a market share above 25%.\n\nWhile concentrating on the areas above to develop and realise its strategy, Equinor's strategic pillars remain firm and continue to guide our business.\n\nAlways safe - safety is Equinor's top priority. Equinor works hard to reduce risk and avoid incidents and injuries, both among our own employees and those of our suppliers. Everyone working for Equinor should return safely from work and Equinor will step up its safety performance through a One Equinor culture, more proactive safety leadership and forceful implementation of the 'I am Safety' Roadmap.\n\nHigh value - Equinor will drive competitive performance and efficiency improvements will remain a priority. Equinor's growing oil and gas cashflow will enable the transformation and ensure value creation for Equinor's shareholders and society. NCS assets are expected to generate substantial cashflow during the coming decade. The portfolio is resilient to low prices, has fast return on investments and world-class breakevens. We are growing cashflow from our international portfolio, making it more robust towards lower prices. Projects in Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico, coming onstream from the mid-2020s, will contribute significantly. Through our positions in the offshore wind market and European low carbon solutions, we will build a pipeline of future projects. We will utilise our trading and midstream capabilities to optimise the portfolio of commodities that we provide to our customers, together with new products and services from low carbon solutions.\n\nLow carbon - Equinor's long-term ambition is to become a net zero company by 2050. Equinor has set interim ambitions for its portfolio, to establish a pathway to net zero. Equinor aims to reduce its group-wide emissions by 50% by 2030, reinforcing its commitment to reduce net carbon intensity for the energy provided by 20% by 2030 and 40% by 2035. Those ambitions are backed by actions such as: Reducing emissions from our oil and gas operations, increasing renewables capacity, establishing value chains in CCS and hydrogen, increasing the\n\nshare of non-combusted products from hydrocarbons, and using high-quality carbon sinks. In the longer term, a decline in oil and gas production will also drive reductions in net carbon intensity towards net zero in 2050.\n\nWith its clear ambition to become a net zero energy company by 2050, Equinor maintains its advantage as a leading company in carbon-efficient oil and gas production while building a low carbon business to capture new opportunities in the energy transition. Equinor believes a lower carbon footprint will make it more competitive in the future and sustainability is integrated in Equinor's strategic work. Our four sustainability priorities are closely linked with our strategic pillars and focus areas. Further information can be found in section 2.14 Safety, security and sustainability and in the 2021 Sustainability report.\n\nTo deliver on the strategy, Equinor has four key strategic enablers that strengthen the company's competitiveness:\n\n- \u00b7 Safety, security, and sustainability (SSU) is focused on taking care of people, the environment and assets while enabling Equinor's accelerated transition. Stakeholder expectations on safety, security and sustainability are ever increasing and Equinor aims to meet them.

        "page_content": "on the energy transition opportunities where it would matter the most.\n\n- \u00b7 Our people are our most valuable asset, and it is their collective competence that enables us to deliver on our strategy. To deliver on the energy transition we are adapting, expanding and replenishing our competence and capacity to meet new business challenges. We are building on strong core competencies and we are investing in learning to support our employees in accelerating the development of their skillsets. This also means attracting and retaining key talent in a highly competitive market and we are further strengthening our talent attraction and retention efforts, creating engagement and pride around our purpose and strategy. Our focus on flexibility, collaboration and inclusiveness will continue, along with the evolution of our operating model and ways of working to further strengthen our competitiveness.\n\nWith the updated strategy focusing on leadership and value creation in the energy transition and supported by its existing pillars and updated enablers, the Business Areas (BAs) are well on the way with their response to realise and execute on Equinor's new strategy.\n\n## Transforming the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS) to deliver value for decades\n\nFor 50 years, Equinor has explored, developed and produced oil and gas from the NCS. It represents approximately 65% of Equinor's equity production at more than 1.35 mmboe per day in 2021. The cashflow from NCS in 2021 reached a record high of more than USD 20 billion. We expect that NCS cash flow and value generation capacity will continue to be substantial going forward.\n\nEquinor is continuing to add highly profitable barrels through exploration and increased oil and gas recovery. In 2021 Equinor made eight commercial discoveries in areas close to existing infrastructure. The production outlook for the next decade has been further strengthened with an expected production growth towards 2026 and a 2030 forecast at current production level.\n\nIn 2021 several important projects were approved, and new projects came on stream. The partners in the \u00c5sgard licence decided to invest approximately NOK 1.4 billion to further develop the field and implement the \u00c5sgard B low-pressure project. The plan for developing the Breidablikk field was approved. Both Martin Linge and Troll phase 3 came on stream. With a breakeven price of less than USD 10 per barrel oil equivalents, Troll phase 3 is one of the most profitable projects in Equinor's history. The gas is also produced with record-low CO2 emissions, less than 0.1 kilo per barrel oil equivalent.\n\nEquinor is continuing to improve the efficiency, reliability, carbon emissions and lifespan of fields already in production - with all time high Production Efficiency for EPN assets and all-time low maintenance backlog. The unit for late life assets (FLX) has continued to develop new ways of working to realize the full potential of our late life fields. The results from FLX so far are promising with realized improvements on safety indicators, operational performance, and financial results.\n\nOur efforts to reduce CO2 emissions from NCS operations are progressing. Continued focus on operational measures are\n\nreducing current and near-term emissions. The CO2 abatement portfolio is maturing; the Sleipner and the Troll West partial electrification were approved by the authorities during 2021 while the PDO for Oseberg gas capacity upgrade and partial electrification was submitted to the authorities in November 2021.\n\nIn 3Q 2021 Equinor launched Norway energy hub, an industrial plan for the energy nation Norway, pointing at steps to be taken during the next decade. The plan is both an invitation to collaborate and a specification of what it takes to create new sustainable energy value chains for a net-zero future. The purpose is to contribute to the transition Norway will go through during the next decades. The plan outlines how Norway can maintain its position as an energy nation through investment in new renewable and low carbon industries. It shows what is needed to decarbonise oil and gas production, industrialise offshore wind, commercialise transport and storage of CO2 and scale up hydrogen production. The plan includes investment estimates and points at policies necessary to trigger investments. It is not a plan for Equinor alone, rather an invitation to facilitate cooperation between Norwegian companies, the State and other organisations. This broad collaboration is necessary to ensure that Norway meets its climate goals, further develops expertise, creates new industrial jobs, provides stable access to more renewable energy and maintains the position as a reliable provider of clean energy.\n\n## Transforming the value of international oil and gas\n\nEquinor has built its international oil and gas portfolio over the past 30 years, representing approximately 35% of Equinor's equity production at 0.7 million boe per day in 2021.\n\nIn 2021, Equinor made significant progress to focus and optimise its oil and gas portfolio with country exits from: Australia, Ireland (Corrib divestment to be completed in 2022), Kazakhstan, Mexico, Nicaragua, and South Africa. Further, the following assets were divested within established country positions: Bakken and Austin Chalk (US onshore), Terra Nova (Canada) and Bajo del Toro Este / Aguila Mora Noreste (Argentina onshore).\n\nEquinor continues to optimise its strong set of development projects, and in 2021, made the final investment decision for Phase 1 of its operated Bacalhau field, off the Brazilian coast. Two satellites to block 17 in Angola came onstream. Aligned with its focused exploration strategy, Equinor is appraising the operated Monument discovery in the US Gulf of Mexico.\n\nOn the climate front, Equinor is assessing the potential for low carbon value chains around key international upstream assets. In the US northeast, Equinor is collaborating with partners and major industrial players to assess blue hydrogen and CCS around its onshore natural gas position.\n\n## Renewables - Developing a high value business\n\nThe renewable industry is changing and growing at an unprecedented pace, presenting opportunities for decades of growth. Equinor has a strong renewable development portfolio, and we are leveraging our core competencies in managing complex oil and gas projects when growing in offshore wind. By 2026 Equinor expects to significantly increase installed capacity from renewable projects under development, mainly based",

        "page_content": "## Strategic report\n\non the current project portfolio. Towards 2030, Equinor expects to increase installed renewables capacity further to between 12 and 16 GW 4 , depending on availability of attractive project opportunities.\n\n## Becoming a global offshore wind major\n\nEquinor has the last year continued to develop and optimise its offshore wind portfolio. The two first Dogger Bank projects are under construction and the last phase of the development, Dogger Bank C (1.2 GW), has been brough to investment decision in 2021. Equinor also adjusted the equity share by farming down a 10% stake to ENI in 4Q the same year to realise value.  Dogger Bank will be the world's largest offshore wind farm development with an installed capacity of 3.6 GW - enough to supply 5% of UK electricity demand.\n\nIn the beginning of the year Equinor and bp completed their previously announced transaction in the US, whereby Equinor has sold a 50% interest in both the Empire Wind and Beacon Wind assets on the US east coast. The transaction was the first step in the strategic partnership in offshore wind where Equinor and bp are combining strengths to enable profitable growth in offshore wind in the US. Equinor will remain the operator of the projects in these leases through the development, construction and operations phases, and the wind farms will be equally staffed in operations.\n\nIn South Korea, Equinor continues to develop its position by developing an offshore wind portfolio and building local partnerships. In 4Q 2021 Equinor signed a memorandum of understanding with Korea East-West Power (EWP), one of South Korea's state-owned power generation companies, to cooperate on 3 gigawatts of offshore wind projects in the country. The partnership with EWP provides a strong basis for Equinor to develop a leading role in developing a pipeline of offshore wind projects needed in South Korea's ongoing energy transition. Equinor has also strengthened its position in the future Norwegian offshore wind market by entering into a collaboration agreement with V\u00e5rgr\u00f8nn, a Norwegian renewable energy company established by HitecVision and Eni. The collaboration aims to jointly prepare and submit an application to the Norwegian authorities to develop floating offshore wind at Utsira North in the Norwegian North Sea.\n\nAnother collaboration agreement between Equinor, RWE Renewables and Hydro REIN was also signed early in 2021 for offshore wind in Norway. The three partners agreed to jointly prepare and submit an application to the Norwegian authorities to develop a large-scale bottom-fixed offshore wind farm in the Southern North Sea 2 area in the Norwegian North Sea. The partnership represents a strong combination of experience and expertise from offshore wind development, energy market insight and large-scale industrial project execution.\n\nIn the floating part of the offshore wind industry, Equinor continued the construction of Hywind Tampen, which will be the first floating windfarm connected to an oil and gas installation. Equinor believes floating wind has a large potential as up to 80% of the world's offshore wind potential will likely require floating solutions and continues to develop the portfolio as well as its efforts to reduce cost and risks to improve the\n\nattractiveness of this technology globally. Our ambition is to bring floating wind towards commerciality by 2030.\n\n## Maturing opportunities in onshore renewables\n\nEquinor believes in diversifying its renewable business and pursuing additional growth options in new markets and geographies. Having a flexible portfolio gives us the ability to provide power from numerous renewable energy sources including offshore wind, energy storage, solar and onshore wind. Over time we expect to build a profitable onshore growth platform in selected power markets. Last year Equinor expanded is activities by the acquisition of 100% of the shares in Polish onshore renewables developer Wento from the private equity firm Enterprise Investors. The transaction strengthened and diversified our portfolio in Poland. It gives Equinor an onshore growth platform in a transition market set for significant renewables growth.\n\nEquinor sees a solid opportunity to create profitable businesses by deploying batteries and storage assets to satisfy the growing need to stabilize power markets, either as a part of offshore or onshore renewable assets or as separate units suppling services to the grid. In addition, Equinor is exploring opportunities and cooperation within the green hydrogen sector to build new and supporting value chain. Hydrogen is expected to become an integrated part of the future energy system and Equinor is taking positions adding clean hydrogen as an enabler for transport and storage of clean energy produced by renewables.\n\n## Midstream, marketing and processing (MMP) - Secure premium market access, grow value creation through cycles and build a low carbon business\n\nMMP works to maximise the value creation in Equinor's global mid- and downstream positions. The business area is responsible for global marketing and trading of crude and petroleum products, natural gas, electric power and green certificates. This also includes marketing of the Norwegian state's natural gas and crude on the Norwegian continental shelf. MMP is also responsible for onshore plants, transportation and for the development of value chains to ensure flow assurance for Equinor's upstream production and to maximise value creation.\n\nAs part of the Equinor group, Danske Commodities, one of Europe's largest electricity traders, supports Equinor's strategy to build a profitable renewables business. In addition, MMP is responsible for developing low carbon value chains for Equinor, with key focus on transforming natural gas to clean hydrogen and developing carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) projects.\n\nIn 2021, MMP has made significant progress on developing low carbon solutions for a net zero future:\n\n- \u00b7 The Northern Lights (Equinor 33.33%, operator) which is part of the Norwegian full-scale CCS Longship project is under development and expected to be operational in 2024. This is a milestone for commercial CCS in Europe.\n- \u00b7 Equinor sold its refining business in Denmark supporting its strategy to focus its portfolio around core areas. Equinor is concentrating its refining position around Mongstad, Norway, where the company can leverage its integrated industrial cluster, expand the portfolio of low carbon energy",

        "page_content": "## 2.2 Business overview\n\n## History in brief\n\n## 18 September 1972\n\nEquinor, formerly Statoil, was formed by a decision of the Norwegian parliament and incorporated as a limited liability company under the name Den norske stats oljeselskap AS. At the time owned 100% by the Norwegian State, Equinor's initial role was to be the government's commercial instrument in the development of the oil and gas industry in Norway. Growing in parallel with the Norwegian oil and gas industry, Equinor's operations were primarily focused on exploration, development and production of oil and gas on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS).\n\n## 1979 - 1981\n\nThe Statfjord field was discovered in the North Sea and commenced production. In 1981 Equinor was the first Norwegian company to be given operatorship for a field, at Gullfaks in the North Sea.\n\n## 1980s and 1990s\n\nEquinor grew substantially through the development of the NCS (Statfjord, Gullfaks, Oseberg, Troll and others). In the 1990s, Equinor started to grow internationally. Equinor also became a major player in the European gas market by entering into large sales contracts for the development and operation of gas transport systems and terminals. During these decades, Equinor was also involved in manufacturing and marketing in Scandinavia and established a comprehensive network of service stations. This line of business was fully divested in 2012.\n\n## 2001\n\nEquinor was listed on the Oslo and New York stock exchanges and became a public limited company under the name Statoil ASA, now Equinor ASA, with a 67% majority stake owned by the Norwegian State.\n\n## 2007 - 2018\n\nEquinor's ability to fully realise the potential of the NCS and grow internationally was strengthened through the merger with Norsk Hydro's oil and gas division on 1 October 2007. Equinor's business grew as a result of substantial investments on the NCS and internationally. Equinor delivered the world's longest multiphase pipelines on the Ormen Lange and Sn\u00f8hvit gas fields, and the giant Ormen Lange development project was completed in 2007.\n\nBy 2007, Equinor had expanded into Algeria, Angola, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Nigeria, UK, and the US Gulf of Mexico, amongst others.\n\n## 2018 - 2019\n\nStatoil ASA changed its name to Equinor ASA, following approval of the name change by the company's annual general meeting on 15 May 2018. The name supports the company's strategy and development as a broad energy company in addition to reflecting Equinor's evolution and identity as a company for the generations to come.\n\nThe record-breaking Johan Sverdrup field came on stream in October 2019. It is powered by electricity from shore, making it one of the most carbon-efficient fields worldwide.\n\n## 2020 - 2021\n\nEquinor sets an ambition be a leading company in the energy transition and to become a net-zero company by 2050, including emissions from production to final energy consumption.\n\nEquinor announced changes to the reporting segments, corporate structure and the corporate executive committee (CEC) to further strengthen its ability to deliver on Equinor's always safe, high value, low-carbon strategy. The changes will support improved value creation from Equinor's world-class oil and gas portfolio, accelerated profitable growth within renewables and the development of low-carbon solutions.\n\nIn January 2021, civil works began at the Northern Lights development for carbon transport and storage. In June 2021, the final investment decision was made for the first phase of the development of the Bacalhau field. The Martin Linge field was brought on stream in June 2021, driven by electric power from shore. The third phase of the Troll field development came on stream in August 2021, producing from the Troll West gas cap. The electrification of Troll West is underway. In November 2021, the decision was made to develop the third phase of the Dogger Bank offshore windfarm. To meet the growing demand, Equinor scaled up gas production from the NCS in 2021.\n\n## Current activities\n\nEquinor's access to crude oil in the form of equity, governmental and third-party volumes makes Equinor a large seller of crude oil, and Equinor is the second largest supplier of natural gas to the European market. Processing, refining, offshore wind and carbon capture and storage are also part of our operations.\n\nIn recent years, Equinor has utilised its expertise to design and manage operations in various environments to grow upstream activities outside the traditional area of offshore production.\n\nEquinor operates in around 30 countries and as per 31 December 2021 employs 21,126 people worldwide. Equinor's head office is located at Forusbeen 50, 4035 Stavanger, Norway. The telephone number of its registered office is +47 51 99 00 00.",

        "page_content": "## Equinor's competitive position\n\nEquinor is an energy company with a portfolio dominated by oil and gas, but with an increasing share of renewable energy sources like offshore wind. Key factors affecting competition in all these segments are internal factors like costs, operational excellence, project execution, and technology development, and external factors like environmental and governmental regulations and access to acreage and leases.\n\nWhen acquiring assets and licences for development of energy either from oil and gas, or from renewable energy sources, Equinor competes with other integrated oil and gas companies as well as other energy companies. Equinor also competes with these companies when marketing and trading crude oil, natural gas and related products, and power from renewable energy sources.\n\nEquinor continues to optimise the oil and gas portfolio and explore new business opportunities in offshore wind, solar, hydrogen and carbon capture, usage, and storage (CCUS).\n\nImprovements in cost and technology for renewables have rapidly changed the landscape in the recent years. Ambitious goals have been set for a low carbon energy business supporting Equinor's strategy; always safe, high value, low carbon and the commitment to contribute to a sustainable energy future and a net zero emission society.\n\nEquinor's ability to remain competitive will depend, among other things, on continuous focus on reducing costs and improving efficiency, but also the ability to seize opportunities in new business areas, apply new and digital technologies, and reduce CO2 emissions from operations.\n\nThe information about Equinor's competitive position in the strategic report is based on several sources such as investment analyst reports, independent market studies, and internal assessments of market share based on publicly available information about the financial results and performance of market players.\n\n## Where we are\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * In February 2022, Equinor announced its intention to exit its business activities in Russia.

        "page_content": "## Equinor's value chain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Corporate structure\n\nEquinor is a broad international energy company and its value chain includes most phases from exploration of hydrocarbons through development, production and manufacturing, marketing and trading, and a growing renewables business.\n\nEffective 1 June 2021, Equinor made changes to the corporate structure and the corporate executive committee (CEC) to further strengthen its ability to deliver on Equinor's always safe, high value, low carbon strategy. The changes are intended to support improved value creation from Equinor's world-class oil and gas portfolio, accelerated profitable growth within renewables and the development of low carbon solutions. The new corporate structure consists of seven business areas and five corporate centre units.\n\nEquinor's operations are managed through the following business areas: Exploration & Production Norway (EPN), Exploration & Production International (EPI), Exploration & Production USA (EPUSA), Marketing, Midstream & Processing (MMP), Renewables (REN), Projects, Drilling & Procurement (PDP) and Technology, Digital & Innovation (TDI).\n\n## Exploration & Production Norway (EPN)\n\nManaging Equinor's upstream activities on the NCS, EPN explores for and extracts crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids in the North Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea. EPN aims to ensure safe and efficient operations and\n\ntransform the NCS to deliver sustainable value for many decades. EPN is shaping the future of the NCS with a digital transformation and solutions to achieve a lower carbon footprint and high recovery rates.\n\nBefore 1 June 2021, EPN was referred to as Development & Production Norway (DPN).\n\n## Exploration & Production International (EPI)\n\nEPI manages Equinor's worldwide upstream activities in all countries outside Norway and the USA. EPI operates across six continents covering offshore and onshore exploration and extraction of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; and implementing rigorous safety standards, technological innovations and environmental awareness. EPI's intent is to build and grow a competitive international portfolio - always safe, high value and low carbon.\n\nBefore 1 June 2021, EPI was referred to as Development & Production International (DPI). Additionally, from 1 June 2021, the former Development and production Brazil (DPB) is included in EPI and is no longer a separate business area.\n\n## Exploration & Production USA (EPUSA)\n\nEPUSA manages Equinor's upstream activities in the US and US Gulf of Mexico, both onshore and offshore exploration, development and production of oil and gas. Equinor has been present in the US since 1987. EPUSA's ambition is to develop a",

        "page_content": "competitive portfolio in the US. EPUSA produced around 18% of Equinor's total equity production of oil and gas in 2021.\n\nBefore 1 June 2021, EPUSA was referred to as Development & Production USA (DPUSA).\n\n## Marketing, Midstream & Processing (MMP)\n\nMMP works to maximise value creation in Equinor's global midstream and downstream positions. MMP is responsible for global marketing and trading of crude, petroleum products, natural gas and electric power, including marketing of the Norwegian State's natural gas and crude on the NCS. MMP is responsible for onshore plants and transportation in addition to the development of value chains to ensure flow assurance for Equinor's upstream production and to maximise value creation. Low-carbon solutions such as carbon capture and storage and other low-carbon energy solutions, are also a part of MMP's responsibility.\n\n## Renewables (REN)\n\nREN reflects Equinor's long-term goal to complement Equinor's oil and gas portfolio with profitable renewable energy. REN is responsible for wind farms, solar as well as other forms of renewable energy and energy storage. REN aims to do this by combining Equinor's oil and gas competence, project delivery capacities and ability to integrate technological solutions.\n\nBefore 1 June 2021, REN was referred to as New Energy Solutions (NES).\n\n## Projects, Drilling & Procurement (PDP)\n\nPDP is responsible for field development, well deliveries and procurement in Equinor and aims to deliver safe, secure and efficient field development, including well construction, founded on world-class project execution and technology excellence. PDP utilises innovative technologies, digital solutions and carbon-efficient concepts to shape a competitive project portfolio at the forefront of the energy industry transformation. Sustainable value is being created together with suppliers through a simplified and standardised fit-for-purpose approach.\n\nFrom 1 June 2021, PDP is a separate business area, while Research & Technology is part of the new business area Technology, Digital & Innovation (TDI).\n\nFrom 1 June 2021, Exploration is part of EPN, EPI and EPUSA, based on the location of the exploration activities, and is no longer a separate business area.\n\nFrom 1 June 2021, Global Strategy and Business development (GSB) no longer is a separate business area, and its tasks are covered by other corporate units.\n\n## Presentation\n\nIn the following sections in the report, the operations are reported according to the reporting segment. Underlying activities or business clusters are presented according to how the reporting segment organises its operations. See note 4 Segments to the Consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\nAs required by the SEC, Equinor prepares its disclosures about oil and gas reserves and certain other supplementary oil and gas disclosures based on geographic areas. Equinor's geographical areas are defined by country and continent and consist of Norway, Eurasia excluding Norway, Africa, USA and Americas excluding USA. For more information, see section 4.2 Supplementary oil and gas information (unaudited) in the Financial statements and supplements chapter.\n\n## Segment reporting\n\nThe reporting segments Exploration & Production Norway (E&P Norway), Exploration & Production International (E&P International), Exploration & Production USA (E&P USA), Marketing, Midstream & Processing (MMP) and Renewables (REN) consist of the business areas EPN, EPI, EPUSA, MMP and REN respectively. The operating segments, PDP, TDI and corporate staffs and functions are aggregated into the reporting segment 'Other' due to the immateriality of these operating segments. Most of the costs within the operating segments PDP and TDI are allocated to the E&P Norway, E&P International, E&P USA, MMP and REN reporting segments.\n\nEquinor's upstream activities in the USA are a separate reporting segment since the second quarter of 2020. As from the first quarter of 2021, Equinor changed its reporting as REN became a separate reporting segment. Previously the activities in REN were reported in the segment 'Other'. The new reporting structure has been applied retrospectively with comparable figures reclassified. The change has its basis in the increased strategic importance of the renewable business for Equinor and that the information is regarded useful for the readers of the financial statements.\n\nInternal transactions in oil and gas volumes occur between reporting segments before such volumes are sold in the market. Equinor has established a market-based transfer pricing methodology for the oil and natural gas intercompany sales and purchases that meets the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. For further information, see section 2.10 Operational performance under Production volumes and prices.\n\nEquinor eliminates intercompany sales when combining the results of reporting segments. Intercompany sales include transactions recorded in connection with oil and natural gas production in the E&P reporting segments, and in connection with the sale, transportation or refining of oil and natural gas production in the MMP reporting segment. Certain types of transportation costs are reported in both the MMP, E&P USA and the E&P International segments.\n\nThe E&P Norway segment produces oil and natural gas which is sold internally to the MMP segment. A large share of the oil produced by the E&P USA and E&P International segments is also sold through the MMP segment. The remaining oil and gas from the E&P International and E&P USA segments are sold directly in the market. In 2021, the average transfer price for natural gas for E&P Norway was 14.43 USD/mmbtu. The average transfer price was 2.26 USD/mmbtu in 2020. For the oil sold from the E&P Norway reporting segment to the MMP reporting segment, the transfer price is the applicable market-reflective price minus a cost recovery rate.",

E & P Norway aims to ensure safe and efficient operations, maximising the value potential from the NCS. E & P Norway transforms the NCS using digital and carbon-efficient solutions and considers electrification of several offshore installations.\n\nFor 2021, Equinor reports production on the NCS from 43 Equinor-operated fields and nine partner-operated fields.\n\n## Key events and portfolio developments in 2021 and early 2022:\n\n- \uf0a7 Equinor's production on the NCS remained largely unaffected by Covid-19 precautionary measures, such as manning limitations and quarantining.\n- \uf0a7 To meet the growing demand, Equinor and its licence partners scaled up gas production in 2021, e.g. from the Gina Krog , Oseberg and Troll licences. Gas export from Gina Krog boosted gas supplies to Europe by 8 million m 3 a day from 15 October. For more details, see section 2.6 MMP.\n- \uf0a7 Oil production from the Johan Sverdrup field was in the first half of 2021 ramped up to 535,000 barrels a day, which is 100,000 higher than anticipated at production start in October 2019.\n\n- \uf0a7 Gas production from the Sn\u00f8hvit field is suspended after the fire at the Melk\u00f8ya LNG plant in late September 2020. Production will resume when the refurbished Melk\u00f8ya plant comes on line, expected in May 2022.\n- \uf0a7 Equinor and its licence partners made eight commercial discoveries on the NCS in 2021.\n- \uf0a7 On 19 January, Equinor was awarded 17 licences ( 10 as operator) on the NCS in the Awards for predefined areas round 2020 .\n- \uf0a7 On 11 February, the MPE approved the plan for development and operation of a partial electrification of the Sleipner field centre. Planned investments are around NOK 850 million, and the field centre is expected to connect to the Utsira high power hub towards the end of 2022.\n- \uf0a7 On 4 March, Equinor and its licence partners decided to further develop the \u00c5sgard field in the Norwegian Sea, investing around NOK 1.4 billion in \u00c5sgard B low pressure . The platform is being modified to reduce inlet pressure, by replacing the reinjection compressors and rebuilding parts of the processing facility. The low-pressure production is expected to begin in 2023.\n- \uf0a7 On 22 April, the 11 foundations for the Hywind Tampen wind turbines were towed from Stord to Vindafjord, for further slipforming and mechanical outfitting. The Hywind Tampen floating wind farm is taking shape, expected on stream in the third quarter of 2022.\n- \uf0a7 On 23 April, Equinor and its licence partners decided to develop Askeladd West , a satellite to the Sn\u00f8hvit gas field in the southern Barents Sea. Investments are estimated to be NOK 3.2 billion. Askeladd West is planned to be ready for first gas in the fourth quarter of 2025.",

        "page_content": "- \uf0a7 On 17 June, Equinor and its licence partners decided to extend Heimdal field life by two years to 2023. Gas from new wells at Valemon is being processed at the Heimdal facilities, rendering a field life extension financially viable.\n- \uf0a7 On 23 June, Equinor was awarded two licences (as operator) in the Barents Sea in the 25 th licensing round on the NCS\n- \uf0a7 On 23 June, crane vessel Sleipnir installed the 12,050-ton substructure of the new processing platform at the Johan Sverdrup field. The second phase of the Johan Sverdrup field development advances towards production start in fourth quarter 2022.\n- \uf0a7 On 29 June, the MPE approved the plans for development and operation of Breidablikk oil field . The unitisation agreement was approved on 15 September, establishing a 39% share for Equinor . Approximately NOK 18.6 billion is planned to be invested in the field development. Production start is scheduled for the first half of 2024.\n- \uf0a7 On 30 June, the Martin Linge oil and gas field was brought on stream. The field is operated from shore. Investments in the field development were approximately NOK 63 billion. Energised in 2018, Martin Linge was the first field development on the NCS to be supplied with onshore power, considerably reducing its carbon footprint. The field was officially opened on 27 January 2022.\n- \uf0a7 On 27 August, the third phase of the Troll field development in the North Sea was brought on stream. Troll phase 3 produces the gas cap of Troll West. The development uses existing infrastructure and investments were around NOK 8 billion.\n- \uf0a7 On 3 November, the second phase of the partneroperated \u00c6rfugl oil and gas field development was brought on stream. In a subsea development six wells have been tied in to the Skarv FPSO in the Norwegian Sea, around 210 km west of Sandnessj\u00f8en.\n- \uf0a7 On 26 November, Equinor and its licence partners submitted to the MPE the plan for development and operation for further developing the Oseberg field . The plan comprises installation of two new compressors to boost recoverable gas volumes, and a partial electrification of the Oseberg field centre and Oseberg South platform.\n- \uf0a7 On 5 December, the refurbished vessel Njord Bravo was towed from Haugesund to Kristiansund. Once Njord future\n\n- comes on stream in the fourth quarter of 2022, the vessel will process and store oil and gas from the Njord A platform. Following the upgrade, the storage vessel is expected to be operational until 2040.\n- \uf0a7 On 7 December, Equinor entered into an agreement with Spirit Energy to acquire the company's production licences in the Statfjord area on the NCS and UKCS for USD 50 million, plus a contingent payment.

The MPE approved the plan for development and operation of Troll West electrification on 17 December 2021. Troll B is planned to be partially electrified by 2024 and Troll C is expected to be fully electrified by 2026.\n\n## Decommissioning on the NCS\n\nUnder the Petroleum Act, the Norwegian government has imposed strict regulations for removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas installations. The Oslo-Paris convention for the protection of the marine environment of the Northeast Atlantic (OSPAR), which Norway has committed to, gives requirements with respect to how disused offshore oils and gas installations are to be disposed.\n\nHeimdal (Equinor 29.40%, operator) is planning for cease of production in 2023. The Heimdal main platform and Gassco/Gassled's riser platform are scheduled to be removed during the years 2025-2027. The platforms will be brought to shore at Eld\u00f8yane, Stord, for demolition and recycling.\n\nVeslefrikk (Equinor 18.00%, operator) ceased production on 17 February 2022. Plugging of wells started early in 2021 and is planned to be completed by the first quarter of 2022. Veslefrikk B will be towed to shore for dismantling and recycling at MARS in Fredrikshavn, Denmark, in the autumn of 2022, and Veslefrikk A is scheduled to be removed in 2025/2026. Veslefrikk A will be brought to Eld\u00f8yane, Stord, for demolition and recycling.\n\nEkofisk (Equinor 7.60%, operated by ConocoPhillips Skandinavia AS) is in the category 3 removal campaign, some installations were removed in 2021. Outstanding in this campaign is the Tor 2/4 E platform, scheduled to be removed in 2024.\n\nFor further information about decommissioning, see note 2 Significant accounting policies to the Consolidated financial statements.",

The E&P International reporting segment covers exploration, development and production of oil and gas outside the NCS and the US.\n\nE&P International is present in nearly 15 countries and had production in 12 countries in 2021. E&P International produced around 16% of Equinor's total equity production of oil and gas in 2021, compared to 17% in 2020.\n\nFor information about proved reserves development see section 2.10 Operational Performance under Proved oil and gas reserves.\n\n## Key events and portfolio developments in 2021 and early 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 In 2021, Covid-19 infection control measures, such as manning limitations and quarantining, caused delay in progress of maintenance activities in Peregrino producing field as wells as activities in the Peregrino phase 2 project. Equinor's production in other E&P International assets remained largely unaffected.\n- \u00b7 On 14 January, Equinor and partner YPF S.A. entered into an agreement with Shell Argentina S.A. to jointly farm down 30% interest in the CAN 100 block offshore Argentina . After the transaction, Equinor holds a 35% interest in the block.\n\n- \u00b7 On 20 January, Equinor completed the sale of a 40.81% interest in and transfer of operatorship of the Bressay oil field development on the UK continental shelf to EnQuest Heather Ltd.\n- \u00b7 On 29 January, Equinor announced the write down of previously capitalised well costs related to Equinor's Block 2 exploration licence in Tanzania .\n- \u00b7 On 19 February, Equinor completed the acquisition of a 21.37% interest in the Barnacle field in the Statfjord area from Esso Exploration and Production UK Limited.\n- \u00b7 On 1 June, Equinor and its partners made the final investment decision for the first phase of the development of the Bacalhau oil and gas field, with first oil planned for 2024.\n- \u00b7 On 28 July, Equinor and state-owned Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PdVSA) completed the transaction to transfer Equinor's 9.67% non-operated interest in the Petrocede\u00f1o project onshore Venezuela to Corporaci\u00f3n Venezolana del Petr\u00f3leo (CVP), a PdVSA company.\n- \u00b7 On 8 September, Equinor entered into an agreement with the co-owners to divest its ownership interest in Terra Nova field in Canada.\n- \u00b7 On 29 November, Equinor entered into an agreement with Vermilion Energy Inc to sell Equinor's non-operated equity position in the Corrib gas field offshore Ireland.

Equity production in PSAs and PSCs represent Equinor's percentage ownership in a particular field, whereas entitlement production represents Equinor's share of the volumes distributed to the partners in the field, which is subject to several deductions including but not limited to royalties and the host government's share of profit oil (see section 5.7 Terms and abbreviations).\n\nEquinor's entitlement production outside Norway and the US was 13% of Equinor's total entitlement production in 2021.\n\nThe following table shows E&P International's average daily entitlement production of liquids and natural gas for the years ended 31 December 2021, 2020, and 2019.\n\n## Average daily entitlement production\n\n|                              | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   |\n|------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                              | 2021                             | 2021                             | 2021                             | 2020                             | 2020                             | 2020                             | 2019                             | 2019                             | 2019                             |\n| Production area              | Oil and NGL   mboe/day           | Natural gas  mmcm/day            | mboe/day                         | Oil and NGL   mboe/day           | Natural gas  mmcm/day            | mboe/day                         | Oil and NGL   mboe/day           | Natural gas  mmcm/day            | mboe/day                         |\n| Americas (excluding US) 1)   | 52                               | 1                                | 56                               | 67                               | 1                                | 72                               | 98                               | 1                                | 103                              |\n| Africa                       | 94                               | 3                                | 115                              | 115                              | 3                                | 136                              | 137                              | 4                                | 165                              |\n| Eurasia                      | 42                               | 2                                | 54                               | 47                               | 2                                | 63                               | 29                               | 3                                | 45                               |\n| Equity accounted  production | 19                               | 0                                | 21                               | 6                                | 0                                | 7                                | 3                                | 0                                | 4                                |\n| Total                        | 207                              | 6                                | 246                              | 236                              | 7                                | 278                              | 267                              | 8                                | 317                              |\n\n1) In 2019, the entitlement production numbers have been restated to reflect change to segment.

The In Amenas infrastructure includes a gas processing plant with three trains. The production facility is connected to the Sonatrach distribution system.\n\nSeparate PSAs including mechanisms for revenue sharing, govern the rights and obligations of the parties and establish joint operatorships between Sonatrach, bp and Equinor for In Salah and In Amenas.\n\n## Angola\n\nThe deep-water blocks 17, 15 and 31 contributed 36% of Equinor's equity liquid production outside the NCS and the US in 2021. Each block is governed by a PSA which sets out the rights\n\nand obligations of the participants, including mechanisms for sharing of the production with the Angolan state oil company Sonangol.\n\nBlock 17 has production from four FPSOs: CLOV, Dalia, Girassol and Pazflor. New projects on Dalia, CLOV and Pazflor are being developed to stem decline. The Zinia phase 2 and CLOV phase 2 projects came on stream during 2021.\n\nBlock 15 has production from four FPSOs: Kizomba A, Kizomba B, Kizomba C-Mondo, and Kizomba C-Saxi Batuque.\n\nBlock 31 has production from one FPSO producing from the PSVM fields.\n\nThe FPSOs serve as production hubs and each receives oil from more than one field through multiple wells.\n\n## Libya\n\nEquinor has ownership interest in two oil fields onshore in Libya, Murzuq and Mabruk. Production from the Murzuq field recommenced towards end of 2020 after being shut down for nearly nine months and has remained stable throughout 2021. Plans are underway to redevelop the Mabruk field, which was damaged during the conflicts in Libya in 2015.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nThe Agbami deep water field is located 110 km off the coast of the Central Niger Delta region. The Agbami field straddles the two licences OML 127 and OML 128 and is operated by Chevron under a Unit Agreement. The Agbami field is governed by a PSC.\n\nFor information related to the Agbami redetermination process and the dispute between the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and the partners in OML 128 concerning certain terms of the OML 128 PSC, see note 24 Other commitments, contingent liabilities and contingent assets to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe government of Nigeria approved and implemented a new Petroleum Industry Act during 2021 which governs new leases as well as renewal of existing leases.\n\n## Eurasia\n\n## Azerbaijan\n\nAzeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) is an oil field offshore Azerbaijan. The crude oil is sent to the Sangachal Terminal, where it is processed prior to export. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline is the main export route, in which Equinor holds 8.71%. The development of the Azeri Central East (ACE) platform in the ACG field was sanctioned by the partners in April 2019. The new platform is expected to come on stream in 2023.\n\n## Ireland\n\nEquinor holds an interest in the Corrib gas field off Ireland's northwest coast. In November, Equinor entered into an agreement with Vermilion Energy Inc to sell Equinor's nonoperated equity position in the Corrib gas field offshore Ireland.

The field is around 500 km northeast of St. John's in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Developing Bay du Nord and nearby discoveries in a subsea solution tied back to an FPSO is under consideration.\n\n## Africa\n\n## Tanzania\n\nBlock 2 (Equinor 65%, operator). Equinor made several large gas discoveries in Block 2 in the Indian Ocean, off southern Tanzania, during 2012-2015. The partners of blocks 2 (Equinor, operator) and blocks 1 and 4 (Shell, operator) are collaborating on the future development of the discoveries. The government of Tanzania has invited the operators and partners to start negotiations on a suitable legal, commercial, and fiscal framework for developing the discoveries. These negotiations are ongoing.\n\n## Eurasia Azerbaijan\n\nThe Karabagh (Equinor 50%, operated by Karabagh Joint Operating Company ) field is located 120 kilometres east of Baku.

Following the commodity price decline in early 2020, Equinor halted its US onshore operated drilling and completions activities. In April 2021, Equinor completed its divestment of the Bakken asset thereby refocusing its US onshore portfolio towards partner operated activities.\n\nEquinor has an ownership interest in the Marcellus shale gas play, located in the Appalachian region in northeast US. The position is mostly partner operated. Since 2012, Equinor has also been an operator in the Appalachian region in the state of Ohio, developing Marcellus and Utica formations.\n\nIn addition, Equinor participates in natural gas gathering system and gas treatment and processing facilities in Appalachian basin assets to provide flow assurance for Equinor's upstream production.\n\n## US exploration\n\nThroughout 2021, Equinor has continued its activity in US Gulf of Mexico, one of its core areas for exploration.\n\nEquinor began drilling an operated appraisal well located in the Walker Ridge area of the US Gulf of Mexico which is expected to be completed in 2022.

Production permits for the Oseberg and Troll fields have each been increased by 1 billion cubic meters (bcm) for the gas year starting 1 October.\n- \u00b7 In October 2021 the East Coast Cluster was selected as one of the first two carbon capture projects to be developed, hence setting the development of NEP and CO2 infrastructure in North East England up for future government funding.\n- \u00b7 On 15 October 2021, gas exports to Europe increased by 8 million cubic meters of gas per day (mcmd) through the stop of gas injection at Gina Krog. Following a dialogue with licence partners and authorities, the MPE granted a permit to temporarily halt gas injection up to 31 December 2021. For 2022, a new application for continued halt in gas injection has been granted up to 31 March 2022.\n- \u00b7 The gas prices continued to increase in 2021, reaching a record-high level of in December month.\n- \u00b7 Celebrating 25 years\n- of production from the Troll field and the opening of Kollsnes processing facility, Kollsnes achieved all time production record in October.\n\n## Marketing and trading of gas, LNG and power\n\nMMP is responsible for the sale of Equinor's and SDFI's (Norwegian State's direct financial interest) dry gas and LNG. Equinor's gas marketing and trading business is conducted from Norway and from offices in Belgium, the UK, Germany and the US. As Owner of Danske Commodities (DC), a trading company for power and gas, MMP has strengthened Equinor's energy trading business, also supporting our investment within Renewables. DC is primarily active in Europe but also has power activities in US and Australia.\n\n## Europe\n\nThe major export markets for natural gas produced from the\n\nNorwegian continental shelf (NCS) are the UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Belgium. LNG from the Sn\u00f8hvit field 8 , combined with third-party LNG cargoes, allows Equinor to reach global gas markets. The gas is sold to counterparties through bilateral sales agreements and over the trading desk. Some of Equinor's long-term gas contracts have price review clauses which can be triggered by the parties.\n\nFor ongoing price reviews, Equinor provides in its financial statements for probable liabilities based on Equinor's best judgement. For further information, see note 24 Other commitments, contingent liabilities and contingent assets to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nEquinor is active on both the physical and exchange markets, such as the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and Trayport. Equinor expects to continue to optimise the value of the gas volumes through a mix of bilateral contracts and over the trading desk, via its production and transportation systems and downstream assets. MMP receives a marketing fee from EPN for the Norwegian gas sold on behalf of the company.\n\nDC is active on both the physical and exchange markets for both gas and power as a separate entity. All trading and optimisation of power in Equinor is performed by DC.\n\n## USA\n\nEquinor Natural Gas LLC (ENG), a wholly owned subsidiary, has a gas marketing and trading organisation in Stamford, Connecticut that markets natural gas to local distribution companies, industrial customers, power generators and other gas trading counterparties. ENG also markets equity production volumes from the Gulf of Mexico and the Appalachian Basin and transports some of the Appalachian production to New York City and into Canada to the greater Toronto area. In addition, ENG has capacity contracts at the Cove Point LNG regasification terminal.\n\n## Marketing and trading of liquids\n\nMMP is responsible for the sale of Equinor's and SDFI's crude oil and NGL produced at the Norwegian Continental Shelf, in addition to the operation and commercial optimisation of the refineries and terminals. MMP also markets the equity volumes from the Company's assets located in the US, Brazil, Canada, Angola, Nigeria, Algeria, Azerbaijan and the UK, as well as thirdparty volumes. The value is maximised through marketing, physical and financial trading and through the optimisation of owned and leased capacity such as refineries, processing, terminals, storages, pipelines, railcars and vessels.\n\nThe liquids marketing and trading business is conducted from Norway, the UK, Singapore, the US and Canada. The main crude oil market for Equinor is Northwest Europe.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nEquinor owns and operates the Mongstad refinery in Norway, including a combined heat and power plant (CHP). The refinery is a medium-sized refinery built in 1975, with a crude oil and condensate distillation capacity of 226,000 barrels per day. The refinery is supplied via the Mongstad Terminal DA linked to offshore fields through three crude oil pipelines, a pipeline for NGL's connecting to Kollsnes and Sture (the Vestprosess pipeline) and to Kollsnes by a gas pipeline. The CHP produces heat and power from gas received from Kollsnes and from the refinery. It was designed with a generating capacity of approximately 280 megawatts of electric power and 350 megawatts of process heat. Equinor has decided to cease the operation and redesign a part of the CHP to a new heater for process heat planned to be operational in the second quarter of 2022. The CHP will continue operation until the new heater comes into service.\n\nEquinor holds an ownership interest in Vestprosess (34%), which transports and processes NGL and condensate. The",

        "page_content": "operatorship of Vestprosess was transferred to Gassco as of 1 January 2018, with Equinor as the technical service provider.\n\nEquinor Refining Denmark A/S owned a refinery and two terminals. The refinery processes about 5.5 million tonnes of crude oil, condensate and feedstock per year. Total capacity per day is 108.000 barrels. The product terminal in Kalundborg is located next to the refinery. The terminal in Hedehusene (close to Copenhagen) is supplied 100% via two pipelines, which are connected to the refinery. The pipelines are owned by Danish Central Oil Stockholding (FDO). The majority of the refined products are sold locally in Denmark and Scandinavia. The legal transfer and sale of 100% of the shares of Equinor Refining Denmark A/S to Klesch Group was completed on 31 December 2021.\n\nEquinor holds an ownership interest in the methanol plant at Tjeldbergodden (82 %). The plant receives natural gas from fields in the Norwegian Sea through the Haltenpipe pipeline. In\n\naddition, Equinor holds an ownership interest in the air separation unit Tjeldbergodden Luftgassfabrikk DA (50.9%).\n\nThe following table shows the operating statistics for the plants at Mongstad, Kalundborg and Tjeldbergodden. Refinery margins increased in 2021 after the Covid-19 pandemic market collapse in 2020. The higher throughput for Mongstad in 2021 was mainly due to increased utilisation rate as a result of higher margins in addition to better refinery performance. The increase in on stream factor at Mongstad is due to few unplanned shutdowns and fewer planned shutdowns in 2021 than in 2020. The lower throughput for Tjeldbergodden in 2021 was mainly influenced by more unplanned shutdowns compared to 2020. Reduced onstream factor and utilisation rate compared to 2020 are influenced by higher number of days with shutdown for Tjeldbergodden. In addition, Tjeldbergodden had one planned shutdown in 2021. On-stream factor in 2021 is higher than previous year, resulting in higher throughput than last year.\n\n|                |   Throughput 1) |   Throughput 1) |   Throughput 1) |   Distillation capacity 2) |   Distillation capacity 2) |   Distillation capacity 2) |   On stream factor % 3) |   On stream factor % 3) |   On stream factor % 3) |   Utilisation rate % 4) |   Utilisation rate % 4) | Utilisation rate % 4)   |\n|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Refinery       |          2021   |          2020   |          2019   |                     2021   |                     2020   |                     2019   |                  2021   |                  2020   |                  2019   |                  2021   |                  2020   | 2019                    |\n| Mongstad       |            11.1 |             9.7 |            10.5 |                        9.3 |                        9.3 |                        9.3 |                    98.2 |                    82.5 |                    79   |                    93.3 |                    81.4 | 87.7                    |\n| Kalundborg     |             4.9 |             4.5 |             5   |                        5.4 |                        5.4 |                        5.4 |                    99   |                    92.1 |                    98   |                    83   |                    84.4 | 85.4 5)                 |\n| Tjeldbergodden |             0.6 |             0.9 |             0.9 |                        0.7 |                        1   |                        1   |                    71.4 |                    86.8 |                    93.9 |                    90   |                    86.8 | 93.9                    |\n\n## Terminals and storage\n\nEquinor operates the Mongstad crude oil terminal (Equinor 65%). The crude oil is landed at Mongstad through pipelines from the NCS and by crude tankers from the market. The Mongstad terminal has a storage capacity of 9.4 million barrels of crude oil.\n\nEquinor operates the Sture crude oil terminal. The crude oil is landed at Sture through pipelines from the North Sea. The terminal is part of the Oseberg Transportation System (Equinor 36.2%). The processing facilities at Sture stabilise the crude oil and recover an LPG mix (propane and butane) and naphtha.\n\nEquinor operates the South Riding Point Terminal (SRP), which is located on the Grand Bahamas Island and consists of two shipping berths and ten storage tanks, with a storage capacity of 6.75 million barrels of crude oil. The terminal has facilities to blend crude oils, including heavy oils. In September 2019, SRP was struck by Hurricane Dorian causing damage to the facility and an oil spill on land. Clean-up activities at and around the terminal were completed in 2021. Rebuild of the terminal is planned to commence in 2022.\n\nEquinor UK holds an interest in the Aldbrough Gas Storage (Equinor 33.3%) in the UK, which is operated by SSE Hornsea Ltd.\n\nEquinor Deutschland Storage GmbH holds an interest in the Etzel Gas Lager (Equinor 23.7%) in the northern part of Germany which has a total of 19 caverns and secures the regularity for gas deliveries from the NCS.\n\n## Low-carbon solutions\n\n- \u00b7 Since 1996, Equinor had proven experience in carbon capture and storage (CCS) from the offshore oil and gas business and has continued to develop competence through research engagement at Technology Centre Mongstad, the world's largest facility for testing and improving CO2 capture. Equinor will seek to deploy its competence and experience in other CCS projects, both to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from several sources and to drive new opportunities, including enhanced oil recovery possibilities and carbon neutral value chains based on hydrogen.\n- \u00b7 Northern Lights (Equinor 33.33%, operator) Equinor is, together with Shell and Total, developing infrastructure for transport and storage on the NCS of CO2 from various onshore industries.

Capture and storage of CO2 will contribute to reaching the climate goal of the Paris agreement, and the project is part of Longship, the Norwegian authorities' project for fullscale carbon capture, transport and storage in Norway. The Norwegian government announced its funding decision for Northern Lights in December 2020. The Northern Lights infrastructure will enable transport of CO2 from industrial capture sites to a terminal in \u00d8ygarden for intermediate storage, before transport by pipeline for permanent storage in a reservoir 2,600 metres under the seabed. Equinor, Shell and Total made their conditional investment decision in May 2020. The three companies formed a joint venture Northern Lights JV DA in March 2021, and the new company has assumed operatorship of the storage licence. Longship was passed unanimously in the\n\nNorwegian Parliament (St prop 33/2020) on 21 January 2021, and the Northern Lights PDO was officially approved on 26 February 2021. A confirmation well was completed in 2020, and civil works began at \u00d8ygarden in January 2021. A second well is drilled summer 2022. The project is expected to come on stream in 2024.\n\nIn March 2020, Northern Lights completed drilling a confirmation well for CO2 storage in exploration licence EL001 south of the Troll field in the North Sea. The well is intended for injection and storage of CO/uni2082. To stimulate the development of future carbon capture and storage projects, Equinor and its partners have shared the well data with external parties without charge.\n\nIn parallel with Northern Lights, Equinor is looking to provide CCS capacity in the UK in partnership with five other energy companies. This partnership is called the Northern Endurance Partnership (NEP). The consortium is developing a CO2 offshore transport and storage infrastructure in the UK, which will serve the proposed Net Zero Teesside project (led by bp with Equinor as a partner) and Zero Carbon Humber project (led by Equinor) with the aim of decarbonising these industrial clusters. In 2020 Equinor became a CO2 storage licence holder for the Endurance in the Southern UK North Sea together with bp and NGV, and the NEP partnership submitted a bid for funding further project development of the CO2 transport and storage infrastructure through UK's government's industrial decarbonisation challenge.\n\n## In July 2020, Equinor launched the Hydrogen 2 Humber (H2H)\n\nSaltend project (part of Zero Carbon Humber) which aims to anchor the low-carbon infrastructure in the area and a fuel switch in the Saltend chemical park. Established hydrogen pipelines will be expanded across the Humber, transporting hydrogen for use by multiple industry and power customers.\n\nEquinor and partners Air Liquide (operator) and BKK are developing a liquid hydrogen project in southwestern Norway to establish a full value chain for decarbonising the maritime sector ( Liquid to hydrogen project LH2 ). In May 2020, the consortium with representatives from the whole value chain was established. Mongstad Industripark was chosen as the location for liquid hydrogen production based on the opportunities for infrastructure synergies between existing and future plants in the area. This project is part of the Equinor's maritime climate strategy, which is well aligned with the political strategy set out by the Norwegian government for decarbonisation of the maritime sector.\n\n## Pipelines\n\nEquinor is a significant shipper in the NCS gas pipeline system. Most of the gas pipelines on the NCS that are accessed by thirdparty customers are owned by a single joint venture, Gassled (Equinor 5%), with regulated third-party access. The Gassled system is operated by the independent system operator Gassco AS, which is wholly owned by the Norwegian State. See Gas sales and transportation from the NCS in section 2.9 Corporate for further information.\n\nEquinor is technical service provider (TSP) for the K\u00e5rst\u00f8 and Kollsnes gas processing plants in accordance with the technical service agreement between Equinor and Gassco AS, included as Exhibit 4(a)(i) to the Form 20-F. Equinor also performs the TSP role for the majority of the Gasscooperated gas pipeline infrastructure.\n\nIn addition, MMP manages Equinor's ownership in the following pipelines in the Norwegian oil and gas transportation system: The Grane oil pipeline (Equinor 23.5%), the Kvitebj\u00f8rn oil pipeline (Equinor 39.6%), the Troll oil pipeline I and II (Equinor 30.6%), the Edvard Grieg oil pipeline (Equinor 16.6%), the Utsira High gas pipeline (Equinor 24.9%), the Valemon rich gas pipeline (Equinor 66.8 %), the Haltenpipe pipeline (Equinor 19.1%), Norpipe gas pipeline (Equinor 5%) , Vestprosess pipeline and processing plant (Equinor 34%) and Mongstad gas pipeline (Equinor 30.6%).\n\nEquinor holds an interest in the Nyhamna gas processing plant (Equinor 30.1%) in Aukra via the Nyhamna Joint Venture. The venture is operated by Gassco.\n\nThe Polarled pipeline (Equinor 37.1%), operated by Gassco, connects fields in the Norwegian Sea with the Nyhamna gas processing plant.\n\nThe Johan Sverdrup pipelines (owned by the Johan Sverdrup licence partners) export oil and gas from the Johan Sverdrup field. The crude oil is exported from Johan Sverdrup to the Mongstad terminal through a 283 km, 36-inch pipeline. The gas is transported to the gas processing facility at K\u00e5rst\u00f8 through a 156 km long, 18-inch pipeline with a subsea connection to the Statpipe pipeline.",

Previously the activities in REN were reported in the segment Other. The change has its basis in the increased strategic importance of the renewable business for Equinor and that the information is regarded useful for the readers of the financial statements.\n\nEquinor aims to be a leader in the energy transition and is building a material position in renewable energy, focusing on offshore wind, and integrated solutions for onshore renewables.\n\nWe are developing as a global offshore wind major, powering European homes with renewable electricity from offshore wind farms in the UK and Germany and building material clusters in the North Sea, the US East coast and in the Baltic Sea. In parallel, we are actively positioning ourselves to access emerging markets globally. The core of Equinor's renewable strategy is creating value from scale within established clusters and developing growth options in prioritised markets.\n\nEquinor sees potential for floating offshore wind projects in Norway, Europe, the US and Asia and is accelerating the development of this technology to uphold its leading position. Floating wind is still at an early development phase compared to other renewable energy sources. However, through technology improvements, increased scale and industrialisation, it represents the next wave of scalable renewables. Floating wind farms can capture higher winds, are more flexible on location and could be built in areas where there are few alternatives due to limited onshore or nearshore acreage like outside large coastal cities.\n\nEquinor is also gradually growing its presence in onshore renewables in selected power markets with increasing demand for solar, wind and storage solutions as integrated parts of the energy system.\n\n## Key events in 2021 and early 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 On 29 January, Equinor closed the transaction with bp to sell 50% of the non-operated interests in the Empire Wind and Beacon Wind assets for a preliminary total consideration of USD 1.2 billion (after interim period adjustments), resulting in a gain of USD 1.1 billion for the divested portion.\n- \u00b7 On 26 February, Equinor closed the transaction with Eni to sell a 10% equity interest in the Dogger Bank Wind Farm A and B assets in the UK for a total consideration of GBP 206.4 million (USD 285 million), resulting in a gain of GBP 202.8 million (USD 280 million).\n- \u00b7 On 5 May, Equinor completed a transaction to acquire 100% of the shares in Wento , a Polish onshore renewables developer, from the private equity firm Enterprise Investors for a cash consideration of EUR 98 million (USD 117 million) after net cash adjustments.\n- \u00b7 On 6 May, Equinor announced entry into a collaboration agreement with V\u00e5rgr\u00f8nn to jointly apply for offshore wind acreage in Norway for the Utsira North area.\n- \u00b7 In May, Equinor completed the acquisition of a site at the port of \u0141eba to serve as the operations and maintenance (O&M) base for the Polish Baltic Sea offshore wind projects. The announcement makes Equinor the first developer to confirm an offshore wind maintenance port in Poland together with the joint venture partner Polenergia.",

The wind farm is in full production with 88 turbines and an installed capacity of 317 megawatts (MW). The wind farm's annual production is approximately 1.1 terawatt hours (TWh).\n\nThe Dudgeon offshore wind farm (Equinor 35%, operator) lies in the Greater Wash area off the English east coast, a short distance from Sheringham Shoal. The wind farm has been in operation since November 2017, with an annual production of approximately 1.7 TWh from 67 turbines. The capital expenditure is financed through project finance. At year-end 2021, Equinor's share of the project financing debt for the project amounted to 0.5 billion USD.\n\nThe Hywind Scotland wind farm (Equinor 75%, operator) is a floating wind pilot farm using the Hywind concept, developed and owned by Equinor. The wind farm is placed at Buchan Deep, approximately 25 km off Peterhead on the east coast of Scotland, UK. Equinor completed the project during 2017 and has installed five 6 MW turbines. Production is around 0.14 TWh per year.\n\nThe Arkona offshore wind farm (Equinor 25%, operated by RWE) is located in the German part of the Baltic Sea, while the operations and maintenance base is in Port Mukran on the island of R\u00fcgen in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The wind farm has\n\n60 turbines and a capacity of 385 MW and has been in full operation from early 2019. The wind farm's annual production is approximately 1.6 TWh.\n\n## Projects under development\n\nThe Hywind Tampen floating offshore wind project is described in section 2.3 Exploration & Production Norway.\n\nThe Dogger Bank wind farms (Equinor 40%, operated by SSE Renewables during the development phase. Equinor assumes operatorship when the windfarms come on stream) are three 1,200 MW offshore wind farms, Dogger Bank A, B and C, being developed 130 km off the coast of Yorkshire, UK. This is the world's largest offshore wind farm development with a total planned capacity of 3,600 MW. All three projects have been awarded a Contract for Difference (CfD), a government financial support mechanism providing the projects a long-term predictable revenue stream. Each project will require a total capital expenditure of around GBP 3 billion, including the capex for the offshore transmission system. A state-of-the-art Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Base is under construction in the Port of Tyne.\n\nFinal investment decision for Dogger Bank A and B was made in 2020. The third project, Dogger Bank C, reached final investment decision in November 2021. The capital expenditure is partially financed through project finance for all three projects. At year-end 2021, Equinor's share of the project financing debt for the three projects amounted to 1.2 billion USD. First power is expected in 2023 for Dogger Bank A, 2024 for Dogger Bank B and 2025 for Dogger Bank C. Equinor and SSE have entered into an agreement to sell 10% each in Dogger Bank C to Eni. The transaction closed on 10 February 2022 and Equinor now holds a 40% interest  in all three projects.\n\n## Early phase developments\n\n## Offshore wind\n\nEquinor is developing the Empire Wind (Equinor 50%, operator) and Beacon Wind (Equinor 50%, operator) assets off the US east coast together with bp. The agreement with bp to sell 50% non-operated interests in these assets was closed on 29 January 2021.\n\nThe Empire Wind site extends 24-48 km (15-30 miles) southeast of Long Island, spans 324 km 2 (80,000 acres), and covers water depths between 20 and 40 metres (65 and 131 feet). Empire Wind's lease area could have the capacity to produce up to 2,000 megawatts of electricity, enough to power more than 1 million homes. Beacon Wind is located 65 km south of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and 110 km east of Long Island, New York, and is large enough to support one or several windfarms with a total capacity above 2,000 MW.\n\nOn 14 January 2022, Equinor and bp announced the finalisation of the Purchase and Sale Agreements (PSAs) with the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) for Empire Wind 2 and Beacon Wind 1. Equinor and bp will provide generation capacity of 1,260 megawatts (MW) renewable offshore wind power from Empire Wind 2, and",

The maximum total capacity for the combined projects will be 719 MW and Equinor is seeking to develop the two projects as a Tandem project. Both extension projects secured a grid connection and commenced a joint consenting process. The projects are named Dudgeon extension project and Sheringham Shoal extension project.\n\nThe Ba\u0142tyk I, II and III are offshore wind development projects in Poland (Equinor 50%, operator). Ba\u0142tyk II and III have a combined capacity of up to 1,440 MW and will supply more than 2 million households with electricity. They are located between 27 and 40 kilometres from shore in water depths of 20-40 meters. The final investment decisions are subject to obtaining necessary permits. The Ba\u0142tyk I project is located around 80 km from the shore on the border of the Polish exclusive economic zone and will have a capacity of up to 1,560 MW. It holds location permits and grid connection conditions from the transmission system operator. During 2021, Equinor and Polenergia's Ba\u0142tyk II and Ba\u0142tyk III projects were awarded contracts for difference (CfD) under the first phase of Poland's offshore wind development scheme.\n\n## Onshore renewables\n\n## Assets in production\n\nThe Apodi solar plant (Equinor 43.75%, operated by Scatec) is located in the municipality of Quixer\u00e9, Cear\u00e1 State in Brazil. The plant, with an installed capacity of 162 MW, started commercial operations in November 2018. The capital expenditure is financed through project financing.\n\nThe Guanizul 2A solar plant (Equinor 50%, operated by Scatec) is located in the San Juan region of Argentina. The plant started operations in July 2021 and has an installed capacity of 117 MW.\n\nAs of end 2021, Equinor ASA owns 20,776,200 shares in Scatec ASA , corresponding to 13.12% of the total shares and voting power in an integrated independent solar power producer. This financial investment is included in the Other Group reporting segment.\n\n## Early phase development and project development\n\nIn 2021, Equinor acquired the Polish onshore renewables developer Wento, providing a strong platform for growth in onshore renewables in the country. Wento develops and sells renewable energy projects. Two solar PV plant projects are currently under construction in Poland (120 MW) and commercial operations expected in 2022/2023.\n\nIn 2021, Equinor also acquired a 45% stake in Noriker Power Limited, a leading battery storage developer in the United Kingdom focusing on the engineering and project development of utility scale storage and stability services.\n\nGuanizul 2A solar plant in San Juan, Argentina.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 2.9 Corporate\n\n## Applicable laws and regulations\n\nEquinor operates in around 30 countries and is exposed and committed to compliance with numerous laws and regulations globally.\n\nThis section gives a general description on the legal and regulatory framework in the various jurisdictions where Equinor operates and in particular in the countries of Equinor's core activities.\n\nFor further information about the jurisdictions in which Equinor operates, see sections 2.2 Business overview and 2.13 Risk review. Further, see chapter 3 Governance for information about the domicile and legal form of Equinor, including the current articles of association, information on listing on the Oslo B\u00f8rs and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and corporate governance.\n\n## Regulatory framework for upstream oil and gas operations\n\nCurrently, Equinor is subject to two main regimes applicable to petroleum activities worldwide:\n\n- \u00b7 Corporate income tax regimes; and\n- \u00b7 Production sharing agreements (PSAs)\n\nEquinor is also subject to a wide variety of health, safety and environmental (HSE) laws and regulations concerning its products, operations and activities. Relevant laws and regulations include jurisdiction specific laws and regulations, international regulations, conventions or treaties, as well as EU directives and regulations.\n\n## Concession regimes\n\nUnder a concession regime, companies are granted licences by the government to extract petroleum. This is similar to the Norwegian system described below. Typically, the licensees are offered to pre-qualified companies following bidding rounds. The criteria for the evaluation of bidding offers under these regimes can be the level of offered signature bonus (bid amount), minimum exploration programme, and local content. In exchange for those commitments, the successful bidder(s) receive a right to explore, develop and produce petroleum within a specified geographical area for a limited period of time. The terms of the licences are usually not negotiable. The fiscal regime may entitle the relevant jurisdiction to royalties, profit tax or special petroleum tax.\n\n## PSA regimes\n\nPSAs are normally awarded to the contractor parties after bidding rounds announced by the government. Main bid parameters are a minimum exploration programme and signature bonuses, and allocation of profit oil and tax may also be a bid parameter.\n\nUnder a PSA, the host government typically retains the right to the hydrocarbons in place. The contractor receives a share of the production for services performed. Normally, the contractor carries the exploration and development costs and risk prior to a commercial discovery and is then entitled to recover those costs during the production phase. The remaining share of the production - the profit share, is split between the government and the contractor according to a mechanism set out in the PSA. The contractor is usually subject to income tax on its own share of the profit oil. Fiscal provisions in a PSA are to a large extent negotiable and are unique to each PSA.\n\n## Norway\n\nThe principal laws governing Equinor's petroleum activities in Norway and on the NCS are the Norwegian Petroleum Act of 29 November 1996 (the Petroleum Act) and the regulations issued thereunder, and the Norwegian Petroleum Taxation Act of 13 June 1975 (the Petroleum Taxation Act).\n\nNorway is not a member of the European Union (EU) but is a member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). The EU and the EFTA Member States have entered into the Agreement on the European Economic Area, referred to as the EEA Agreement, which provides for the inclusion of EU legislation in the national law of the EFTA Member States (except Switzerland). Equinor's business activities are subject to both the EFTA Convention and EU laws and regulations adopted pursuant to the EEA Agreement.\n\nUnder the Petroleum Act, the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (MPE) is responsible for resource management and for administering petroleum activities on the NCS. The main task of the MPE is to ensure that petroleum activities are conducted in accordance with the applicable legislation, the policies adopted by the Norwegian Parliament (the Storting) and relevant decisions of the Norwegian State.\n\nThe Storting's role in relation to major policy issues in the petroleum sector can affect Equinor in two ways: first, when the Norwegian State acts in its capacity as majority owner of Equinor shares and, second, when the Norwegian State acts in its capacity as regulator:\n\n- \u00b7 The Norwegian State's shareholding in Equinor is managed by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries. The Ministry will normally decide how the Norwegian State will vote on proposals submitted to general meetings of the shareholders. However, in certain exceptional cases, it may be necessary for the Norwegian State to seek approval from the Storting before voting on a certain proposal. This will normally be the case if Equinor issues additional shares and such issuance would significantly dilute the Norwegian State's holding, or if such issuance would require a capital contribution from the Norwegian State in excess of government mandates.

        "page_content": "## Strategic report\n\nagainst an Equinor proposal to issue additional shares would prevent Equinor from raising additional capital in this manner and could adversely affect Equinor's ability to pursue business opportunities. For more information about the Norwegian State's ownership, see Risks related to state ownership in section 2.13 Risk review, chapter 3 Governance, and Major shareholders in section 5.1 Shareholder information.\n\n- \u00b7 The Norwegian State exercises important regulatory powers over Equinor, as well as over other companies and corporations on the NCS. As part of its business, Equinor or the partnerships to which Equinor is a party, frequently need to apply for licences and other approvals from the Norwegian State. Although Equinor is majority-owned by the Norwegian State, it does not receive preferential treatment with respect to licences granted by or under any other regulatory rules enforced by the Norwegian State.\n\nThe Petroleum Act sets out the principle that the Norwegian State is the owner of all subsea petroleum on the NCS, that exclusive right to resource management is vested in the Norwegian State and that the Norwegian State alone is authorised to award licences for petroleum activities as well as determine their terms. Licensees are required to submit a plan for development and operation (PDO) to the MPE for approval. For fields of a certain size, the Storting has to accept the PDO before it is formally approved by the MPE. Equinor is dependent on the Norwegian State for approval of its NCS exploration and development projects and its applications for production rates for individual fields.\n\nProduction licences are the most important type of licence awarded under the Petroleum Act. A production licence grants the holder an exclusive right to explore for and produce petroleum within a specified geographical area. The licensees become the owners of the petroleum produced from the field covered by the licence. Production licences are normally awarded for an initial exploration period, which is typically six years, but which can be shorter. The maximum period is ten years. During this exploration period, the licensees must meet a specified work obligation set out in the licence. If the licensees fulfil the obligations set out in the initial licence period, they are entitled to require that the licence be extended for a period specified at the time when the licence is awarded, typically 30 years.\n\nThe terms of the production licences are decided by the MPE. Production licences are awarded to group of companies forming a joint venture at the MPE's discretion. The members of the joint venture are jointly and severally liable to the Norwegian State for obligations arising from petroleum operations carried out under the licence. The MPE decides the form of the joint operating agreements and accounting agreements.\n\nThe governing body of the joint venture is the management committee. In licences awarded since 1996 where the State's direct financial interest (SDFI) holds an interest, the Norwegian State, acting through Petoro AS, may veto decisions made by the joint venture management committee, which, in the opinion of the Norwegian State, would not be in compliance with the obligations set forth in the licence with respect to the Norwegian\n\nState's exploitation policies or financial interests. This power of veto has never been used.\n\nInterests in production licences may be transferred directly or indirectly subject to the consent of the MPE and the approval of the Ministry of Finance of the tax treatment. In most licences, there are no pre-emption rights in favour of the other licensees. However, the SDFI, or the Norwegian State, as appropriate, still hold pre-emption rights in all licences.\n\nThe day-to-day management of a field is the responsibility of an operator appointed by the MPE. The operator is in practice always a member of the joint venture holding the production licence, although this is not legally required. The terms of engagement of the operator are set out in the joint operating agreement.\n\nIf important public interests are at stake, the Norwegian State may instruct the operators on the NCS to reduce the production of petroleum. An example of this occurred in 2020, when the Norwegian State in May imposed a reduction in oil production for the rest of the year, due to the Covid-19 pandemic that led to a lower demand for oil and gas. The reduction in production was distributed between all fields on a pro rata basis.\n\nA licence from the MPE is also required in order to establish facilities for the transportation and utilisation of petroleum. Ownership of most facilities for the transportation and utilisation of petroleum in Norway and on the NCS is organised in the form of joint ventures. The participants' agreements are similar to joint operating agreements for production.\n\nLicensees are required to prepare a decommissioning plan before a production licence or a licence to establish and use facilities for the transportation and utilisation of petroleum expires or is relinquished, or the use of a facility ceases. On the basis of the decommissioning plan, the MPE makes a decision as to the disposal of the facilities.\n\nFor an overview of Equinor's activities and shares in Equinor's production licences on the NCS, see section 2.3 E&P Norway.\n\n## Gas sales and transportation from the NCS\n\nEquinor markets gas from the NCS on its own behalf and on the Norwegian State's behalf. Dry gas is mainly transported through the Norwegian gas transport system (Gassled) to customers in the UK and mainland Europe, while liquified natural gas is transported by vessels to worldwide destinations.\n\nThe Norwegian gas transport system, consisting of the pipelines and terminals through which licensees on the NCS transport their gas, is owned by a joint venture called Gassled. The Norwegian Petroleum Act of 29 November 1996 and the pertaining Petroleum Regulation establish the basis for nondiscriminatory third-party access to the Gassled transport system.\n\nThe tariffs for the use of capacity in the transport system are determined by applying a formula set out in separate tariff regulations stipulated by the MPE. The tariffs are paid for booked capacity rather than the volumes actually transported.\n\nFor further information, see section 2.6 Marketing, Midstream & Processing (MMP).",

        "page_content": "## The Norwegian State's participation\n\nIn 1985, the Norwegian State established the State's direct financial interest (SDFI) through which the Norwegian State has direct participating interests in licences and petroleum facilities on the NCS. As a result, the Norwegian State holds interests in a number of licences and petroleum facilities in which Equinor also holds interests. Petoro AS, a company wholly owned by the Norwegian State, was formed in 2001 to manage the SDFI assets.\n\nThe Norwegian State has a coordinated ownership strategy aimed at maximising the aggregate value of its ownership interests in Equinor and the Norwegian State's oil and gas. This is reflected in the Owner's Instruction described below, which contains a general requirement that, Equinor, in its activities on the NCS, take account of these ownership interests in decisions that may affect the execution of this marketing arrangement.\n\n## SDFI oil and gas marketing and sale\n\nEquinor markets and sells the Norwegian State's oil and gas together with Equinor's own production. The arrangement has been implemented by the Norwegian State through a separate instruction (the Owner's Instruction) adopted by an extraordinary shareholder meeting in 2001, with the Norwegian State as sole shareholder at the time. The Owner's Instruction sets out the specific terms for the marketing and sale of the Norwegian State's oil and gas.\n\nEquinor is obliged under the Owner's Instruction to jointly market and sell the Norwegian State's oil and gas as well as Equinor's own oil and gas. The overall objective of the marketing arrangement is to obtain the highest possible total value for Equinor's oil and gas and the Norwegian State's oil and gas, and to ensure an equitable distribution of the total value creation between the Norwegian State and Equinor.\n\nThe Norwegian State may at any time utilise its position as majority shareholder of Equinor to withdraw or amend the Owner's Instruction.\n\n## US\n\nPetroleum activities in the US are extensively regulated by multiple agencies in the US federal government, and by tribal, state and local regulation. The US government directly regulates development of hydrocarbons on federal lands, in the US Gulf of Mexico, and in other offshore areas. Different federal agencies directly regulate portions of the industry, and other general regulations related to environmental, safety, and physical controls apply to all aspects of the industry. In addition to regulation by the US federal government, any activities on US tribal lands (indigenous persons' semi-sovereign territory) are regulated by governments and agencies in those areas. Significantly for Equinor's US onshore interests, each individual state has its own regulations of all aspects of hydrocarbon development within its borders. A recent trend also includes local municipalities adopting their own hydrocarbon regulations.\n\nIn the US, hydrocarbon interests are considered a private property right. In areas owned by the US government, that means that the government owns the minerals in its capacity as landowner. The federal government, and each tribal and state government, establishes the terms of its own leases, including the length of time of the lease, the royalty rate, and other terms.\n\nThe vast majority of onshore minerals, including hydrocarbons, in every state in which Equinor has onshore interests, belong to private individuals.\n\nIn order to explore for or develop hydrocarbons, a company must enter into a lease agreement from the applicable governmental agency for federal, state or tribal land, and for private lands, from each owner of the minerals the company wishes to develop. In each lease, the lessor retains a royalty interest in the production (if any) from the leased area. The lessee owns a working interest and has the right to explore and produce oil and gas. The lessee incurs all the costs and liabilities but will share only the portion of the revenue that is net of costs and expenses and not reserved to the lessor through its royalty interest.\n\nLeases typically have a primary term for a specified number of years (from one to ten years) and a conditional secondary term that is tied to the production life of the properties. If oil and gas is being produced in paying quantities at the end of the primary term, or the operator satisfies other obligations specified in the agreement, the lease typically continues beyond the primary term (Held by Production). Leases typically involve paying the lessor both a signing bonus based on the number of leased acres and a royalty payment based on the production.\n\nEach state has its own agencies that regulate the development, exploration, and production of oil and gas activities. These state agencies issue drilling permits and control pipeline transportation within state boundaries. The state agencies particularly relevant to Equinor's US onshore activities include: (a) Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Office of Oil and Gas Management, (b) Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Oil and Gas, and (c) West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection. In addition, some state utility departments handle pipeline transportation within state boundaries, and each state also has its own department regulating environmental, health, and safety issues arising from oil and gas operations.\n\n## Brazil\n\nIn Brazil, licences are mainly awarded according to a concession regime or a production sharing regime (the latter specifically for areas within the pre-salt polygon area or strategic areas) by the Federal Government. All state-owned and private oil companies may participate in the bidding rounds provided they follow the bidding rules and meet the qualification criteria. The tender protocol issued for each bidding round contains the draft of the concession agreement or the production sharing agreement that the winners must adhere to without the possibility of negotiating its terms, i.e., all the agreements signed under a certain bidding round contain the same general provisions and only differ in the particular items presented in the offers. There is no restriction on foreign participation, provided that the foreign investor incorporates a company under the Brazilian law for signing the agreement and complies with the requirements established by the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP).\n\nThe current criteria for the evaluation of bidding offers under the concession regime are: (a) signature bonus; and (b) minimum exploration program. However, in past bidding rounds the participants also had to offer a local content percentage as",

Companies can bid individually or in consortium always observing the qualification criteria for operator and non-operators.\n\nThe concession agreements are signed by ANP on behalf of the Federal Government. Generally, concessions are granted for a total period of 35 years and typically the exploration phase lasts from two to eight years, while the production phase may last 27 years from the declaration of commerciality. Concessionaires are entitled to request the extension of each of these phases, subject to ANP approval.\n\nIn bidding rounds involving the production sharing regime, the law grants to the Brazilian government-controlled company Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras, a right of preference to be the sole operator in the pre-salt fields with a minimum 30% of participating interest. If this right is exercised, Petrobras may still participate in the bidding round and present offers for the remaining 70% under the same conditions applicable to other participants. Likewise, in the concession bidding rounds, companies may bid individually or together with other companies. The winners are required to form a consortium with Pre-Sal Petroleo S.A. (PPSA), a Brazilian state-owned company, which is responsible for managing the production sharing agreement and selling the production allocated to the Government under the profit oil. PPSA appoints 50% of the members of the operating committee, including the chairperson, in addition to certain veto rights and casting vote.\n\nThe current criteria for the evaluation of bidding offers under the production sharing regime is the offered percentage of profit oil. The winner will be the company which offers the highest percentage to the government in accordance with the technical and economic parameters established for each block in the tender documents under a certain bidding round.\n\nProduction sharing contracts are signed by the Ministry of Mines and Energy on behalf of the Federal Government. Generally, the contracts are valid for a period of 35 years which, in accordance with the law, cannot be extended. Of the two phases of the contract - exploration and production - the exploration phase can be extended provided that the total period of the contract remains as 35 years.\n\nIn order to perform the exploration and exploitation of oil and gas reserves, the companies must obtain an environmental license granted by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA), which, together with ANP, is responsible for the safety and environmental regulations regarding upstream activities.\n\n## HSE regulation relevant for the Norwegian upstream oil and gas activities in Norway\n\nEquinor's oil and gas operations in Norway must be conducted in compliance with a reasonable standard of care, taking into consideration the safety of workers, the environment and the economic values represented by installations and vessels. The Petroleum Act specifically requires that petroleum operations be carried out in such a manner that a high level of safety is maintained and developed in step with technological developments. Equinor is also required at all times to have a plan to deal with emergency situations in Equinor's petroleum operations. During an emergency, the Norwegian Ministry of\n\nLabour and Social Inclusion/Norwegian Ministry of Transport/Norwegian Coastal Administration may decide that other parties should provide the necessary resources, or otherwise adopt measures to obtain the necessary resources, to deal with the emergency for the licensees' account.\n\n## Liability for pollution damage\n\nThe Norwegian Petroleum Act imposes strict liability for pollution damage regardless of fault. Accordingly, as a holder of licences on the NCS, Equinor is subject to statutory strict liability under the Petroleum Act as a result of pollution caused by spills or discharges of petroleum from petroleum facilities in any of Equinor's licences.\n\nA claim against the license holders for compensation relating to pollution damage shall initially be directed to the operator, which in accordance with the terms of the joint operating agreement, will distribute the claim to the other licensees in accordance with their participating interest in the licences.\n\n## Discharge permits\n\nEmissions and discharges from Norwegian petroleum activities are regulated through several acts, including the Petroleum Act, the CO2 Tax Act, the Sales Tax Act, the Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Act and the Pollution Control Act. Discharge of oil and chemicals in relation to exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas are regulated under the Pollution Control Act. In accordance with the provisions of this Act, an operator must apply for a discharge permit from relevant authorities on behalf of the licence group in order to discharge any pollutants into water. Further, the Petroleum Act states that burning of gas in flares beyond what is necessary for safety reasons to ensure normal operations is not permitted without approval from the MPE. All operators on the NSC have an obligation, and are responsible, for establishing sufficient procedures for the monitoring and reporting of any discharge into the sea. The Environment Agency, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate and the Norwegian Oil Industry Association have established a joint database for reporting emissions to air and discharges to sea from the petroleum activities, the Environmental Web (EW). All operators on the NCS report emission and discharge data directly into the database.\n\n## Regulations on reduction of carbon emissions and CO2 storage\n\nEquinor's operations in Norway are subject to emissions taxes as well as emissions allowances granted for Equinor's larger European operations under the emissions trading scheme. The agreed strengthening of the EU's emission trading scheme may result in a significant reduction in the total emissions from relevant energy and industry installations, which include Equinor's installations at the NCS. The price of emissions allowances has increased significantly and is expected to increase further towards 2030.\n\nThe Norwegian Climate Act promotes the implementation of Norway's climate targets as part of the transition to a lowemission society in Norway in 2050. This act may influence our activities through plans and actions implemented to achieve these targets and reference is made to the Climate Plan 20212030 launched 8 January 2021 by the Norwegian Government for achievement of at least 50% and towards 55% reduction in GHG emissions in 2030 compared to 1990 levels.

The CO2 capture and storage at Equinor's Sleipner and Sn\u00f8hvit fields as well as the Northern Lights project are governed by these regulations. More storage locations are currently being applied for.\n\n## HSE regulation of upstream oil and gas activities in the US\n\nEquinor's upstream activities in the US are heavily regulated at multiple levels, including federal, state, and local municipal regulation. Equinor is subject to those regulations as a part of its activities in the US onshore (including Equinor's assets in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia), and activities in the US Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 is an umbrella procedural statute that requires federal agencies to consider the environmental impacts of their actions. Several substantive US federal statutes specifically cover certain potential environmental effects of hydrocarbon extraction activities. Those include: the Clean Air Act, which regulates air quality and emissions; the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act), which regulates water quality and discharges; the Safe Drinking Water Act, which establishes drinking water standards for tap water and underground injection rules; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, which regulates hazardous and solid waste management; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, which addresses remediation of legacy disposal sites and release reporting; and the Oil Pollution Act, which provides for oil spill prevention and response.\n\nOther US federal statutes are resource-specific. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 protects listed endangered and threatened species and critical habitat. Other statutes protect certain species, including the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. Other statutes govern natural resource planning and development on federal lands onshore and on the Outer Continental Shelf, including: the Mineral Leasing Act; the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act; the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976; the Mining Law of 1872; the National Forest Management Act of 1976; the National Park Service Organic Act; the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act; the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966; the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act; and the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972.\n\nThe federal government regulates offshore exploration and production for the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), which extends from the edge of state waters (either 3 or 9 nautical miles from the coast, depending on the state) out to the edge of national jurisdiction, 200 nautical miles from shore. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) manages federal OCS leasing programs, conducts resource assessments, and licences seismic surveys. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) regulates all OCS oil and gas drilling and production. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) collects and disburses rents and royalties from offshore and onshore federal and Native American lands.\n\nAdditional federal statutes cover certain products or wastes, and focus on human health and safety: the Toxic Substances Control Act regulates new and existing chemicals and products that contain these chemicals; the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act regulates transportation of hazardous materials; the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 regulates hazards in the workplace; the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 provides emergency planning and notification for hazardous and toxic chemicals.\n\nThe federal and state governments share authority to administer some federal environmental programs (e.g., the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act). States also have their own, sometimes more stringent, environmental laws. Counties, cities and other local government entities may have their own requirements as well.\n\nEquinor continually monitors regulatory and legislative changes at all levels and engages in the stakeholder process through trade associations and direct comments to suggested regulatory and legislative regimes, to ensure that its operations remain in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. In particular, BSEE drilling and production regulations were extensively revised in response to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon blowout and oil spill. The revised regulatory regime includes requirements for enhanced well design, improved blowout preventer design, testing and maintenance, and an increased number of trained inspectors. The Biden Administration is expected to review and revise these regulations, and Equinor is engaged with relevant governmental and industry stakeholders to ensure that Equinor's operations remain in compliance.\n\n## HSE regulation of upstream oil and gas activities in Brazil\n\nEquinor's oil and gas operations in Brazil must be conducted in compliance with a reasonable standard of care, taking into consideration the safety and health of workers and the environment. The Brazilian Petroleum Law (Law No. 9,478/97) describes the government's policy objectives for the rational use of the country's energy resources, including the protection of the environment. In addition to the Petroleum Law, Equinor is also subject to many other laws and regulations issued by different authorities, including ANP, IBAMA, Federal Environmental Council (CONAMA) and Brazilian Navy. All those authorities have the power to impose fines in case of non-compliance with the respective rules. The concession and production sharing contracts also impose obligations on operators and consortium members, who are jointly and severally liable. They must, at their own account and risk, assume and fully respond to all losses and damages caused directly or indirectly by the applicable consortium's operations and their performance irrespective of fault, to the ANP, the Federal Government and third parties.\n\nThe exploration, drilling and production of oil and gas depend on environmental licences which define the conditions for the implementation of the project and compliance measures to mitigate and control environment impact. Equinor is subject to fines and even licence suspension and/or cancellation in case of non-compliance with such conditions.\n\nIn Brazil, Equinor is also required to have an emergency response system as per ANP Ordinance 44/2009 to deal with emergency situations in its petroleum operations, as well as an oil spill response plan for each asset to minimise the",

According to Environmental Ministry Ordinance No. 422/2011, the discharge of chemicals in connection with exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas is assessed as part of the permitting process and the operator must apply for any discharge permit from relevant authorities on behalf of the licence group in order to discharge any pollutants into the water.\n\n## Regulations on reduction of carbon emissions\n\nAlthough Equinor's operations in Brazil are not subject to emissions taxes (CO2 limit) yet, there are initiatives within the Brazilian congress for the establishment of a carbon market. At this point it is unclear if and when these initiatives will be turned into law.\n\nThe CONAMA Regulation No. 382/06 regulates air emissions limits for pollutant gases (e.g. NOx) from all fixed sources that have total power consumption higher than 100MW.\n\nGas flares must be authorised by the ANP under ANP Resolution No. 806/2020, which also sets out cases in which ANP authorisation is not necessary.\n\nThe Brazilian government signed the Paris Agreement in 2015. During COP26, Brazil updated its ambition to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 37% until 2025 and 50% until 2030, compared to 2005 levels. Because of the desire to boost the economy and an expected growing energy demand, the focus on emissions reduction is on improved control of Forests and Land Use and for that Brazil continue to adhere to the Forest for Deal agreement, committing to take actions to reduce illegal deforestation until 2030. The country also adheres to the Global Methane Pledge.\n\nTo meet the growing energy demand challenge, the Brazilian government has indicated acceptance for an increase in total emissions in the short term from the industrial and power generation sectors, although the efficiency in power generation and usage will certainly be an important part of the Brazilian government's future approach to the issue.\n\n## Regulatory framework for renewable energy operations\n\nEquinor's renewables positions currently mainly consist of offshore wind farms in operation and development in the UK, the state of New York and Poland. In these jurisdictions the legislation is structured around a lease where permission to develop is granted following a series of approvals relating largely to environmental and social impact assessments. The government separately auctions a subsidized power purchase price either through renewable offtake certificates or contracts for difference. In both cases, Equinor and its partners take the risk for developing, constructing and operating the wind farms within a fixed timeframe.\n\nNorwegian continental shelf.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Taxation of Equinor\n\n## Norway\n\nEquinor's profits, both from offshore oil and natural gas activities and from onshore activities, are subject to Norwegian corporate income tax. The standard corporate income tax rate is 22%. In addition, a special petroleum tax is levied on profits from petroleum production and pipeline transportation on the NCS. The special petroleum tax rate is 56%. The special petroleum tax rate is applied to relevant income in addition to the standard income tax rate, resulting in a 78% marginal tax rate. For further information, see note 10 Income taxes to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn June 2020, the Norwegian Parliament enacted temporary targeted changes to Norway's petroleum tax system for investments incurred in 2020 and 2021 and beyond 2021 for certain projects. The changes were effective from 1 January 2020 and provide companies with an immediate tax deduction in the special petroleum tax (56% rate) instead of tax depreciation over six years. In addition, the tax uplift, which has been increased from 20.8% to 24%, will be allowed in the first year instead of over four years. Tax depreciation towards the corporate tax rate (22% tax rate) will continue to be over six years. See also note 10 Income taxes to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nOn 3 September 2021, the Norwegian Ministry of Finance circulated a consultation paper for a cashflow-based petroleum tax system for the special tax of 56%. The combined tax rate of 78% is maintained and the temporary 2020-rules are upheld for qualified future investments. Investments that are not covered by the temporary 2020-rules will be 100% deductible in the special tax base, but with no right for uplift. The corporate tax of 22% is deductible in the special tax base and the special tax rate is increased to 71.8% to maintain the marginal tax rate of 78%. Tax treatment of future investment costs in the ordinary tax base (22%) will continue to be depreciated over six years. The new rules are proposed to be implemented from 1 January 2022. The deadline for consultation on the proposal was 3 December 2021 and the new Government, which has expressed\n\nsupport to the main content of the proposal, will now draft a bill to the parliament (Storting).\n\nEquinor's international petroleum activities are subject to tax pursuant to local legislation.\n\n## US\n\nEquinor's operations in the US are subject generally to corporate income, severance and production, ad valorem and transaction taxes levied by the federal, state and local tax authorities, and to royalties payable to federal, state and local authorities and, in some cases, private landowners. The federal corporate income tax rate in the US is 21%. The current administration is proposing several major legislative changes to the US tax code, including the imposition of a 15% minimum tax on corporate book income for corporations with profits over USD 1 billion, effective for tax years beginning after 31 December 2022.\n\n## Brazil\n\nRegardless of the applicable regime for oil and gas activities, corporate income tax and social contribution are levied on taxable income at a combined rate of 34%. A simplified tax regime with a lower effective tax rate is available for activities with gross revenues below a threshold of 78 million Brazilian reais per year. In addition, there are several indirect taxes but exports are exempt. There is a Bill of Law aiming to establish a tax on export of crude oil expected to be voted in 2022.\n\nImports of assets are subject to several customs duties, but a special regime is available for certain assets used in the oil and gas activities allowing suspension of the federal duties and reduction of state duties.\n\nThe concession regime usually includes a 10% royalty, and special participation tax that varies based on time, location and production between 10% and 40%. PSA regime usually includes a 15% royalty, an annual 80% cost recovery ceiling, and a biddable government profit share.",

These are the result of continuous business processes and can be expected to continue to add reserves in the future.\n\nProved reserves can also be added or subtracted through the acquisition or divestment of assets or due to other factors outside management control.\n\nChanges in oil and gas prices can affect the quantities of oil and gas that can be recovered from the accumulations. Higher oil and gas prices will normally allow more oil and gas to be recovered, while lower prices will normally result in reductions. However, for fields with PSAs and similar contracts, increased prices may result in lower entitlement to produced volumes and lower prices may increase entitlement to produced volumes. These described changes are included in the revisions category.\n\nThe principles for booking proved gas reserves are limited to contracted gas sales or gas with access to a robust gas market.\n\nIn Norway, the UK and Ireland, Equinor recognises reserves as proved when a development plan is submitted, as there is reasonable certainty that such a plan will be approved by the regulatory authorities. Outside these territories, reserves are generally booked as proved when regulatory approval is received, or when such approval is imminent. Undrilled well locations in onshore fields in the USA are generally booked as proved undeveloped reserves when a development plan has been adopted and the well locations are scheduled to be drilled within five years.\n\nApproximately 85% of Equinor's proved reserves are located in OECD countries. Norway is by far the most important contributor in this category, followed by USA and Canada. Of Equinor's total proved reserves, 6% are related to PSAs in nonOECD countries such as Angola, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Libya, Nigeria and Russia 9 . Other non-OECD reserves are related to concessions in Argentina, Brazil and Russia 1 , representing all together 9% of Equinor's total proved reserves.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is the net result of 746 million boe in positive revisions and increased recovery and 150 million boe in negative revisions. Many producing fields had positive revisions due to better performance, new drilling targets and improved recovery measures, as well as reduced uncertainty\n\ndue to further drilling and production experience. The positive\n\nrevisions also included a direct effect of higher commodity prices, increasing the proved reserves by approximately 275 million boe through increased economic lifetime on several fields. The negative revisions were related to lower entitlement volumes from several fields with PSAs, and to unforeseen events and operational challenges resulting in reduced production potential on some fields.\n\n## Extensions and discoveries\n\nA total of 306 million boe of new proved reserves were added through extensions and discoveries. The Bacalhau field in Brazil is the main contributor in this category and is included in the proved reserves for the first time. In addition, this category includes extensions of proved areas through drilling of new wells in previously undrilled areas in the onshore plays in the US and in Argentina, and at fields in Norway and UK.\n\n## Purchase and sale of reserves\n\nThere were no purchase of proved reserves in 2021.\n\nA total of 96 million boe of sale of reserves in place are related to divestment of our Bakken assets in the US and the Terra Nova field offshore Canada.\n\n## Production\n\nThe 2021 entitlement production was 710 million boe, unchanged from 2020.",

Production start of the Troll Phase 3 project and the Martin Linge field added more than 600 million boe to the proved developed reserves. Continued drilling in the Appalachian basin in the US and in the Oseberg, Johan Sverdrup, and Snorre fields in Norway increased the proved developed reserves by 180 million boe during 2021. The remaining 100 million boe of the matured volume is related to a wide range of activities on assets world-wide. The positive revisions of both proved developed reserves of 471 million boe and proved undeveloped reserves of 125 million boe are related to the increased commodity prices, increasing economic lifetime at some fields, as well as higher activity levels.\n\nUndeveloped extensions and discoveries of 269 million boe are dominated by the onshore assets in the Appalachian basin and in Argentina, together with the Bacalhau field in Brazil and the Johan Castberg field in Norway.\n\nIn 2020, 250 million boe were matured from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves. Continued drilling in the Appalachian basin in the US and in the Johan Sverdrup, \u00c6rfugl and Oseberg fields in Norway, increased the proved developed reserves by 200 million boe during 2020. The remaining 50 million boe of the matured volume was related to a wide range of activities on assets world-wide. The negative revision of proved undeveloped reserves of 131 million boe was both related to the reduced commodity prices, decreasing economic lifetime at some fields, as well as reduced activity levels and operational challenges This resulted in a reduction of\n\nproved undeveloped reserves, particularly in the onshore assets in the US, in fields in Brazil and in the UK.\n\nIn 2019, 426 million boe were matured from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves. Start of production from the Johan Sverdrup, Trestakk and Utgard fields in Norway and in the UK, increased the proved developed reserves by 305 million boe. The remaining 121 million boe of the matured volume was related to activities on developed assets in several countries. Sanctioning of the North Komsomolskoye field development in Russia 10 , and extension of the proved areas in our onshore assets in the US, were the main reasons for the 188 million boe of proved undeveloped reserves added as extensions and discoveries. The net positive revisions of 149 million boe were the result of several smaller revisions on most fields in our portfolio.\n\nOver the last five years, Equinor has matured 2,406 million boe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves.",

The Johan Sverdrup and Sn\u00f8hvit fields, which have continuous development activities, together with fields not yet in production, such as Johan Castberg, have the largest proved undeveloped reserves in Norway. The largest assets with proved undeveloped reserves outside Norway, are Bacalhau and Peregrino in Brazil, North Komsomolskoye in Russia 11 , the Appalachian basin and Vito in the US, Mariner in the UK, and ACG in Azerbaijan. All these fields are either producing or will start production within the next three years.\n\nFor fields with proved reserves where production has not yet started, investment decisions have already been sanctioned and investments in infrastructure and facilities have commenced. There are no material development projects, which would require a separate future investment decision by management, included in our proved reserves.  Some development activities will take place more than five years from the disclosure date on many fields, but these are mainly related to incremental type of spending, such as drilling of additional wells from existing facilities, in order to secure continued production.\n\nFor projects under development, the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted progress due to personnel limitations on offshore and onshore facilities and yards. This has delayed production start at the Martin Linge and Johan Castberg fields in Norway. At Martin Linge, where development has now been going on for more than five years, first oil was planned in 2020. First oil occurred in 2021. The Johan Castberg field was originally planned to start production in 2022, four years after the field development was sanctioned. This is now delayed to 2024.\n\nFor our onshore assets, all proved undeveloped reserves are limited to wells that are scheduled to be drilled within five years.\n\nIn 2021, Equinor incurred USD 7.0 billion in development costs relating to assets carrying proved reserves, of which USD 6.0 billion was related to proved undeveloped reserves.\n\nAdditional information about proved oil and gas reserves is provided in section 4.2 Supplementary oil and gas information (unaudited).\n\n## Reserves replacement\n\nThe reserves replacement ratio is defined as the net amount of proved reserves added divided by produced volumes in any given period. The table below presents the changes in reserves for each category relating to the reserve replacement ratio for the years 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nThe 2021 reserves replacement ratio was 113% and the corresponding three-year average was 61%.\n\nThe reserves replacement ratio excluding equity accounted entities was 115% in 2021.\n\nThe organic reserves replacement ratio, excluding sales and purchases, was 127% in 2021 compared to negative 6% in 2020. The organic average three-year replacement ratio was 68% at the end of 2021.\n\nFor additional information regarding proved reserves changes and the reliability of proved reserves estimates, see the sections 4.2 Supplementary oil and gas information and 2.13 Risk review, respectively.",

Of these, 53 fields and field areas are currently in production, 41 12 of which are operated by Equinor.\n\nProduction experience, further drilling and improved recovery on many of Equinor's producing fields in Norway contributed with positive revisions of 465 million boe in 2021. Negative revisions totalled 42 million boe and were related to operational challenges. The higher commodity prices increased the proved reserves in Norway by 144 million boe (2.2%).\n\nInclusion of new segments to several fields contributed to extensions and discoveries which totalled 19 million boe in 2021.\n\nOf total proved reserves on the NCS, 2,847 million boe (75%) are proved developed reserves. Of the total proved reserves in this area, 60% are gas reserves related to large gas fields such as Troll, Oseberg, Sn\u00f8hvit, Ormen Lange, Aasta Hansteen, Martin Linge, Tyrihans and Visund, and 40% are liquid reserves.\n\n## Proved reserves in Eurasia, excluding Norway\n\nEquinor has proved reserves of 204 million boe related to seven fields in Russia 13 , Azerbaijan, United Kingdom and Ireland. Net negative revisions related mainly to operational challenges on fields in the UK and in Russia 1 reduced the proved reserves in this area by 23 million boe. Eurasia excluding Norway represents 4% of Equinor's total proved reserves. All fields in this area are now producing. Of the proved reserves in Eurasia, 85 million boe (42%) are proved developed reserves.\n\nOf the total proved reserves in this area, 87% are liquid reserves and 13% are gas reserves.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Proved reserves in Africa\n\nEquinor recognised proved reserves of 159 million boe in producing assets in the West and North African countries Angola, Algeria, Nigeria and Libya. Africa represents 3% of Equinor's total proved reserves. Angola and Algeria are the primary contributors to the proved reserves in this area. Most of the fields in Africa are mature and on decline. Net positive revisions increased the proved reserves by 13 million boe, mainly related to positive reservoir performance.\n\nFor information related to the Agbami redetermination process and the dispute between the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and the partners in Oil Mining Lease (OML) 128 concerning certain terms of the OML 128 Production Sharing Contract (PSC), see note 24 Other commitments, contingent liabilities and contingent assets to the Consolidated financial statements. The effect of this redetermination on the proved reserves, which is estimated to be immaterial, is not yet included.",

Liquid reserves are 40% and gas reserves are 60%.\n\nProved reserves in the US now represent 12% of total proved reserves in Equinor.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Proved reserves in the Americas excluding USA\n\nIn the Americas excluding USA, Equinor has proved reserves equal to 552 million boe in a total of seven fields. Three fields are located offshore Canada, three offshore Brazil, and one field onshore in Argentina. Six of these are producing.\n\nOur interests in the Terra Nova field in Canada were divested during 2021 resulting in a reduction of 6 million boe.\n\nRevisions of the proved reserves in this area are positive increasing the proved reserves by a net volume of 63 million boe. This is related to continued drilling and increased commodity prices, resulting in longer economic lifetime of fields.\n\nSanctioning of the Bacalhau field, offshore Brazil, and activities in new areas in Bandurria Sur in Argentina added a total of 224 million boe to the extensions and discoveries category.\n\nOf the total proved reserves in the Americas excluding USA, 217 million boe, or 39% are proved developed reserves. Less than 1% of the proved reserves in this area are gas reserves.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Preparation of reserves estimates\n\nEquinor's annual reporting process for proved reserves is coordinated by a central corporate reserves management (CRM) team consisting of qualified professionals in geosciences, reservoir and production technology and financial evaluation. The team has an average of more than 25 years' experience in the oil and gas industry. CRM reports to the senior vice president of accounting and financial compliance in the Chief financial officer organisation and is independent of the exploration and production business areas. All the reserves estimates have been prepared by Equinor's technical staff.\n\nAlthough the CRM team reviews the information centrally, each asset team is responsible for ensuring compliance with the requirements of the SEC and Equinor's corporate standards. Information about proved oil and gas reserves, standardised measures of discounted net cash flows related to proved oil and gas reserves and other information related to proved oil and gas reserves, is collected from the local asset teams and checked by CRM for consistency and conformity with applicable standards. The final numbers for each asset are qualitycontrolled and approved by the responsible asset managers, before aggregation to the required reporting level by CRM.\n\nThe person with primary responsibility for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimates is the manager of the CRM team. The person who currently holds this position has a bachelor's degree in earth sciences from the University of Gothenburg, and a master's degree in petroleum exploration and exploitation from Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden. She has 36 years' experience in the oil and gas industry, 35 of them with Equinor. She is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineering (SPE) and of the Technical Advisory Group to the UNECE Expert Group on Resource Management (EGRM).\n\n## DeGolyer and MacNaughton report\n\nPetroleum engineering consultants DeGolyer and MacNaughton have carried out an independent evaluation of Equinor's proved reserves as of 31 December 2021 using data provided by Equinor. The evaluation accounts for 100% of Equinor's proved reserves including equity accounted entities.

In Africa, the Algerian gas development projects In Amenas and In Salah represent the largest concentrations of net developed acreage. In the Americas, the Appalachian basin assets in the US have the largest net developed acreage.\n\nThe largest concentration of net undeveloped acreage is in Russia 14 in Eurasia, which represents 25% of Equinor's total net undeveloped acreage, followed by Norway and Argentina.\n\nThe largest net undeveloped acreage in the Americas, is in Argentina, Canada and Colombia.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, Equinor no longer holds acreage in Australia, Nicaragua, South Africa and Uruguay.\n\nEquinor holds acreage in numerous concessions, blocks and leases. The terms and conditions regarding expiration dates vary significantly from property to property. Work programmes are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration.\n\nAcreage related to several of these concessions, blocks and leases are scheduled to expire within the next three years. Any acreage which has already been evaluated to be non-profitable may be relinquished prior to the current expiration date. In other cases, Equinor may decide to apply for an extension if more time is needed in order to fully evaluate the potential of the properties. Historically, Equinor has generally been successful in obtaining such extensions.\n\nMost of the undeveloped acreage that will expire within the next three years, is related to early exploration activities where no production is expected in the foreseeable future. The expiration of these leases, blocks and concessions will therefore not have any material impact on our proved reserves.",

These reserves are sold in conjunction with Equinor's own reserves. As part of this arrangement, Equinor delivers gas to customers under various types of sales contracts. In order to meet the commitments, a field supply schedule is utilised to ensure the highest possible total value for Equinor and SDFI's joint portfolio of oil and gas.\n\nEquinor's and SDFI's delivery commitments under bilateral agreements for the calendar years 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025 expressed as the sum of expected gas off-take, are equal to 45.7, 32.5, 21.3 and 16.4 bcm, respectively. The number of bilateral agreements is steadily declining as our customers are increasingly requesting more and more short-term contracts and higher volumes are traded on the spot market.\n\nEquinor's currently developed gas reserves on the NCS are more than sufficient to meet our share of these commitments for the next four years.\n\nAny remaining volumes after covering our delivery commitments under the bilateral agreements, will be sold by trading activities at the hubs.\n\n## Production volumes and prices\n\nThe business overview is presented based on our segment's operations as of 31 December 2021, whereas certain disclosures on oil and gas reserves are based on geographical areas as required by the SEC. For further information about extractive activities, see sections 2.3 E&P Norway, 2.4 E&P International and 2.5 E&P USA.\n\nEquinor prepares its disclosures for oil and gas reserves and certain other supplemental oil and gas disclosures by geographical area, as required by the SEC. The geographical areas are defined by country and continent. These are Norway, Eurasia excluding Norway, Africa, the US and the Americas excluding US.\n\nFor further information about disclosures concerning oil and gas reserves and certain other supplemental disclosures based on geographical areas as required by the SEC, see section 4.2 Supplementary oil and gas information (unaudited).",

The stated production volumes are the volumes to which Equinor is entitled, pursuant to conditions laid down in licence agreements and production sharing agreements. The production volumes are net of royalty oil paid in-kind, and of gas used for fuel and flaring. Production is based on proportionate participation in fields with multiple owners and does not include production of the Norwegian State's oil and natural gas. NGL includes both LPG and naphtha.

Average invoiced gas prices for Europe and North America were up over 100% and 87% respectively, and average liquids prices were up 82%. Net impairments and exploration expenses were lower in 2021. Equinor delivered an entitlement production of 1,931 mboe per day, a minor decrease from 2020. Net income was positive USD 8.6 billion, up from negative USD 5.5 billion in 2020.\n\nTotal equity liquids and gas production was 2,079 mboe and 2,070 mboe per day in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The minor increase in total equity production was mainly due to new fields on stream on the NCS and higher gas outtake, partially offset by the divestment of an unconventional US onshore asset in the\n\nsecond quarter of 2021, expected natural decline and the continued shutdown of Hammerfest LNG plant.\n\nTotal entitlement liquids and gas production was 1,931 mboe per day in 2021 compared to 1,938 mboe in 2020. The production was influenced by the factors mentioned above in addition to lower entitlements from production sharing agreements (PSA) and lower US royalty volumes. The combined effect of PSA and US royalties was 148 mboe and 133 mboe per day in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nOver time, the volumes lifted and sold will equal the entitlement production, but they may be higher or lower in any period due to differences between the capacity and timing of the vessels lifting our volumes and the actual entitlement production during the period.\n\n| Condensed income statement under IFRS                   | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   |         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------|\n| (in USD million)                                        | 2021                             | 2020                             | Change  |\n| Revenues                                                | 88,744                           | 45,753                           | 94%     |\n| Net income/(loss) from equity accounted investments     | 259                              | 53                               | >100%   |\n| Other income                                            | 1,921                            | 12                               | >100%   |\n| Total revenues and other income                         | 90,924                           | 45,818                           | 98%     |\n| Purchases [net of inventory variation]                  | (35,160)                         | (20,986)                         | 68%     |\n| Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses | (9,378)                          | (9,537)                          | (2%)    |\n| Depreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses    | (11,719)                         | (15,235)                         | (23%)   |\n| Exploration expenses                                    | (1,004)                          | (3,483)                          | (71%)   |\n| Net operating income/(loss)                             | 33,663                           | (3,423)                          | N/A     |\n| Net financial items                                     | (2,080)                          | (836)                            | >(100%) |\n| Income/(loss) before tax                                | 31,583                           | (4,259)                          | N/A     |\n| Income tax                                              | (23,007)                         | (1,237)                          | >100%   |\n| Net income/(loss)                                       | 8,576                            | (5,496)                          | N/A     |",

        "page_content": "## Strategic report\n\nTotal revenues and other income amounted to USD 90,924 million in 2021 compared to USD 45,818 million in 2020.\n\nRevenues are generated from both the sale of lifted crude oil, natural gas and refined products produced and marketed by Equinor, and from the sale of liquids and gas purchased from third parties. In addition, Equinor markets and sells the Norwegian State's share of liquids from the NCS. All purchases and sales of the Norwegian State's production of liquids are recorded as purchases [net of inventory variations] and revenues, respectively, while sales of the Norwegian State's share of gas from the NCS are recorded net. For additional information regarding sales, see the Sales volume table in section 2.10 above in this report.\n\nRevenues were USD 88,744 million in 2021, up 94% compared to 2020. The increase was mainly due to significantly higher average prices for all products. Higher entitlement gas production added to the increase, partially offset by decreased entitlement liquids production and a reduction in sales of third party gas.\n\nNet income from equity accounted investments was USD 259 million in 2021, up from USD 53 million in 2020 mainly due to increase in net income from Angara Oil. For further information, see note 13 Equity accounted investments to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nOther income was USD 1,921 million in 2021 compared to USD 12 million in 2020. In 2021, other income was positively impacted by gain from divestment in Beacon and Empire Wind and Dogger Bank, Sn\u00f8hvit insurance proceeds and gain from effects related to the sale of shares in an Equinor refinery. In 2020, other income was positively impacted by gain on sale of assets mainly related to Kvitebj\u00f8rn pipeline and minor joint venture assets.\n\nDue of the factors explained above, total revenue and other income was up by 98% in 2021.\n\nPurchases [net of inventory variation] include the cost of liquids purchased from the Norwegian State, which is pursuant to the Owner's instruction, and the cost of liquids and gas purchased from third parties. See SDFI oil and gas marketing\n\nand sale in section 2.9 Corporate for more details. Purchases [net of inventory variation] amounted to USD 35,160 million in 2021 compared to USD 20,986 million in 2020. The 68% increase in 2021 was mainly due to significantly higher average prices for gas and liquids, partially offset by decreased third party sales of gas.\n\n## Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses\n\namounted to USD 9,378 million in 2021 compared to USD 9,537 million in 2020. The 2% decrease from 2020 to 2021 was mainly due to lower transportation costs on liquids due to lower volumes and lower freight rates. The decrease was partially offset by the NOK/USD exchange rate development, increased operation and maintenance activities in addition to increased royalties in the E&P International segment.\n\n## Depreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses\n\namounted to USD 11,719 million compared to USD 15,235 million in 2020. The 23% decrease was mainly due to lower net impairments primarily related to increased price assumptions in addition to the effect on depreciation of upward revision of reserves. The NOK/USD exchange rate development, investments and ramp-up of new fields especially on the NCS offset the decrease.\n\nIncluded in the total for 2021 was net impairments of USD 1,287 million, mainly related to negative reserve updates of an oil producing asset in Europe and increased cost estimates related to CO2 emissions for Mongstad refinery, partially offset by upwards revisions of reserves estimates on assets on Norwegian continental shelf and price assumptions.\n\nIncluded in the total for 2020 were net impairments of USD 5,720 million, the majority of which related to decreased price assumptions in addition to downward reserves revisions. Other elements were reduced refinery margin estimates, increased cost estimates in addition to reduced volume-estimates from processing and change to fair value less cost of disposal valuation in relation to a sales transaction.\n\nFor further information, see note 4 Segments and note 11 Property, plant and equipment to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Exploration expenses\n\n|                                                            | For the year ended 31 December   | For the year ended 31 December   |        |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------|\n| (in USD million)                                           | 2021                             | 2020                             | Change |\n| Exploration expenditures                                   | 1,027                            | 1,371                            | (25%)  |\n| Expensed, previously capitalised exploration expenditures  | 19                               | 1,169                            | (98%)  |\n| Capitalised share of current period's exploration activity | (194)                            | (394)                            | (51%)  |\n| Net impairments / (reversals)                              | 152                              | 1,337                            | (89%)  |\n| Total exploration expenses                                 | 1,004                            | 3,483                            | (71%)  |\n\nIn 2021, exploration expenses were USD 1,004 million, a 71% decrease compared to USD 3,483 million in 2020.\n\nThe 71% decrease in exploration expenses in 2021 is mainly due to lower impairments of exploration prospects and signature\n\nbonuses, write down of previously capitalised well costs of USD 982 million related to the Tanzania LNG project in 2020, lower drilling costs compared to 2020 and previously expensed wells being recapitalised due to related projects being matured in 2021.

        "page_content": "exploration expenditure being capitalised in 2021 and higher field development and seismic costs compared to 2020.\n\nIn 2021, there was exploration activity in 31 wells compared to 46 wells in 2020. 21 wells were completed with 8 commercial discoveries in 2021 compared to 34 wells completed with 16 commercial discoveries in 2020.\n\nNet operating income was positive USD 33,663 million in 2021 compared to negative USD 3,423 million in 2020. As with the development in revenues and costs discussed above, the increase in 2021 was primarily driven by higher gas and liquid prices and lower net impairments.\n\nNet financial items amounted to negative USD 2,080 million in 2021 compared to negative USD 836 million in 2020. The negative development of USD 1,244 million was mainly due to negative fair value development on non-current financial derivatives of USD 708 million in 2021, compared to positive fair value developments of USD 448 million in 2020. The negative fair value development in 2021 was mainly a result of an upward shift in both short term and long term interest rates.\n\nIncome taxes were USD 23,007 million in 2021, equivalent to an effective positive tax rate of 72.8%, compared to USD 1,237 million in 2020, equivalent to an effective negative tax rate of 29.0%. The effective tax rate in 2021 was primarily influenced by high share of operating income from the NCS with higher than average effective tax rate and losses recognised in countries with lower than average effective tax rates, partially offset by positive income in countries with unrecognised deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate was also influenced by currency effects in entities that are taxable in other currencies than the functional currency. For further information, see note 10 Income taxes to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe effective tax rate in 2020 was primarily influenced by losses recognised in countries without recognised taxes or in countries with lower than average tax rates. The effective tax rate was also influenced by currency effects in entities that are taxable in other currencies than the functional currency, partially offset by the temporary changes to Norway's petroleum tax system and changes in estimates for uncertain tax positions.\n\nThe effective tax rate is calculated as income taxes divided by income before taxes. Fluctuations in the effective tax rates from year to year are principally the result of non-taxable items (permanent differences) and changes in the relative composition of income between Norwegian oil and gas production, taxed at a marginal rate of 78%, and income from other tax jurisdictions. Other Norwegian income, including the onshore portion of net financial items, is taxed at 22%, and income in other countries is taxed at the applicable income tax rates in the various countries.\n\nIn 2021, net income was positive USD 8,576 million compared to negative USD 5,496 million in 2020.\n\nThe significant increase in 2021 was mainly a result of the increase in net operating income partially offset by the negative change in net financial items and by higher income taxes, as explained above.\n\nThe board of directors proposes to the AGM a cash dividend of USD 0.20 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021 and to introduce an extraordinary quarterly cash dividend of USD 0.20 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021 and for the first three quarters of 2022.\n\nThe annual ordinary dividends for 2021 amounted to an aggregate total of USD 2,939 million. Considering the proposed dividend, USD 5,223 million will be allocated to retained earnings in the parent company.\n\nFor 2020, annual ordinary dividends amounted to an aggregated total of USD 1,331 million.\n\nFor further information, see note 18 Shareholders' equity and dividends to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn accordance with \u00a73-3a of the Norwegian Accounting Act, the board of directors confirms that the going concern assumption on which the financial statements have been prepared, is appropriate.\n\nBalance sheet information: The sum of equity accounted investments and non-current segment assets was USD 71,213 million for the year ending 31 December 2021, compared to USD 78,919 million for the year ending 31 December 2020.\n\n## Segments financial performance\n\n## E&P Norway profit and loss analysis\n\nNet operating income in 2021 was USD 30,471 million, compared to USD 3,097 million in 2020. The USD 27,375 million increase from 2020 to 2021 was primarily driven by higher gas transfer price and liquids price.\n\nBalance sheet information: The sum of equity accounted investments and non-current segment assets was USD 35,304 million for the year ended 31 December 2021, compared to USD 37,735 million for the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\nThe average daily production of liquids and gas was 1,364 mboe per day in 2021 and 1,315 mboe per day in 2020. The increase was mainly due to the ramp-up of Johan Sverdrup and Martin Linge, a higher flexible gas outtake from Oseberg and Troll and new wells on Snorre and Skarv, partially offset by shutdown at Sn\u00f8hvit and natural decline.\n\nOver time, the volumes lifted and sold will equal entitlement production, but may be higher or lower in any period due to differences between the capacities and timing of the vessels lifting the volumes and the actual entitlement production during the period.",

The 230% increase in revenue in 2021 was mainly due to higher gas transfer price and liquids price.\n\nOther income was mainly impacted by insurance settlement related to the incident in 2020 on Melk\u00f8ya of USD 392 million in 2021. In 2020, other income was impacted by gain from the sale of an exploration asset of USD 3 million.\n\nOperating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses were USD 3,729 million in 2021, compared to USD 2,829 million in 2020. The increase was mainly due to the NOK/USD exchange rate development, higher Gassled removal costs and ramp-up of new fields. Higher environmental taxes, increased maintenance and higher electricity prices added to the increase.\n\nDepreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses were USD 4,678 million in 2021, compared to USD 5,546 million in 2020. The decrease was mainly due reversal of impairments. The NOK/USD exchange rate development, ramp-up of new fields, investments, higher field specific production, decreased proved reserves on several fields and increased depreciation of the asset retirement obligation (ARO) assets partially offset the decrease.\n\nExploration expenses were USD 363 million in 2021, compared to USD 423 million in 2020. The reduction from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to previously expensed wells being recapitalised due to related projects being matured, partially offset by higher field development and seismic costs. In 2021 there was exploration activity in 21 wells with 18 wells completed, compared to activity in 23 wells with 20 wells completed in 2020.\n\n## E&P International profit and loss analysis\n\nNet operating income in 2021 was positive USD 326 million, compared to negative USD 3,565 million in 2020. The increase from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to higher liquids and gas prices, and the write down of previously capitalised well costs of USD 982 million related to the Tanzania LNG project in 2020. Lower depreciations, higher result from associated companies, and lower impairment losses in 2021 added to the increase.\n\nBalance sheet information: The sum of equity accounted investments and non-current segment assets was USD 16,775 million for the year ended 31 December 2021, compared to USD 18,961 million for the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\nThe average daily equity liquids and gas production was 342 mboe per day in 2021, compared to 352 mboe per day in 2020. The decrease of 3% from 2020 to 2021 was driven by natural decline, primarily at mature fields in Angola, production halt on Peregrino in Brazil due to repairs, partially offset by higher field specific production in Russia 15 .\n\nThe average daily entitlement liquids and gas production was 246 mboe per day in 2021, compared to 278 mboe per day in 2020. The 11% decrease from 2020 to 2021 was due to lower equity production as described above, and higher effect from PSAs primarily driven by higher prices. The net effect of PSAs was 96 mboe per day in 2021 and 74 mboe per day in 2020.\n\nOver time, the volumes lifted and sold will equal to our entitlement production, but they may be higher or lower in any period due to differences between the capacity and timing of the vessels lifting our volumes and the actual entitlement production during the period.

The increase from 2020 to 2021 was primarily related to associated companies in Russia and Argentina. In 2020, the result included the expensing of well commitments in offshore Russia in connection with the purchase of shares in the KrasGeoNac limited liability company (renamed to AngaraOil limited liability company in 2021) 16 .\n\nOther income was positive USD 5 million in 2021, compared to negative USD 2 million in 2020. In 2021, other income was mainly related to a gain from the sale of an asset in Canada. In 2020, other income was mainly related to a settlement connected to the sale of an asset in UK.\n\nAs a result of the factors explained above, total revenues and other income increased by 59% in 2021.\n\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses were USD 1,466 million in 2021, compared to USD 1,439 million in 2020. The 2% increase from 2020 to 2021 was mainly due to higher royalties and production fees driven by higher prices.\n\nDepreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses were USD 3,257 million in 2021, compared to USD 3,471 million in 2020. The 6% decrease from 2020 to 2021 was primarily caused by lower depreciation expenses due to increased reserve estimates, lower entitlement production from mature fields and reduced asset retirement obligation estimates, partially offset by increased investments and field specific production.\n\nNet impairment losses increased from USD 1,426 million in 2020 to USD 1,587 million in 2021, with impairments of conventional assets in the Europe and Asia area caused by reduced reserve estimates as the largest contributors in 2021. In 2020, impairments of conventional assets in the Europe and Asia area were the main contributors, mainly caused by decreased shortterm price assumptions and reduced reserve estimates.\n\nExploration expenses were USD 451 million in 2021, compared to USD 2,071 million in 2020.  The decrease from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to write down of previously capitalised well costs of USD 982 million related to the Tanzania LNG project in 2020 and lower impairments of exploration prospects and signature bonuses amounting to USD 101 million in 2021 compared to USD 508 million in 2020, in addition to lower drilling and other cost. The decrease was partially offset by a lower portion of exploration expenditure being capitalised in 2021.\n\nIn 2021 there was exploration activity in nine wells with three wells completed, compared to 18 wells with 11 wells completed in 2020.\n\n## E&P USA profit and loss analysis\n\nNet operating income in 2021 was positive USD 1,150 million, compared to negative USD 3,512 million in 2020. The increase from 2020 to 2021 was mainly due to higher liquids and gas prices in addition to lower net impairments in 2021.\n\nNet impairment losses in 2021 amounted to USD 112 million relating to the US offshore leaseholds, changes to commodity prices assumptions, reduced reservoir performance and reduced fair value related to an asset held for sale in the first quarter of 2021. Net impairment losses in 2020 amounted to USD 2,758 million, with impairments of unconventional onshore assets in North America as the largest contributors caused by decreased long-term price assumptions, changed operational plans for certain assets and a reduced fair value for one asset.\n\nBalance sheet information: The sum of equity accounted investments and non-current segment assets was USD 11,406",

The 18% decrease from 2020 to 2021 was mainly due to the Bakken divestment in the second quarter of 2021 and reduced manning.\n\nDepreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses were USD 1,733 million in 2021, compared to USD 3,824 million in 2020. The 55% decrease from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to lower ordinary depreciation cost due to an asset classified as held for sale at year end 2020 and lower net impairments.\n\nExploration expenses were USD 190 million in 2021, compared to USD 990 million in 2020. The decrease from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to lower net impairments of exploration prospects and signature bonuses in 2021 of USD 44 million compared with USD 822 million in 2020, and lower drilling expenditures compared to 2020. The decrease was partially offset by increased field development cost due to increased activity compared to 2020.\n\nIn 2021, there was exploration activity in one well with no wells completed, compared to five wells with three wells completed in 2020.\n\n## MMP profit and loss analysis\n\nNet operating income was USD 1,141 million in 2021 compared to USD 359 million in 2020, an increase of 218%. The increase was mainly due to significant positive impact from gas derivatives, higher results from liquids trading, lower impairments and improved processing margins, partially offset by the continued outage at the Hammerfest LNG plant due to shutdown.\n\nNet operating income was negatively impacted by impairments of USD 718 million related to refinery assets. Operational storage effects of USD 231 million and other income of 167 million related to disposal of refinery asset partially offset the decrease. In 2020, net operating income was negatively impacted by impairments of USD 1,060 million mostly related to refinery assets and higher provisions of USD 245 million. Inventory hedging effects of USD 224 million and operating storage effects of USD 127 million added to decrease.\n\nBalance sheet information: The sum of equity-accounted investments and non-current segment assets was USD 3,133 million for the year ended 31 December 2021, compared to USD 4,460 million for the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\nThe total natural gas sales volumes were 61.0 bcm in 2021, increased by 1.8 bcm compared to total volumes for 2020. The increase in the NCS equity gas volumes was partially offset by a decrease in third party gas. The following chart does not include",

The increase from 2020 to 2021 was mainly due to higher prices for both gas and liquids, partially offset by lower volumes for liquids.\n\nOperating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses were USD 4,276 million in 2021, compared to USD 5,060 million in 2020. The decrease from 2020 to 2021 was mainly due to significant lower transportation costs due to weak freight market in addition to lower volumes. Higher costs at operating plants partially offset the decrease.\n\nDepreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses were USD 1,079 million in 2021, compared to USD 1,453 million in 2020. The decrease was mainly due to lower impairments in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\n## Renewables profit and loss analysis\n\nNet operating income was positive USD 1,245 million in 2021 compared to negative USD 35 million in 2020. The increase was mainly due to gain on divestments completed in the first quarter of 2021 of around USD 1.4 billion. Higher net income from equity accounted investments related to assets in production added to the increase. Lower net income from equity accounted investments related to assets under development (where project costs are expensed) in addition to increased business development costs driven by higher activity level in the US, the UK and in Asia partially offset the increase.\n\nBalance sheet information: The sum of equity accounted investments and non-current segment assets was USD 1,262 million at 31 December 2021, compared to USD 1,020 million for the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\nPower generation (Equinor share) was 1,562 GWh in the full year of 2021, compared to 1,662 GWh in the full year of 2020.

Reduced net results from equity accounted investments were mainly due to costs related to the progressing of the Empire Wind and Beacon Wind assets on the US east coast. These assets have changed consolidation method from proportional to equity accounted investments in 2021, following the farm-down of 50% of the owner share in the first quarter of 2021. Higher net income from equity accounted investments related to assets in production partially offset the decrease.\n\nOther income was impacted by gain on divestments in the first quarter of 2021 of around USD 1.4 billion.\n\nOperating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses were USD 163 million in 2021, compared to USD 215\n\nmillion in 2020. The decrease was mainly due to changed consolidation method for the Empire Wind and Beacon Wind assets, partially offset by increased business development costs driven by higher activity level in the US, the UK and in Asia.\n\n## Other\n\nThe Other reporting segment includes activities within; Projects, Drilling & Procurement, Technology, Digital & Innovation, corporate staffs and support functions, and IFRS 16 leases. All lease contracts are presented within the Other segment.\n\nIn 2021, the Other reporting segment recorded a net operating loss of USD 210 million compared to a net operating loss of USD 63 million in 2020. The increased loss compared to 2020 was mainly due to insurance costs related to the fire at Melk\u00f8ya LNG in late September 2020.",

The increase was mainly due to higher liquids and gas prices, partially offset by increased tax payments, changes in working capital and increased derivatives payments.\n\nCash flows used in investing activities increased by USD 4,119 million compared to 2020. The increase was mainly due to increased financial investments, partially offset by increased proceeds from sale of assets.\n\nCash flows used in financing activities increased by USD 7,827 million compared to 2020. The increase was mainly due to bonds issued in the first half of 2020 and increased repayment of short-term debt and increased collateral payments, partially offset by increase in short term debt, decreased payments related to the share buy-back programme and decreased dividend paid.\n\n## Financial assets and debt\n\nThe net debt to capital employed ratio before adjustments at year end decreased from 36.5% in 2020 to 2.2% in 2021. See section 5.2 for non-GAAP measures for net debt ratio. Net interest-bearing debt decreased from USD 19.5 billion to USD\n\n0.9 billion. During 2021 Equinor's total equity increased from USD 33.9 billion to USD 39.0 billion, mainly driven by higher liquids and gas prices in 2021. Equinor has paid out four quarterly dividends in 2021. For the fourth quarter of 2021 the board of directors will propose to the AGM to declare a dividend of USD 0.20 per share and to introduce an extraordinary quarterly cash dividend of USD 0.20 per share for 4Q 2021 and for the first three quarters of 2022. For further information, see note 18 Shareholders' equity and dividends to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nEquinor believes that, given its current liquidity reserves, including a committed revolving credit facility of USD 6.0 billion and its access to global capital markets, Equinor will have sufficient funds available to meet its liquidity needs and its working capital requirements.\n\nFunding needs arise as a result of Equinor's general business activities. Equinor generally seeks to establish financing at the corporate (top company) level. Project financing may be used in cases involving incorporated joint ventures with other companies. Equinor aims to have access to a variety of funding sources across different markets and instruments at all times, as well as to maintain relationships with a core group of international banks that provide a wide range of banking services.\n\nThe management of financial assets and liabilities takes into consideration funding sources, the maturity profile of noncurrent debt, interest rate risk, currency risk and available liquid assets. Equinor's borrowings are denominated in various currencies and normally swapped into USD. In addition, interest",

Equinor's funding and liquidity activities are handled centrally.\n\nEquinor has diversified its cash investments across a range of financial instruments and counterparties to avoid concentrating risk in any one type of investment or any single country. As of 31 December 2021, approximately 20% of Equinor's liquid assets were held in USD-denominated assets, 22% in NOK, 25% in EUR, 9% in DKK and 22% in SEK, before the effect of currency swaps and forward contracts. Approximately 27% of Equinor's liquid assets were held in time deposits, 58% in treasury bills and commercial papers and 8 % in money market funds. As of 31 December 2021, approximately 6% of Equinor's liquid assets were classified as restricted cash (including collateral deposits). Equinor's general policy is to keep a liquidity reserve in the form of cash and cash equivalents or other current financial investments in Equinor's balance sheet, as well as committed, unused credit facilities and credit lines in order to ensure that Equinor has sufficient financial resources to meet short-term requirements.\n\nLong-term funding is raised when a need is identified for such financing based on Equinor's business activities, cash flows and\n\nrequired financial flexibility or when market conditions are considered to be favourable.\n\nThe Group's borrowing needs are usually covered through the issuance of short-, medium- and long-term securities, including utilisation of a US Commercial Paper Programme (programme limit USD 5.0 billion) and issuances under a Shelf Registration Statement filed with the SEC in the US and a Euro Medium-Term Note (EMTN) Programme (programme limit EUR 20 billion) listed on the London Stock Exchange. Committed credit facilities and credit lines may also be utilised. After the effect of currency swaps, the major part of Equinor's borrowings is in USD.\n\nIn 2021 Equinor did not issue any new bonds. In May 2020, Equinor issued USD 1.5 billion in new bonds in the US bond market, amount equally split between 5 and 10 years to maturity, in addition to EUR 1.0 billion in new bonds in the European market with 12 years to maturity and EUR 750 million with 6 years to maturity. In April 2020 Equinor issued USD 1.25 billion new bonds with 5 years to maturity, USD 500 million with 7 years to maturity, USD 1.5 billion with 10 years to maturity, USD 500 million with 20 years to maturity and USD 1.25 billion with 30 years to maturity.

The decrease of USD 18.6 billion from 2020 to 2021 was mainly related to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of USD 7.3 billion, a USD 9.3 billion increase in current financial investments and a decrease in gross interest-bearing debt of USD 1.9 billion.\n\n## The net debt to capital employed ratio\n\nThe net debt to capital employed ratio before adjustments was 2.2% and 36.5% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nThe net debt to capital employed ratio adjusted (see footnote three above) was -0.8% and 31.7% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nThe 34.3 percentage points decrease in net debt to capital employed ratio before adjustments from 2020 to 2021 was related to the decrease in net interest-bearing debt of USD 18.6 billion in combination with a decrease in capital employed of USD 13.5 billion.\n\nThe 32.5 percentage points decrease in net debt to capital employed ratio adjusted from 2020 to 2021 was related to the decrease in net interest-bearing debt adjusted of USD 16.0 billion in combination with a decrease in capital employed adjusted of USD 10.9 billion.\n\n## Cash, cash equivalents and current financial investments\n\nCash and cash equivalents were USD 14.1 billion and USD 6.8 billion at 31 December 2021 and 2020, respectively. See note 17 Cash and cash equivalents to the Consolidated financial statements for information concerning restricted cash. Current financial investments, which are part of Equinor's liquidity management, amounted to USD 21.2 billion and USD 11.9 billion at 31 December 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Investments\n\nIn 2021, capital expenditures, defined as Additions to PP&E, intangibles and equity accounted investments in note 4 Segments to the Consolidated financial statements, amounted to USD 8.5 billion of which USD 8.1 billion were organic capital expenditures 17 .\n\nIn 2020, capital expenditures were USD 9.8 billion, as per note 4 Segments to the Consolidated financial statements, of which organic capital expenditures 7 amounted to USD 7.8 billion.\n\nIn 2019, capital expenditures were USD 14.8 billion, as per note 4 Segments to the Consolidated financial statements, of which organic capital expenditures 7 amounted to USD 10.0 billion.\n\nIn Norway, a substantial proportion of 2022 capital expenditures will be spent on ongoing development projects such as Johan Castberg, and Johan Sverdrup phase 2, in addition to various extensions, modifications and improvements on currently producing fields.\n\nInternationally, we currently estimate that a substantial proportion of 2022 capital expenditure will be spent on the following ongoing and planned development projects: Bacalhau phase 1 and Peregrino in Brazil, and offshore and non-operated onshore activity in the USA.\n\nWithin renewable energy, capital expenditure in 2022 is expected to be spent mainly on offshore wind projects.\n\nEquinor finances its capital expenditures both internally and externally. For more information, see Financial assets and debt earlier in this chapter.\n\nAs illustrated in section Principal contractual obligations below, Equinor has committed to certain investments in the future. The further into the future, the more flexibility we will have to revise expenditure. This flexibility is partially dependent on the expenditure joint venture partners agree to commit to. A large part of the capital expenditure for 2022 is committed.\n\nEquinor may alter the amount, timing or segmental or project allocation of capital expenditures in anticipation of, or as a result of a number of factors outside our control.",

Equinor Energy AS is the co-obligor of certain existing debt securities of Equinor ASA and has guaranteed certain existing debt securities of Equinor ASA, including in each case debt securities that are registered under the US Securities Act of 1933 (\"US registered debt securities\").\n\nAs co-obligor, Equinor Energy AS fully, unconditionally and irrevocably assumes and agrees to perform, jointly and severally with Equinor ASA, the payment and covenant obligations for certain debt held by Equinor ASA. As a guarantor, Equinor Energy AS fully and unconditionally guarantees the payment obligations for certain debt held by Equinor ASA. Total debt at 31 December 2021 is USD 27,650 million, all of which is either guaranteed by Equinor Energy AS (USD 25,493 million), or for which Equinor Energy AS is coobligor (USD 2,157 million). In the future, Equinor ASA may from time to time issue debt for which Equinor Energy AS will be the co-obligor or guarantor.\n\nThe applicable US registered debt securities and related guarantees of Equinor Energy AS are unsecured and rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of Equinor ASA and Equinor Energy AS. The guarantees of Equinor Energy AS are subject to release in limited circumstances upon the occurrence of certain customary\n\nconditions. With respect to US registered debt securities (and certain other debt securities) issued on or after 18 November 2019, Equinor Energy AS will automatically and unconditionally be released from all obligations under its guarantee and the guarantee shall thereupon terminate and be discharged of no further force or effect, in the event that at substantially the same time as its guarantee of such debt securities is terminated, the aggregate amount of indebtedness for borrowed money for which Equinor Energy AS is an obligor (as a guarantor, coissuer or borrower) does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness for borrowed money of Equinor ASA and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, as of such time.\n\nInternal dividends, group contributions and repayment of capital from Equinor Energy AS to Equinor ASA are regulated in the Norwegian Public Limited Liabilities Act \u00a7\u00a7 3-1 - 3-5.\n\nThe following summarised financial information for the year ended 31 December 2021 provides financial information about Equinor ASA, as issuer, and Equinor Energy AS, as co-obligor and guarantor on a combined basis after elimination of transactions between Equinor ASA and Equinor Energy AS. Investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries are eliminated.\n\nIntercompany balances and transactions between the obligor group and the non-guarantor subsidiaries are presented on separate lines. Transactions with related parties are also presented on a separate line item and include transactions with the Norwegian State's and the Norwegian State's share of dividend declared but not paid.\n\nThe combined summarized financial information is prepared in accordance with Equinor's IFRS accounting policies as described in note 2 Significant accounting policies.",

        "page_content": "## 2.13 Risk review\n\n## Risk factors\n\nEquinor is exposed to risks that separately, or in combination, could affect its operational and financial performance. In this section, some of the key risks are addressed.\n\n## Risks related to our business, strategy and operations\n\nThis section describes the most significant potential risks relating to Equinor's business, strategy and operations.\n\nOil and natural gas price. Fluctuating prices of oil and/or natural gas impact our financial performance. Generally, Equinor will not have control over the factors that affect the prices of oil and natural gas.\n\nThe prices of oil and natural gas have fluctuated significantly over the last years. Fundamental market forces and other factors beyond the control of Equinor or other similar market participants have impacted and will continue to impact oil and natural gas prices.\n\nFactors that affect the prices of oil and natural gas include:\n\n- \u00b7 economic and political developments in resource-\n- producing regions and key demand regions\n- \u00b7 actions taken by governments and international organizations, including changes in energy and climate policies;\n- \u00b7 global economic conditions;\n- \u00b7 global and regional supply and demand development;\n- \u00b7 the ability of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and/or other producing nations to influence global production levels and prices;\n- \u00b7 social and health situations in any country or region, including an epidemic or pandemic, measures taken by governments and non-governmental organisations in response to such situations, and the effects of such situations on demand;\n- \u00b7 prices of alternative fuels that affect the prices realised under Equinor's long-term gas sales contracts;\n- \u00b7 war or other international conflicts;\n- \u00b7 changes in population growth and consumer preferences;\n- \u00b7 the price and availability of new technology;\n- \u00b7 changes in supply from new oil and gas sources; and\n- \u00b7 weather conditions and climate change.\n\nIn 2021, there has been significant price volatility, primarily triggered by high economic growth and subsequent supply chain bottlenecks on the back of measures to contain the Covid19 pandemic. See also 'Covid-19 pandemic' below. Developments relating to Russia's invasion of Ukraine could adversely affect global and regional economic conditions and trigger volatility in the prices of oil, natural gas and energy generally.\n\nClimate change in general, the energy transition, governmental regulations and policies, and the world's ambition to reach the climate targets set out in the Paris Agreement could, either together or independently, influence oil and natural gas prices. Equinor's long-term plans have to take into consideration a large outcome space for how the global energy markets may develop in the long term. Estimating global energy demand decades ahead is an extremely difficult task, as it involves assessing the future development in supply and demand, technology change, taxation (including, taxes on emissions), production limits and other factors.\n\nDecreases in oil and/or natural gas prices could have an adverse effect on Equinor's business, the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and Equinor's ability to finance planned capital expenditure, including possible reductions in capital expenditures, which in turn could lead to reduced reserve replacement.\n\nA significant or prolonged period of low oil and natural gas prices or other indicators would, if deemed to have longer term impact, lead to reviews for impairment of the group's oil and natural gas assets. Such reviews would reflect management's view of long-term oil and natural gas prices and could result in a charge for impairment that could have a significant effect on the results of Equinor's operations in the period in which it occurs. Changes in management's view on long-term oil and/or natural gas prices or further material reductions in oil, gas and/or product prices could have an adverse impact on the economic viability of projects that are planned or in development. See also Note 2 Significant accounting policies to the Consolidated financial statements for a discussion of key sources of uncertainty with respect to management's estimates and assumptions that affect Equinor's reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses and Note 11 Property, plants, and equipment to the Consolidated financial statements for a discussion of price assumptions and sensitivities affecting the impairment analysis.\n\nProved reserves and expected reserves estimates. Crude oil and natural gas reserves are based on estimates and Equinor's future production, revenues and expenditures with respect to its reserves may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe reliability of the reserve estimates is dependent on:\n\n- \u00b7 the quality and quantity of Equinor's geological, technical and economic data;\n- \u00b7 the production performance of Equinor's reservoirs;\n- \u00b7 extensive engineering judgments; and\n- \u00b7 whether the prevailing tax rules and other government regulations, contracts and oil, gas and other prices remain the same as on the date the estimates are made.\n\nMany of the factors, assumptions and variables involved in estimating reserves are beyond Equinor's control and may",

        "page_content": "## Strategic report\n\nprove to be incorrect over time. The results of drilling, testing and production after the date of the estimates may require substantial upward or downward revisions in Equinor's reserve data.\n\nIn addition, proved reserves are estimated based on the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements and may therefore differ substantially from Equinor's view on expected reserves. The prices used for proved reserves are defined by the SEC and are calculated based on a 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month during the reporting year, leading to a forward price strongly linked to last year's price environment.\n\nFluctuations in oil and gas prices will have a direct impact on Equinor's proved reserves. For fields governed by production sharing agreements (PSAs), a lower price may lead to higher entitlement to the production and increased reserves for those fields. Conversely, a lower price environment may also lead to lower activity resulting in reduced reserves. For PSAs, these two effects may to some degree offset each other. In addition, a lower price environment may result in earlier shutdown due to uneconomic production. This will affect both PSAs and fields with concession types of agreement.\n\n## Climate change and transition to a lower carbon economy. A\n\ntransition to a lower carbon economy will affect Equinor's business and entails risks related to policy, legal, regulatory, market, technology developments as well as reputational impact.\n\nRisks related to changes in policies, laws and regulations: Equinor expects, and is preparing for, regulatory changes and policy measures targeted at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Stricter climate regulations and policies could impact Equinor's financial outlook, including the value of its assets, whether directly through changes in taxation, other costs to operations and projects, and access to acreage, or indirectly through changes in consumer behaviour or technology developments.\n\nEquinor expects greenhouse gas emission costs to increase from current levels and to have a wider geographical range than today. Equinor applies a default minimum carbon price in investment analysis starting at 58 USD per tonne in 2022, increasing towards 100 USD per tonne by 2030. In countries where the actual or predicted carbon price is higher than our default at any point in time, Equinor applies the actual or expected cost, such as in Norway where both a CO2 tax and the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS) apply.\n\nThe new EU Green Deal, EU Taxonomy and climate-related regulations and carbon pricing in specific countries imply more future uncertainty. Climate-related policy changes may also reduce access to prospective geographical areas for exploration and future production. Disruptive policy changes may not be ruled out, possibly triggered by severe weather events affecting public perception and policy making.\n\nMarket and technology risks: A transition to a low carbon economy contributes to uncertainty over future demand and prices for oil and gas as described in the section 'Oil and natural gas price'. Such price sensitivities of the project portfolio are\n\ndescribed in section 2.14 Safety, security and sustainability. Increased demand for and improved cost competitiveness of renewable energy, and innovation and technology changes supporting the further development and use of renewable energy and low-carbon technologies, represent both threats and opportunities for Equinor.\n\nReputational impact: Increased concern over climate change could lead to increased expectations on fossil fuel producers, as well as a more negative perception of the oil and gas industry. This could lead to increased litigation-related costs and poor reputation could affect our license to operate as well as our ability to attract and retain talent and key competences.\n\nAll of these risks could lead to an increased cost of capital. For example, certain lenders have recently indicated that they will direct or restrict their lending activities based on environmental parameters.\n\nEquinor's net zero path and climate related ambitions are a response to challenges related to climate change and the energy transition. There is no assurance that Equinor's climate related ambitions will be achieved. The achievement of the midand long-term climate ambitions depends, in part, on broader societal shifts in consumer demands and technological advancements, each of which are beyond Equinor's control. Should society's demands and technological innovation not shift in parallel with Equinor's pursuit of significant greenhouse gas emission reductions, Equinor's ability to meet its climate ambitions will be impaired.\n\nMove to a broader energy company and acceleration of renewable growth. For Equinor to build a material renewable business, covering also low carbon solutions such as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS), being competitive and getting access to attractive acreage and opportunities at the right terms are key. Future conditions along with risks and uncertainties in power, hydrogen and carbon markets as well as internal factors will influence our ability to achieve our ambitions relating to renewable energy.\n\nRisks related to changes in policies, laws and regulations: Policy makers in many modern electricity markets provide both direct and indirect support to renewables aimed at helping the renewable industry to grow and mature. The framework for low carbon solutions remains relatively immature while such solutions require material levels of investment. Potential regulatory changes, and new policy measures related to support regimes represent both threats and opportunities for Equinor. However, regulatory stability and predictability are key concerns in this area.\n\nMarket and technology risks: Technology development, such as for wind turbines, hydrogen production and carbon capture, is a driving force to ensure financial viability of Equinor's investments. Important risk factors are Equinor's understanding of the markets, market future development, and our ability to reduce costs and capitalize on technology improvements.\n\nFinancial and reputational impact: Strong competition for assets may lead to diminishing returns within the renewable and low carbon industries and hamper the transition into a broader energy company. Competitive auctions/tenders where prices do not allow absorption of higher costs may increase the exposure",

This is also relevant for assets where the costs and/or income have been locked in before the final investment decision.\n\nAlthough renewables and low carbon solutions are generally perceived to be important means to meet climate challenges, these industries may also entail impact on local communities and habitats. Accordingly, growth is also expected to be accompanied by greater scrutiny from other industries and the society at large. Increasing criticism and push-back from environmental non-governmental organisations and equivalents could lead to a negative perception of the renewable and low carbon industries which in turn could lead to less access to attractive business opportunities.\n\nOrganisational risk factors: Equinor's ambition of growth within the renewable and low carbon solutions domains highlights the need for robust processes and fit-for-purpose management systems to ensure a solid growth foundation. Providing the renewable and low carbon domains with a management system that is easy to adopt, implement, use and understand as well as ensuring sufficient capability in the organization will be crucial to the future success of a broader energy company. This implies uncertainty and risks with regards to continuously developing renewable and low carbon competence, having a disciplined capital allocation, ensuring enough capacity and management focus on delivering a sustainable and fit for purpose growth.\n\nGlobal operations. Equinor is engaged in global activities that involve several technical, commercial and country-specific risks.\n\nTechnical risks of Equinor's exploration activities relate to Equinor's ability to conduct its seismic and drilling operations in a safe and efficient manner and to encounter commercially productive oil and gas reservoirs. Technical risks of Equinor's development and operation activities relate to Equinor's ability to design, construct, operate and maintain facilities and installations for hydrocarbon exploitation, renewable energy generation and climate-related projects, such as carbon capture and storage.\n\nCommercial risks relate to Equinor's ability to secure access to new business opportunities in an uncertain global, competitive environment and to recruit and maintain competent personnel and continue to ensure commercial viability of such business opportunities in this context.\n\nCountry-specific risks relate, among other things, to health, safety and security, the political environment, compliance with and understanding of local laws, regulatory requirements and/or license agreements, and impact on the environment and the communities in which Equinor operates.\n\nThese risks may adversely affect Equinor's current operations and financial results, and, for its oil- and gas activities, its longterm replacement of reserves.\n\nSee 'Covid-19 pandemic' below for further details on how the Covid-19 pandemic impacts Equinor's operations. See 'International political, social, and economic factors' below for further details on how political, social, and economic factors could affect Equinor's business and Equinor's intention to exit its business activities in Russia.\n\nDecline of reserves. Failure to discover, acquire and develop additional reserves, will result in material decline of reserves and production from current levels.\n\nEquinor's future production is dependent on its success in discovering or acquiring and developing additional reserves adding value. If unsuccessful, future total proved reserves and production will decline.\n\nIf upstream resources are not progressed to proved reserves in a timely manner, Equinor's reserve base, and thereby future production, will gradually decline and future revenue will be reduced.\n\nIn particular, in a number of resource-rich countries, national oil companies control a significant proportion of oil and gas reserves that remain to be developed. To the extent that national oil companies choose to develop their oil and gas resources without the participation of international oil companies, or if Equinor is unable to develop partnerships with national oil companies, its ability to discover or acquire and develop additional reserves will be limited.\n\nIn addition, undeveloped resources could be impacted by low oil and/or gas prices over a sustained period of time. Such low prices may result in Equinor deciding not to develop these resources or at least deferring development awaiting improved prices.\n\nHealth, safety and environmental. Equinor is exposed to a wide range of health, safety and environmental risks that could result in significant losses.\n\nExploration, project development, operation and transportation related to oil and natural gas, as well as development and operation of renewable energy production, can be hazardous. In addition, Equinor's activities and operations are affected by external factors like difficult geographies, climate zones and environmentally sensitive regions.\n\nRisk factors that could affect health, safety and the environment include human performance, operational failures, detrimental substances, subsurface behaviour, technical integrity failures, vessel collisions, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, epidemics or pandemics, structural and organisational changes and other occurrences. Furthermore, non-compliance with our management system could influence the potential for negative effects. These risk factors could result in disruptions of our operations and could, among other things, lead to blowouts, structural collapses, loss of containment of hydrocarbons or other hazardous materials, fires, explosions and water contamination that cause harm to people, loss of life or environmental damage. In particular, all modes of transportation of hydrocarbons - including road, sea or pipeline - are susceptible to a loss of containment of hydrocarbons and other hazardous materials and represent a significant risk to people and the environment.\n\nAs operations are subject to inherent uncertainty, it is not possible to guarantee that the management system or other policies and procedures will be able to identify all aspects of health, safety and environmental risks. It is also not possible to",

Equinor is exposed to security threats that could have a materially adverse effect on Equinor's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nSecurity threats such as acts of terrorism, state-sponsored cyber operations, unauthorised access or attacks by hackers, computer viruses, breaches due to unauthorized use, errors or malfeasance by employees or others who have gained access to the networks and systems on which Equinor depends could result in loss of production, information, life and other losses. In particular, the scale, sophistication and severity of cyberattacks continue to evolve. Increasing digitisation and reliance on information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT or Industrial and automation control systems, IACS) systems make managing cyber-risk a priority for many industries, including the energy industry. Failure to manage these threats could materially disrupt Equinor's operations. The company could face regulatory actions, legal liability, reputational damage, and loss of revenue.\n\nFailure to maintain and develop cybersecurity barriers, which are intended to protect Equinor's IT infrastructure from being compromised by unauthorized parties, may affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Equinor's information systems and digital solutions, including those critical to its operations. Attacks on Equinor's information systems could result in significant financial damage to Equinor, including as a result of material losses or loss of life due to such attacks. Equinor could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems.\n\nInternational political, social, and economic factors. Equinor has interests in regions where political, social and economic instability could adversely affect Equinor's business.\n\nEquinor has assets and operations in several countries and regions around the globe where negative political, social and economic developments could occur. These developments and related security threats require continuous monitoring. Political instability, civil strife, strikes, insurrections, acts of terrorism and acts of war, adverse and hostile actions against Equinor's staff, its facilities, its transportation systems and its digital infrastructure (cyberattacks) may cause harm to people and disrupt or curtail Equinor's operations and business opportunities, lead to a decline in production and otherwise adversely affect Equinor's business, operations, results and financial condition. Similarly, Equinor's response to such situations could lead to claims from partners and relevant stakeholders, litigation, and litigation-related costs.\n\nEquinor holds an interest in one offshore and several onshore oil and gas projects in Russia. Some of these projects result from a strategic cooperation with Rosneft Oil Company (Rosneft) initiated in 2012. In each of these projects, Rosneft holds the\n\nmajority interest. One of the projects is in Arctic offshore and deepwater area.  As of 31 December 2021, Equinor had USD 1.2 billion in non-current assets in Russia. On 28 February 2022 Equinor announced that it will stop new investments into its Russian businesses and will start the process of exiting its joint ventures in Russia. It is expected that this decision will impact the book value of Equinor's Russian assets and lead to impairment. It is impossible to predict the timing and terms of such exit of Equinor's interests in Russia or the prices for which such interests may potentially be sold, all of which may be affected, among other factors, by trade restrictions and sanctions or other steps taken by governmental authorities or any other relevant persons. Such prices could be significantly below the book values of the assets divested and there is a risk that Equinor will not be able to recover any value from such assets.\n\nEquinor also has investments in Argentina where revised foreign exchange and price regulations could adversely affect Equinor's business.\n\nCovid-19 pandemic. Equinor's operations and workforce have and continue to be impacted by the global Covid-19 pandemic. The continuation or a resurgence of the pandemic, or the outbreak of other epidemics or pandemics, could precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors identified in this report and materially impact Equinor's operations and financial condition.\n\nIn 2021, the Covid-19 pandemic showed signs of being less severe. However, there continues to be uncertainty around the duration and extent of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Equinor's operations and workforce, including projects under development, have and continue to be impacted by the global Covid-19 pandemic. Quarantine rules, travel restrictions, workforce shortage, supply chain disruptions and Covid-19 prevention and mitigation controls, such as social distancing requirements and reduced utilisation of offshore beds, have resulted in lower activity levels on certain sites, causing delays, cost increases and disruption of further work. As a consequence, the start-up of projects (Njord future, Johan Castberg and Peregrino phase 2) have been postponed. In addition, certain of our suppliers and customers have and continue to be impacted by the spread of the pandemic, and the efforts to contain it, and may as a result explore invoking contractual clauses such as those involving force majeure. There can be no assurance that the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, new variants, and efforts to contain the virus will not materially impact our operations or financial condition.\n\nThe changes in market risk and economic circumstances from the Covid-19 pandemic will continue to impact Equinor's assumptions about the future and related sources of estimation uncertainty. The unprecedented nature of such market conditions could cause current management estimates and assumptions to be challenged in hindsight.\n\nThe continuation or a resurgence of the pandemic, or outbreak of other pandemics or epidemics, could precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors identified in this report. Such occurrences could further adversely affect Equinor's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and profitability, including in ways not currently known or considered by us to present significant risks.  The effect of any infection control measures may also impact project execution.",

        "page_content": "Physical effects of climate change. Changes in physical climate parameters could impact Equinor's facility design and operations.\n\nExamples of physical parameters that could impact Equinor's facility design and operations include acute effects like increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, and chronic effects like rising sea level, changes in sea currents and reduced water availability. There is also uncertainty regarding the magnitude and time horizon for the occurrence of physical impacts of climate change, which increases uncertainty regarding their potential impact on Equinor. The impact to Equinor could be increased costs or incidents affecting our operations.\n\nUnexpected changes in meteorological parameters, such as in the average wind speed, can also affect renewable power generation outputs, resulting in performance above or below expectations.\n\nHydraulic fracturing. Equinor is exposed to risks as a result of its use of hydraulic fracturing.\n\nEquinor's US operations use hydraulic fracturing which is subject to a range of applicable federal, state and local laws, including those discussed under the heading 'Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks'. A case of subsurface migration of hydraulic fracturing fluids or a case of spillage or mishandling of hydraulic fracturing fluids during these activities could subject Equinor to civil and/or criminal liability and the possibility of incurring substantial costs, including for environmental remediation. In addition, various states and local governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permit requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements and temporary or permanent bans. Changes to the applicable regulatory regimes could make it more difficult to complete oil and natural gas wells in shale formations, cause operational delays, increase costs of regulatory compliance or in exploration and production, which could adversely affect Equinor's US onshore business and the demand for its fracturing services.\n\nCrisis management systems. Equinor's crisis management systems may prove inadequate.\n\nIf Equinor does not respond or is perceived not to have prepared, prevented, responded or recovered in an effective and appropriate manner to a crisis, people, environment, assets and reputation could be severely affected. A crisis or disruption might occur as a result of a security or cybersecurity incident or if a risk described under 'Health, safety and environmental' materialises.\n\nCompetition; innovation. Equinor encounters competition from other companies in all areas of its operations. Equinor could be adversely affected if competitors move faster or in other directions in the development and deployment of new technologies and products.\n\nEquinor may experience increased competition from larger players with stronger financial resources, from smaller ones with increased agility and flexibility, and from an increasing number of companies applying new business models. Gaining access to\n\nattractive opportunities via license rounds, auctions, and acquisitions, in addition to continued exploration and development of existing assets are key to ensure the long-term economic viability of the business. Failure to address this could negatively impact future performance.\n\nTechnology and innovation are key competitive advantages in Equinor's industry - both within the traditional oil and gas industry and the renewable and low carbon industries. The ability to maintain efficient operations, develop and adapt to innovative technologies and digital solutions, and seek profitable low carbon energy solutions are key success factors for future business and resulting performance. Competitors may be able to invest more than Equinor in developing or acquiring intellectual property rights to technology. Equinor could be adversely affected if it lags behind competitors and the industry in general in the development or adoption of innovative technologies, including digitalisation and low carbon energy solutions.\n\nProject development and production operations. Equinor's development projects and production operations involve uncertainties and operating risks which could prevent Equinor from realising profits and cause substantial losses.\n\nOil and gas, renewable, low carbon and climate-related projects may be curtailed, delayed or cancelled for many reasons. Unexpected events as equipment shortages or failures, natural hazards, unexpected drilling conditions or reservoir characteristics, irregularities in geological formations, challenging soil conditions, accidents, mechanical and technical difficulties, challenges due to new technology and quality issues might have significant impact. The risk is higher in new and challenging areas such as deep waters or other harsh environments.\n\nEquinor's portfolio of development projects comprises a high number of mega-projects (eg. Njord Future, Johan Castberg and Bacalhau phase 1), 'first-off' projects (i.e., those involving a new project type/concept, a new area, a new execution model, a new market and/or a new main contractor for Equinor), which represent an increasing portfolio complexity and potential execution risk.\n\nIn US onshore, low regional prices may render certain areas unprofitable, and production may be curtailed until prices recover. Market changes and low oil, gas and power prices, combined with high levels of tax and government take in several jurisdictions, could erode the profitability of some of Equinor's activities.\n\nSimilarly, scarcity of electric power and grid capacity constraints, coupled with increasing electric power prices, could impede efforts to reduce carbon emissions from facilities.\n\nStrategic objectives. Equinor may not achieve its strategic objectives of successfully exploiting profitable opportunities.\n\nEquinor intends to continue to nurture attractive commercial opportunities to create value. This may involve acquisition of new businesses, and/or properties or moving into new markets. Failure by Equinor to successfully pursue and exploit new business opportunities, including in renewable and new energy",

New projects and acquisitions may have different embedded risks than Equinor's existing portfolio. As a result, new projects and acquisitions could result in unanticipated liabilities, losses or costs, as well as Equinor having to revise its forecasts either or both with respect to unit production costs and production. In addition, the pursuit of acquisitions or new business opportunities could divert financial and management resources away from Equinor's day-to-day operations to the integration of acquired operations or properties. Equinor may require additional debt or equity financing to undertake or consummate future acquisitions or projects, and such financing may not be available on terms satisfactory to Equinor, if at all, and it may, in the case of equity, be dilutive to Equinor's earnings per share.\n\nTransportation infrastructure. The profitability of Equinor's oil, gas and power production in remote areas may be affected by infrastructure constraints.\n\nEquinor's ability to commercially exploit discovered petroleum resources depends, among other factors, on infrastructure to transport oil, petroleum products and gas to potential buyers at a commercial price. Oil and petroleum products are transported by vessels, rail or pipelines to potential customers/refineries, petrochemical plants or storage facilities, and natural gas is transported to processing plants and end users by pipeline or vessels (for liquefied natural gas). Equinor's ability to commercially exploit renewable opportunities depends on available infrastructure to transmit electric power to potential buyers at a commercial price. Electricity is transmitted through power transmission and distribution lines. Equinor must secure access to a power system with sufficient capacity to transmit the electric power to the customers. Equinor may be unsuccessful in its efforts to secure transportation, transmission and markets for all its potential production.\n\nReputation . Equinor's reputation is an important asset. Erosion of the reputation could adversely affect Equinor's brand, social license to operate, and business opportunity set.\n\nSocietal and political expectations from our industry and business are high, especially in Norway with the Norwegian state as Equinor's majority owner. Safe and sustainable operations,\n\nethical business conduct and compliance with laws and regulations are prerequisites for access to natural resources, industrial value creation and contribution to society. Failure to deliver on societal and political expectations, or non-compliance with ethical standards, laws and regulations, HSE and security/cybersecurity incidents could impact our reputation. This could in turn have an adverse effect on Equinor's licence to operate, ability to secure new business opportunities, earnings and cash flow.\n\nNorwegian State's exercise of ownership. Failure to deliver on expectations from the Parliament and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries (MTIF), and failure to deliver on societal and political expectations in general could impact the manner which the Norwegian State exercises its ownership of the company.\n\nOn 1 July 2021 the responsibility to exercise the Norwegian State's ownership in Equinor was transferred from the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (MPE) to MTIF. The MTIF's exercise of ownership could also be subject to scrutiny by the Norwegian Parliament.\n\nIn February 2021, Equinor was invited to a parliamentary hearing in the standing committee for scrutiny and constitutional affairs on the Auditor-General's review of the follow-up by the MPE of the state's ownership in Equinor, with a specific focus on the company's international investments. Following the hearing, the standing committee in May 2021 endorsed the AuditorGeneral's review, including conclusions and recommendations. The recommendations expressed expectations with respect to the follow-up by the ministry on Equinor's financial reporting, and on risk, profitability and return in Equinor's international portfolio.  For additional information on the management of the Norwegian State's ownership interest in Equinor, see 3.4 Equal treatment of shareholders and transactions with close associates.\n\nWorkforce. Equinor may not be able to secure the right level of workforce competence and capacity.\n\nAs the energy industry is a long-term business, it needs to take a long-term perspective on workforce capacity and competence. The uncertainty of the future of the oil industry, in light of potential reduced oil and natural gas prices, climate policy changes, the climate debate affecting the perception of the industry, and increased competition for talent pose a risk to securing the right level of workforce competence and capacity through industry cycles.\n\nChanges to Equinor's corporate structure . The implementation of the new corporate structure in 2021 and its continued implementation may pose a risk for upholding safe and secure operations.\n\nThe changes to Equinor's corporate structure were decided and implemented to further strengthen Equinor's ability to deliver on our strategy of always safe, high value and low carbon. The ongoing implementation process of these changes may divert management and employee attention from tasks and responsibilities with a potential, negative impact on our ability to uphold safe and secure operations.",

        "page_content": "Insurance coverage. Equinor's insurance coverage may not provide adequate protection from losses.\n\nEquinor maintains insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to its properties, third-party liability, workers' compensation and employers' liability, general liability, sudden pollution, and other coverage. Equinor's insurance coverage includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery and is subject to caps, exclusions, and limitations. There is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect Equinor against liability from all potential consequences and damages. The fire at Hammerfest LNG in September 2020, leading to a financial loss for the group related to physical damage, postponement of production, and gas trading, illustrates that insurance may not completely protect the group from significant financial impact following an insurable loss.\n\nThe Equinor group also often retains parts of its insurable risks in a wholly owned captive insurance company, so insurance recovery outside of the Equinor group may sometimes be limited.\n\nUninsured losses could have a material adverse effect on Equinor's financial position.\n\n## Legal, regulatory and compliance risks International governmental and regulatory framework.\n\nEquinor's operations are subject to dynamic political and legal factors in the countries in which it operates.\n\nEquinor has oil and gas and renewable assets in several countries where the political and regulatory regime can change over time. Further, Equinor has activities in countries with emerging or transitioning economies that, in part or in whole, lack well-functioning and reliable legal systems, where the enforcement of contractual rights is uncertain or where the governmental and regulatory framework is subject to unexpected or rapid change. Equinor's oil and gas exploration and production activities in these countries are often undertaken together with national oil companies and are subject to a significant degree of state control. In recent years, governments and national oil companies in some regions have begun to exercise greater authority and to impose more stringent conditions on energy companies. Intervention by governments in such countries can take a wide variety of forms, including:\n\n- \u00b7 restrictions on exploration, production, imports and exports;\n- \u00b7 the awarding, denial or unavailability of exploration and production interests;\n- \u00b7 the imposition of specific seismic and/or drilling obligations;\n- \u00b7 price and exchange controls;\n- \u00b7 tax or royalty increases, imposition of new taxes or other governmental charges, such as the indemnification to the Rio de Janeiro State for non-compliance with minimum local requirements and the ICMS indirect tax in Rio de Janeiro State on crude oil extraction (see note 24 Other commitments and contingencies for further details), including retroactive claims;\n- \u00b7 nationalisation or expropriation of Equinor's assets;\n- \u00b7 unilateral cancellation or modification of Equinor's license, contractual rights or industry incentives;\n- \u00b7 the renegotiation of contracts;\n\n- \u00b7 payment delays and capital transfer restrictions, such as Nigerian regulations regarding eligible expatriation of funds and current Argentinian foreign exchange regulations; and\n- \u00b7 currency exchange restrictions or currency devaluation.\n\nThe likelihood of these occurrences and their overall effect on Equinor vary greatly from country to country and are hard to predict. If such risks materialize, they could cause Equinor to incur material costs, cause decrease in production, and potentially have a materially adverse effect on Equinor's operations or financial condition.\n\n## Policies and actions of the Norwegian State could affect\n\nEquinor's business. The Norwegian State governs the management of NCS hydrocarbon resources through legislation, such as the Norwegian Petroleum Act, tax law and safety and environmental laws and regulations. The Norwegian State awards licences for exploration, development projects, production, transportation, and applications for production rates for individual fields. The Petroleum Act provides that if important public interests are at stake, the Norwegian State may instruct operators on the NCS to reduce petroleum production .\n\nThe Norwegian State has a direct participation in petroleum activities through the State's direct financial interest (SDFI). In the production licenses in which the SDFI holds an interest, the Norwegian State has the power to direct petroleum licenses' actions in certain circumstances. See also section 2.9.\n\nIf the Norwegian State were to change laws, regulations, policies, or practices relating to energy or to the oil and gas industry (including in response to environmental, social or governance concerns), or take additional action under its activities on the NCS, Equinor's international and/or NCS exploration, development and production activities, and the results of its operations, could be affected.\n\n## Health, safety and environmental laws and regulations.\n\nCompliance with health, safety and environmental laws and regulations that apply to Equinor's activities and operations could materially increase Equinor's costs. The enactment of, or changes to, such laws and regulations could increase such costs or create compliance challenges.\n\nEquinor incurs, and expects to continue to incur, substantial capital, operating, maintenance and remediation costs relating to compliance with increasingly complex laws and regulations for the protection of the environment and human health and safety, as well as in response to concerns relating to climate change, including:\n\n- \u00b7 higher prices on greenhouse gas emissions;\n- \u00b7 costs of preventing, controlling, eliminating or reducing certain types of emissions to air and discharges to the sea;\n- \u00b7 remediation of environmental contamination and adverse impacts caused by Equinor's activities;\n- \u00b7 decommissioning obligations and related costs; and\n- \u00b7 compensation of costs related to persons and/or entities claiming damages as a result of Equinor's activities.\n\nIn particular, Equinor's activities are increasingly subject to statutory strict liability in respect of losses or damage suffered",

In the United States, Federal agencies have taken steps to rescind, delay, or revise regulations seen as overly burdensome to the upstream oil and gas sector, including methane emission controls. To the extent new or revised regulations impose additional compliance or data gathering requirements, Equinor could incur higher operating costs.\n\nCompliance with laws, regulations and obligations relating to climate change and other health, safety and environmental laws and regulations could result in substantial capital expenditure, reduced profitability as a result of changes in operating costs, and adverse effects on revenue generation and strategic growth opportunities. However, more stringent climate change regulations could also represent business opportunities for Equinor. For more information about climate change related to legal and regulatory risks, see the risks described under the heading 'Climate change and transition to a lower carbon economy' in 'Risks related to our business, strategy and operations' in this section.\n\n## Supervision, regulatory reviews and financial reporting.\n\nEquinor conducts business in many countries and its products are marketed and traded worldwide. Equinor is exposed to risk of supervision, review and sanctions for violations of laws and regulations at the supranational, national and local level. These include, among others, laws and regulations relating to financial reporting, taxation, bribery and corruption, securities and commodities trading, fraud, competition and antitrust, safety and the environment, labour and employment practices and data privacy rules.\n\nViolations of applicable laws and regulations may lead to legal liability, substantial fines, claims for damages, criminal sanctions and other sanctions for noncompliance.\n\nEquinor is subject to supervision by the Norwegian Petroleum Supervisor (PSA), which supervises all aspects of Equinor's operations, from exploration drilling through development and operation, to cessation and removal. Its regulatory authority covers the whole NCS including offshore-wind as well as petroleum-related plants on land in Norway. As its business grows internationally, Equinor may become subject to supervision or be required to report to other regulators, and such supervision could result in audit reports, orders and investigations.\n\nEquinor is listed on both the Oslo B\u00f8rs and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and is a reporting company under the rules and regulations of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). Equinor is required to comply with the continuing obligations of these regulatory authorities, and violation of these obligations may result in legal liability, the imposition of fines and other sanctions.\n\nEquinor is also subject to financial review from financial supervisory authorities such as the Norwegian Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) and the SEC. Reviews performed by\n\nthese authorities could result in changes to previously published financial statements and future accounting practices. In addition, failure of external reporting to report data accurately and in compliance with applicable standards could result in regulatory action, legal liability and damage to Equinor's reputation. Also, any identification of a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting could cause investors to lose confidence in reported financial information and potentially impact the share price.\n\nAnti-corruption, anti-bribery laws and Equinor's Code of Conduct and the Human Rights policy. Non-compliance with anti-bribery, anti-corruption and other applicable laws or failure to meet Equinor's ethical requirements, including the Human Rights policy, has the potential to expose Equinor to legal liability, lead to a loss of business, loss of investor confidence, damage our reputation and our social license to operate, as well as erode shareholder value. It could also lead to an adverse effect on the human rights of various rightholders.\n\nEquinor is a global company with a presence and/or suppliers and other business partners in many parts of the world including where corruption and bribery represents a high risk and where the human rights situation is challenging. Such risks often exist in combination with weak legal institutions and lack of transparency. Governments routinely play a significant role in the energy sector, through ownership of resources, participation, licensing, and local content which leads to a high level of interaction with public officials. Equinor is subject to anticorruption and bribery laws in multiple jurisdictions, including the Norwegian Penal code, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act. A violation of such applicable anticorruption or bribery laws could expose Equinor to investigations from multiple authorities and may lead to criminal and/or civil liability with substantial fines. Incidents of noncompliance with applicable anti-corruption and bribery laws and regulations and the Equinor Code of Conduct could be damaging to Equinor's reputation, competitive position, and shareholder value. Similarly, failure to uphold our Human Rights policy may damage our reputation and social license to operate. Similarly, failure to identify or address potential adverse human rights impacts in line with our Human Rights policy, e.g., in parts of our supply chains, could damage our reputation, and weaken our social license to operate.\n\nThroughout 2021, the organization monitored potential increased risks or changed risk picture with respect to Equinor's ethics and compliance standards due to the Covid-19 situation. Continuation or a resurgence of the pandemic could continue to impact and/or potentially increase our ethics and compliance risks in ways not currently known or considered by us.\n\nInternational sanctions and trade restrictions. Equinor's activities may be affected by international sanctions and trade restrictions.\n\nIn 2021, as in previous years, there were several changes to sanctions and international trade restrictions. Equinor seeks to comply with these where they are applicable. Equinor's diverse portfolio of projects worldwide could expose its business and financial affairs to political and economic risks, including",

        "page_content": "operations in markets or sectors targeted by sanctions and international trade restrictions.\n\nSanctions and trade restrictions are complex, unpredictable and are often implemented on short notice. Equinor's business portfolio is evolving and will constantly be subject to review. Given the use of trade restrictions by, amongst others, the US, UK and EU, it is possible that Equinor will decide to take part in new business activity in markets or sectors where sanctions and trade restrictions are particularly relevant.\n\nWhile Equinor remains committed to do business in compliance with sanctions and trade restrictions and takes steps to ensure, to the extent possible, compliance therewith, there can be no assurance that no Equinor entity, officer, director, employee or agent is not in violation of such sanctions and trade restrictions. Any such violation, even if minor in monetary terms, could result in substantial civil and/or criminal penalties and could materially adversely affect Equinor's business and results of operations or financial condition.\n\nThe following discusses Equinor's interests in certain jurisdictions:\n\nFor a discussion of Equinor's intent to exit its business activities in Russia, see 'International, political, social and economic factors' above.  In addition, Equinor is monitoring and remains committed to comply with Norwegian, EU, UK, US and any other applicable trade restrictions and sanctions targeting Russian sectors, entities and persons, including Rosneft.\n\nEquinor holds a 51% interest in a gas license offshore Venezuela. Since 2017, various international sanctions and trade controls have targeted certain Venezuelan individuals as well as the Government of Venezuela. The international sanctions and trade controls in place restrict to a large extent the way Equinor can conduct its business in Venezuela, and could, alone or in combination with other factors, further negatively impact Equinor's position and ability to continue its business in Venezuela.\n\nDisclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act\n\nEquinor is providing the following disclosure pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act. Equinor is a party to agreements with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), namely, a Development Service Contract for South Pars Gas Phases 6, 7 & 8 (offshore part), an Exploration Service Contract for the Anaran Block and an Exploration Service Contract for the Khorramabad Block, which are located in Iran. Equinor's operational obligations under these agreements have terminated and the licences have been abandoned. The cost recovery programme for these contracts was completed in 2012, except for the recovery of tax and obligations to the Social Security Organization (SSO).\n\nFrom 2013 to November 2018, after closing Equinor's office in Iran, Equinor's activity was focused on a final settlement with the Iranian tax and SSO authorities relating to the above-mentioned agreements.\n\nIn a letter from the US State Department of 1 November 2010, Equinor was informed that it was not considered to be a company of concern based on its previous Iran-related activities.\n\nEquinor has an intention to settle historic obligations in Iran while remaining compliant with applicable sanctions and trade restrictions against Iran. Since November 2018 Equinor has not conducted any activity in Iran, nor has it been able to resolve tax claims from the Iranian authorities. No payments were made to Iranian authorities during 2021.\n\nJoint arrangements and contractors. Many of Equinor's activities are conducted through joint arrangements and with contractors and sub-contractors which may limit Equinor's influence and control over the performance of such operations. This exposes Equinor to financial, operational, safety, security, and compliance risks as well as reputational risks and risks related to ethics, integrity, and sustainability, if the operators,\n\npartners or contractors fail to fulfil their responsibilities.\n\nOperators, partners, and contractors may be unable or unwilling to compensate Equinor against costs incurred on their behalf or on behalf of the arrangement. Equinor is also exposed to enforcement actions by regulators or claimants in the event of an incident in an operation where it does not exercise operational control.\n\nInternational tax law. Equinor is exposed to potentially adverse changes in the tax regimes of each jurisdiction in which Equinor operates.\n\nChanges in the tax laws of the countries in which Equinor operates could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and results of operations.\n\n## Market, financial and liquidity risks\n\nForeign exchange. Equinor's business is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely affect the results of Equinor's operations.\n\nA large percentage of Equinor's revenues and cash receipts are denominated in USD, and sales of gas and refined products are mainly denominated in EUR and GBP. Further, Equinor pays a large portion of its income taxes, operating expenses, capital expenditures and dividends in NOK. The majority of Equinor's long-term debt has USD exposure. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates between USD, EUR, GBP and NOK may significantly influence Equinor's financial results. See also 'Financial risk' .\n\nLiquidity and interest rate. Equinor is exposed to liquidity and interest rate risks.\n\nEquinor is exposed to liquidity risk, which is the risk that Equinor will not be able to meet obligations of financial liabilities when they become due. Equinor's main cash outflows include the quarterly dividend payments and Norwegian petroleum tax payments which are paid six times per year. Liquidity risk sources include but are not limited to business interruptions and commodity and financial markets price movements.\n\nEquinor is exposed to interest rate risk, which is the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments, principally long-term debt and associated derivatives. Equinor's bonds are normally issued at fixed rates in a variety of local currencies (USD, EUR and GBP",

Most bonds are kept as or converted to fixed rate USD while some are converted to floating rate USD by using interest rate and/or currency swaps.\n\nEquinor has started the transition from London Inter-bank Offered Rates (LIBOR) to alternative reference rates and expects to complete this process within 2023.\n\nFor interest rate derivatives contracts, Equinor expects to follow the ISDA Fallback Protocol outlining the process for conversion of LIBOR to the Official ISDA Fallback Rates for derivatives, or other official adjusted reference rates (such as SONIA or SOFR). The expectation is that the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates for floating rate bonds will follow the principles outlined by ICMA (International Capital Markets Association) and that loan agreements and facilities in general will follow the LMA (Loan Market Association). Equinor believes that the financial risks for Equinor related to the transition are small.\n\nTrading and supply activities. Equinor is exposed to risks relating to trading and supply activities.\n\nEquinor is engaged in trading and commercial activities in the physical markets. Equinor uses financial instruments such as futures, options, over-the-counter (OTC) forward contracts, market swaps and contracts for differences related to crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas and electricity to manage price differences and volatility. Trading activities involve elements of forecasting, and Equinor bears the risk of market movements, the risk of losses if prices develop contrary to expectations, and the risk of default by counterparties.\n\nFinancial risk. Equinor is exposed to financial risk.\n\nThe main factors influencing Equinor's operational and financial results include oil/condensate and natural gas prices and trends in the exchange rates between mainly the USD, EUR, GBP and NOK; Equinor's oil and natural gas entitlement production volumes (which in turn depend on entitlement volumes under PSAs where applicable) and available petroleum reserves, and Equinor's own, as well as its partners', expertise and cooperation in recovering oil and natural gas from those reserves; and changes in Equinor's portfolio of assets due to acquisitions and disposals.\n\nEquinor's operational and financial results also are affected by trends in the international oil industry, including possible actions by governments and other regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which Equinor operates, possible or continued actions by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and/or other producing nations that affect price levels and volumes, refining margins, the cost of oilfield services, supplies and equipment, competition for exploration opportunities and operatorships and deregulation of the natural gas markets, all of which may cause substantial changes to existing market structures and to the overall level and volatility of prices and price differentials.\n\nThe following table shows the yearly averages for quoted Brent Blend crude oil prices, natural gas average sales prices, refining reference margins and the USD/NOK exchange rates for 2021 and 2020.\n\n| Yearly averages                                  |   2021 |   2020 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Average Brent oil price (USD/bbl)                |   70.7 |   41.7 |\n| Average invoiced gas prices - Europe (USD/mmBtu) |   14.6 |    3.6 |\n| Refining reference margin (USD/bbl)              |    4   |    1.5 |\n| USD/NOK average daily exchange rate              |    8.6 |    8.8 |",

The estimated price sensitivity of Equinor's financial results to each of the factors has been estimated based on the assumption that all other factors remain unchanged. The estimated indicative effects of the negative changes in these factors are not expected to be materially asymmetric to the effects shown in the illustration.\n\nSignificant downward adjustments of Equinor's commodity price assumptions could result in impairments on certain producing and development assets in the portfolio. See note 11 Property, plant and equipment to the Consolidated financial statements for sensitivity analysis related to impairments.\n\nFluctuating foreign exchange rates can also have a significant impact on the operating results. Equinor's revenues and cash flows are mainly denominated in or driven by USD, while a large portion of the operating expenses, capital expenditures and income taxes payable accrue in NOK. In general, an increase in the value of USD in relation to NOK can be expected to increase Equinor's reported net operating income.\n\nHistorically, Equinor's revenues have largely been generated by the production of oil and natural gas on the NCS. Norway imposes a 78% marginal tax rate on income from offshore oil and natural gas activities (a symmetrical tax system). Equinor's earnings volatility is moderated as a result of its significant proportion of Norwegian offshore income that is subject to the 78% tax rate in profitable periods and the significant tax assets generated by its Norwegian offshore operations in any lossmaking periods. For further information, see section 2.9 Corporate Taxation of Equinor.\n\nCurrently, the majority of dividends received by Equinor ASA are from Norwegian companies. Dividends received from Norwegian companies and from similar companies' resident in the EEA for\n\ntax purposes, in which the recipient holds more than 90 % of the shares and votes, are fully exempt from tax. For other dividends, 3% of the dividends received are subject to the standard income tax rate of 22%, giving an effective tax rate of 0.66%. Dividends from companies resident in low-tax jurisdictions in the EEA that are not able to demonstrate that they are genuinely established and carry on genuine economic business activity within the EEA and dividends from companies in low-tax jurisdictions and portfolio investments below 10% outside the EEA will be subject to the standard income tax rate of 22% based on the full amounts received.\n\nSee also note 6 Financial risk management to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Disclosures about market risk\n\nEquinor uses financial instruments to manage commodity price risks, interest rate risks and currency risks. Significant amounts of assets and liabilities are accounted for as financial instruments.\n\nSee note 26 Financial instruments: fair value measurement and sensitivity analysis of market risk in the Consolidated financial statements for details of the nature and extent of such positions and for qualitative and quantitative disclosures of the risks associated with these instruments.\n\n## Risks related to state ownership\n\nThis section discusses some of the potential risks relating to Equinor's business that could derive from the Norwegian State's majority ownership and from Equinor's involvement in the SDFI.\n\nControl by the Norwegian State. The interests of Equinor's majority shareholder, the Norwegian State, may not always be aligned with the interests of Equinor's other shareholders, and this may affect Equinor's activities, including its decisions relating to the NCS.\n\nThe Norwegian State has resolved that its shares in Equinor and the SDFI's interest in NCS licences must be managed in accordance with a coordinated ownership strategy for the Norwegian State's oil and gas interests. Under this strategy, the Norwegian State has required Equinor to market the Norwegian State's oil and gas together with Equinor's own oil and gas as a single economic unit. Pursuant to this coordinated ownership strategy, the Norwegian State requires Equinor, in its activities on the NCS, to take account of the Norwegian State's interests in all decisions that may affect the marketing of Equinor's own and the Norwegian State's oil and gas.\n\nThe Norwegian State directly held 67% of Equinor's ordinary shares as of 31 December 2021 and has effectively the power to influence the outcome of any vote of shareholders, including amending its articles of association and electing all nonemployee members of the corporate assembly. The interests of the Norwegian State in deciding these and other matters and the factors it considers when casting its votes, especially the coordinated ownership strategy for the SDFI and Equinor's shares held by the Norwegian State, could be different from the interests of Equinor's other shareholders.\n\nIf the Norwegian State's coordinated ownership strategy is not implemented and pursued in the future, then Equinor's mandate to continue to sell the Norwegian State's oil and gas together",

Loss of the mandate to sell the SDFI's oil and gas could have an adverse effect on Equinor's position in the markets in which it operates. See also section 3.4 under the Governance chapter for further details on State ownership.\n\n## Risk management\n\nEquinor's risk management practice is based on an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework where risk management is an integrated part of Equinor's business operations. This includes managing risk in relation to all of Equinor's activities to create value and avoid incidents, always with Equinor's best interest in mind.\n\nTo achieve optimal solutions, and to provide for risk informed decision basis, the focus of the ERM approach is on:\n\n- \u00b7 the value impact for Equinor, including upside and downside risk; and\n- \u00b7 managing of risk in compliance with Equinor's requirements with a strong focus on avoiding HSE, human rights and business integrity incidents (such as accidents, fraud and corruption).\n\nManaging risk is an integral part of any manager's responsibility. In general, risk is managed in the business line, but some risks are managed at the corporate level to provide optimal solutions. Risks managed at the corporate level include the top enterprise risks in addition to oil and natural gas price risks,\n\ninterest and currency risks, risk dimension in the strategy work, prioritisation processes and capital structure discussions.\n\nERM involves using a holistic approach where correlations between risks and the natural hedges inherent in Equinor's portfolio are considered. This approach allows Equinor to reduce the number of risk management transactions and avoid sub-optimisation. Some risks related to operational activities are partly insurable and insured via Equinor's captive insurance company operating in the Norwegian and international insurance markets. Equinor also assesses oil and gas price hedging opportunities on a regular basis as a tool to increase financial robustness and strengthen flexibility.\n\nEquinor's risk management process is based on ISO 31000 Risk management. A standardised process across Equinor allows for comparing risk on a like-for-like basis and supports efficiency in decisions. The process seeks to ensure that risks are identified, analysed, evaluated, and managed. Risk is integrated into the company's Management Information System (IT tool) where Equinor's purpose, vision and strategy are translated into strategic objectives, risks, actions and KPIs. The tool is used to capture all risks and follow up risk-adjusting actions and related assurance activities. In general, risk adjusting actions are subject to a cost-benefit evaluation (except certain safety related risks which could be subject to specific regulations), and the approach to assurance is risk-based in the context of a threelines-of-control model.\n\nThe upgraded Njord Bravo under tow from Haugesund to Kristiansund, 5 December 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Climate change and energy transition\n\nClimate change and reaching the goals of the Paris Agreement represent fundamental challenges to society. As outlined in the COP26 Glasgow Climate Pact, achieving the most ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement now requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions. This includes reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 45% by 2030 relative to 2010 levels, and to net zero around midcentury. The average increase in global temperatures has already reached 1.1 o C above pre-industrial levels, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nClimate change is a collective challenge, and Equinor will contribute by accelerating its response to the energy transition in partnership with governments, investors, customers and society at large. Our industry will play an important role. While individual company-level decarbonisation ambitions are important, the journey towards net zero can only be met through an 'unprecedented transformation of how energy is produced, transported and used globally', according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nEquinor's ambition is to be a leading company in the energy transition and to become a net-zero company by 2050, including emissions from production through to final energy consumption. During the last year we have raised our short- and medium-term ambitions. These demonstrate our commitment to produce energy with decreasing emissions over time. While delivering long-term shareholder value and competitiveness, we will reduce emissions from our oil and gas operations, scale up investments in renewable energy and aim to take a leading role in building out new low carbon value chains. We will work with our suppliers and customers, governments and civil society to develop the technologies, business models, policies and frameworks to contribute to an energy transition supporting the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nAmong the new or strengthened short- and medium-term ambitions announced in 2021/22 are:\n\n- \u00b7 Reducing our net operated greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 with 50% compared to 2015, aiming for 90% absolute reductions\n- \u00b7 Increasing annual gross capex 18 allocation to renewables and low carbon solutions to above 30% by 2025 and to more than 50% by 2030\n- \u00b7 Accelerating the renewable energy installed capacity ambition of 12-16 GW from 2035 to 2030\n- \u00b7 Reducing upstream CO2 intensity from our own operations to ~6 kg CO2 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) by 2030\n- \u00b7 Developing the capacity to store 5-10 million tonnes CO2 per year on an equity basis by 2030 and 15-30 million tonnes CO2 per year in 2035\n\n- \u00b7 Establishing a 10% market share of hydrogen in Europe in 2035\n- \u00b7 Allocating 40% of research and development (R&D) capital annually towards renewables and low carbon by 2025\n- \u00b7 Reducing net carbon intensity by 20% by 2030 and by 40% by 2035\n\nIn our Energy Transition Plan we describe our role in the energy transition. The plan is expected to be launched in March 2022 and will be submitted for an advisory vote to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in 2022. We will update the plan every three years for an advisory AGM vote and report on progress annually.\n\n## Industry leading carbon efficiency\n\nWe aim to remain an industry leader in carbon efficiency by working towards emitting as little CO/uni2082 as possible from each barrel of oil equivalent produced. Our ambition is to reduce the upstream CO2 intensity of our globally operated oil and gas production to below 8 kg CO2/barrel of oil equivalent (boe) by 2025 and to ~6 kg CO2/boe by 2030.\n\nOur upstream CO2 intensity improved from 8.0 to 7.0 kg CO2/boe. Divestment from the Bakken assets in the United States, temporary shut-down of the Peregrino field in Brazil and increased production from the Johan Sverdrup, Troll and Oseberg fields in Norway were the key drivers for this reduced upstream CO2 intensity in 2021. Our total scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions for 2021 were 12.1 million tonnes - a decrease of 1.4 million tonnes from the previous year. The reduction can be attributed to the divestment of the Bakken assets as well as the temporary shutdown of the Hammerfest LNG plant in Norway and the Peregrino field in Brazil.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe assess carbon intensity when we shape our portfolio and implement emission reduction measures. Electrification is a key component to reach our emissions reduction ambitions and involves replacing fossil fuel-based power supply with Norwegian grid mix, or power from floating wind turbines. In 2021, we advanced several electrification initiatives:\n\n- \u00b7 The revised plan for partial electrification of the Sleipner Field Centre was approved by the authorities. Emission cuts",

The project entails partial electrification of Troll B and full electrification of Troll C. After its planned completion in 2026, it will cut CO2 emissions by almost 500,000 tonnes per year, i.e. the equivalent of more than 3% of total emissions from oil and gas production in Norway. NOx emissions will be reduced by some 1,700 tonnes per year.\n- \u00b7 A plan for investing further in Oseberg to increase gas production and reduce emissions was submitted to the authorities in 2021. The planned total emission reduction at Oseberg field centre and Oseberg South is more than 300,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.\n\n## Flaring\n\nFor all Equinor operated oil and gas assets, we work to systematically reduce all flaring and to eliminate routine flaring, in line with the 'World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030' initiative. We do not have routine flaring in our own operations in Norway, Brazil or offshore US, and final investment decisions of all new oil fields we operate include a solution for the field's associated gas without routine flaring. We work actively in our partner-operated assets to help reduce flaring. We currently flare associated gas in the Mariner field in the UK on an intermittent basis when the early production phase associated gas volumes exceed the demand for fuel gas for power generation.\n\nOur 2021 flaring intensity was 0.09% of hydrocarbon produced, which is significantly lower than the industry average of 0.8%.\n\n## Methane\n\nCurbing methane emissions is a key priority for Equinor and the oil and gas industry. We continue to develop and implement technologies and procedures to identify, quantify, avoid and minimise methane emissions. We do this to support industry efforts to reduce methane emissions across the oil and gas value chain, increase the quality and transparency of reported data, and to support the development of sound methane policies and regulations. An independent study published in 2021 confirmed that methane emissions from Equinor operated fields on the Norwegian Continental Shelf are at similar or lower levels than those reported by Equinor.\n\nEquinor's 2021 methane intensity for our upstream and midstream business was reduced to approximately 0.02%, which is down from 0.03% in previous years and around one tenth of the industry average. Equinor continues to pursue a methane intensity target of near zero by 2030.\n\n## Investing in renewables and low carbon solutions\n\nWe are developing as a global offshore wind major with renewable power production from offshore wind farms in the UK and Germany and building material clusters in the North Sea, the US East coast and in the Baltic Sea. In parallel, we are actively positioning ourselves to access emerging markets globally. Equinor is gradually growing its presence in onshore renewables in selected power markets with increasing demand for solar, wind and storage solutions as integrated parts of the energy system. Our equity-based renewables energy production was 1.6 TWh in 2021, down from 1.7 TWh in 2020. Considering our renewables and low carbon solutions project\n\nportfolio, we evaluate our capex ambition, installed renewable capacity and ambition for CO2 storage as being on track to reach our ambitions for this decade. See section 2.7 Renewables for more details.\n\nCarbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and hydrogen are important enablers to deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement. These technologies can remove CO/uni2082 from sectors that cannot be easily decarbonised such as heavy industry, maritime transport, heating and flexible power generation. Based on experience from oil and gas value chains, Equinor is well positioned to provide low-carbon solutions and establish net zero-emission value chains.\n\nThe Northern Lights project, representing the start of commercial CCS in Europe, is on track to demonstrate that CCS is a valid decarbonisation solution for important industry sectors. An important development in 2021 was that four of our potential customers were granted financing from EU's innovation fund. This represents a major step forward, as the combined storage requirement for these four customers is over 3 million tonnes CO2 per year.\n\nEquinor is exploring CCS opportunities in the UK together with five other energy companies through the Northern Endurance Partnership. Together with bp we are developing the Net Zero Teesside project, a CO2 offshore transport and storage infrastructure, and we are leading the Zero Carbon Humber project which aims to decarbonise local industrial clusters.\n\nAs part of this, Equinor and SSE Thermal are collaborating on plans to develop first-of-a-kind hydrogen and CCS projects in the Humber region in the UK. Together with ENGIE we announced the H2BE project which aims to develop production of low-carbon hydrogen from natural gas in Belgium. See section 2.6 Marketing, Midstream and Processing for more details.\n\n## Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions\n\nAs an energy company, our scope 3 emissions are primarily related to our customers' use of energy products. To help reduce these emissions, we are working with developing low carbon solutions such as CCS and hydrogen at scale. Over time, this will help decarbonise the use of our energy products. This, combined with portfolio diversification is our most important strategic lever to address scope 3 emissions and the carbon intensity of energy we produce.\n\nEquinor's scope 3 emissions in 2021 were 249 million tonnes CO2e compared to 250 million tonnes CO2e in 2020. Our net carbon intensity in 2021 was 67 g CO2e/MJ energy produced, down from 68 g CO2e/MJ in 2020. The net carbon intensity includes scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operated assets on a 100% basis and scope 3 emissions from our equity production. As we are cutting own emissions and adding capacity in renewables and low carbon solutions, we expect our net carbon intensity to reduce more quickly later in this decade.\n\nProcurement of products and services represent another source of scope 3 emissions for Equinor. While the indirect emissions from our supply chain are significantly lower than the emissions from the use of our oil and gas products, they are still important and represent an opportunity for GHG reduction.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic report\n\nSupply chain emissions are the largest contributing factor to the total life cycle emissions for our renewable operations. Maritime operations, heavy duty transport and the production of steel and cement are considered the most material sources of scope 3 emissions in our supply chain. With greater understanding and assurance on our scope 1 and 2 emissions, we plan to apply this knowledge and experience to assess our supply chain emissions and follow up on the most material areas.\n\nEquinor has an ambition of halving our maritime emissions in Norway by 2030 and halving our global maritime emissions by 2050. We are working to reduce our own consumption of fossilbased maritime fuels and to stimulate systemic change through development of low-emission maritime solutions. Equinor has extensive maritime activity around the world, including around 175 vessels on contract with the company at any time. As a supplier of fuel to the maritime sector, Equinor's ambition is to increase our production and use of low-carbon, and zeroemission fuels. Equinor has been a pioneer in using liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a fuel and in 2021 we introduced largescale use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as a fuel. A new hybrid battery system has been introduced for 19 supply vessels on contract with Equinor on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and the next generation of dual-fuel vessels is being introduced to the fleet. In collaboration with the maritime industry, we have also started developing the world's first supply vessel to run on zero-emission ammonia.\n\n## Carbon offsets and nature-based solutions\n\nIn the longer term, we see negative emissions solutions as making an important contribution to the climate challenge. Offsets and removals will however play a minimal role in achieving our operated emissions reductions. We have so far only purchased offsets related to our business travel. We plan to use only credits verified according to high standards and to disclose information about the type of offsets employed. To ensure quality in the credits we will use, we have established a set of corporate criteria and principles based on the Oxford Principles for Net Zero Aligned Carbon Offsetting\n\n## Stress-testing our management approach to climate risk\n\nEquinor's business needs to be resilient in a world of significant uncertainty and disruption, where climate related risks are integral to prudent risk management. We responsively work to navigate these risks so that we have the financial robustness to reach our ambitions. Our company strategy is developed to address the challenges, opportunities and urgency associated with the energy transition, whilst recognising the many risk factors outside our control.\n\nClimate-related risks to Equinor include market effects from changing demand for oil, gas and renewable energy, potential stricter climate policies, laws and regulations, technology changes supporting the further development and use of renewable energy and low-carbon technologies, as well as physical effects of climate change and reputational effects. A summary of our climate-related risk factors is provided in section 2.13 Risk review. We continue to report on climaterelated upside and downside risks in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nFor portfolio and decision analysis, our base assumptions include a carbon cost for all assets and projects. In countries where no such cost exists, we use a generic cost which has been substantially increased in 2021. We use a default minimum at 58 USD per tonne (real 2021), that increases to 100 USD per tonne by 2030 and stays flat thereafter. In countries with higher carbon costs, we use the country specific cost expectations. This carbon cost is included in investment decisions and is part of break-even calculations when testing for profitability robustness.\n\nSince 2016 we have been testing the resilience of our portfolio against the scenarios from the IEAs World Energy Outlook (WEO) report. WEO scenarios change from year to year and in the 2021 WEO report they were: Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE), Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), and the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS). We test our portfolio by applying the price assumptions in each of these scenarios and compare the impact on NPV using our internal planning assumptions. Exploration activities are not included due to the uncertainties related to potential discoveries and development solutions. The net present value effects are varying from -9% in SDS, to -30% and -34% for STEPS and NZE, respectively. Further details about the portfolio sensitivity test are available in our 2021 Sustainability Report, which also includes a reference index to the TCFD framework.\n\nAs noted in section 2.13 Risk Review under Risk Factors-Risks related to our business, strategy and operations-Oil and natural gas price, a significant or prolonged period of low oil and natural gas prices or other indicators will lead to impairment assessments of the group's oil and natural gas assets. See also note 3 Consequences of initiatives to limit climate change to the Consolidated financial statements for a discussion of key sources of uncertainty with respect to management's estimates and assumptions that affect Equinor's reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses and note 11 Property, plants and equipment to the Consolidated financial statements for a discussion of price assumptions and sensitivities affecting the impairment analysis.\n\n## Environment\n\nGlobally, there is an increasing expectation for urgent actions to address the twin threats of climate change and nature loss. Equinor is a large operator of offshore oil and gas facilities and increasingly offshore wind power provider. Management of our activities and potential impacts on the marine environment is very important. Our potential material impacts are related to discharges and accidental spills to sea, emissions to air, and use of areas.\n\nWe aim to systematically manage environmental aspects as an integrated part of our governance, risk and performance framework. The precautionary approach and mitigation hierarchy are central to implementing measures to avoid, reduce or mitigate adverse direct impacts and to enhance positive outcomes. We seek to continuously improve our environmental management system and performance. Our management approach includes environmental risk and impact assessments, as well as stakeholder engagement in planning",

It also includes environmental baseline studies, surveys, monitoring programmes, and collaborative research projects to build knowledge and develop tools.\n\nEquinor supports the global ambition of reversing nature loss by 2030 and is ready to play its part. In 2021 we announced our biodiversity position, identifying five areas to focus our actions on. These include establishing voluntary exclusion zones, developing a net-positive approach, increasing knowledge and access to biodiversity data, investing in nature-based solutions, and advocating for ambitious biodiversity policy.\n\nDuring 2021, we did not operate in UNESCO World Heritage sites or within sites in the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN) category 1a ('Strict nature reserve') or category 1b ('Wilderness area'). There were 19 cases where we had operations inside or adjacent to (< 1km) protected areas within any IUCN category.\n\nThe number of accidental spills of oil and other liquids was reduced by 14% from 2020 to 2021 to 218 incidents. None of these was a serious accidental spill. Our freshwater withdrawal remained at 8 million m 3 .\n\nSOx emissions in 2021 ended at 0.9 thousand tonnes, down from 1.3 thousand tonnes in 2020. This reduction is largely due to the temporary shut-down of the Peregrino field throughout 2021. SOx emissions were also reduced due to improved process regularity at the Mongstad and Kalundborg refineries, and reduced usage of diesel due to no drilling and fracking activity in our US onshore assets. NOx emissions were reduced to 34 thousand tonnes in 2021 from 36 thousand tonnes in 2020, mainly due to less drilling and well activities in 2021 and the divestment from the Bakken asset. The volume of oil discharged with water to sea was reduced to 1.1 thousand tonnes in 2021 compared to 1.3 thousand tonnes in 2020. The main driver for this change was the substitution of corrosion inhibitors at our Statfjord platforms leading to better conditions for process water cleaning.\n\nFor most waste categories, we have seen a significant drop in 2021 compared to 2020. This is mainly due to changes in activity level and types, especially lower drilling and well activities and decreased volumes of process water transported from Troll to Mongstad. An increase of 14% in the non-hazardous waste quantity to 33 thousand tonnes in 2021 is mainly due to large quantities of sand blasting waste from tank maintenance at Mongstad, waste from the fire training field at Kollsnes and waste related to the activities following the fire at the Hammerfest LNG plant in 2020.\n\n## Health, safety and security\n\n## Safety\n\nIn a world fighting a pandemic, the running of safe operations and provision of energy, with as low major accident risk as possible, has remained Equinor's priority. Our vision is zero harm, which is supported by one of our three strategic pillars, 'Always Safe'. The safety and security of our people, and integrity of our operations, is our top priority. We believe that all accidents related to people, environment and assets can be prevented.\n\nAs a response to two serious process incidents at our onshore plants last year, we have developed a new framework for major accident prevention. This is built on three pillars: 'Leadership culture and organisational frame conditions', 'Safe practices and design' and 'Safety barriers'. The global implementation of this framework remains a priority for 2021 and beyond.\n\nOur 'I am safety roadmap 2025' sets our ambition for safety performance. It outlines prioritised activities within four categories across the company: safety visibility, leadership and behaviour; learning and follow up, and safety indicators. We are stepping up the work to consistently improve our safety performance and work continuously to develop a proactive safety culture, where safe and secure operations are incorporated into everything we do. Two important initiatives to achieve this were implemented in 2021. These include the strengthening of 'human and organisational performance (HOP)' and the implementation of digital 'observation cards' to facilitate more engagement and improved safety behaviour across the workforce. HOP is now implemented in leadership training to provide a better understanding of how people, technology, organisations and processes interact as a system, and how these conditions can influence human errors.\n\nIn 2021 we experienced no major accidents although one incident with major accident potential was recorded when H2S and LPG (Liquified Petroleum Gas) leaked at the Mongstad refinery in Norway. Equinor experienced a tragic fatality at one of our chartered tankers when a cadet was found dead in the harbour basin after the ship had left the port near Houston. The US Coast Guard, local police and independent investigators carried out an investigation that concluded that the person had inadvertently fallen overboard. The investigation found no evidence of any criminal action.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur total Serious Incident Frequency (SIF), which includes near misses, ended at 0.4 incidents per million work hours in 2021. This is at our target and an improvement compared to last year. After closure of investigations, we adjusted our number of incidents with major accident potential in 2020 from 0 to 2.",

        "page_content": "## Health and working environment\n\nEquinor's efforts related to health and working environment during 2021 have been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic in several areas. The medical risk of infection resulted in a focus on measures including hygiene and social distancing. We worked proactively to address the mental health impact of working from home. Where we were permitted to do so, offices were reopened with safety measures in place so that those who needed or wanted to return, could do so safely. Medical resources with competence on ergonomics and psychosocial risk have been allocated to support leaders and teams managing risks related to working from home. The total sick leave increased from 4.2% in 2020 to 4.6% in 2021.\n\nPersonal injuries measured by total recordable injury frequency per million hours worked (TRIF) has developed negatively from 2.3 in in 2020 to 2.4 in 2021. This is higher than for our peers and industry benchmarking.\n\n## Security\n\nOver the course of 2021, the security threat picture has also evolved, as have the security risks. Threat actors have tried to exploit the practice of working from home and cyber-crime has increased. Through holistic security risk management, which includes physical, cyber and personnel security, we seek to secure continuous safeguarding of Equinor's people, assets, and operations.  For more information about security risks, see section 2.13 Risk review.\n\n## Emergency preparedness and response, and business continuity\n\nTo ensure that we are prepared, we work to have appropriate emergency response capabilities in place to limit the consequences of incidents, should they occur. Our oil spill response capabilities are in line with best international practice and leverage expertise and resources made available through our membership of local and international oil spill response organisations.\n\n## Human rights\n\nUnderstanding and managing our risks of adverse human rights impacts related to our activities remains at the core of our human rights commitment. This is consistent with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), the ten principles of the Global Compact and the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights. We recognise that our activities can cause, contribute, or be linked to negative human rights and other social impacts especially in jurisdictions with weak regulatory frameworks. Thus, we aim to promote good practice and share learnings with partners. In 2021, the Covid-19 pandemic continued to exacerbate risks in some areas of our operations. In parallel, governments and society are sharpening their focus towards human rights performance.\n\nEquinor's human rights policy applies to all our activities. When we identify human rights risks and adverse impacts, Equinor works to prevent, mitigate or remediate as relevant to each situation. We make efforts to build and use leverage towards our suppliers or partners including through senior level engagement, capacity building opportunities and access to third party expertise.\n\nAs part of environmental and social impact assessments for new operated assets, potential human rights risks and impacts are identified. In addition, we undertake human rights assessments and due diligence for certain assets on a risk basis. We set requirements for all suppliers regarding general human rights expectations. We also include human rights clauses in significant agreements and contracts and follow up selected suppliers on their performance through verifications and follow-up findings.\n\nWe have developed a performance framework built around four pillars: leadership and governance, risk management, partner and supplier maturity, and management of salient issues. A set of internal monitoring indicators will be implemented as a first step under this framework.\n\nFollowing the adoption of our supply chain due diligence priorities, we saw an increase in engagement with prioritised first-tier suppliers. Through risk mapping and assessment of red flags within value and supply chains of seven suppliers, risks and impacts are being addressed jointly.\n\nIn 2021, we have assessed conditions for workers involved in specific construction projects in Malaysia, China and Singapore. Moreover, indicators of forced labour (as defined by the International Labour Organisation) have been identified in seven contracts or projects we are linked to, most typically in relation to payment of recruitment fees, retention of identity documents, restriction of movement, excessive overtime and substandard living conditions. Compensation towards undue payment such as recruitment fees has been confirmed to 6,203 workers in our value and supply chains. In 2021, Equinor conducted 30 human rights verifications of suppliers covering 10 countries.\n\nDuring our early-stage portfolio development of solar energy in 2021 we noted several reports and concerns about potential forced labour in the solar supply chain. In an effort to address this risk, we have proactively engaged with peers, partners, suppliers and industry associations such as the Solar Energy Industry Association (SEIA) to increase the visibility in our supply chains, while supplier risk assessments have been conducted by third party experts.\n\n## Socio-economic impact\n\nContributing positively to societies and communities where we operate has always been important for Equinor and will continue to be so during the energy transition. Through our core business and supply chain, as well as broader social engagement, we primarily create economic value and opportunities for society and communities through:\n\n- \u00b7 Providing reliable energy in a sustainable way\n- \u00b7 Providing significant revenues for countries through the taxes we pay\n- \u00b7 Creating jobs, developing staff, and promoting diversity and inclusion in our workforce and beyond\n- \u00b7 Generating economic opportunities across our value chain through sourcing of goods and services\n- \u00b7 Driving innovation, research and development of new technologies to improve society",

        "page_content": "In 2021, we published, for the first time, our Tax Contribution Report. This provides a breakdown of tax contributions paid by Equinor ASA and subsidiaries in 2020. Tax earnings from Equinor, a significant tax contributor, provide governments and authorities with the opportunity to increase welfare and strengthen their societies. The report discloses Equinor's approach to tax and tax strategy, compliance and governance and provides information about the corporate income tax Equinor paid in countries and locations where we create value across all our businesses. The full report can be found on our webpage.\n\nWe generate important socio-economic impacts through working with suppliers. In 2021, supplier spend totalled over USD 16 billion. As an example, the signing of four new contracts with Aibel this year worth around USD 600 million will create around 3,500 person years employment ensuring job opportunities for several years in the local Norwegian communities of Haugesund, Harstad, Asker, and Stavanger.\n\nThriving local supply chains are important for regional economic development and for Equinor, as we invest in long-term infrastructure that will be operational for decades. An illustrative case is the 'Bridge' project that Equinor launched in Brazil that is intended to build capacity and create opportunities for local start-ups, and small and medium sized enterprises. We have also continued our support for educational programmes, for example the agreement signed in 2021 with the department of Chemical and Mining Engineering at the University of Dar Es Salaam in Tanzania,\n\nRead more about socio-economic impact in the context of how we develop our people, involve them in the development of the company and embrace diversity and drive inclusion in section 2.15 Our people.\n\n## Integrity and transparency\n\nAn ethical business culture is the cornerstone of a sustainable company. As a global company, Equinor is present in parts of the world where corruption is a high risk. With a strategic focus on increased investments in new energy markets, we have continued our work on ethics and compliance throughout 2021. Our commitment to conduct business in an ethical, socially responsible and transparent manner has remained unchanged during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Code of Conduct sets out our commitment and requirements for how we do business at Equinor. It applies to our employees, board members and hired personnel. We train our employees on how to apply the Code of Conduct in their daily work and require all employees to confirm annually that they understand and will comply with it. We expect our suppliers to act in a way that is consistent with our Code of Conduct and\n\nengage with them to help them understand our ethical requirements and how we do business.\n\nOur Code of Conduct explicitly prohibits engaging in bribery and corruption in any form. Equinor's Anti-Corruption Compliance Program summarises the standards, requirements and procedures implemented to comply with applicable laws and regulations and maintaining our high ethical standards. The Program lays down the foundation for ensuring that anti-bribery and corruption risks are identified, concerns are reported, and measures are taken to mitigate risk throughout the organisation.\n\nEquinor's Code of Conduct also addresses the requirement to comply with applicable competition and antitrust laws. Our Competition and Antitrust Program consists of governing documents and manuals, training of employees in high-risk positions as well as risk assessments and assurance activities.\n\nThe Code of Conduct imposes a duty to report possible violations of the Code or other unethical conduct. We require leaders to take their control responsibilities seriously to prevent, detect and respond to ethical issues. Employees are encouraged to discuss concerns with their leader or the leader's superior or use available internal channels to provide support. Concerns may also be reported through our Ethics Helpline which allows for anonymous reporting and is open to employees, business partners and the general public. Equinor has a strict non-retaliation policy.\n\nWe believe that through disclosure of payments to governments we promote accountability and build trust in the societies where we operate. Since 2014, we have reported our payments to governments on a country-by-country, project-by-project and legal entities basis. This reporting represents a core element of transparent corporate tax disclosure. The 'Tax Contribution Report' provides further insight into our approach to tax, including use of controversial tax jurisdictions, incentives and transfer pricing, and explaining why and where we pay the taxes we pay.\n\nWe have long standing relationships with the UN Global Compact, the World Economic Forum's Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) and Transparency International (TI). Equinor, as a long-standing supporter of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), has throughout 2021 continued its active participation in the EITI multi-stakeholder process with the clear objective of strengthening revenue transparency and good governance in the sector.\n\n## Other relevant reports\n\nMore information about Equinor's policies and approach taken to manage safety, security and sustainability performance is available in Equinor's 2021 Sustainability Report.",

Embracing diversity and driving inclusion is fundamental to us. As outlined in our code of conduct, we do not tolerate any discrimination or harassment of colleagues, or others affected by our operations, and everyone will be treated with fairness, respect and dignity. We focus on diversity and inclusion (D&I) because we believe that leveraging our diverse workforce and creating a safe and inclusive work environment will enable us to deliver on our strategy - taking a leading role in the energy transition.\n\nWe believe diversity is about what makes us who we are - what shapes our thoughts and perspectives. As a company we have focused on increasing gender balance for many years, including representation in leadership, development opportunities and through supporting girls and women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education through our sponsorship programs, and early talent recruitment. Since 2019 we have focused on increasing awareness of diversity beyond gender, and have set an ambition that all teams in Equinor be diverse and inclusive by 2025. This ambition is set on a global corporate level.\n\nWe built our ambition on research that says diverse and inclusive teams are more innovative and perform better. That is why we focus on bringing together people with different backgrounds, experiences and competencies to share ideas and challenge groupthink. These teams will only be successful if everyone feels safe, included and supported at work. As a tool\n\nto help drive our D&I ambition, we use metrics that look at the diversity dimensions of gender, age, nationality and experience. We believe diversity is broader than these dimensions, and work to increase awareness, understanding and support for diversity on a broader level. We aim to work more systematically to remove any barriers and strengthen inclusion for colleagues who identify as a minority group in terms of disability, ethnicity, LGBTQ+, religion and caring responsibilities. We measure inclusion through our annual people survey, while protecting the anonymity of our employees on these sensitive topics.\n\nThe D&I roadmap is owned by Corporate People & Organisation (HR), however deliverables are implemented through broader HR and cross-functional collaboration with Health and Working Environment and Safety. The Corporate Executive Committee provides strategic direction for D&I, and the Board of Directors ensures that our duty to engage in equality work is met. Progress updates are provided through formal channels and meetings.\n\nWe involve union representatives and safety delegates as part of our processes, both through selective projects and the formal structures of central union representative meetings. In 2021, we revised the local tariff agreement on equality, equity and diversity for Equinor ASA. The agreement (likestillingsavtale) between the company and union Industri Energie applies to all employees in Equinor ASA and states that we as an employer work to ensure all employees are treated equally regarding recruitment, pay and working conditions, training, career paths and professional development.",

In 2021, we adjusted our operating model to further expand the use of competence centres. This has increased our organisational flexibility and will help build diverse teams and facilitate collaboration. Our internal job market offers transparency of available opportunities.\n\nRecruitment plays a vital part in our D&I strategy as it provides the opportunity to increase our workforce diversity. We have a 50:50 global ambition for gender and nationality (Norwegian and non-Norwegian) for our early talent programs. In Brazil we align with local legal requirements of hiring people with disability. In this regard, we have identified the need to review our recruitment process to determine accessibility for candidates. Initially our focus will be to review the digital recruitment process in Brazil and Norway. Consideration of broader and global actions will follow.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to focus our talent attraction to be broader in terms of where and how we find talent and reviewing our compensation and benefits. We believe this will increase the diversity of our potential candidates, both globally and in Norway. We have reviewed some of our earlier actions to determine if they have been successful in attracting diverse candidates in terms of gender and nationality.

The gender pay gap reported for total compensation is larger than that of base pay. Our analysis shows that a key driver for this difference is the higher representation of males in skilled offshore and other operational positions. These roles are typically compensated with a range of additional elements beyond base salary, such as offshore allowances or shift allowances, as well as overtime payments. The gender imbalance in these roles compared to non-operational onshore roles result in a wider pay gap for total compensation than with base salary.\n\nA full table showing the breakdown of earning ratios in all major Equinor locations by Equinor's job structure can be found in the Equinor data hub. In line with our principles on pay equity, Equinor will continue to develop our understanding of the\n\nunderlying causes of potential gender imbalances in all our compensation items. We will seek to identify opportunities where we can proactively address gaps, whilst also being conscious of structural differences which may be beyond our ability to address.\n\nTo show our commitment to equal and inclusive workplaces, Equinor participates in Gender Equality Indexes that aim to give more visibility into reporting. This includes the Nordic SHE Index where Equinor was ranked number one out of 92 participating companies in Norway, receiving the SHE Index award in March 2021 for our progress towards gender equality. We commit to disclosing our efforts to support gender equality as we believe increased transparency in this work will have an impact on increasing gender balance both within our industry and in business more broadly.\n\nrevised job description and the expectations listed and supporting hiring managers to limit impact of unconscious bias in recruitment process. We will explore further improvement opportunities in 2022.\n\nWe believe that building a fit-for-future workforce, driving a strong performance development culture, and empowering our people to perform at their best, is important to driving D&I. We emphasize the importance of everyone driving their own growth and development in the company, underpinning our focus on equal opportunities for all. We believe our feedback culture supports a safe, supportive, and inclusive environment. In 2021, we saw a slight decrease in number of people asking for and people giving feedback and we will work to identify actions to strengthen our feedback culture further.\n\n## Gender\n\nEquinor has worked systematically to increase women in leadership positions over several years. In 2021, our CEO appointed a gender balanced Corporate Executive Committee. The leadership level reporting into the CEC also represents 49% female leaders. Embedding D&I in our key people processes, including talent and succession reviews, leadership assessments, leadership development courses and top-tier leadership deployment has contributed to the senior leadership gender balance in Equinor.",

To achieve this, we need everyone to feel that they belong, can be safe to be themselves at work, and can speak up. We have set clear expectations for leaders to drive an inclusive culture, and to seek out diversity when building teams. In 2021, the CEO sharpened the leadership expectations to match the key drivers for the energy transition. Emphasis was placed on inclusion and our leaders' abilities to build trust and create an environment where everyone can bring their whole self to work and have their voices heard and respected. These expectations are integrated in all our leadership development programs and tools.\n\nIn 2021, we increased awareness around mental health and communicated support and benefits available. Through our annual people survey and other feedback mechanisms, we have identified the need for further support. Plans to support mental health and wellbeing include allocating funds to welfare activities in all the countries we operate, and mental health support from external expertise through webinars and podcasts to employees and leaders. Additionally, all employees will receive a lump sum equivalent to 1,000 USD to spend on activities of their choice, to support their wellbeing.\n\nWe have identified that using Teams to collaborate across the organisation has increased inclusion of our colleagues with vision- and hearing impairments. In 2021, we identified risks and barriers related to office technology and building accessibility in Norway. As a response, we have started upgrading the technology systems in our offices, and improved office accessibility in terms of noise reduction measures in our canteens. Accessibility improvements will continue to be a focus in 2022 as we plan to do further analysis to determine actions and priorities.\n\nEmployee resource groups (ERGs) play an important role in increasing understanding and knowledge about diversity and creating inclusion and engagement. Home office requirement across our offices and locations have had an impact on their actions and engagement. In 2021, further support was offered to the ERGs by promoting and supporting various initiatives, and the set-up of additional ERGs including Black in Equinor in Brazil, incluzive in UK, and Mental Health in Norway. Having analyzed our impact, we have identified that these measures have not been sufficient and further actions in 2022 focus on senior sponsorship and HR support to strengthen activity and engagement. Our ERGs are run through groups in Norway, Brazil, US and UK, but are inclusive and welcoming of employee in all our locations.\n\n## Flexibility\n\nIn line with local Covid-19 restrictions and guidelines, we introduced a flexible work strategy to support combining work from the office with work done outside the office in a virtual way. In close collaboration with union representatives, we established corporate principles for flexible work agreements, which will guide our future efforts for teams that can safely and securely perform their tasks outside an Equinor office or asset. We believe flexibility will support employees with caring responsibilities and other personal commitments that require flexibility to ensure work-life balance, and continue to work to determine how best to apply these principles.\n\nIn Equinor ASA most of our employees work on a full-time basis, and we do not have employees who work involuntary part-time. The 2.4% of employees who work part time, do so on a voluntary basis. This group represents mostly women. We will continue to monitor the number of part time workers and the gender balance to determine if further analysis is required to understand if Equinor can better support employees who currently work part-time but wish to work full time\n\n## Number of employees, voluntary part time employees and temporary employees 2021\n\n|                                      | Female   | Male   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------|--------|\n| as of 31 December 2021               |          |        |\n| Number of employees                  | 5,690    | 12,527 |\n| Voluntary part time employees (in %) | 5.5 %    | 1.0 %  |\n| active in 2021                       |          |        |\n| Temporary employees                  |          |        |\n| Summer internship                    | 57       | 89     |\n| Apprentices                          | 148      | 385    |\n| Other temporary employees            | 10       | 24     |\n\nWe offer 16 weeks paid parental leave for all Equinor employees who become parents. In Equinor ASA, we report on the average number of weeks employees took in relation to the Norwegian Statutory parental leave. According to Norwegian Statutory parental leave, mothers have a quota of 18 weeks and fathers have 15 weeks with 100% pay. An additional 16 weeks may be\n\nsplit between mothers and fathers at 100% pay. Parents in same-sex couples have the same rights. On average men took less leave than the 15 weeks they are entitled to. This may reflect that the leave may be spread beyond the first 12 months, and we have identified the opportunity to do further analysis to understand the data.",

This includes internal crossfunctional collaboration and liaising with union representatives, and safety delegates according to local law, regulation, and practice. In 2021, this was vital in the work related to the new operating model and corporate flexible work strategy and principles. Cooperation and dialogue with trade unions and employee representatives has also been a prerequisite for all changes we make related to our physical workplace. We respect employees' rights to organize and their opportunity to bring forward their opinions, and we have the same clear expectation of our suppliers and partners. Data on union membership figures is available in our sustainability performance data at Equinor.com.\n\n## Measuring our progress\n\nOur work with D&I is broad in scope. Measuring progress towards our D&I ambition, that all teams will be diverse and inclusive by 2025, requires both formal and in-formal data collection methods. We have identified improvement opportunities in how we report on metrics globally, which has been highlighted in our prioritized actions for 2022.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to measure progress on our D&I ambition with the Corporate D&I KPI. The KPI was implemented in 2019\n\nand is made up by two indexes. The diversity index monitors each business area's progression on team diversity in terms of gender, age, nationality and experience.\n\nThe inclusion index is measured in our annual people survey and measures employees' perception of inclusion in their teams. The diversity index shows a slow but steady increase over the year with 2021 figure being 39 (baseline 2018 was 33, with 2025 ambition of 55). Our inclusion index has increased over the years, however in 2021 the figure dropped one point to 77 (baseline 2018 was 76, ambition 80). The D&I KPI has been a valuable tool since it was implemented, however our revised operating model requires us to reconsider our D&I metrics going forward. We have also identified the need to improve the way we measure and report actions and initiatives that go beyond diversity metrics - including engagement around D&I, activities by ERGs, and engagement on internal communication channels. In 2022, we aim to formalise these metrics further.",

One of our priorities for 2022 is to gain better overview of all our initiatives and metrics to determine our progress on a country level. This includes gaining better understanding of country reporting requirements according to local legislative framework in our largest locations of Norway, UK, USA and Brazil.\n\nWe will also complete a risk assessment to examine discrimination risks and diversity barriers to prioritise actions for 2022 and beyond. This project will be led by People & Organisation in collaboration with legal and union representatives. A few concrete activities have been prioritised for 2022 and will be part of the risk assessment. These include\n\nthe following deliverables that are both on global and Norwegian level:\n\n- 1) Review and revise current D&I metrics to better report on our progress and legal requirements.\n- 2) Analyze current state to ensure equity in key people processes, including recruitment, and further identify actions to increase accessibility for our colleagues.\n- 3) Strengthen and build a more inclusive culture by increasing awareness of diversity beyond gender - with particular focus on activities related to disability, mental health and ethnicity.\n\nHammerfest LNG plant, Melk\u00f8ya\n\n<!-- image -->",

American Depositary Receipts (ADR) representing ordinary shares are also listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and we are subject to the listing requirements of NYSE and the applicable reporting requirements of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC rules).\n\nThe board of directors focuses on maintaining a high standard of corporate governance in line with Norwegian and international standards of best practice. Good corporate governance is a prerequisite for a sound and sustainable company, and our corporate governance is based on openness and equal treatment of shareholders. Governing structures and controls help to ensure that we run our business in a justifiable and profitable manner for the benefit of employees, shareholders, partners, customers and society.\n\nThe work of the board of directors is based on the existence of a clearly defined division of roles and responsibilities between the shareholders, the board of directors and the company's management.\n\nThe following principles underline Equinor's approach to corporate governance:\n\n- \u00b7 All shareholders will be treated equally.\n- \u00b7 Equinor will ensure that all shareholders have access to upto-date, reliable and relevant information about its activities.\n- \u00b7 Equinor will have a board of directors that is independent (as defined by Norwegian standards) of the group's management. The board focuses on preventing conflicts of interest between shareholders, the board of directors and the company's management.\n- \u00b7 The board of directors will base its work on the principles for good corporate governance.\n\nCorporate governance in Equinor is subject to regular review and discussion by the board of directors and the text of this chapter three has also been considered at a board meeting.\n\nThe governance and management system is further elaborated on our website at www.equinor.com/cg where shareholders and stakeholders can explore any topic of interest in more detail.\n\n## Articles of association\n\nEquinor's current articles of association were adopted at the annual general meeting of shareholders on 14 May 2020.\n\n## Summary of Equinor's articles of association:\n\n## Name of the company\n\nThe registered name is Equinor ASA.

However, Equinor is required to disclose any significant ways in which its corporate governance practices differ from those applicable to domestic US companies under the NYSE rules. A statement of differences is set out below:\n\n## Corporate governance guidelines\n\nThe NYSE rules require domestic US companies to adopt and disclose corporate governance guidelines. Equinor's corporate governance principles are developed by the management and the board of directors, in accordance with the Code of Practice and applicable law. Oversight of the board of directors and management is exercised by the corporate assembly.\n\n## Director independence\n\nThe NYSE rules require domestic US companies to have a majority of \"independent directors\". The NYSE definition of an \"independent director\" sets out five specific tests of independence and requires an affirmative determination by the board of directors that the director has no material relationship with the company.\n\nPursuant to Norwegian company law, Equinor's board of directors consists of members elected by shareholders and employees. Equinor's board of directors has determined that, in its judgment, all shareholder-elected directors are independent. In making its determinations of independence, the board focuses\n\ninter alia on there not being any conflicts of interest between shareholders, the board of directors and the company's management. It does not strictly make its determination based on the NYSE's five specific tests but takes into consideration all relevant circumstances which may in the board's view affect the directors' independence. The directors elected from among Equinor's employees would not be considered independent under the NYSE rules as they are employees of Equinor. None of these employee representatives are executive officers of the company.\n\nFor further information about the board of directors, see 3.8 Corporate assembly, board of directors and management.\n\n## Board committees\n\nPursuant to Norwegian company law, managing the company is the responsibility of the board of directors. Equinor has an audit committee, a safety, sustainability and ethics committee and a compensation and executive development committee. The audit committee and the compensation and executive development committee operate pursuant to instructions that are broadly comparable to the applicable committee charters required by the NYSE rules. They report on a regular basis to, and are subject to, oversight by the board of directors. For further information about the board's committees, see 3.9 The work of the board of directors.\n\nEquinor complies with the NYSE rule regarding the obligation to have an audit committee that meets the requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nThe members of Equinor's audit committee include an employee-elected director. Equinor relies on the exemption provided in Rule 10A-3(b)(1)(iv)(C) from the independence requirements of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with respect to the employee-elected director. Equinor does not believe that its reliance on this exemption will materially adversely affect the ability of the audit committee to act independently or to satisfy the other requirements of Rule 10A-3 relating to audit committees. The other members of the audit committee meet the independence requirements under Rule 10A-3.\n\nAmong other things, the audit committee evaluates the qualifications and independence of the company's external auditor. However, in accordance with Norwegian law, the auditor is elected by the annual general meeting of the company's shareholders.\n\nEquinor does not have a nominating/corporate governance committee formed from its board of directors. Instead, the roles prescribed under the NYSE rules for such committee are principally carried out by the corporate assembly and the nomination committee, each of which is elected by the general meeting of shareholders.\n\nNYSE rules require the compensation committee of US companies to comprise independent directors, recommend senior management remuneration and determine the independence of advisors when engaging them. Equinor, as a foreign private issuer, is exempted from complying with these rules and is permitted to follow its home country regulations. Equinor considers all its compensation committee members to",

Equinor's compensation committee makes recommendations to the board regarding management remuneration, including that of the CEO. Further, the compensation committee assesses its own performance and has the authority to hire external advisors. The nomination committee, which is elected by the general meeting of shareholders, recommends to the corporate assembly the candidates and remuneration of the board of directors. The nomination committee also recommends to the general meeting of shareholders the candidates and remuneration of the corporate assembly and the nomination committee.\n\n## Shareholder approval of equity compensation plans\n\nThe NYSE rules require that, with limited exemptions, all equity compensation plans must be subject to a shareholder vote. Under Norwegian company law, although the issuance of shares and authority to buy-back company shares must be approved by Equinor's annual general meeting of shareholders, the approval of equity compensation plans is normally reserved for the board of directors.\n\nDeviations from the Code of Practice: None\n\n## 3.2 Business\n\nEquinor is an international energy company headquartered in Stavanger, Norway. The company has business operations in around 30 countries and approximately 21,000 employees worldwide. Equinor ASA is a public limited liability company organised under the laws of Norway and subject to the provisions of the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act. The Norwegian State is the largest shareholder in Equinor ASA, with a direct ownership interest of 67%. Equinor is transforming the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) and focusing its international portfolio to deliver sustainable value in the decades to come, at the same time as it develops a high value renewables business and secure early opportunities in the low carbon market.\n\nEquinor is among the world's largest net sellers of crude oil and condensate and is the second-largest supplier of natural gas to the European market. Equinor also has substantial processing and refining operations, contributes to the development of new low carbon energy resources, has on-going offshore wind activities internationally and is at the forefront of the implementation of technology for carbon capture and storage (CCS) in Europe.\n\n## Objective, strategies and risk profiles\n\nEquinor's objective is defined in the articles of association (www.equinor.com/articlesofassociation) and is to engage in exploration, production, transportation, refining and marketing of petroleum and petroleum-derived products, and other forms of energy; either independently or through participation in or together with other companies as well as other business.\n\nEquinor's purpose is turning natural resources into energy for people and progress for society, and the company's vision is to 'shape the future of energy'. The board and the administration have formulated a corporate strategy to deliver on this vision. It has been translated into concrete objectives and targets to align strategy execution across the company. Equinor's\n\ncorporate strategy is presented in section 2.1 Strategy and market overview.\n\nIn pursuing our vision and strategy, Equinor is committed to the highest standard of governance and to cultivating a valuesbased performance culture that rewards exemplary ethical practices, respect for the environment and personal and corporate integrity. The company continuously considers prevailing international standards of best practice when defining and implementing company policies, as Equinor believes that there is a clear link between high-quality governance and the creation of shareholder value.\n\nAt Equinor, the way we deliver is as important as what we deliver. The Equinor Book, which addresses all Equinor employees, sets the standards for behaviour, delivery and leadership.\n\nOur values guide the behaviour of all Equinor employees. Our corporate values are \"courageous\", \"open\", \"collaborative\" and \"caring\". Both our values and ethics are treated as an integral part of business activities. The Code of Conduct is further described in section 3.10 Risk management and internal control.\n\nWe also focus on managing the impacts of our activities on people, society and the environment, in line with corporate policies for health, safety, security, sustainability and climate, including human rights and ethics. Areas covered by these policies include labour standards, transparency and anticorruption, local hiring and procurement, health and safety, the working environment, security and broader environmental issues. These efforts and policies are further described in section 2.14 Safety, security and sustainability, and in Equinor's sustainability report.\n\nThe Equinor risk profile is a composite view of risks and supports current and future portfolio considerations. The focus is to strive for a portfolio that is robust and value creating through the cycles. Risk is an embedded part of the board's strategy discussions and investment decisions. The board regularly evaluates Equinor's strategy, risk profile and target setting as part of its annual plan. See also sections 3.9 The work of the board of directors and 3.10 Risk management and internal control.\n\nDeviations from the Code of Practice: None\n\n## 3.3 Equity and dividends\n\n## Shareholders' equity and capital structure\n\nThe company's shareholders' equity at 31 December 2021 amounted to USD 39,010 million (excluding USD 14 million in non-controlling interest, minority interest), equivalent to 26.5% of the company's total assets. The net debt ratio was 0.8% 19 . Cash, cash equivalents and current financial investments amounted to USD 36,372 million. The board of directors considers this to be",

If a mandate was to be granted to the board of directors to increase the company's share capital, such mandate would be restricted to a defined purpose. If the general meeting is to consider mandates to the board of directors for the issue of shares for different purposes, each mandate would be considered separately by the general meeting.\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nIt is Equinor's ambition to grow the annual cash dividend, measured in USD per share, in line with long-term underlying earnings. Equinor announces dividends on a quarterly basis. The board approves first to third quarter interim dividends based on an authorisation from the general meeting, while the annual general meeting approves the fourth quarter (and total annual) dividend based on a proposal from the board. When deciding the interim dividends and recommending the total annual dividend level, the board will take into consideration expected cash flow, capital expenditure plans, financing requirements and appropriate financial flexibility. In addition to cash dividends, Equinor might buy-back shares as part of the distribution of capital to the shareholders.\n\nThe shareholders at the annual general meeting may vote to reduce, but may not increase, the fourth quarter dividend proposed by the board of directors. Equinor announces dividend payments in connection with quarterly results. Payment of quarterly dividends is expected to take place approximately four months after the announcement of each quarterly dividend.\n\nEquinor declares dividends in USD. Dividends in NOK per share will be calculated and communicated four business days after record date for shareholders at Oslo B\u00f8rs.\n\nThe board of directors proposes to the annual general meeting a dividend of USD 0.20 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021 and an extraordinary dividend of USD 0.20 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\n## Buy-back of own shares for subsequent annulment\n\nIn addition to cash dividend, Equinor may buy-back shares as part of the total distribution of capital to the shareholders. In order to be able to buy-back shares the board of directors will need an authorisation from the general meeting which must be renewed on an annual basis. The annual general meeting authorised on 11 May 2021, the board of directors to acquire Equinor ASA shares in the market, on behalf of the company, with a nominal value of up to NOK 187,500,000. The board of directors is authorised to decide at what price within minimum and maximum prices of NOK 50 and NOK 500, respectively, and at what time such acquisition shall take place. Shares acquired pursuant to this authorisation can only be used for annulment through a reduction of the company's share capital, pursuant to the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act section 12-1. It is also a precondition for the repurchase and the annulment of shares that the Norwegian State's ownership interest in Equinor ASA is not changed. Accordingly, a proposal for the redemption of a proportion of the State's shares, so that\n\nthe State's ownership interest in the company remains unchanged, will also have to be put forward at the general meeting to decide on the annulment of repurchased shares. The authorisation remains valid until the next annual general meeting, but no later than 30 June 2022. Reference is made to section 5.1 Shareholder information for a description of the executed share buybacks in 2021.\n\n## Purchase of own shares for use in the share savings plan\n\nSince 2004, Equinor has had a share savings plan for its employees. The purpose of this plan is to strengthen the business culture and encourage loyalty through employees becoming part-owners of the company. The annual general meeting annually authorises the board of directors to acquire Equinor ASA shares in the market in order to continue implementation of the employees share savings plan.\n\nOn 11 May 2021, the board was authorised on behalf of the company to acquire Equinor ASA shares for a total nominal value of up to NOK 38,000,000 for use in the share savings plan. This authorisation remains valid until a new authorisation has been adopted at the next general meeting, but no later than 30 June 2022.\n\nDeviations from the Code of Practice: None\n\n## 3.4 Equal treatment of shareholders and transactions with close associates\n\nEqual treatment of all shareholders is a core governance principle in Equinor. Equinor has one class of shares, and each share confers one vote at the general meeting. The articles of association contain no restrictions on voting rights and all shares have equal rights. The nominal value of each share is NOK 2.50. The repurchase of shares for use in the share savings plan for employees (or, if applicable, for subsequent cancellation) is carried out through Oslo B\u00f8rs.\n\n## The Norwegian State as majority owner\n\nThe Norwegian State (the State) is the majority shareholder of Equinor and also holds major investments in other Norwegian companies. As of 31 December 2021, the State had an ownership interest in Equinor of 67% (excluding Folketrygdfondet's (Norwegian national insurance fund) ownership interest of 3.7%). The State's ownership interest in Equinor was previously managed by the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, however the State transferred the ownership from 1 July 2021 to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries (MTIF). The State is also a majority owner in other companies or enterprises that are under a common ownership structure and therefore meet the definition of a related party. Equinor may participate in transactions with such companies or enterprises. All such transactions are always entered into on an arm's length basis. The State's ownership interests in related parties may be managed by the MTIF or other Ministries in the Norwegian government, depending on the line of business such related parties are engaged in.\n\nThe State's ownership policy is that the principles in the Code of Practice will apply to state ownership and the Government has",

The principles are presented in the State's annual ownership report.\n\nContact between the State as owner and Equinor takes in principle place in the same manner as for other institutional investors, however, with the difference that there are more frequent meetings with the MTIF. Topics discussed includes Equinor's economic and strategic development, sustainability and the State's expectations regarding results and returns on investments. Such meetings comply with Norwegian company and securities legislation, hereunder equal treatment of shareholders and limitations for discussing inside information.\n\nIn all matters in which the State acts in its capacity as shareholder, exchanges with the company are based on information that is available to all shareholders. If state participation is imperative and the government must seek approval from the Norwegian Parliament (Stortinget), it may be necessary to provide the Ministry with insider information. The State will be subject to general rules that apply to the handling of such information. We ensure that, in any interaction between the State and Equinor, a distinction is drawn between the State's different roles.\n\nThe State has no appointed board members or members of the corporate assembly in Equinor. As majority shareholder, the State has appointed a member of Equinor's nomination committee.\n\n## Sale of the State's oil and gas\n\nPursuant to Equinor's articles of association, Equinor markets and sells the State's share of oil and gas production from the NCS together with its own production. The State has a common ownership strategy aimed at maximising the total value of its ownership interests in Equinor and its own oil and gas interests. This strategy is incorporated in the Owner's Instruction, which obliges Equinor, in its activities on the NCS, to emphasise these overall interests in decisions that may be of significance to the implementation of the sales arrangements.\n\nThe State-owned company Petoro AS handles commercial matters relating to the State's direct involvement in petroleum activities on the NCS and related activities.\n\n## Other transactions\n\nIn relation to its ordinary business operations such as pipeline transport, gas storage and processing of petroleum products, Equinor also has regular transactions with certain entities in which Equinor has ownership interests. Such transactions are carried out on an arm's length basis.\n\nDeviations from the Code of Practice: None\n\n## 3.5 Freely negotiable shares\n\nEquinor's primary listing is on Oslo B\u00f8rs. ADRs are traded on the NYSE. Each Equinor ADR represents one underlying ordinary share.\n\nThe articles of association of Equinor do not include any form of restrictions on the ownership, negotiability or voting related to its shares and the ADRs.\n\nDeviations from the Code of Practice: None\n\n## 3.6 General meeting of shareholders\n\nThe general meeting of shareholders is Equinor's supreme corporate body. It serves as a democratic and effective forum for interaction between the company's shareholders, board of directors and management.\n\nThe next annual general meeting (AGM) is scheduled for 11 May 2022.The AGM will be held as a combined physical and digital meeting (subject to potential Covid-19 restrictions). Practical details will follow from the notice of AGM and on our website. The AGM is conducted in Norwegian, with simultaneous English translation during the webcast. At Equinor's digital AGM on 11 May 2021, 80.18 % of the share capital was represented either by personal attendance, by proxy or by advance voting.\n\nThe main framework for convening and holding Equinor's AGM is as follows:\n\nPursuant to Equinor's articles of association, the AGM must be held by the end of June each year. Notice of the meeting and documents relating to the AGM are published on Equinor's website and notice is sent to all shareholders with known addresses at least 21 days prior to the meeting. All shareholders who are registered in the Norwegian Central Securities Depository (VPS) will receive an invitation to the AGM. Other documents relating to Equinor's AGMs will be made available on Equinor's website. A shareholder may request that these documents be sent to him/her.\n\nShareholders are entitled to have their proposals dealt with at the AGM if the proposal has been submitted in writing to the board of directors in sufficient time to enable it to be included in the notice of meeting, i.e. no later than 28 days before the meeting.\n\nAs described in the notice of the general meeting, shareholders may vote in writing, including through electronic communication, during a specified period before the general meeting.\n\nThe AGM is normally opened and chaired by the chair of the corporate assembly. If there is a dispute concerning individual matters and the chair of the corporate assembly belongs to one of the disputing parties or is for some other reason not perceived as being impartial, another person will be appointed to chair the AGM. This is in order to ensure impartiality in relation to the matters to be considered.",

Resolutions at general meetings are normally passed by simple majority. However, Norwegian company law requires a qualified majority for certain resolutions, including resolutions to waive preferential rights in connection with any share issue, approval of a merger or demerger, amendment of the articles of association or authorisation to increase or reduce the share capital. Such matters require the approval of at least two-thirds of the aggregate number of votes cast as well as two-thirds of the share capital represented at the general meeting.\n\nIf shares are registered by a nominee in the Norwegian Central Securities Depository (VPS), cf. section 4-10 of the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act, and the beneficial shareholder wants to vote such shares, the beneficial shareholder must re-register the shares in a separate VPS account in such beneficial shareholder's own name prior to the general meeting. If the holder can prove that such steps have been taken and that the holder has a de facto shareholder interest in the company, the company will allow the shareholder to vote the shares. Decisions regarding voting rights for shareholders and proxy holders are made by the person opening the meeting, whose decisions may be reversed by the general meeting by simple majority vote.\n\nThe minutes of the AGM are made available on Equinor's website immediately after the AGM.\n\nAn extraordinary general meeting (EGM) will be held in order to consider and decide a specific matter if demanded by the corporate assembly, the chair of the corporate assembly, the auditor or shareholders representing at least 5% of the share capital. The board must ensure that an EGM is held within a month of such demand being submitted.\n\nThe following sections outline certain types of resolutions by the general meeting of shareholders:\n\n## New share issues\n\nIf Equinor issues any new shares, including bonus shares, the articles of association must be amended. This requires the same majority as other amendments to the articles of association (i.e. two-thirds of votes cast as well as two-thirds of the share capital). In addition, under Norwegian law, the shareholders have a preferential right to subscribe for new shares issued by Equinor. The preferential right to subscribe for an issue may be waived by a resolution of a general meeting passed by the same percentage majority as required to approve amendments to the articles of association. The general meeting may, with a twothirds majority as described above, authorise the board of\n\ndirectors to issue new shares, and to waive the preferential rights of shareholders in connection with such share issues. Such authorisation may be effective for a maximum of two years, and the par value of the shares to be issued may not exceed 50% of the nominal share capital when the authorisation was granted.\n\nThe issuing of shares through the exercise of preferential rights to holders who are citizens or residents of the US may require Equinor to file a registration statement in the US under US securities laws. If Equinor decides not to file a registration statement, these holders may not be able to exercise their preferential rights.\n\n## Right of redemption and repurchase of shares\n\nEquinor's articles of association do not authorise the redemption of shares. In the absence of authorisation, the redemption of shares may nonetheless be decided upon by a general meeting of shareholders by a two-thirds majority on certain conditions. However, such share redemption would, for all practical purposes, depend on the consent of all shareholders whose shares are redeemed.\n\nA Norwegian company may purchase its own shares if authorisation to do so has been granted by a general meeting with the approval of at least two-thirds of the aggregate number of votes cast as well as two-thirds of the share capital represented at the general meeting. The aggregate par value of such treasury shares held by the company must not exceed 10% of the company's share capital, and treasury shares may only be acquired if, according to the most recently adopted balance sheet, the company's distributable equity exceeds the consideration to be paid for the shares. Pursuant to Norwegian law, authorisation by the general meeting to repurchase shares cannot be granted for a period exceeding 18 months.\n\n## Distribution of assets on liquidation\n\nUnder Norwegian law, a company may be wound up by a resolution of the company's shareholders at a general meeting passed by both a two-thirds majority of the aggregate votes cast and a two-thirds majority of the aggregate share capital represented at the general meeting. The shares are ranked equally in the event of a return on capital by the company upon winding up or otherwise.\n\n## Deviations from the Code of Practice:\n\nThe Code of Practice recommends that the board of directors and chair of the nomination committee be present at the general meetings. Equinor has not deemed it necessary to require the presence of all members of the board of directors. However, the chair of the board, the chair of the nomination committee, as well as the chair of the corporate assembly, our external auditor, the CEO and other members of management are always present at general meetings.\n\n## 3.7 Nomination committee\n\nPursuant to Equinor's articles of association, the nomination committee shall consist of four members who are shareholders or representatives of shareholders. The duties of the nomination committee are set forth in the articles of association, and the instructions for the committee are adopted by the general meeting of shareholders.",

The nomination committee invites Equinor's largest shareholders to propose shareholder-elected candidates of the board of directors and the corporate assembly, as well as members of the nomination committee. The shareholders are also invited to provide input to the nomination committee in respect of the composition and competence of Equinor's governing bodies considering Equinor's strategy and challenges and opportunities going forward. The deadline for providing input is normally set to early/mid-January so that such input may be taken into account in the upcoming nominations. In addition, all shareholders have an opportunity to submit proposals through an electronic mailbox as described on Equinor's website. The results from an annual board evaluation, normally externally facilitated, are made available to the nomination committee for the board nomination process. Separate meetings are held between the nomination committee and each board member, including employee-elected board members. The chair of the board and the chief executive officer are invited, without having the right to vote, to attend at least one meeting of the nomination committee before it makes its final recommendations.

        "page_content": "## Governance\n\nShareholder elected members of the corporate assembly were elected in May 2020 for a period of two years. However, Brynjar Kristian Forbergskog chose to resign as a member in June 2021. Accordingly, deputy member Trond Straume became a member of the corporate assembly as of 9 June 2021. An election of the employee-elected members of the corporate assembly was held in early 2021. As of 12 May 2021, Peter B. Sabel (previously observer) was elected as new member, replacing Sun Maria Lehmann. Oddvar Karlsen, Berit S\u00f8gnen Sandven, Lars Olav Gr\u00f8vik, Frode Mikkelsen and Terje Enes were re-elected as members of the corporate assembly. Ingvild Berg Martiniussen was elected as new observer, replacing Peter B. Sabel. Per Helge \u00d8deg\u00e5rd and Anne Kristi Horneland were re-elected as observers. A total list of members and deputy members can be found at www.equinor.com/corporateassembly.\n\nThe duties of the corporate assembly are defined in section 637 of the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act. The corporate assembly elects the board of directors and the chair of the board and can vote separately on each nominated candidate. Its responsibilities also include overseeing the board and the CEO's management of the company, making decisions on investments of considerable magnitude in relation to the company's resources, and making decisions involving the rationalisation or reorganisation of operations that will entail major changes in or reallocation of the workforce.\n\nEquinor's corporate assembly held four ordinary meetings in 2021. The chair of the board and the CEO participated in all four meetings. Other members of management were also present at the meetings.\n\nThe procedure for the work of the corporate assembly, as well as an updated overview of its members, is available at www.equinor.com/corporateassembly.\n\n## Board of directors\n\nPursuant to Equinor's articles of association, the board of directors consists of between 9 and 11 members elected by the corporate assembly. The chair and the deputy chair of the board are also elected by the corporate assembly. At present, Equinor's board of directors consists of 11 members. As required\n\nby Norwegian company law, the company's employees are represented by three board members.\n\nThe employee-elected board members, but not the shareholder-elected board members, have three deputy members who attend board meetings in the event an employeeelected member of the board is unable to attend. The management is not represented on the board of directors. Members of the board are elected for a term of up to two years, normally for one year at a time. There are no board member service contracts that provide for benefits upon termination of office.\n\nThe board considers its composition to be competent with respect to the expertise, capacity and diversity appropriate to attend to the company's strategy, goals, main challenges, and the common interest of all shareholders. The board members have experience from oil, gas, renewables, shipping, telecom, politics and climate policy. The board also deems its composition to consist of individuals who are willing and able to work as a team, resulting in an efficient and collegiate board. At least one board member qualifies as an \"audit committee financial expert\", as defined in the SEC rules. The board has determined that, in its judgment, all the shareholder representatives on the board are considered independent. Seven board members are men, four board members are women and three board members are nonNorwegians resident outside of Norway.\n\nEquinor ASA has purchased and maintains a Directors and Officers Liability Insurance on behalf of the members of the board of directors and the CEO. The insurance also covers any employee acting in a managerial capacity and includes controlled subsidiaries. The insurance policy is issued by a reputable insurer with an appropriate rating.\n\nThe board held eight ordinary board meetings and three extraordinary meetings in 2021. Average attendance at these board meetings was 100%.\n\nFurther information about the members of the board and its committees, including information about expertise, experience, other directorships, independence, share ownership and loans, follows and is available on our website at www.equinor.com/board.",

        "page_content": "As part of its general loan arrangement for Equinor employees, Equinor has granted loans to Equinor-employed spouses of certain members of the corporate executive committee. Permanent employees in certain specified employee categories may take out a car loan from Equinor in accordance with standardised provisions set by the company. The standard maximum car loan is limited to the cost of the car, including registration fees, but not exceeding NOK 300,000. Employees outside the collective labour area are entitled to a car loan up to NOK 575,000 (vice presidents and senior vice presidents) or NOK 475,000 (other positions). The car loan is interest-free, but the tax value, \"interest advantage\", must be reported as salary. Permanent employees of Equinor ASA may also apply for a consumer loan up to NOK 350,000. The interest rate on consumer loans corresponds to the standard rate in effect at any time for 'reasonable loans' from employer as decided by the Norwegian Ministry of Finance, i.e. the lowest rate an employer may offer without triggering taxation of the benefit for the employee.\n\nDeviations from the Code of Practice: None\n\n## 3.9 The work of the board of directors\n\nThe board is responsible for managing the Equinor group and for monitoring day-to-day management and the group's business activities. This means that the board is responsible for establishing control systems and for ensuring that Equinor operates in compliance with laws and regulations, with our values as stated in the Equinor Book and the Code of Conduct, as well as in accordance with the owners' expectations of good corporate governance. The board emphasises the safeguarding of the interests of all shareholders, but also the interests of Equinor's other stakeholders.\n\nThe board handles matters of major importance, or of an extraordinary nature, and may require the management to present other matters. An important task of the board is to appoint the chief executive officer (CEO) and stipulate their job instructions and terms and conditions of employment.\n\nThe board has adopted a generic annual plan for its work which is revised with regular intervals. Recurring items on the board's annual plan are: safety, security, sustainability and climate, corporate strategy, business plans, targets, quarterly and annual results, annual reporting, ethics, management's monthly performance reporting, management compensation issues, CEO and top management leadership assessment and succession planning, project status review, people and organisation strategy and priorities, two yearly discussions of main risks and risk issues and an annual review of the board's governing documentation.\n\nClimate-related upside and downside risks, and Equinor's strategic response to these are discussed frequently by the board. In 2021, the board discussed climate change and the energy transition in most of the ordinary board meetings either as integral parts of strategy and investment discussions or as separate topics.\n\nIn February 2021, following-up on the net-zero ambition launched on 2 November 2020, the board participated in a second workshop which included climate risk training, building on the workshop conducted in 2020. In March, as part of Equinor's strategy for significant growth within renewables, the board participated in the second of two offshore wind deep dives, building on the workshop they conducted in December 2020. Finally, in June the board participated in a deep dive into Equinor's low carbon solutions focusing on the project portfolios, profitability and what it takes to deliver on the ambitions. At the beginning of each board meeting, the CEO meets separately with the board to discuss key matters in the company. At the end of all board meetings, the board has a closed session with only board members attending the discussions and evaluating the meeting. The CEO, the CFO, the head of Safety, Security & Sustainability, the senior vice president for communication, the general counsel and the company secretary attend all board meetings. Other members of the executive committee and senior management attend board meetings by invitation in connection with specific matters.\n\nAn induction programme with key members of the management is arranged for new board members. They receive an introduction to Equinor's business and relevant information about the company and the board's work.\n\nThe board conducts an annual self-evaluation of its own work and competence, with input from various sources, which generally is externally facilitated. In the annual board evaluation for 2021, climate change capabilities and knowledge were included as key components. The evaluation report is discussed in a board meeting and is made available to the nomination committee and also discussed in a meeting between the chair of the board and the nomination committee as input to the committee's work.\n\nThe entire board, or part of it, regularly visits several Equinor locations in Norway and globally, and a longer board trip for all board members to an international location is made at least every two years. When visiting Equinor locations globally, the board emphasises the importance of improving its insight into, and knowledge about, safety and security in Equinor's operations, Equinor's technical and commercial activities as well as the company's local organisations. In 2021, the board's visits were cancelled due to the Covid-19 situation and next board trip is planned for 2022. In 2021, the chair of the board visited the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal in the context of the US offshore wind business.\n\n## Requirements for board members\n\nUnder our Code of Conduct, which is approved by the board, and which applies to both management, employees and board members, individuals must behave impartially in all business dealings and not give other companies, organisations or individuals improper advantages.\n\nThe work of the board is based on rules of procedure that describe the board's responsibilities, duties and administrative procedures. They also describe the CEO's duties vis-\u00e0-vis the board of directors.\n\nFurther, they state that members of the board and the CEO may not participate in any discussion or decision of issues which are",

Each board member and the CEO are individually responsible for ensuring that they are not disqualified from discussing any particular matter. Members of the board are obliged to disclose any interests they or their closely related parties may have in the outcome of a particular issue. The board must approve any agreement between the company and a member of the board or the CEO. The board must also approve any agreement between the company and a third party in which a member of the board or the CEO may have a special interest. Each member of the board shall also continuously assess whether there are circumstances which could undermine the general confidence in the director's independence. It is incumbent on each board member to be especially vigilant when making such assessments in connection with the board's handling of transactions, investments and strategic decisions. The board member shall immediately notify the chair of the board if such circumstances are present or arise and the chair of the board will determine how the matter will be dealt with. The board's rules of procedure will be adjusted in 2022 to reflect the updated recommendation in the Code of Practice chapter 9 relating to how the board and management shall treat agreements with related parties, including whether an independent valuation should be obtained. The board's rules of procedure are available on our website at www.equinor.com/board.\n\n## The board of directors' committees\n\nEquinor's board has established three committees: the audit committee; the compensation and executive development committee; and the safety, sustainability and ethics committee. The committees prepare items for consideration by the board and their authority is limited to making such recommendations. The committees consist entirely of board members and answer to the board alone for the performance of their duties. Minutes of the committee meetings are sent to the whole board, and the chair of each committee regularly informs the board at board meetings about the committees' work. The composition and work of the committees are further described below.\n\n## Audit committee\n\nThe audit committee acts as a preparatory body for the board in connection with risk management, internal control and financial reporting, and other tasks assigned to the committee.\n\nIn particular, the audit committee shall assist the board in exercising its oversight responsibilities in relation to:\n\n- \u00b7 The financial reporting process and the integrity of the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 The company's internal control, internal audit and risk management systems and practices.\n- \u00b7 The election of and qualifications, independence and oversight of the work of the external auditor.\n- \u00b7 Business integrity, including handling of complaints and reports.\n- \u00b7 Other duties as set out in the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act \u00a7 6-43 and Regulation 10A-3 of the US Securities Exchange Act and applicable listing requirements.\n\nThe audit committee reviews the effectiveness of the system for monitoring compliance with laws and regulations pertaining to business integrity and compliance with Equinor's Code of Conduct relevant to the committee's responsibilities.\n\nUnder Norwegian law, the external auditor is appointed by the shareholders at the annual general meeting based on a proposal from the corporate assembly. The audit committee is responsible for making recommendations regarding appointment, re-appointment or removal of the company's external auditor, and supports the board and the corporate assembly in their roles related to the election of external auditors for Equinor ASA at the annual general meeting.\n\nThe audit committee meets as often as it deems necessary, normally five to seven times every year, and holds meetings with the internal auditor and the external auditor on a regular basis without the company's management being present, including in relation to the financial statement and annual report.\n\nThe audit committee is also responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 Reviewing the scope of the audit and the nature of any non-audit services provided by external auditors.\n- \u00b7 Ensuring that the company has procedures in place for receiving and dealing with complaints received by the company regarding accounting, internal control or auditing matters.\n- \u00b7 Procedures for the confidential and anonymous submission by company employees, via the group's ethics helpline, of concerns regarding accounting or auditing matters, as well as other matters regarded as being in breach of the group's Code of Conduct, a material violation of an applicable US federal or state securities law, a material breach of fiduciary duties or a similar material violation of any other US or Norwegian statutory provision.\n\nThe audit committee is designated as the company's qualified legal compliance committee for the purposes of Part 205 in Title 17 of the US Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nIn the execution of its tasks, the audit committee may examine all activities and circumstances relating to the operations of the company. In this regard, the audit committee may request the CEO or any other employee to grant it access to information, facilities and personnel and such assistance as needed. The audit committee is authorised to carry out or instigate such investigations as it deems necessary in order to execute its tasks, and it may use the company's internal audit and investigation unit, the external auditor or other external advice and assistance. The costs of such work will be covered by the company.\n\nThe audit committee is only responsible to the board for the execution of its tasks. The work of the audit committee in no way alters the responsibility of the board and its individual members, and the board retains full responsibility for the audit committee's tasks.\n\nCorporate Audit reports administratively to the president and CEO and functionally to the chair of the audit committee.\n\nThe board elects at least three of its members to serve on the audit committee and appoints one of them to act as chair.

        "page_content": "## 3.10 Risk management and internal control\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe board of directors oversees the company's internal control and overall risk management and assurance, and through its audit committee, reviews and monitors the effectiveness of the company's policies and practices in such regard. On an ongoing basis, the board and board audit committee discuss the company's enterprise risk management framework and threelines of control model and learning from risk-adjusting actions and assurance activities. The board, board audit committee and board safety, sustainability and ethics committee, together, monitor and assess risks including legal, regulatory, financial, safety, security, sustainability and climate-related risks and the associated control measures put in place to manage them. Twice a year, the board receives and reviews an assessment of all top enterprise risks, material emerging risks and risk-issues, and discusses the company's risk profile.\n\nEquinor manages risk to ensure that operations and other business activities are conducted in a safe and secure manner, in compliance with external and internal standards and requirements, so that unwanted incidents are avoided, and maximum value is created. The company's enterprise risk management framework endeavours to make risk considerations an integral part of realising its purpose and vision, and of driving day-to-day performance.\n\nThrough its three lines of control model, company-wide accountabilities for risk management, and responsibilities for risk analysis, monitoring, advise and assurance are defined across all relevant classes of risk, including business integrity risks (fraud, sanctions, competition, money laundering), safety/security/sustainability risks, financial/legal/regulatory risks, people risks and political/public affairs risks. Procedures and systems are in place to assess both potential financial impacts of risks on cash-flows and potential non-financial impacts of risks on people, the environment, physical assets, and ultimately, the company's reputation. Where necessary, operational risks are insured by the company's captive insurance company, that operates in both Norwegian and international insurance markets.\n\nFurther information about the risks and risk factors that the company's financial and operating results are subject to are presented in section 2.13 (risk review) of the Form 20-F.\n\n## Controls and procedures\n\nThis section describes controls and procedures relating to our financial reporting.\n\n## Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures\n\nThe management of Equinor, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a15(b) as of 31 December 2021. Based on that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded\n\nthat these disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable level of assurance.\n\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management, with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, recognised that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance that the desired control objectives will be achieved, and that the management must necessarily exercise judgment when evaluating possible controls and procedures. Because of the limitations inherent in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and any instances of fraud in the company have been detected.\n\n## Management's report on internal control over financial reporting\n\nThe management of Equinor is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed, under the supervision of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Equinor's financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU). The accounting policies applied by the group also comply with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nThe management of Equinor has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that Equinor's internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2021 was effective.\n\nEquinor's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets, provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded in the manner necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and that receipts and expenditures are only carried out in accordance with the authorisation of the management and directors of Equinor; and provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of any unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of Equinor's assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control to future periods are subject to a risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Attestation report of the registered public accounting firm\n\nThe effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2021 has been audited by Ernst & Young AS, an independent registered accounting firm that also audits the",

Their audit report on the internal control over financial reporting is included in section 4.1 Consolidated financial statements in this report.\n\n## Remediation of material weaknesses in prior year\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, management has completed the remediation work to address the material weaknesses identified as of 31 December 2020, as follows:\n\nIT user access controls:\n\n- \uf0a7 The IT user access review controls have been assessed and the control attributes clarified to ensure operating effectiveness.\n- \uf0a7 The frequency of the existing review and security controls has been increased to strengthen the control framework.\n- \uf0a7 The coordination and monitoring activities related to the execution of the IT user access management controls have been increased, including further enhancement of the documentation.\n- \uf0a7 Competence has been strengthened by providing targeted training and coaching of relevant personnel executing controls.\n\nControls over sales and purchases of liquid and gas, including inventory variation, and power trading in the MMP segment:\n\n- \uf0a7 The internal control design has been strengthened to address design deficiencies, as well as the implementation of automated controls.\n- \uf0a7 Significant training activities have been conducted to enhance the documentation, improve the deviation handling procedures, and increase monitoring activities.\n- \uf0a7 Targeted training and coaching of relevant personnel executing controls has been provided, in particular on requirements for review controls and for ensuring completeness and accuracy of data and reports used in these controls.\n\nManagement believes the foregoing work has effectively remediated the material weaknesses.\n\n## Changes in internal control over financial reporting\n\nOther than as described above, there were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended 31 December 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\n## Ethics - Equinor's approach\n\nEquinor believes that responsible and ethical behaviour is a necessary condition for a sustainable business. Equinor's Code of Conduct is based on its values and reflects Equinor's commitment to high ethical standards in all its activities.\n\n## Our Code of Conduct\n\nThe Code of Conduct describes Equinor's code of business practice and the requirements for expected behaviour. The Code of Conduct applies to Equinor's board members, employees and hired personnel. It is divided into five main categories: The Equinor way, Respecting our people, Conducting our operations, Relating to our business partners and Communities and environment.\n\nThe Code of Conduct is approved by the board of directors.\n\nEquinor seeks to work with others who share its commitment to ethics and compliance, and Equinor manages its risks through in-depth knowledge of suppliers, business partners and markets. Equinor expects its suppliers and business partners to comply with applicable laws, respect internationally recognised human rights and adhere to ethical standards which are consistent with Equinor's ethical requirements when working for or together with Equinor. In joint ventures and entities where Equinor does not have control, Equinor makes good faith efforts to encourage the adoption of ethics and anti-corruption policies and procedures that are consistent with its standards. Equinor will not tolerate any breaches of the Code of Conduct. Remedial measures may include termination of employment and reporting to relevant authorities.\n\n## Training and certifying the Code of Conduct\n\nAll Equinor employees must annually confirm electronically that they understand and will comply with the Code of Conduct and pass a quiz to certify as competent (Code certification). The Code certification reminds the individuals of their duty to comply with Equinor's values and ethical requirements, including how to report concerns.\n\nIn 2021, the Code of Conduct was included in Equinor's competence assurance management solution (CAMS), providing management with the opportunity to monitor the completion rate daily, and be more targeted in their follow-up based on completion data in the Code of Conduct dashboard.\n\nFurther, there are specific training on various compliance topics, including anti-corruption, anti-trust, anti-money laundering and sanctions. In 2021, many workshops were held virtually. The anticorruption and anti-money laundering e-learning was updated in 2021.\n\n## Anti-corruption compliance program\n\nEquinor is against all forms of corruption including bribery, facilitation payments and trading in influence. There is a company-wide anti-corruption compliance program which implements the zero-tolerance policy. The program includes mandatory procedures designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, as well as guidance and training on relevant topics such as gifts, hospitality and conflict of interest. A global network of compliance officers, who support the integration of ethics and anti-corruption considerations into Equinor's business activities, constitute an important part of the program.\n\nEquinor consistently works with its partners and suppliers on ethics and anti-corruption compliance and has initiated dialogue with several partners on the risks that we jointly face and actions that can be taken to address them. There are separate compliance policies and procedures describing Equinor's management of third-party corruption risk both in operated and non-operated joint ventures, and on integrity due diligence of third parties.\n\n## Open dialogue and raising concerns\n\nEquinor is committed to maintain an open dialogue on ethical issues. The Code of Conduct requires those who suspect a violation of the Code of Conduct or other unethical conduct to raise their concern. Employees are encouraged to discuss",

Equinor recognises that raising a concern is not always easy so there are several internal channels for taking concerns forward, including through People and Organisation or the ethics and compliance function in the legal department. Concerns can also be raised through the externally operated Ethics Helpline which is available 24/7 and allows for anonymous reporting and two-way communication. Equinor has a non-retaliation policy for anyone who raises an ethical or legal concern in good faith.\n\nMore information about Equinor's policies and requirements related to the Code of Conduct is available on www.equinor.com/en/about-us/ethics-and-compliance-inequinor.html.\n\nDeviations from the Code of Practice: None\n\n## 3.11 Remuneration to the board of directors and corporate assembly\n\n## Remuneration to the board of directors\n\n| Approach to setting fees                                                                                                                             | Basis of fees                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Other items                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| The remuneration to the board  and its committees is decided  by the corporate assembly,  based on a recommendation  from the nomination  committee. | The board members have an annual, fixed  remuneration, except for deputy members  (only elected for employee-elected board  members) who receive remuneration per  meeting attended.                                                   | The board members from outside Scandinavia and  outside Europe, respectively, receive separate travel  allowances for each meeting attended.

The board of directors' complete remuneration policy and report for executive personnel follows.\n\nOnly the following portions of this section 3.12 Remuneration to the corporate executive committee form part of Equinor's annual report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC: Equinor's performance framework and the link to business strategy, long-term interests and sustainability of the company; the table summarising the main elements of Equinor executive remuneration; the description of remuneration policy for international executives, duration of contracts with executive vice presidents, mobility, localisation and relocation; the description of the threshold for variable pay and company performance modifier; the description of pension and insurance schemes and severance pay arrangements; the description regarding release of earned LTI grants and bonus shares at termination of employment, the salary and employment conditions of other employees, the recruitment policy; the description regarding execution of the remuneration policy in 2021; the tables summarising the performance assessment, main objectives and KPIs for each perspective; the table summarising remuneration paid to each member of the corporate executive committee; and the description regarding share ownership, including the summary table.\n\n## Remuneration policy\n\nThe following guidelines for remuneration of Equinor' corporate executive committee proposed by the board of directors were approved by the 2021 20 annual general meeting, pursuant to the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act, section 616 a and supplementing regulations . The policy also includes compensation to members of the board of directors and the corporate assembly employed by the company, which is explained in section 3.11 Remuneration to the board of directors and corporate assembly. The policy is subject to approval by the annual general meeting at every material change and, in any case, at least every fourth year.\n\nEquinor's remuneration policy and terms are aligned with the company's overall strategy, values, people policy and performance-oriented framework. Our rewards and recognition for executives are designed to attract and retain the right people; people who are committed to deliver on our business strategy and able to adapt to a changing business environment. Equinor's remuneration framework contributes to the business strategy, long-term interests and sustainability of the company.\n\nA key role for the board of directors is to ensure that executive compensation is competitive, but not market leading, in the markets where we operate. The board is committed to ensuring that executive compensation is fair and aligned with our overall remuneration philosophy and compensation levels in the company, and in line with shareholders' interests.\n\nThe remuneration policy is an integrated part of our valuesbased performance framework. It has been designed to:\n\n- \u00b7 Contribute to the business strategy, long-term interests and sustainability of the company\n- \u00b7 Strengthen the common interests of employees in the Equinor group and its shareholders\n\n- \u00b7 Reflect the company's overall performance and financial results\n- \u00b7 Be competitive and aligned with local markets\n- \u00b7 Equally reward and recognise 'What' we deliver and 'How' we deliver\n- \u00b7 Differentiate on the basis of responsibilities and performance\n- \u00b7 Be acknowledged as fair, transparent, consistent and nondiscriminatory\n- \u00b7 Promote collaboration and teamwork\n- \u00b7 Fully align with our values and HSE standards\n- \u00b7 Promote continuous improvement and a sustainable cost level\n\n## The decision-making process\n\nThe decision-making process for implementing or changing our remuneration policy, and the determination of salaries and other remuneration for the corporate executive committee, are in accordance with the provisions of the Norwegian public limited liability companies act sections 5-6 and 6-16 a and the board's rules of procedure. The board of director's rules of procedure are available at www.equinor.com/board.\n\nThe board of directors has appointed a designated compensation and executive development committee. The compensation and executive development committee is a preparatory body for the board of directors. The committee's main objective is to assist the board of directors in its work relating to the terms of employment for Equinor's chief executive officer and the main principles and strategy for the remuneration and leadership development of our senior executives. The board of directors determines the chief executive officer's salary and other terms of employment. The committee shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at every material change and, in any case, every fourth year and submit it to the general meeting for resolution. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines have been adopted by the general meeting.\n\nThe compensation and executive development committee answers to the board of Equinor ASA for the performance of its duties. The work of the committee in no way alters the responsibilities of the board of directors or the individual board members.\n\nFor further details about the roles and responsibilities of the compensation and executive development committee, please",

        "page_content": "## Governance\n\nrefer to the committee's instructions available at www.equinor.com/compensationcommittee.\n\n## Equinor purpose, vision and overall strategy\n\nEquinor's purpose is turning natural resources into energy for people and progress for society, and our vision is to shape the future of energy. We are strongly committed to creating shareholder value and with a leading role in the energy transition towards a low-carbon future.\n\nWhile our strategic pillars of 'always safe', 'high value' and 'low carbon' remain firm, we will further strengthen in the areas of a) an optimised oil & gas portfolio, b) a faster growing renewable business, c) expanding our low-carbon solutions business.\n\nWithin all areas, technology and innovation will be key accelerators to drive value and improved performance. We will use our strengths and experience within the oil & gas portfolio as a foundation for developing offshore wind at scale, establishing new value chains, and for developing new low carbon energy sources.\n\n## Equinor's performance framework and the link to business strategy, long-term interests and sustainability of the company\n\nOur performance framework translates the company vision, values and strategy into actions and results for the company, its units, teams and every leader and employee.\n\nPerformance is evaluated in two dimensions; 'What' we deliver and 'How' we deliver. This is the core of our values-based performance culture and means that delivery ('what') and behaviour ('how') are equally weighted when recognising and rewarding individual performance.\n\n'What' we deliver (business delivery) is defined through the company's performance framework 'Ambition to Action', which addresses strategic objectives, key performance Indicators (KPIs) and actions across the five perspectives; Safety, Security and Sustainability, People and Organisation, Operations, Market and Finance. Generally, Equinor believes in setting ambitious targets to inspire and drive strong performance. Each year individual performance goals ('what') based on the company's 'Ambition to Action' are established for the CEO and the executive vice presidents.\n\nThe board decides annually a set of strategic objectives and KPIs that will form basis for the assessment of the business delivery dimension ('What'). These KPIs and related targets for the upcoming performance year shall be disclosed in the annual remuneration report. Examples of such KPIs are Serious Incident Frequency (SIF), CO2 intensity for the upstream portfolio, Levelised cost of energy (LCOE), Production efficiency (PE), Production based availability (PBA), Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR), Relative ROACE, Improvement impact etc.\n\nGoals on 'How' we deliver are based on Equinor's core values and leadership principles and address the behaviour required and expected to achieve the delivery goals. We believe in developing a strong leadership and culture recognised by our values, driving the long-term and sustainable success of the company. The CEO and the executive vice presidents have individual behaviour goals within prioritised behaviour themes such as safety and compliance, empowerment, diversity and inclusion, collaboration and sustainability and climate.\n\nPerformance evaluation is holistic, involving both measurement and assessment. Significant changes in assumptions are taken into account, as well as target ambition levels, sustainability of delivered results and strategic contribution.\n\nThe balanced approach, which involves a broad set of goals defined in relation to both 'What' and 'How' dimensions and an overall performance evaluation, significantly reduces the likelihood that remuneration policies may incentivise excessive risk-taking or have other material adverse effects.\n\n## The remuneration concept for the corporate executive committee\n\nEquinor's remuneration for the corporate executive committee consists of the following core elements;\n\n- \u00b7 Fixed remuneration: base salary and as applicable fixed salary addition\n- \u00b7 Variable pay: annual variable pay (AVP) and long-term incentive (LTI)\n- \u00b7 Benefits: primarily pension, insurance and share savings plan\n\nThe following table illustrate how the reward policy is translated into our key remuneration elements.",

        "page_content": "## Governance\n\n## Remuneration policy for international executives\n\nEquinor is a broad global energy company, developing oil, gas, wind and solar energy in around 30 countries. The company has high goals related to diversity and inclusion, and diversity at all levels including among top management is crucial in ensuring the long-term sustainable success of the company. From time to time the company will appoint executives employed in international markets with different framework for executive base pay, variable pay and benefits, than what is the case in the Norwegian market. To be able to hire international executives, the company needs to offer competitive compensation in the markets where it operates. The policy of being competitive but not market leading still remains.\n\nIn order to ensure Equinor's competitive position and attract talent in the international market, the board of directors has the mandate to exceed the levels for variable pay and pension terms described in the table above, for remuneration of executive vice presidents hired in the international market and the remuneration level will reflect the at any time prevailing and documented market level for the EVP position. The annual variable pay shall not exceed 50% of base salary at target (100% maximum) and the long-term incentive (LTI) annual grant shall be maximum 70% of base salary. The threshold for variable pay and the company performance modifier as described below will apply. For the international LTI a three years' average company performance modifier will be applied. Pension contribution will be in accordance with the local market, and the 12G cap on pension used in the Norwegian tax favored regime is not applicable for the international executives. Any decision on terms and conditions as described above will be included in the remuneration report subject to review and endorsement by the annual general meeting.\n\n## Duration of contracts with executive vice presidents\n\nDuration of contracts with the executive vice presidents are not limited to a certain period and are valid until the executive resigns from the position or enters into a new position in the company.\n\n## Mobility\n\nTo support the company's need for a mobile workforce also at the senior executive level, the company's standard international assignment framework can be used for candidates employed in a different country than the location of the CEC role. International assignment for a CEC position will normally be limited to a three-year period.\n\n## Localisation and relocation\n\nIf an executive is recruited to Equinor and employed on local terms and conditions different from the executive's country and market, the company may decide to cover reasonable relocation costs including housing and schooling within the international assignment framework for these elements for a period up to two years.\n\n## Threshold for variable pay and company performance modifier\n\nThe threshold and company performance modifier are implemented to strengthen the link between the company's overall financial results and the individual variable pay.\n\n## Threshold\n\nThe threshold is implemented for affordability reasons to ensure that no or reduced variable pay would be granted if the company's financial performance and position is weak and in a critical situation. The financial threshold is applicable for payment of annual variable pay and award of LTI grant.\n\nThe threshold has the following guiding parameters; 1) Cash flows provided by operating activities after tax and before working capital items\n\n2) Net debt ratio and development\n\n3) Company's overall operational and financial performance.\n\n'Green zone'\n\nCash flows provided by operating activities after tax and before working capital items higher than USD 12 billion and a net debt ratio below 30% will normally guide for no reduction of bonus.\n\n## 'Yellow zone'\n\nCash flows provided by operating activities after tax and before working capital items lower than USD 12 billion but higher than USD 8 billion and a net debt ratio between 30% and 45% will normally guide a reduction of bonus but not annulment.\n\n## 'Red zone'\n\nCash flows provided by operating activities after tax and before working capital items lower than USD 8 billion and a net debt ratio above 45% will normally guide no bonus.\n\nApplication of the threshold is subject to a discretionary assessment of the company's overall performance by the board of directors. These measures and targets are indicative and will form part of a broader assessment of bonus award. The conclusion considers both achieved results and how these results are expected to impact the company's medium and longterm development and value creation.\n\n## Company performance modifier\n\nBased on approval by the annual general meeting in 2016, a company performance modifier was introduced and has been applied in the calculation of variable pay.\n\nThe company performance will be assessed against two equally weighted measures: relative total shareholder return (TSR) and relative return on average capital employed (ROACE). TSR and ROACE are currently also applied as performance indicators in the corporate performance management system.\n\nThe results of these two performance measures are compared to our peers and determine Equinor's relative position. A position of Quartile 1 means that Equinor is amongst the top scoring quartile of peer companies. A position of Quartile 4 means that Equinor is in the bottom performing quartile. In years with strong deliveries on relative TSR and ROACE, the matrix will result in the variable pay being modified with a factor higher than one and, correspondingly, lower than one in weak years. The combination of ratings for both measures, will act as a 'multiplier' according to the guideline in the matrix displayed below.",

Application of the modifier is subject to discretionary assessment based on the company's overall performance.\n\nThe company performance modifier will be used in calculations of annual variable pay for members of the corporate executive committee. The modifier will also be applied in other variable pay schemes below the corporate executive level. Further application of the company performance modifier will also be assessed and decided if deemed appropriate.\n\nThe annual variable pay for members of the corporate executive committee employed by Equinor ASA will be within a framework of 45% of base salary, irrespective of the result of the modifier .\n\n## Pension and insurance schemes\n\nMembers of the corporate executive committee in Equinor ASA are covered by the company's general occupational pension scheme which is a defined contribution scheme with a contribution level of 7% below 7,1 G and 22% above 7,1 G. A defined benefit scheme is retained by a grandfathered group of employees. For new members of the corporate executive committee appointed after 13 February 2015, a cap on pension contribution at 12 G is applied. In lieu of pension accrual above 12 G a fixed salary addition of 18% is provided. This element does not form basis of calculation of AVP and LTI. The 12 G cap is based on the Norwegian tax favoured occupational pension schemes and will not be applied to the pension schemes of executives employed outside Norway.\n\nMembers of the corporate executive committee employed in Equinor ASA and appointed before 13 February 2015, maintain their pension contribution above 12 G based on obligations in previously established agreements.\n\nPension terms that historically have been individually agreed with elements outside the framework above will be described in the annual remuneration report.\n\nEquinor ASA has implemented a general cap on pensionable income at 12 G for all new hires into the company employed as of 1 September 2017.\n\nIn addition to the pension benefits outlined above, the executive vice presidents in the parent company are offered disability and dependents' benefits in accordance with Equinor's general pension plan/defined benefit plan. Members of the corporate executive committee are covered by the general insurance schemes applicable within Equinor.\n\n## Severance pay arrangements\n\nThe chief executive officer and the executive vice presidents are entitled to a severance payment equivalent to six months' salary, commencing after the six months' notice period, when the resignation is requested by the company. The same amount of severance payment is also payable if the parties agree that the employment should be discontinued, and the individual gives notice pursuant to a written agreement with the company. Any other payment earned by the individual during the period of severance payment will be fully deducted. This relates to earnings from any employment or business activity where the individual has active ownership.\n\nThe entitlement to severance payment is conditional on the chief executive officer or the executive vice president not being guilty of gross misconduct, gross negligence, disloyalty or other material breach of his/her duties.\n\nThe chief executive officer's/executive vice president's own notice will not instigate any severance payment.\n\n## Release of earned LTI grants and bonus shares at end of employment\n\nIf termination of employment is based on a mutual agreement between the executive and Equinor, the company may decide to release locked in LTI shares and award already earned bonus shares in the share savings scheme at the end of employment.\n\n## Salary and employment conditions of other employees\n\nSalary and employment conditions of employees of the company have been taken into account when establishing the remuneration policy. The remuneration and employment framework for the members of the executive committee are based on the same main principles as applicable for the remuneration frameworks for senior leaders in the company in general.\n\n## Recruitment policy\n\nFrom time to time, Equinor may recruit executives from outside of the organisation. Our principles are designed to attract and retain the right individuals to ensure the successful implementation of our strategy and to safeguard our long-term interests.\n\nIf an individual forfeits remuneration as a result of recruitment to Equinor, the company can compensate partly or fully for the documented financial loss of unvested short and long-term incentive opportunity held by preferred external candidates. Such decision will take into consideration the vehicle, expected value and timing of forfeited awards. Any buy-out will be limited to one year's base salary and normally paid over a period of 24 months.",

The number of oil and gas leakages was 12 in 2021 compared to 11 in 2020. The  number of red incidents is however lower than in 2020. The 2021 CO2 intensity for the  upstream portfolio ended at 7 kg/boe. The low result comparted to the 8 kg /boe in  2020 was impacted by high gas production and high production share and regularity  from low intensity fields.

The proved reserves replacement ratio (RRR) for 2021 is 1.1, mainly  due to large positive revision caused by higher prices and the inclusion of Bacalhau.  The improvement in Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) ended at 4% year on year  which is 2%-points better than the target.

The year has been impacted by the pandemic, but the markets have also shown strong recovery, with high volatility. The ability to capture higher prices have been one area of focus in the board's evaluation of the CEO. Within safety, the Total Serious Incident Frequency (SIF) has improved compared to 2020 and reached the target of 0.4. This is the lowest level in the company's history. The Total Recordable Incident Frequency and number of oil and gas leakages had a negative trend in 2021. This underlines the need for a continued strong focus on safety to improve the performance.\n\nThe CO2 intensity for the upstream portfolio improved compared to 2020 result and ended better than the target set for 2021. Capex was delivered in line with the updated guiding provided to the market. The fixed operating costs ended at similar level as for 2020 and did not reach the targeted improvement. In 2021 some important projects came on stream, but there has been delays for part of the project development portfolio.  The company delivered oil and gas production above the guided level, where a high production efficiency had a strong contribution to the production growth. During the year, the company has taken important steps in the energy transition and the updated strategy was communicated at the capital market day in June. There were positive developments in the reserve replacement ratio for oil and gas, the value of the renewable portfolio and the levelized cost of energy which ended better than target.\n\nThe significant transformation of the organisation and the implementation of the adjustments to the strategic ambitions, to better align with the company's objectives in the energy transition, were visible throughout the year. The internal general employee satisfaction saw a negative trend indicating the importance of increasing internal focus to align the organisation with the change agenda as well as identifying improvement areas.\n\nEquinor was ranked number two in the peer group on relative TSR performance, above the target of being better than average in the peer group. On relative ROACE Equinor ranked second in the peer group which is better than the target set at above average for the peer group.\n\nRef. also Table 4 for details.",

In Equinor performance is measured in two dimensions, where the (\"what\") and the (\"how\") dimensions are equally weighted. Targets for annual variable pay for the members of the corporate executive committee employed by Equinor ASA are 25% of base salary, and the maximum annual variable pay for 2021 was 50% of base salary. For members of the corporate executive committee employed outside the Norwegian market other targets and maximum limit for annual variable pay might apply.\n\nIn addition to performance the company performance modifier and the threshold can affect the final annual variable pay award. The company performance modifier for 2021 ended at a multiplier of 150%. The threshold will not impact the annual variable pay for the performance year 2021.\n\n'What' In terms of the 'what' dimension, the KPIs for the CEO as set by the board of directors for 2021 was also made applicable for the EVPs' Performance assessment. These KPIs are listed in the table right below and referred to as common KPIs in this Table 4.\n\nTable 4 - Performance of corporate executive committee in the reported financial year\n\n| KPI                                                                                                                         | Target                                                    | Performance              |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| \u00b7 Serious Incident Frequency                                                                                                | 0.4 or better                                             | 0.4                      |\n| \u00b7 CO2 intensity for the upstream portfolio                                                                                  | 8.1 kg CO2 per boe or better                              | 7.0 kg CO2 per boe       |\n| \u00b7 Improvement in levelised cost of Energy  (LCoE) for projects which have passed concept  selection and business case (DG2) | 2% improvement during the year compared to  approved plan | 4% improvement delivered |\n| \u00b7 Relative Total Shareholder Return                                                                                         | Better than peer average                                  | First quartile           |\n| \u00b7 Relative ROACE                                                                                                            | Better than peer average                                  | First quartile           |\n| \u00b7 Fixed OPEX and SG&A:                                                                                                      | 5% reduction compared to forecast                         | ~ 0                      |\n\nThe common KPIs, together with the individual performance criteria provided for the respective EVP, form the basis for the assessment of the 'what' dimension. CEO and EVPs responsible for corporate functions are only measured on common KPIs.\n\n'How' - In terms of the 'how' dimension, the behavior goals of the CEO for 2021, as agreed with the board of directors, were made applicable for the EVPs' performance assessment. In addition, the CEO and the EVPs had individual behavior goals reflecting their personal development and respective areas of responsibility. Individual behavior goals are not subject to disclosure.\n\nIn accordance with Equinor performance framework and remuneration policy, performance in relation to behavior goals has formed an equal part to the business performance in the holistic performance assessment.\n\n## Anders Opedal, CEO\n\n## Performance criteria 2021\n\nThe common KPIs for 2021\n\nDemonstrate accountability, visibility, and engagement for safety and compliance\n\nBuild trust in Equinor\n\nTransform the organisation to deliver on our corporate purpose and become a leading company in the energy transition Individual behaviour goals\n\n|                                         | Award outcome AVP %   | Reduction for threshold   | Share of total annual  variable pay   | USD thousand   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Base salary                             | -                     | -                         | -                                     | 1 096          |\n| Performance evaluation                  | 30.00%                | -                         | 66.66                                 | 329            |\n| Company modifier 150%                   | 15.00%                | -                         | 33.33                                 | 164            |\n| Award annual variable pay  USD thousand | 45.00%                | -                         | 100.00                                | 493            |",

Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC 1) and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on whether the remuneration report contains the information required in section 6-16 b of the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act and the accompanying regulation and that the information in the remuneration report is free from material misstatements.

        "page_content": "## 3.13 Information and communications\n\nEquinor's reporting is based on openness and it takes into account the requirement for equal treatment of all participants in the securities market. Equinor has established guidelines for the company's reporting of financial and other information and the purpose of these guidelines is to ensure that timely and correct information about the company is made available to our shareholders and society in general.\n\nA financial calendar and shareholder information is published at www.equinor.com/calendar.\n\nThe investor relations corporate staff function is responsible for coordinating the company's communication with capital markets and for relations between Equinor and existing and potential investors. Investor relations is responsible for distributing and registering information in accordance with the legislation and regulations that apply where Equinor securities are listed. Investor relations reports directly to the chief financial officer.\n\nThe company's management holds regular presentations for investors and analysts. The company's quarterly presentations are broadcast live on our website. Investor relations communicate with present and potential shareholders through presentations, one-to-one meetings, conferences, website, financial media, telephone, mail and e-mail contact. The related reports as well as other relevant information are available at www.equinor.com/investor.\n\nAll information distributed to the company's shareholders is published on the company's website at the same time as it is sent to the shareholders.\n\nDeviations from the Code of Practice: None\n\n## 3.14 Take-overs\n\nThe board of directors endorses the principles concerning equal treatment of all shareholders and Equinor's articles of association do not set limits on share acquisitions. Equinor has no defence mechanisms against take-over bids in its articles of association, nor has it implemented other measures that limit the opportunity to acquire shares in the company. The Norwegian State owns 67% of the shares, and the marketability of these shares is subject to parliamentary decree.\n\nThe board is obliged to act professionally and in accordance with the applicable principles for good corporate governance if a situation should arise in which this principle in the Code of Practice were put to the test.\n\n## Deviations from the Code of Practice:\n\nThe Code of Practice recommends that the board establish guiding principles for how it will act in the event of a take-over bid. The board has not established such guidelines, due to Equinor's ownership structure and for the reasons stated above. In the event of a bid as discussed in section 14 of the Code of Practice, the board of directors will, in addition to complying with relevant legislation and regulations, seek to comply with the recommendations in the Code of Practice. The board has no\n\nother explicit basic principles or written guidelines for procedures to be followed in the event of a take-over bid. The board of directors otherwise concurs with what is stated in the Code of Practice regarding this issue.\n\n## 3.15 External auditor\n\nOur independent registered public accounting firm (external auditor) is independent in relation to Equinor and is appointed by the general meeting of shareholders. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young AS, has been engaged to provide and audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Ernst & Young AS will also issue a report in accordance with law, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including International Standards on Auditing (ISAs), which includes opinions on the Consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements of Equinor ASA. The reports are set out in section 4.1 Consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe external auditor's fee must be approved by the general meeting of shareholders.\n\nPursuant to the instructions for the board's audit committee approved by the board of directors, the audit committee is responsible for ensuring that the company is subject to an independent and effective external and internal audit. Every year, the external auditor presents a plan to the audit committee for the execution of the external auditor's work. The external auditor attends the meeting of the board that deals with the preparation of the annual accounts.\n\nThe external auditor also participates in meetings of the audit committee. The audit committee considers all reports from the external auditor before they are considered by the board. The audit committee meets at least five times a year and both the board and the board's audit committee hold meetings with the internal auditor and the external auditor on a regular basis without the company's management being present.\n\nThe audit committee evaluates and makes a recommendation to the board, the corporate assembly and the general meeting of shareholders regarding the choice of external auditor. The committee is responsible for ensuring that the external auditor meets the requirements in Norway and in the countries where Equinor is listed. The external auditor is subject to the provisions of US securities legislation, which stipulates that a responsible partner may not lead the engagement for more than five consecutive years.\n\nWhen evaluating the external auditor, emphasis is placed on the firm's qualifications, capacity, local and international availability and the auditor's fee.\n\n## The audit committee's policies and procedures for preapproval\n\nIn its instructions for the audit committee, the board has delegated authority to the audit committee to pre-approve assignments to be performed by the external auditor. Within this pre-approval, the audit committee has issued further guidelines. The audit committee has issued guidelines for the management's",

Provided that the types of services proposed are permissible under SEC guidelines and Norwegian Auditors Act requirements, preapproval is usually granted at a regular audit committee meeting. The chair of the audit committee has been authorised to pre-approve services that are in accordance with policies established by the audit committee that specify in detail the types of services that qualify. It is a condition that any services pre-approved in this manner are presented to the full audit committee at its next meeting. Some pre-approvals can therefore be granted by the chair of the audit committee if an urgent reply is deemed necessary.\n\n## Remuneration of the external auditor in 2019 - 2021\n\nIn the annual Consolidated financial statements and in the parent company's financial statements, the independent auditor's remuneration is split between the audit fee and the fee for audit-related, tax and other services. The breakdown between the audit fee and the fee for audit-related, tax and other services is presented to the annual general meeting of shareholders.\n\nThe following table sets out the aggregate fees related to professional services rendered by Equinor's external auditor Ernst & Young AS, for the fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021 and KPMG until 15 May 2019.\n\n## Auditor's remuneration\n\n| (in USD million, excluding VAT)                                  | 2021   |   Full year  2020 |   2019 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------|--------|\n| Audit fee Ernst & Young (principal accountant from 2019)         | 14.4   |              10.7 |    4.7 |\n| Audit fee KPMG (principal accountant 2018)                       |        |               0   |    2.8 |\n| Audit related fee Ernst & Young (principal accountant from 2019) | 1.1    |               1   |    0.5 |\n| Audit related fee KPMG (principal accountant 2018)               |        |               0   |    1.2 |\n| Tax fee Ernst & Young (principal accountant from 2019)           | 0.0    |               0   |    0.2 |\n| Tax fee KPMG (principal accountant 2018)                         |        |               0   |    0   |\n| Other service fee Ernst & Young (principal accountant from 2019) | 0.0    |               0   |    0.9 |\n| Other service fee KPMG (principal accountant 2018)               |        |               0   |    0   |\n| Total remuneration                                               | 15.5   |              11.7 |   10.3 |\n\nAll fees included in the table have been approved by the board's audit committee.\n\nAudit fee is defined as the fee for standard audit work that must be performed every year in order to issue an opinion on Equinor's Consolidated financial statements, on Equinor's internal control over annual reporting and to issue reports on the statutory financial statements. It also includes other audit services, which are services that only the independent auditor can reasonably provide, such as the auditing of non-recurring transactions and the application of new accounting policies, audits of significant and newly implemented system controls and limited reviews of quarterly financial results.\n\nAudit-related fees include other assurance and related services provided by auditors, but not limited to those that can only reasonably be provided by the external auditor who signs\n\nthe audit report, that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the company's financial statements, such as acquisition due diligence, audits of pension and benefit plans, consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards.\n\nTax and Other services fees include services, if any, provided by the auditors within the framework of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, i.e. certain agreed procedures.\n\nIn addition to the figures in the table above, the audit fees and audit-related fees relating to Equinor licences for the years 2021, 2020 and 2019 amounted to USD 0.5 million, USD 0.5 million and USD 0.5 million, respectively.\n\nDeviations from the Code of Practice: None",

Ernst & Young AS (PCAOB ID: 1572) has also issued reports in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) in the US, which include opinions on the Consolidated financial statements of Equinor ASA and on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as at 31 December 2021. Those reports are set out on pages 185 to 188.\n\n## Independent auditor's report\n\nTo the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of Equinor ASA\n\n## Report on the audit of the financial statements\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe have audited the financial statements of Equinor ASA (the Company) which comprise the financial statements of the Company and the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group). The financial statements of the Company comprise the balance sheet as at 31 December 2021 and the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of cash flows and statement of changes in equity for the year then ended and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The consolidated financial statements of the Group comprise the balance sheet as at 31 December 2021, the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of cash flows and statement of changes in equity for the year then ended and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\n## In our opinion\n\n- \u00b7 the financial statements comply with applicable legal requirements,\n- \u00b7 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2021 and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with simplified application of international accounting standards according to section 3-9 of the Norwegian Accounting Act,\n- \u00b7 the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2021 and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU.\n\nOur opinion is consistent with our additional report to the audit committee.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company and the Group in accordance with the requirements of the relevant laws and regulations in Norway and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited non-audit services referred to in the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 5.1 have been provided.\n\nWe have been the auditor of the Company for 3 years from the election by the general meeting of the shareholders on 15 May 2019 for the accounting year 2019.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements for 2021. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

        "page_content": "## Financial statements and supplements\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nWe have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the financial statements.\n\n## Recoverable amounts of production plants and oil and gas assets including assets under development\n\n## Basis for the key audit matter\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group has recognised production plants and oil and gas assets, including assets under development, of USD 45,595 million and USD 12,270 million, respectively, within Property, plant and equipment. Refer to Notes 2 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the related disclosures. As described in Note 2, determining the recoverable amount of an asset involves an estimate of future cash flows, which is dependent upon management's best estimate of the economic conditions that will exist over the asset's useful life. The asset's operational performance and external factors have a significant impact on the estimated future cash flows and therefore, the recoverable amount of the asset.\n\nAuditing management's estimate of the recoverable amount of production plants and oil and gas assets is complex and involves a high degree of judgement. Significant assumptions used in forecasting future cash flows are future commodity prices, currency exchange rates, expected reserves, capital expenditures, and the discount rate.\n\nThese assumptions are forward-looking and can be affected by future economic and market conditions, including matters related to climate change and energy transition. Such climate-related matters have financial impacts which are mainly related to management's estimation of long-term commodity prices, as a result of an expected lower carbon emission scenario in the future and expected CO2 costs.\n\nAdditionally, the treatment of tax in the estimation of the recoverable amount is challenging, as the Group is subject to different tax structures that are inherently complex, particularly in Norway.\n\nWe therefore consider the determination of the recoverable amounts of production plants and oil and gas assets including assets under development, to be a key audit matter given the significance of the accounts on the balance sheet and the complexity and uncertainty of the estimates and assumptions used by management in the cash flow models.\n\n## Our audit response\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Group's process for evaluating the recoverability of production plants and oil and gas assets including assets under development. This included testing controls over management's review of assumptions and inputs to the calculations of impairment and impairment reversals.\n\nOur audit procedures performed over the significant assumptions and inputs included, among others, evaluation of the methods and models used in the calculation of the recoverable amount. We also evaluated the relevant tax effects based on the local legislation of the relevant jurisdictions, particularly in Norway, and tested the clerical accuracy of the models through independently recalculating the value in use. We involved valuation specialists to assist us with these procedures.\n\nIn addition, we compared projected capital expenditures to approved operator budgets or management forecasts and compared expected reserve volumes to internal production forecasts and external evaluations of expected reserves, in accordance with the Group's internal procedures. For those assets previously impaired, we compared actual results to the forecasts used in historical impairment analyses. We also involved reserves specialists to assist us with these procedures.\n\nTo test price assumptions, we evaluated management's methodology to determine future short- and long-term commodity prices and compared such assumptions to external benchmarks, among other procedures. We involved valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the Group's assessment of currency exchange rates and the discount rate, by assessing the Group's methodologies and key assumptions used to calculate the rates and by comparing those rates with external information. We also evaluated management's methodology to factor climate-related matters into their determination of future short- and long-term commodity prices, through assessing management's sensitivity analyses as discussed below.\n\nTo test carbon costs assumptions, with the involvement of climate change and sustainability specialists, we evaluated management's methodology to determine future CO2 tax, including assessing the impact from climaterelated matters, through assessing management's sensitivity analyses as discussed below, and compared management's assumptions with the current legislation in place in the relevant jurisdictions and the jurisdictions' announced pledges regarding escalation of CO2 taxes.\n\nWe evaluated management's sensitivity analyses over its future short- and long-term commodity prices and carbon cost assumptions by taking into consideration, among other sources, the net-zero emission scenario estimated by the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nWe have also evaluated management's disclosures related to the consequences of initiatives to limit climate changes, including the effects of the Group's climate change strategy on the Consolidated Financial Statements and the energy transition's effects on estimation uncertainty, discussed in more detail in Notes 2, 3 and 11.",

        "page_content": "## Estimation of the asset retirement obligation\n\n## Basis for the key audit matter\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group has recognised a provision for decommissioning and removal activities of USD 17,417 million classified within Provisions and other liabilities. Refer to Notes 2 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to the asset retirement obligation (ARO) provision.\n\nAuditing management's estimate of the decommissioning and removal of offshore installations at the end of the production period is complex and involves a high degree of judgement. Determining the provision for such obligation involves application of considerable judgement related to the assumptions used in the estimate, the inherent complexity and uncertainty in estimating future costs, and the limited historical experience against which to benchmark estimates of future costs. Significant assumptions used in the estimate are the discount rates, long-term currency exchange rates and the expected future costs, which includes underlying assumptions such as norms and rates and time required to decommission, which can vary considerably depending on the expected removal complexity. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and can be affected by future economic and market conditions.\n\nWe consider the estimation of the ARO to be a key audit matter given the significance of the related accounts to the financial statements and the complexity and uncertainty of the assumptions used in the estimate.\n\n## Financial statements and supplements\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\n## Our audit response\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Group's process to calculate the present value of the estimated future decommissioning and removal expenditures determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. This includes controls related to management's review of assumptions described above, used in the calculation of the ARO.\n\nTo test management's estimation of the provision for decommissioning and removal activities, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the completeness of the provision by comparing significant additions to property, plant and equipment to management's assessment of new ARO obligations recognized in the period.\n\nTo assess the expected future costs, among other procedures, we compared day rates for rigs, marine operations and heavy lift vessels to external market data or existing contracts. For time required to decommission, we compared the assumptions against historical data on a sample basis. We compared discount rates to external market data. With the support of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the methodology and models used by management to estimate the ARO, assessed the long-term currency exchange rates used in the models and performed a sensitivity analysis on the significant assumptions. In addition, we recalculated the formulas in the models.\n\n## Other information\n\nOther information consists of the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Management (the board of directors and Chief Executive Officer) is responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information, and, in doing so, consider whether the board of directors' report, the statement on corporate governance, the statement on corporate social responsibility and the report on payments to governments contain the information required by applicable legal requirements and whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information or that the information required by applicable legal requirements is not included, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard, and in our opinion, the board of directors' report, the statement on corporate governance, the statement on corporate social responsibility and the report on payments to governments are consistent with the financial statements and contain the information required by applicable legal requirements.\n\n## Responsibilities of management for the financial statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with simplified application of international accounting standards according to section 3-9 of the Norwegian Accounting Act of the Company and of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU of the Group, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.\n\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's and the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the board of directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the audit committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the board of directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.",

Those reports are set out on pages 180 to 184.\n\n## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Equinor ASA\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Equinor ASA and its subsidiaries (Equinor or the Company) as at 31 December 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'Consolidated Financial Statements'). In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2021, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the European Union.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as at 31 December 2021, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated 8 March 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Revision of Segment Reporting\n\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company revised its segment reporting in the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\n## Voluntary Change in Accounting Principle\n\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has elected to change its method of accounting for the discount rate used in calculation of asset retirement obligations, so that this excludes an element covering the Company's own credit risk in the year ended 31 December 2021, which included the disclosure of the 1 January 2020 balance sheet.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Supplemental Information\n\nThe accompanying supplementary oil and gas information has been subjected to audit procedures performed in conjunction with the audits of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Such information is the responsibility of the Company's management. Our audit procedures included determining whether the information reconciles to the financial statements or the underlying accounting and other records, as applicable, and performing procedures to test the completeness and accuracy of the information. In our opinion, the information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole.",

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Recoverable amounts of production plants and oil and gas assets including assets under development\n\nDescription of the Matter\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\nAs  at  31  December  2021,  the  Company  has  recognised  production  plants  and  oil  and  gas  assets, including assets under development, of USD 45,595 million and USD 12,270 million, respectively, within Property, plant and equipment. Refer to Notes 2 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the related disclosures. As described in Note 2, determining the recoverable amount of an asset involves an estimate of future cash flows, which is dependent upon management's best estimate of the economic conditions that will exist over the asset's useful life. The asset's operational performance and external factors have a significant impact on the estimated future cash flows and therefore, the recoverable amount of the asset.\n\nAuditing management's estimate of the recoverable amount of production plants and oil and gas assets is complex and involves a high degree of judgement. Significant assumptions used in forecasting future cash  flows  are  future  commodity  prices,  currency  exchange  rates,  expected  reserves,  capital expenditures, and the discount rate.\n\nThese assumptions are forward-looking and can be affected by future economic and market conditions, including matters related to climate change and energy transition. Such climate-related matters have financial impacts which are mainly related to management's estimation of long-term commodity prices, as a result of an expected lower carbon emission scenario in the future and expected CO2 costs.\n\nAdditionally, the treatment of tax in the estimation of the recoverable amount  is challenging, as the Company is subject to different tax structures that are inherently complex, particularly in Norway.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process for evaluating the recoverability of production plants and oil and gas assets including assets under development. This included testing controls over management's review of assumptions and inputs to the calculations of impairment and impairment reversals.\n\nOur audit procedures performed over the significant assumptions and inputs included, among others, evaluation of the methods and models used in the calculation of the recoverable amount. We also evaluated the relevant tax effects based on the local legislation of the relevant jurisdictions, particularly in Norway, and tested the clerical accuracy of the models through independently recalculating the value in use. We involved valuation specialists to assist us with these procedures. In addition, we compared projected capital expenditures to approved operator budgets or management forecasts and compared expected reserve volumes to internal production forecasts and external evaluations of expected reserves, in accordance with the Company's internal procedures. For those assets previously impaired, we compared actual results to the forecasts used in historical impairment analyses. We also involved reserves specialists to assist us with these procedures.\n\nTo test price assumptions, we evaluated management's methodology to determine future short- and long-term commodity prices and compared such assumptions to external benchmarks, among other procedures. We involved valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the Company's assessment of currency exchange rates and the discount rate, by assessing the Company's methodologies and key assumptions used to calculate the rates and by comparing those rates with external information. We also evaluated management's methodology to factor climate-related matters into their determination of future short- and long-term commodity prices, through assessing management's sensitivity analyses as discussed below.\n\nTo test carbon costs assumptions, with the involvement of climate change and sustainability specialists, we evaluated management's methodology to determine future CO2 tax, including assessing the impact from climate-related matters, through assessing management's sensitivity analyses as discussed below, and compared management's assumptions with the current legislation in place in the relevant jurisdictions and the jurisdictions' announced pledges regarding escalation of CO2 taxes.",

Refer to Notes 2 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to the asset retirement obligation (ARO) provision.\n\nAuditing management's estimate of the decommissioning and removal of offshore installations at the end of the production period is complex and involves a high degree of judgement. Determining the provision for such obligation involves application of considerable judgement related to the assumptions used in the estimate, the inherent complexity and uncertainty in estimating future costs, and the limited historical experience against which to benchmark estimates of future costs. Significant assumptions used in the estimate are the discount rates, long-term currency exchange rates and the expected future costs, which includes underlying assumptions such as norms and rates and time required to decommission, which  can  vary  considerably  depending  on  the  expected  removal  complexity.  These  significant assumptions are forward-looking and can be affected by future economic and market conditions.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process to calculate the present value of the estimated future decommissioning and removal expenditures determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. This includes controls related to management's review of assumptions described above, used in the calculation of the ARO.\n\nTo test management's estimation of the provision for decommissioning and removal activities, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the completeness of the provision by comparing significant additions to property, plant and equipment to management's assessment of new ARO obligations recognized in the period.\n\nTo assess the expected future costs, among other procedures, we compared day rates for rigs, marine operations and heavy lift vessels to external market data or existing contracts. For time required to decommission, we compared the assumptions against historical data on a sample basis. We compared discount rates to external market data. With the support of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the methodology and models used by management to estimate the ARO, assessed the long-term currency exchange rates used in the models and performed a sensitivity analysis on the significant assumptions. In addition, we recalculated the formulas in the models.\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young AS\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2019.\n\nStavanger, Norway 8 March 2022",

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as at 31 December 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company, and our report dated 8 March 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting as set out in section 3.10 Risk management and internal control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young AS Stavanger, Norway 8 March 2022",

The address of its registered office is Forusbeen 50, N-4035 Stavanger, Norway.\n\nEquinor ASA's shares are listed on the Oslo B\u00f8rs (OSL, Norway) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE, USA).\n\nThe Equinor group's business consists principally of the exploration, production, transportation, refining and marketing of petroleum and petroleum-derived products and other forms of energy.\n\nAll the Equinor group's oil and gas activities and net assets on the Norwegian continental shelf are owned by Equinor Energy AS, a 100% owned operating subsidiary. Equinor Energy AS is co-obligor or guarantor of certain debt obligations of Equinor ASA.\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements of Equinor for the full year 2021 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the board of directors on 8 March 2022.\n\n## 2 Significant accounting policies\n\n## Statement of compliance\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements of Equinor ASA and its subsidiaries (Equinor) have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and with IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), effective at 31 December 2021.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis with some exceptions, as detailed in the accounting policies set out below. The policies described in this note are, unless otherwise noted, in effect at the balance sheet date. These policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Consolidated financial statements, except as otherwise noted in disclosure related to the impact of policy changes following the adoption of new accounting standards and voluntary changes in 2021. Certain amounts in the comparable years have been restated or reclassified to conform to current year presentation. The subtotals and totals in some of the tables in the notes may not equal the sum of the amounts shown in the primary financial statements due to rounding.\n\nOperating related expenses in the Consolidated statement of income are presented as a combination of function and nature in conformity with industry practice. Purchases [net of inventory variation] and Depreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses are presented in separate lines based on their nature, while Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses as well as Exploration expenses are presented on a functional basis. Significant expenses such as salaries, pensions, etc. are presented by their nature in the notes to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Changes in significant accounting policies in the current period\n\n## Interest rate benchmark reform - amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16\n\nFollowing the decision taken by global regulators to replace Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs) with alternative nearly risk-free rates (RFRs), IASB released two publications addressing issues affecting financial reporting in the period before the replacement of an existing interest rate benchmark with an RFR (phase one), and issues that affect financial reporting when an existing interest rate benchmark is replaced with an RFR (phase two), typically modifications to contracts as a result of the reform. The amendments provide specific guidance on how to treat financial assets and financial liabilities where the basis for determining the contractual cash flows changes as a result of the interest rate benchmark reform. As a practical expedient, the amendments require an entity to change the basis for determining the contractual cash flows prospectively by revising the effective interest rate. Had the expedient not existed, the financial instrument should be derecognised by such a contractual change, or, if the modification was insubstantial, the carrying value of the financial instrument recalculated and the adjustment recognised as a profit/loss.\n\nThe phase one amendments were effective from 1 January 2020 and the phase two amendments were effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021. Equinor has applied the amendments at the effective dates.\n\nFor Equinor, the transition is relevant for issued bonds with floating interest rates, terms of conditions for bank accounts, project financing, legal contracts and joint venture cash calls as well as for derivatives. In collaboration with our counterparties, Equinor is in the process of replacing contracts which include references to IBORs with new contracts with references to RFRs. Currently, the IBOR reform mainly implies an administrative burden and no material financial impact from the reform is expected. Equinor's risk management strategy has not changed to a significant degree following the IBOR reform.",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements and supplements\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\n## Other standards, amendments to standards and interpretations of standards, effective as of 1 January 2021\n\nOther standard amendments or interpretations of standards effective as of 1 January 2021 and adopted by Equinor, were not material to Equinor's Consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\n\n## Voluntary change in significant accounting policy related to discount rate for Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) calculation\n\nWith effect from 1 October 2021, Equinor changed its discount rate used in calculation of the ARO so that it no longer includes an element covering Equinor's own credit risk. This voluntary accounting policy change is made because the credit element's exclusion from the discount rate in estimating the ARO liability is deemed to better represent the risks specific to the ARO liability. The change affects the amounts of ARO liabilities and the ARO elements of property, plant and equipment materially, and prior periods' balance sheet amounts in this respect have been restated, see further details in Note 21. The policy change will impact future depreciation expenses as well as potential asset impairments or impairment reversals. The impact on relevant lines in the income statement and on equity upon implementation of the voluntary policy change are immaterial. Prior period income statements and statements of changes in equity have not been restated.\n\n## Other standards, amendments to standards and interpretations of standards, issued but not yet effective\n\n## Amendment to IAS 1 and Materiality practice statement 2: Replacing 'Significant accounting policies' with 'Material accounting policies'\n\nIASB has issued an amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements and the IFRS Practice Statement 2 'Making Materiality Judgement'. These amendments are intended to help entities provide more useful accounting policy disclosures by replacing the term 'Significant' with the term 'Material' and by providing additional guidance as to what is considered a 'material accounting policy'. When implementing the amendment, even though some additions to the disclosures may be introduced to present an even more Equinorspecific accounting policy note, the note is expected to be somewhat reduced in scope, disclosing only those accounting policies that are deemed needed to understand other material information in the financial statements of Equinor.\n\nThe amendments become effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, but earlier application is permitted. Equinor expects to apply the amendments from the effective date.\n\nOther standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations of standards, issued but not yet effective, are either not expected to materially impact Equinor's Consolidated financial statements, or are not expected to be relevant to Equinor's Consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\n\n## Key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated financial statements requires that management makes estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates are prepared based on tailormade models, while the assumptions on which the estimates are based rely on historical experience, external sources of information and various other factors that management assesses to be reasonable under the current conditions and circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities when these are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis considering the current and expected future set of conditions.\n\nEquinor is exposed to a number of underlying economic factors which affect the overall results, such as liquids prices, natural gas prices, refining margins, foreign currency exchange rates, market risk premiums and interest rates as well as financial instruments with fair values derived from changes in these factors. In addition, Equinor's results are influenced by the level of production, which in the short term may be influenced by, for instance, maintenance programmes. In the long-term, the results are impacted by the success of exploration, field development and operating activities.\n\nThe most important matters in understanding the key sources of estimation uncertainty that are involved in preparing these Consolidated financial statements are disclosed in the following under each paragraph, where relevant.",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements and supplements\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\n## Estimation uncertainty from initiatives to limit climate changes and the energy transition\n\nThe effects of the initiatives to limit climate changes and the potential impact of the energy transition are relevant to some of the economic assumptions in our estimations of future cash flow. The results the development of such initiatives may have in the future, and the degree Equinor's operations will be affected by them, are sources of uncertainty. Estimating global energy demand and commodity prices towards 2050 is a challenging task, assessing the future development in supply and demand, technology change, taxation, tax on emissions, production limits and other important factors. The assumptions may change which could materialise in different outcomes from the current projected scenarios. This could result in significant changes to accounting estimates, such as economic useful life (affects depreciation period and timing of asset retirement obligations) and value-in-use calculations (affects impairment assessments). See note 3 Consequences of initiatives to limit climate changes for more details.\n\n## Statement of cash flows\n\nIn the statement of cash flows, operating activities are presented using the indirect method, where Income/(loss) before tax is adjusted for changes in inventories and operating receivables and payables, the effects of non -cash items such as depreciations, amortisations and impairments, provisions, unrealised gains and losses and undistributed profits from associates and items of income or expense for which the cash effects are investing or financing cash flows. Increase/decrease in financial investments, Increase/decrease in derivative financial instruments and Increase/decrease in other interest-bearing items are all presented net as part of Investing activities, either because the transactions are financial investments and turnover is quick, the amounts are large, and the maturities are short, or due to materiality.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Equinor ASA and its subsidiaries and include Equinor's interest in jointly controlled and equity accounted investments.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nEntities are determined to be controlled by Equinor, and consolidated in Equinor's financial statements, when Equinor has power over the entity, ability to use that power to affect the entity's returns, and exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity.\n\nAll intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits and losses arising from Equinor's internal transactions, have been eliminated.\n\nNon-controlling interests are presented separately within equity in the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\nWhen partially divesting subsidiaries which do not constitute a business, and the investment is reclassified to an associate or a jointly controlled investment, Equinor only recognises the gain or loss on the divested part.\n\n## Accounting judgement regarding partial divestments\n\nThe policy regarding partial divestments of subsidiaries requires judgement to be applied on a case-by-case basis and has had a substantial impact on the accounting for the divestment of Equinor's non-operated interests in the Empire Wind and Beacon Wind assets, which took effect in 2021 and are further described in Note 5 Acquisitions and Disposals. Equinor reflected on the requirements and scope of IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, as well as the substance of the transactions. In evaluating the standards' requirements, Equinor acknowledged pending considerations related to several relevant and similar issues which have been postponed by the IASB in anticipation of concurrent consideration at a later date and considered the facts and substance of the transactions in question as well as Equinor's subsequent involvement.  Since assets were transferred into separate legal entities only at the time when 50% of the entities' shares were sold to a third party, thereby resulting in Equinor's loss of control of those asset-owning subsidiaries, and simultaneously established investments in joint ventures, Equinor concluded to only recognise the gain on the divested part.\n\n## Joint operations and similar arrangements, joint ventures and associates\n\nA joint arrangement is present where Equinor holds a long-term interest which is jointly controlled by Equinor and one or more other partners under a contractual arrangement in which decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Such joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures.\n\nThe parties to a joint operation have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, relating to their respective share of the joint arrangement. In determining whether the terms of contractual arrangements and other facts and circumstances lead to a classification as joint operations, Equinor considers the nature of products and markets of the arrangements and whether the substance of their agreements is that the parties involved have rights to substantially all the arrangement's assets. Equinor accounts for its share of assets,",

A considerable number of Equinor's unincorporated joint exploration and production activities are conducted through arrangements that are not jointly controlled, either because unanimous consent is not required among all parties involved, or no single group of parties has joint control over the activity. Licence activities where control can be achieved through agreement between more than one combination of involved parties are considered to be outside the scope of IFRS 11, and these activities are accounted for on a pro-rata basis using Equinor's ownership share. Currently there are no significant differences in Equinor's accounting for unincorporated licence arrangements whether in scope of IFRS 11 or not.\n\nJoint ventures, in which Equinor has rights to the net assets, are accounted for using the equity method. These currently include the majority of Equinor's investments in the Renewables (REN) operating and reporting segment.\n\nEquinor's participation in joint arrangements that are joint ventures and investments in companies in which Equinor has neither control nor joint control but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are classified as equity accounted investments. Under the equity method, the investment is carried on the Consolidated balance sheet at cost plus postacquisition changes in Equinor's share of net assets of the entity, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of the investment. The part of an equity accounted investment's dividend distribution exceeding the entity's carrying amount in the Consolidated balance sheet is reflected as income from equity accounted investments in the Consolidated statement of income. Equinor will subsequently only reflect the share of net profit in the investment that exceeds the dividend already reflected as income. Goodwill may arise as the surplus of the cost of investment over Equinor's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the joint venture or associate. Such goodwill is recorded within the corresponding investment. The Consolidated statement of income reflects Equinor's share of the results after tax of an equity accounted entity, adjusted to account for depreciation, amortisation and any impairment of the equity accounted entity's assets based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. Net income/loss from equity accounted investments is presented as part of Total revenues and other income, as investments in and participation with significant influence in other companies engaged in energy-related business activities is considered to be part of Equinor's main operating activities. Where material differences in accounting policies arise, adjustments to the financial statements of equity accounted entities are made in order to bring the accounting policies applied in line with Equinor's. Material unrealised gains on transactions between Equinor and its equity accounted entities are eliminated to the extent of Equinor's interest in each equity accounted entity. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Equinor assesses investments in equity accounted entities for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\n## Equinor as operator of joint operations and similar arrangements\n\nIndirect operating expenses such as personnel expenses are accumulated in cost pools. These costs are allocated on an hours' incurred basis to business areas and Equinor operated joint operations under IFRS 11 and to similar arrangements (licences) outside the scope of IFRS 11. Costs allocated to the other partners' share of operated joint operations and similar arrangements reduce the costs in the Consolidated statement of income. Only Equinor's share of the statement of income and balance sheet items related to Equinoroperated joint operations and similar arrangements are reflected in the Consolidated statement of income and the Consolidated balance sheet. The accounting for lease contracts in joint operations or similar arrangements depends on whether or not Equinor or all partners equally have the primary responsibility for the lease payments and is described in further detail in the paragraph Leases below.\n\n## Reporting segments\n\nEquinor identifies its operating segments (business areas) on the basis of those components of Equinor that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, Equinor's corporate executive committee (CEC). Equinor combines business areas when these satisfy relevant aggregation criteria.\n\nEquinor's accounting policies as described in this note also apply to the specific financial information included in reporting segmentsrelated disclosure in these Consolidated financial statements, with an exception for leases. Note 4 Segments includes further information about lease accounting in the reporting segments.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nIn preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in foreign currencies (those other than functional currency) are translated at the foreign exchange rate at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Consolidated statement of income as foreign exchange gains or losses within Net financial items. Foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of estimate-based provisions, however, generally are accounted for as part of the change in the underlying estimate and as such may be included within the relevant operating expense or income tax sections of the Consolidated statement of income depending on the nature of the provision. Non-monetary assets that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transactions. Loans from",

Foreign exchange differences arising on such loans are recognised in Other comprehensive income (OCI) in the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Presentation currency\n\nFor the purpose of preparing the Consolidated financial statements, the statement of income, the balance sheet and the cash flows of each entity are translated from the functional currency into the presentation currency, USD. The assets and liabilities of entities whose functional currencies are other than USD, are translated into USD at the foreign exchange rate at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of such entities are translated using the foreign exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation from functional currency to presentation currency are recognised separately in OCI. The cumulative amount of such translation differences relating to an entity and previously recognised in OCI, is reclassified to the Consolidated statement of income and reflected as a part of the gain or loss on disposal of that entity.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nBusiness combinations, except for transactions between entities under common control, are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquired identifiable tangible and intangible assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at their fair values at the date of the acquisition. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed under Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Accounting judgement regarding acquisitions\n\nDetermining whether an acquisition meets the definition of a business combination requires judgement to be applied on a caseby-case basis. Acquisitions are assessed under the relevant IFRS criteria to establish whether the transaction represents a business combination or an asset purchase, and the conclusion may materially affect the financial statements both in the transaction period and in terms of future periods' operating income. Similar assessments are performed upon the acquisition of interests in a joint operation to determine whether the activity in the joint operation constitutes a business, and whether the principles of business acquisition accounting therefore should be applied. The concentration test in IFRS 3 provide some clarification to the definition of a business, but do not diminish the fact that critical judgements apply when deciding on whether a transaction is a business combination. Depending on the specific facts, acquisitions of exploration and evaluation licences for which a development decision has not yet been made, have largely been concluded to represent asset purchases.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nEquinor presents Revenue from contracts with customers and Other revenue as a single caption, Revenues, in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised upon satisfaction of the performance obligations for the transfer of goods and services in each such contract. The revenue amounts that are recognised reflect the consideration to which Equinor expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. Revenue from the sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and other merchandise is recognised when a customer obtains control of those products, which normally is when title passes at point of delivery, based on the contractual terms of the agreements. Each such sale normally represents a single performance obligation. In the case of natural gas, sales are completed over time in line with the delivery of the actual physical quantities.\n\nSales and purchases of physical commodities are presented on a gross basis as Revenues from contracts with customers and Purchases [net of inventory variation] respectively in the Consolidated statement of income. When the contracts are deemed financial instruments or part of Equinor's trading activities, they are settled and presented on a net basis. Sales of Equinor's own produced oil and gas volumes are always reflected gross as Revenue from contracts with customers.\n\nRevenues from the production of oil and gas in which Equinor shares an interest with other companies are recognised on the basis of volumes lifted and sold to customers during the period (the sales method). Where Equinor has lifted and sold more than the ownership interest, an accrual is recognised for the cost of the overlift. Where Equinor has lifted and sold less than the ownership interest, costs are deferred for the underlift.\n\nRevenue is presented net of customs, excise taxes and royalties paid in-kind on petroleum products.\n\n## Other revenue\n\nItems representing a form of revenue, or which are closely connected with revenue from contracts with customers, are presented as Other revenue if they do not qualify as revenue from contracts with customers. These other revenue items include taxes paid in-kind under certain production sharing agreements (PSAs) and the net impact of commodity trading and commodity-based derivative instruments connected with sales contracts or revenue-related risk management.\n\nTransactions with the Norwegian State",

The Norwegian State's participation in petroleum activities is organised through the SDFI. All purchases and sales of the SDFI's oil production are classified as purchases [net of inventory variation] and revenues from contracts with customers, respectively.\n\nEquinor sells, in its own name, but for the Norwegian State's account and risk, the State's production of natural gas. These gas sales and related expenditures refunded by the Norwegian State are presented net in the Consolidated financial statements. Natural gas sales made in the name of Equinor subsidiaries are also presented net of the SDFI's share in the Consolidated statement of income, but this activity is reflected gross in the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Accounting judgement related to transactions with the Norwegian State\n\nWhether to account for the transactions gross or net involves the use of significant accounting judgement. In making the judgement, Equinor has considered whether it controls the State originated crude oil volumes prior to onwards sales to third party customers. Equinor directs the use of the volumes, and although certain benefits from the sales subsequently flow to the State, Equinor purchases the crude oil volumes from the State and obtains substantially all the remaining benefits. On that basis, Equinor has concluded that it acts as principal in these sales.\n\nRegarding gas sales, Equinor concluded that ownership of the gas had not been transferred from the SDFI to Equinor. Although Equinor has been granted the ability to direct the use of the volumes, all the benefits from the sales of these volumes flow to the State. On that basis, Equinor is not considered the principal in the sale of the SDFI's natural gas volumes.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nWages, salaries, bonuses, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by employees of Equinor.\n\n## Research and development\n\nEquinor undertakes research and development both on a funded basis for licence holders and on an unfunded basis for projects at its own risk. Equinor's own share of the licence holders' funding and the total costs of the unfunded projects are considered for capitalisation under the applicable IFRS requirements. Subsequent to initial recognition, any capitalised development costs are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.\n\n## Levies, emission allowances and other government takes\n\nCO2 free quotas received under the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) are reflected evenly over the accounting year. Additional quotas purchased are reflected at cost in Operating expenses as incurred in line with emissions. Accruals for CO2 quotas required to cover emissions to date are valued at market price and reflected as a current liability within Trade, other payables and provisions. Quotas owned, but exceeding the emissions incurred to date, are carried in the balance sheet at cost price, classified as Other current receivables, as long as such purchased quotas are acquired in order to cover own emissions and may be kept to cover subsequent years' emissions.\n\nObligations resulting from current year emissions and the corresponding amounts for quotas that have been bought, paid and expensed, but which have not yet been surrendered to the relevant authorities, are reflected net in the balance sheet.\n\n## Estimation uncertainty regarding levies\n\nEquinor's global business activities are subject to different indirect taxes in various jurisdictions around the world. In these jurisdictions, governments can respond to global or local development, including climate related matters and public fiscal balances, by issuing new laws or other regulations stipulating changes in value added tax, tax on emissions, customs duties or other levies which may affect profitability and even the viability of Equinor's business in that jurisdiction. Equinor mitigates this risk by using local legal representatives and staying up to date with the legislation in the jurisdictions where activities are carried out. Occasionally, legal disputes arise from difference in interpretations. Equinor's legal department, together with local legal representatives, estimate the outcome from such legal disputes based on first-hand knowledge. Such estimates may differ from the actual results. We refer to note 24 Other commitments, contingent liabilities and contingent assets for a presentation of contingent liabilities arising from such legal proceedings.\n\n## Income tax\n\nIncome tax in the Consolidated statement of income comprises current and deferred tax expense. Income tax is recognised in the Consolidated statement of income except when it relates to items recognised in OCI.",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements and supplements\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCurrent tax consists of the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment to tax payable for previous years. Uncertain tax positions and potential tax exposures are analysed individually, and as tax disputes are mostly binary in nature, the most likely amount for probable liabilities to be paid (unpaid potential tax exposure amounts, including penalties) and for assets to be received (disputed tax positions for which payment has already been made) in each case is recognised within Current tax or Deferred tax as appropriate. Interest income and interest expenses relating to tax issues are estimated and recognised in the period in which they are earned or incurred and are presented within Net financial items in the Consolidated statement of income. Uplift benefit on the NCS is recognised when the deduction is included in the current year tax return and impacts taxes payable.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and on unused tax losses and credits carried forward, subject to the initial recognition exemption. The amount of deferred tax is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the asset can be utilised. In order for a deferred tax asset to be recognised based on future taxable income, convincing evidence is required, taking into account the existence of contracts, production of oil or gas in the near future based on volumes of proved reserves, observable prices in active markets, expected volatility of trading profits, expected foreign currency rate movements and similar facts and circumstances.\n\nWhen an asset retirement obligation or a lease contract is initially reflected in the accounts, a deferred tax liability and a corresponding deferred tax asset are recognised simultaneously and accounted for in line with other deferred tax items. The applied policy is in line with an amendment to IAS 12, reducing the scope of the initial recognition exemption, which is effective from 1 January 2023.\n\n## Estimation uncertainty regarding income tax\n\nEvery year Equinor incurs significant amounts of income taxes payable to various jurisdictions around the world and may recognise significant changes to deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. There may be uncertainties related to interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations regarding amounts in Equinor's tax returns, which are filed in a considerable number of tax regimes. For cases of uncertain tax treatments, it may take several years to complete the discussions with relevant tax authorities or to reach resolutions of the appropriate tax positions through litigation.\n\nThe carrying values of income tax related assets and liabilities are based on Equinor's interpretations of applicable laws, regulations and relevant court decisions. The quality of these estimates, including the most likely outcomes of uncertain tax treatments, is highly dependent upon proper application of at times very complex sets of rules, the recognition of changes in applicable rules and, in the case of deferred tax assets, management's ability to project future earnings from activities that may apply loss carry forward positions against future income taxes.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has increased the uncertainty in determining key business assumptions used to assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets through sufficient future taxable income before tax losses expire. Climate-related matters and the transition to carbon-neutral energy-consumption globally could also influence Equinor's future taxable profits, and ability to utilise tax losses carried forward and the recognition of deferred tax assets in certain tax jurisdictions.\n\n## Oil and gas exploration, evaluation and development expenditures\n\nEquinor uses the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration costs. Expenditures to acquire mineral interests in oil and gas properties and to drill and equip exploratory wells are capitalised as exploration and evaluation expenditures within intangible assets until the well is complete and the results have been evaluated, or there is any other indicator of a potential impairment. Exploration wells that discover potentially economic quantities of oil and natural gas remain capitalised as intangible assets during the evaluation phase of the discovery. This evaluation is normally finalised within one year after well completion. If, following the evaluation, the exploratory well has not found potentially commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, the previously capitalised costs are evaluated for derecognition or tested for impairment. Geological and geophysical costs and other exploration and evaluation expenditures are expensed as incurred.\n\nCapitalised exploration and evaluation expenditures, including expenditures to acquire mineral interests in oil and gas properties related to offshore wells that find proved reserves, are transferred from Exploration expenditures and Acquisition costs - oil and gas prospects (Intangible assets) to Property, plant and equipment at the time of sanctioning of the development project. The timing from evaluation of a discovery until a project is sanctioned could take several years depending on the location and maturity, including existing infrastructure, of the area of discovery, whether a host government agreement is in place, the complexity of the project and the financial robustness of the project. For onshore wells where no sanction is required, the transfer from Exploration expenditures and Acquisition cost - oil and gas prospects (Intangible assets) to Property, plant and equipment occurs at the time when a well is ready for production.\n\nFor exploration and evaluation asset acquisitions (farm-in arrangements) in which Equinor has made arrangements to fund a portion of the selling partner's exploration and/or future development expenditures (carried interests), these expenditures are reflected in the Consolidated financial statements as and when the exploration and development work progresses. Equinor reflects exploration and evaluation asset dispositions (farm-out arrangements) on a historical cost basis with no gain or loss recognition.",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements and supplements\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nA gain related to a post-tax-based disposition of assets on the NCS includes the release of tax liabilities previously computed and recognised related to the assets in question. The resulting after-tax gain is recognised in full in Other income in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\nConsideration from the sale of an undeveloped part of an onshore asset reduces the carrying amount of the asset. The part of the consideration that exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, if any, is reflected in the Consolidated statement of income under Other income.\n\nEven exchanges (swaps) of exploration and evaluation assets with only immaterial cash considerations are accounted for at the carrying amounts of the assets given up with no gain or loss recognition.\n\n## Accounting judgement and estimation uncertainty regarding exploration activities\n\nEquinor capitalises the costs of drilling exploratory wells pending determination of whether the wells have found proved oil and gas reserves. Equinor also capitalises leasehold acquisition costs and signature bonuses paid to obtain access to undeveloped oil and gas acreage. Judgements as to whether these expenditures should remain capitalised, be de-recognised or written down in the period may materially affect the carrying values of these assets and consequently, the operating income for the period.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is reflected at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation, the initial estimate of an asset retirement obligation, if any, exploration costs transferred from intangible assets and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs. Proceeds from production ahead of a project's final approval are regarded as 'early production' and is recognised as revenue rather than as a reduction of acquisition cost. Contingent consideration included in the acquisition of an asset or group of similar assets is initially measured at its fair value, with later changes in fair value other than due to the passage of time reflected in the book value of the asset or group of assets, unless the asset is impaired. Property, plant and equipment include costs relating to expenditures incurred under the terms of PSAs in certain countries, and which qualify for recognition as assets of Equinor. State-owned entities in the respective countries, however, normally hold the legal title to such PSA-based property, plant and equipment.\n\nExchanges of assets are measured at fair value, primarily of the asset given up, unless the fair value of neither the asset received, nor the asset given up is measurable with sufficient reliability.\n\nExpenditure on major maintenance refits or repairs comprises the cost of replacement assets or parts of assets, inspection costs and overhaul costs. Where an asset or part of an asset is replaced and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to Equinor, the expenditure is capitalised. Inspection and overhaul costs, associated with regularly scheduled major maintenance programmes planned and carried out at recurring intervals exceeding one year, are capitalised and amortised over the period to the next scheduled inspection and overhaul. All other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nCapitalised exploration and evaluation expenditures, development expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines and the drilling of production wells, and field-dedicated transport systems for oil and gas are capitalised as Producing oil and gas properties within Property, plant and equipment. Such capitalised costs, when designed for significantly larger volumes than the reserves from already developed and producing wells, are depreciated using the unit of production method based on proved reserves expected to be recovered from the area during the concession or contract period. Depreciation of production wells uses the unit of production method based on proved developed reserves, and capitalised acquisition costs of proved properties are depreciated using the unit of production method based on total proved reserves. In the rare circumstances where the use of proved reserves fails to provide an appropriate basis reflecting the pattern in which the asset's future economic benefits are expected to be consumed, a more appropriate reserve estimate is used. Depreciation of other assets and transport systems used by several fields is calculated on the basis of their estimated useful lives, normally using the straight-line method. Each part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item is depreciated separately. For exploration and production assets, Equinor has established separate depreciation categories which as a minimum distinguish between platforms, pipelines and wells.\n\nThe estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis, and changes in useful lives are accounted for prospectively. An item of property, plant and equipment is de-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in Other income or Operating expenses, respectively, in the period the item is derecognised.\n\nMonetary or non-monetary grants from governments, when related to property, plant and equipment and considered reasonably certain, are recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet as a deduction to the carrying value of the asset and subsequently recognised in the Consolidated statement of income over the life of the depreciable asset as a reduced depreciation expense.",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements and supplements\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\n## Estimation uncertainty regarding determining oil and gas reserves\n\nReserves estimates are complex and based on a high degree of professional judgement involving geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production, historical recovery and processing yield factors and installed plant operating capacity. Recoverable oil and gas quantities are always uncertain. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and availability of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. Reserves quantities are, by definition, discovered, remaining, recoverable and economic.\n\n## Estimation uncertainty; Proved oil and gas reserves\n\nProved oil and gas reserves may impact the carrying amounts of oil and gas producing assets, as changes in the proved reserves, for instance as a result of changes in prices, will impact the unit of production rates used for depreciation and amortisation. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, estimates of proved reserves only reflect the period before the contracts providing the right to operate expire. For future development projects, proved reserves estimates are included only where there is a significant commitment to project funding and execution and when relevant governmental and regulatory approvals have been secured or are reasonably certain to be secured.\n\nProved reserves are divided into proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves. Proved developed reserves are to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods, or where the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Proved undeveloped reserves are to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major capital expenditure is required for recompletion. Undrilled well locations can be classified as having proved undeveloped reserves if a development plan is in place indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time horizon. Specific circumstances are for instance fields which have large up-front investments in offshore infrastructure, such as many fields on the NCS, where drilling of wells is scheduled to continue for much longer than five years. For unconventional reservoirs where continued drilling of new wells is a major part of the investments, such as the US onshore assets, the proved reserves are always limited to proved well locations scheduled to be drilled within five years.\n\nProved oil and gas reserves have been estimated by internal qualified professionals on the basis of industry standards and are governed by the oil and gas rules and disclosure requirements in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations S-K and S-X, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) requirements for supplemental oil and gas disclosures. The estimates have been based on a 12-month average product price and on existing economic conditions and operating methods as required, and recovery of the estimated quantities have a high degree of certainty (at least a 90% probability). An independent third party has evaluated Equinor's proved reserves estimates, and the results of this evaluation do not differ materially from Equinor's estimates.\n\n## Estimation uncertainty; Expected oil and gas reserves\n\nChanges in the expected oil and gas reserves, for instance as a result of changes in prices, may materially impact the amounts of asset retirement obligations, as a consequence of timing of the removal activities. It may also impact value-in-use calculations for oil and gas assets, possibly also affecting impairment testing and the recognition of deferred tax assets. Expected oil and gas reserves are the estimated remaining, commercially recoverable quantities, based on Equinor's judgement of future economic conditions, from projects in operation or decided for development. Recoverable oil and gas quantities are always uncertain. As per Equinor's internal guidelines, expected reserves are defined as the 'forward looking mean reserves' when based on a stochastic prediction approach. In some cases, a deterministic prediction method is used, in which case the expected reserves are the deterministic base case or best estimate. Expected reserves are therefore typically larger than proved reserves as defined by the SEC, which are high confidence estimates with at least a 90% probability of recovery when a probabilistic approach is used. Expected oil and gas reserves have been estimated by internal qualified professionals on the basis of industry standards and classified in accordance with the Norwegian resource classification system issued by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate.",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements and supplements\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\n## Assets classified as held for sale\n\nNon-current assets are classified separately as held for sale in the Consolidated balance sheet when their carrying amount will be recovered through a sales transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is met only when the sale is highly probable, which is when the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition, and management is committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification. Liabilities directly associated with the assets classified as held for sale and expected to be included as part of the sale transaction, are correspondingly also classified separately. Once classified as held for sale, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not subject to depreciation or amortisation. The net assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## Leases\n\nA lease is defined as a contract that conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. As a lessee, each contract that meets the definition of a lease is recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet. At the date at which the underlying asset is made available for Equinor, the present value of future lease payments is recognised as a lease liability. A corresponding right-of-use (RoU) asset is recognised, including also lease payments and direct costs incurred at or before the commencement date. Future lease payments are reflected as interest expense and a reduction of lease liabilities. The RoU assets are depreciated over the shorter of each contract's term and the assets' useful life.\n\nThe present value of fixed lease payments (or variable lease payments, if the payment depends on an index or a rate) is calculated using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or if that rate cannot be readily determined, Equinor's incremental borrowing rate, for the noncancellable period Equinor has the right to use the underlying asset. Extension options are included in the lease term if they are considered reasonably certain to be exercised.\n\nShort term leases (12 months or less) and leases of low value assets are not reflected in the Consolidated balance sheet but are expensed or (if appropriate) capitalised as incurred, depending on the activity in which the leased asset is used.\n\nMany of Equinor's lease contracts, such as rig and vessel leases, involve several additional services and components, including personnel cost, maintenance, drilling related activities, and other items. For a number of these contracts, the additional services represent a not inconsiderable portion of the total contract value. Non-lease components within lease contracts are accounted for separately for all underlying classes of assets and reflected in the relevant expense category or (if appropriate) capitalised as incurred, depending on the activity involved.\n\nWhere all partners in a licence are considered to share the primary responsibility for lease payments under a contract, the related lease liability and RoU asset will be recognised net by Equinor, on the basis of Equinor's participation interest in the licence. When Equinor is considered to have the primary responsibility for the full external lease payments, the lease liability is recognised gross (100%). Equinor derecognises a portion of the RoU asset equal to the non-operator's interests in the lease, and replace it with a corresponding financial lease receivable, if a financial sublease is considered to exist between Equinor and the licence. A financial sublease will typically exist where Equinor enters into a contract in its own name, has the primary responsibility for the external lease payments, the underlying asset will only be used on one specific licence, and the costs and risks related to the use of the asset are carried by that specific licence.\n\n## Accounting judgement regarding leases\n\nIn the oil and gas industry, where activity frequently is carried out through joint arrangements or similar arrangements, the application of IFRS 16 requires evaluations of whether the joint arrangement or its operator is the lessee in each lease agreement and consequently whether such contracts should be reflected gross (100%) in the operator's financial statements, or according to each joint operation partner's proportionate share of the lease.\n\nIn many cases where an operator is the sole signatory to a lease contract of an asset to be used in the activities of a specific joint operation, the operator does so implicitly or explicitly on behalf of the joint arrangement. In certain jurisdictions, and importantly for Equinor as this includes the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS), the concessions granted by the authorities establish both a right and an obligation for the operator to enter into necessary agreements in the name of the joint operations (licences).\n\nAs is the customary norm in upstream activities operated through joint arrangements, the operator will manage the lease, pay the lessor, and subsequently re-bill the partners for their share of the lease costs. In each such instance, it is necessary to determine whether the operator is the sole lessee in the external lease arrangement, and if so, whether the billings to partners may represent sub-leases, or whether it is in fact the joint arrangement which is the lessee, with each participant accounting for its proportionate share of the lease. Depending on facts and circumstances in each case, the conclusions reached may vary between contracts and legal jurisdictions.",

Intangible assets include acquisition cost for oil and gas prospects, expenditures on the exploration for and evaluation of oil and natural gas resources, goodwill and other intangible assets.\n\nIntangible assets relating to expenditures on the exploration for and evaluation of oil and natural gas resources are not amortised. When the decision to develop a particular area is made, its intangible exploration and evaluation assets are reclassified to Property, plant and equipment.\n\nGoodwill is initially measured at the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for any noncontrolling interest over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at the acquisition date. Goodwill acquired is allocated to each cash generating unit (CGU), or group of units, expected to benefit from the combination's synergies. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. In acquisitions made on a post-tax basis according to the rules on the NCS, a provision for deferred tax is reflected in the accounts based on the difference between the acquisition cost and the transferred tax depreciation basis. The offsetting entry to such deferred tax amounts is reflected as goodwill, which is allocated to the CGU or group of CGUs on whose tax depreciation basis the deferred tax has been computed.\n\nOther intangible assets with a finite useful life, are depreciated over their useful life using the straight-line method.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are initially recognised at fair value when Equinor becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the asset. For additional information on fair value methods, refer to the Measurement of fair values section below. The subsequent measurement of the financial assets depends on which category they have been classified into at inception.\n\nAt initial recognition, Equinor classifies its financial assets into the following three categories: Financial investments at amortised cost, at fair value through profit or loss, and at fair value through other comprehensive income based on an evaluation of the contractual terms and the business model applied. Certain long-term investments in other entities, which do not qualify for the equity method or consolidation, are included as at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, current balances with banks and similar institutions, and short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in fair value and have a maturity of three months or less from the acquisition date. Short-term highly liquid investments with original maturity exceeding 3 months are classified as current financial investments. Contractually mandatory deposits in escrow bank accounts are included as restricted cash if the deposits are provided as part of the Group's operating activities and therefore is deemed as held for the purpose of meeting short -term cash commitments, and the deposits can be released from the escrow account without undue expenses. Cash and cash equivalents and current financial investment are accounted for at amortised cost or at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nTrade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less a provision for doubtful receivables which represent expected losses computed on a probability-weighted basis.\n\nEquinor's financial asset impairment losses are measured and recognised based on expected losses.\n\nA part of Equinor's financial investments is managed together as an investment portfolio of Equinor's captive insurance company and is held in order to comply with specific regulations for capital retention. The investment portfolio is managed and evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with an investment strategy and is accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nFinancial assets are presented as current if they contractually will expire or otherwise are expected to be recovered within 12 months after the balance sheet date, or if they are held for the purpose of being traded. Financial assets and financial liabilities are shown separately in the Consolidated balance sheet, unless Equinor has both a legal right and a demonstrable intention to net settle certain balances payable to and receivable from the same counterparty, in which case they are shown net in the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\nFinancial assets are de-recognised when rights to cash flows and risks and rewards of ownership are transferred through a sales transaction or the contractual rights to the cash flows expire, are redeemed, or cancelled. Gains and losses arising on the sale, settlement or cancellation of financial assets are recognised either in interest income and other financial items or in interest and other finance expenses within Net financial items.\n\n## Inventories\n\nCommodity inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined by the first-in first-out method and comprises direct purchase costs, cost of production, transportation and manufacturing expenses. Inventories of drilling and spare parts are reflected according to the weighted average method.",

Assets are grouped into cash generating units (CGUs) which are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other groups of assets. Normally, separate CGUs are individual oil and gas fields or plants. Each unconventional asset play is considered a single CGU when no cash inflows from parts of the play can be reliably identified as being largely independent of the cash inflows from other parts of the play. In impairment evaluations, the carrying amounts of CGUs are determined on a basis consistent with that of the recoverable amount. In Equinor's line of business, judgement is involved in determining what constitutes a CGU. Development in production, infrastructure solutions, markets, product pricing, management actions and other factors may over time lead to changes in CGUs such as the disaggregation of one original CGU into several.\n\nIn assessing whether a write-down of the carrying amount of a potentially impaired asset is required, the asset's carrying amount is compared to the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less cost of disposal or its value in use. Fair value less cost of disposal is determined based on comparable recent arm's length market transactions or based on Equinor's estimate of the price that would be received for the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants. Such fair value estimates are mainly based on discounted cash flow models, using assumed market participants' assumptions, but may also reflect market multiples observed from comparable market transactions or independent third-party valuations. Value in use is determined using a discounted cash flow model. The estimated future cash flows applied in establishing value in use are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and represent management's best estimates of the range of economic conditions that will exist over the remaining useful life of the assets, as set down in Equinor's most recently approved long-term forecasts. Assumptions and economic conditions in establishing the long-term forecasts are reviewed by management on a regular basis and updated at least annually. See note 11 Property, plant and equipment for a presentation of the most recently updated commodity price assumptions. For assets and CGUs with an expected useful life or timeline for production of expected oil and natural gas reserves extending beyond five years, including planned onshore production from shale assets with a long development and production horizon, the forecasts reflect expected production volumes, and the related cash flows include project or asset specific estimates reflecting the relevant period. Such estimates are established based on Equinor's principles and assumptions and are consistently applied.\n\nIn performing a value-in-use-based impairment test, the estimated future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the asset and discounted using a real post-tax discount rate which is based on Equinor's post-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Country risk specific to a project is included as a monetary adjustment to the projects' cash flow. Equinor regards country risk primarily as an unsystematic risk. The cash flow is adjusted for risk that influence the expected cash flow of a project and which is not part of the project itself. The use of post-tax discount rates in determining value in use does not result in a materially different determination of the need for, or the amount of, impairment that would be required if pre-tax discount rates had been used.\n\nUnproved oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of the asset or CGU to which the unproved properties belong may exceed its recoverable amount, and at least once a year. Exploratory wells that have found reserves, but where classification of those reserves as proved depends on whether major capital expenditure can be justified or where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends on the successful completion of further exploration work, will remain capitalised during the evaluation phase for the exploratory finds. Thereafter it will be considered a trigger for impairment evaluation of the well if no development decision is planned for in the near future and there are no firm plans for future drilling in the licence.\n\nAn assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer be relevant or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.\n\nImpairment losses and reversals of impairment losses are presented in the Consolidated statement of income as Exploration expenses or Depreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses, on the basis of their nature as either exploration assets (intangible exploration assets) or development and producing assets (property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets), respectively.\n\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the CGU, or group of units, to which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the CGU, or group of units, is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. When impairment testing goodwill originally recognised as an offsetting item to the computed deferred tax provision in a post-tax transaction on the NCS, the remaining amount of the deferred tax provision will factor into the impairment evaluations. Once recognised, impairments of goodwill are not reversed in future periods.",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements and supplements\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\n## Estimation uncertainty regarding impairment\n\nChanges in the circumstances or expectations of future performance of an individual asset may be an indicator that the asset is impaired, requiring its carrying amount to be written down to its recoverable amount. Impairments are reversed if conditions for impairment are no longer present. Evaluating whether an asset is impaired or if an impairment should be reversed requires a high degree of judgement and may to a large extent depend upon the selection of key assumptions about the future.\n\nThe key assumptions used will bear the risk of change based on the inherent volatile nature of macro-economic factors such as future commodity prices or discount rate and uncertainty in asset specific factors such as reserve estimates and operational decisions impacting the production profile or activity levels for our oil and natural gas properties. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates will also affect value-in-use, especially for NCS-assets, where the functional currency is NOK. When estimating the recoverable amount, the expected cash flow approach is applied to reflect uncertainties in timing and amounts inherent in the assumptions used in the estimated future cash flows, including climate-related matters affecting those assumptions. For example, climate-related matters (see also Note 3 Consequences of initiatives to limit climate changes) are expected to have a pervasive effect on the energy industry, affecting not only supply, demand and commodity prices, but also technology-changes, increased emission-related levies and other matters with mainly mid-term and long-term effects. These effects have been factored into the price assumptions used for estimating future cash flows using probability-weighted scenario analyses.\n\nUnproved oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of the relevant asset or CGU may exceed its recoverable amount, and at least annually. If, following evaluation, an exploratory well has not found proved reserves, the previously capitalised costs are tested for impairment. Subsequent to the initial evaluation phase for a well, it will be considered a trigger for impairment testing of a well if no development decision is planned for the near future and there is no firm plan for future drilling in the licence. Impairment of unsuccessful wells is reversed, as applicable, to the extent that conditions for impairment are no longer present.\n\nWhere recoverable amounts are based on estimated future cash flows, reflecting Equinor's, market participants' and other external sources' assumptions about the future and discounted to their present value, the estimates involve complexity. Impairment testing requires long-term assumptions to be made concerning a number of economic factors such as future market prices, refinery margins, foreign currency exchange rates and future output, discount rates, impact of the timing of tax incentive regulations, and political and country risk among others, in order to establish relevant future cash flows. Long-term assumptions for major economic factors are made at a group level, and there is a high degree of reasoned judgement involved in establishing these assumptions, in determining other relevant factors such as forward price curves, in estimating production outputs and in determining the ultimate terminal value of an asset.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value when Equinor becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the liability. The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on which category they have been classified into. The categories applicable for Equinor are either financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or financial liabilities measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The latter applies to Equinor's non-current bank loans and bonds.\n\nFinancial liabilities are presented as current if the liability is expected to be settled as part of Equinor's normal operating cycle, the liability is due to be settled within 12 months after the balance sheet date, Equinor does not have the right to defer settlement of the liability more than 12 months after the balance sheet date, or if the liabilities are held for the purpose of being traded. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual obligations are settled, or if they expire, are discharged or cancelled. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognised either in Interest income and other financial items or in Interest and other finance expenses within Net financial items.\n\n## Share buy-backs\n\nWhere Equinor has either acquired own shares under a share buy-back programme or has placed an irrevocable order with a third party for Equinor shares to be acquired in the market, such shares are reflected as a reduction in equity as treasury shares. The remaining outstanding part of an irrevocable order to acquire shares is accrued for and classified as Trade, other payables and provisions.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nEquinor uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value through profit and loss. The impact of commodity-based derivative financial instruments is recognised in the Consolidated statement of income under Other revenues, as such derivative instruments are related to sales contracts or revenue-related risk management for all significant purposes. The impact of other derivative financial instruments is reflected under Net financial items.",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements and supplements\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nDerivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. Derivative assets or liabilities expected to be recovered, or with the legal right to be settled more than 12 months after the balance sheet date, are classified as non-current. Derivative financial instruments held for the purpose of being traded are however always classified as current.\n\nContracts to buy or sell a non-financial item that can be settled net in cash or another financial instrument, or by exchanging financial instruments, as if the contracts were financial instruments, are accounted for as financial instruments. However, contracts that are entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with Equinor's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements, also referred to as own-use, are not accounted for as financial instruments. Such sales and purchases of physical commodity volumes are reflected in the Consolidated statement of income as Revenue from contracts with customers and Purchases [net of inventory variation], respectively. This is applicable to a significant number of contracts for the purchase or sale of crude oil and natural gas, which are recognised upon delivery.\n\nFor contracts to sell a non-financial item that can be settled net in cash, but which ultimately are physically settled despite not qualifying as own use prior to settlement, the changes in fair value prior to settlement is included in gain/(loss) on commodity derivatives. The resulting impact upon physical settlement is shown separately and included in Other revenues. Actual physical deliveries made by Equinor through such contracts are included in Revenue from contracts with customers at contract price.\n\nDerivatives embedded in host contracts which are not financial assets within the scope of IFRS 9 are recognised as separate derivatives and are reflected at fair value with subsequent changes through profit and loss, when their risks and economic characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts, and the host contracts are not carried at fair value. Where there is an active market for a commodity or other non-financial item referenced in a purchase or sale contract, a pricing formula will, for instance, be considered to be closely related to the host purchase or sales contract if the price formula is based on the active market in question. A price formula with indexation to other markets or products will however result in the recognition of a separate derivative. Where there is no active market for the commodity or other non-financial item in question, Equinor assesses the characteristics of such a price related embedded derivative to be closely related to the host contract if the price formula is based on relevant indexations commonly used by other market participants. This applies to certain long-term natural gas sales agreements.\n\n## Pension liabilities\n\nEquinor has pension plans for employees that either provide a defined pension benefit upon retirement or a pension dependent on defined contributions and related returns. A portion of the contributions are provided for as notional contributions, for which the liability increases with a promised notional return, set equal to the actual return of assets invested through the ordinary defined contribution plan. For defined benefit plans, the benefit to be received by employees generally depends on many factors including length of service, retirement date and future salary levels.\n\nEquinor's proportionate share of multi-employer defined benefit plans is recognised as liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet to the extent that sufficient information is available, and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.\n\nEquinor's net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their services in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date, reflecting the maturity dates approximating the terms of Equinor's obligations. The discount rate for the main part of the pension obligations has been established on the basis of Norwegian mortgage covered bonds, which are considered high quality corporate bonds. The cost of pension benefit plans is expensed over the period that the employees render services and become eligible to receive benefits. The calculation is performed by an external actuary.\n\nThe net interest related to defined benefit plans is calculated by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation and opening present value of the plan assets, adjusted for material changes during the year. The resulting net interest element is presented in the Consolidated statement of income within Net financial items. The difference between estimated interest income and actual return is recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\n\nPast service cost is recognised when a plan amendment (the introduction or withdrawal of, or changes to, a defined benefit plan) or curtailment (a significant reduction by the entity in the number of employees covered by a plan) occurs, or when recognising related restructuring costs or termination benefits. The obligation and related plan assets are re-measured using current actuarial assumptions, and the gain or loss is recognised in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\nActuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur, while actuarial gains and losses related to provision for termination benefits are recognised in the Consolidated statement of income in the period in which they occur. Due to the parent company Equinor ASA's functional currency being USD, the significant part of Equinor's pension obligations will be payable in a foreign currency (i.e. NOK). As a consequence, actuarial gains and losses related to the parent company's pension obligations include the impact of exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nContributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the Consolidated statement of income in the period in which the contribution amounts are earned by the employees.",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements and supplements\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nNotional contribution plans, reported in the parent company Equinor ASA, are recognised as Pension liabilities with the actual value of the notional contributions and promised return at reporting date. Notional contributions are recognised in the Consolidated statement of income as periodic pension cost, while changes in fair value of notional assets are reflected in the Consolidated statement of income under Net financial items.\n\nPeriodic pension cost is accumulated in cost pools and allocated to business areas and Equinor operated joint operations (licences) on an hours' incurred basis and recognised in the statement of income based on the function of the cost.\n\n## Onerous contracts\n\nEquinor recognises as provisions the net obligation under contracts defined as onerous. Contracts are deemed to be onerous if the unavoidable cost of meeting the obligations under the contract exceeds the economic benefits expected to be received in relation to the contract. The provision for onerous contracts comprises the costs that relate directly to the contract, both incremental costs and an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling the contracts. A contract which forms an integral part of the operations of a CGU whose assets are dedicated to that contract, and for which the economic benefits cannot be reliably separated from those of the CGU, is included in impairment considerations for the applicable CGU.\n\n## Asset retirement obligations (ARO)\n\nProvisions for ARO costs are recognised when Equinor has an obligation (legal or constructive) to dismantle and remove a facility or an item of property, plant and equipment and to restore the site on which it is located, and when a reliable estimate of that liability can be made. The amount recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditures determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. The cost is estimated based on current regulations and technology, considering relevant risks and uncertainties. The discount rate used in the calculation of the ARO is a risk-free rate based on the applicable currency and time horizon of the underlying cash flows. To better represent the risks specific to the ARO liability, and as described in a previous paragraph regarding changes in accounting policies, Equinor no longer includes a credit premium reflecting Equinor's own credit risk. Normally an obligation arises for a new facility, such as an oil and natural gas production or transportation facility, upon construction or installation. An obligation may also arise during the period of operation of a facility through a change in legislation or through a decision to terminate operations or be based on commitments associated with Equinor's ongoing use of pipeline transport systems where removal obligations rest with the volume shippers. The provisions are classified under Provisions in the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\nWhen a provision for ARO cost is recognised, a corresponding amount is recognised to increase the related property, plant and equipment and is subsequently depreciated as part of the costs of the facility or item of property, plant and equipment. Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the corresponding property, plant and equipment. When a decrease in the ARO provision related to a producing asset exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the excess is recognised as a reduction of Depreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses in the Consolidated statement of income. When an asset has reached the end of its useful life, all subsequent changes to the ARO provision are recognised as they occur in Operating expenses in the Consolidated statement of income. Removal provisions associated with Equinor's role as shipper of volumes through third party transport systems are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Estimation uncertainty regarding asset retirement obligations\n\nEstablishing the appropriate estimates for such obligations are based on historical knowledge combined with knowledge of ongoing technological developments and involve the application of judgement and involve an inherent risk of significant adjustments. The costs of decommissioning and removal activities require revisions due to changes in current regulations and technology while considering relevant risks and uncertainties. Most of the removal activities are many years into the future, and the removal technology and costs are constantly changing. The speed of the transition to new renewable energy may also influence the timing of the production period, hence the timing of the removal activities. The estimates include assumptions of norms, rates and time required which can vary considerably depending on the assumed removal complexity. Moreover, changes in the discount rate and foreign currency exchange rates may impact the estimates significantly. As a result, the initial recognition of the liability and the capitalised cost associated with decommissioning and removal obligations, and the subsequent adjustment of these balance sheet items, involve the application of significant judgement.\n\n## Measurement of fair values\n\nQuoted prices in active markets represent the best evidence of fair value and are used by Equinor in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities to the extent possible. Financial instruments quoted in active markets will typically include financial instruments with quoted market prices obtained from the relevant exchanges or clearing houses. The fair values of quoted financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative instruments are determined by reference to mid-market prices, at the close of business on the balance sheet date.\n\nWhere there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. These include using recent arm's-length market transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, and pricing models and related internal assumptions. In the valuation techniques, Equinor also takes into consideration the counterparty and its own credit risk.",

Consequently, where Equinor reflects elements of long-term physical delivery commodity contracts at fair value, such fair value estimates to the extent possible are based on quoted forward prices in the market and underlying indexes in the contracts, as well as assumptions of forward prices and margins where observable market prices are not available. Similarly, the fair values of interest and currency swaps are estimated based on relevant quotes from active markets, quotes of comparable instruments, and other appropriate valuation techniques.\n\n## Estimation uncertainty regarding the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nDuring 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic slowed economic growth and had dramatic consequences for energy demand, particularly mobility fuels, resulting in a collapse in commodity prices in the first half of 2020. Commodity prices rebounded through the second half of 2020 and have since the first quarter of 2021 surpassed pre-pandemic levels. When setting Equinor's estimates for global supply, demand and commodity prices, management factored in the effects of global roll-out of vaccines during 2021 and 2022. Virus mutation is still causing new waves of lockdown and other restrictions, but the Omicron variant seems less dangerous, letting governments ease restrictions as former variants are being outcompeted. Even though we expect to see the end of the pandemic in the near future, there is always inherent uncertainties and a risk of new virus flareups for as long as the virus is allowed to mutate. The outlook is still somewhat uncertain and dominated by downside risks such as virus infection flare-ups, and we expect that continued global vaccination and the scope of monetary and fiscal governmental stimuli will still affect the economy in the short term. As such, the full resulting operational and economic impact for Equinor from the pandemic cannot be fully ascertained at this time.\n\nApart from the financial impact, Equinor has only experienced immaterial effects on production from assets in operation, due to actions taken to maintain and secure safe production during the pandemic. Minor virus outbreaks at some of our facilities have occurred, but effective measures such as isolation and quarantines combined with social distancing and increased sanitation requirements have prevented production shutdown, and operations have not been significantly impacted.\n\nFor projects under development, the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted progress due to personnel limitations on offshore and onshore facilities / yards due to infection control measures and associated travel restrictions for migrant workforce. The situation is to a certain degree still unpredictable and may have additional consequences for the progress and costs of our projects.\n\n## 3 Consequences of initiatives to limit climate changes\n\n## Equinor's ambitions and our strategy\n\nClimate change and reaching the goals set out in the Paris Agreement represent fundamental challenges to society. As outlined in the COP26 Glasgow Climate Pact, achieving the most ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement now requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions. This includes reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 45% by 2030 relative to 2010 levels, and to net zero around mid-century. Equinor's ambition is to be a leading company in the energy transition and to become a netzero company by 2050, including emissions from production through to final energy consumption. Equinor's strategy is to create value as a leader in the energy transition by pursuing high-value growth in renewables and new markets opportunities in low carbon solutions at the same time as it optimises its oil and gas portfolio.\n\n## Assessment of risks arising from climate change and the energy transition\n\nClimate changes and a transition to a lower carbon economy will affect Equinor's business and entails a broad range of different risk factors. Equinor's climate roadmap and all of our climate-related ambitions are a response to these challenges and risks related to climate change.\n\n- \u00b7 Market and technology risks. A transition to a low carbon economy contributes to uncertainty over future demand and prices for oil and gas. Increased demand for and improved cost competitiveness of renewable energy, and innovation and technology changes supporting the further development and use of renewable energy and low-carbon technologies, represent both threats and opportunities for Equinor.\n- \u00b7 Physical risks. Changes in physical climate parameters could impact Equinor through increased costs or incidents affecting Equinor's operations. Examples of physical parameters that could impact Equinor's facility design and operations include acute effects like increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, and chronic effects like rising sea level, changes in sea currents and reduced water availability. Unexpected changes in meteorological parameters, such as average wind speed, can also affect renewable power generation outputs, resulting in performance above or below expectations.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory risk. Equinor expects, and is preparing for, regulatory changes and policy measures targeted at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, such as changes in carbon costs and taxes, emission standards or energy subsidy policies.

Increased concern over climate change could lead to increased expectations on fossil fuel producers, as well as a more negative perception of the oil and gas industry. This could lead to increased litigation-related costs and poor reputation could affect Equinor's license to operate as well as the ability to attract and retain talent and key competences.\n- \u00b7 Risk of diminished access to financing. Strong competition for assets may lead to diminishing returns within the renewable and low carbon industries and hamper the transition into a broader energy company. Competitive auctions/tenders where prices don't allow absorption of higher costs may increase the exposure to inflation risk. This is also relevant for assets where the costs and income have been locked in before the final investment decision. There is also a risk of increased cost of capital for fossil fuel producers. Certain lenders have recently indicated that they will direct or restrict their lending activities based on environmental parameters.\n\n## Effects on estimation uncertainty\n\nThe effects of the initiatives to limit climate changes and the potential impact of the energy transition are relevant to some of the economic assumptions in our estimations of future cash flows. The results of the development of such initiatives, and the degree to which Equinor's operations will be affected by them, are sources of uncertainty. Estimating global energy demand and commodity prices towards 2050 is a challenging task, as this comprises assessing the future development in supply and demand, technology change, taxation, tax on emissions, production limits and other important factors. The assumptions may change, which could materialise in different outcomes from the current projected scenarios. This could result in significant changes to accounting estimates, such as economic useful life (affects depreciation period and timing of asset retirement obligations) and value-in-use calculations (affects impairment assessments).\n\nEquinor's commodity price assumptions applied in value-in-use impairment testing, are set in accordance with accounting regulations and based on management's best estimate of the development of relevant current circumstances and the likely future development of such circumstances. This price-set is currently not equal to a price-set required to achieve the goals in the Paris Agreement as described in the WEO Sustainability Development Scenario, or the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. A future change in the trajectory of how the world acts with regards to implementing actions in accordance with the goals in the Paris agreement could, depending on the detailed characteristics of such a trajectory, have a negative impact on the valuation of Equinor's property, plant and equipment in total. A calculation of a possible effect of using the prices (including CO2 prices) in a 1.5 o C compatible Net Zero Emission by 2050 Scenario as estimated by the International Energy Agency (IEA) could result in an impairment of around USD 7 billion before tax. This illustrative impairment sensitivity is based on a simplified model and limitations further described in note 11 Property, plant & equipment.\n\n## CO2-related cost\n\nEquinor expects greenhouse gas emission costs to increase from current levels and to have a wider geographical range than today. A global tax on CO2 emissions will have a negative impact on the valuation of Equinor's oil and gas assets, but this risk is mitigated by Equinor's internal carbon price applied to all potential new projects and investments, currently set at 58 USD/tonne and increasing towards 100 USD/tonne by the year 2030 and stays flat thereafter. As such, climate considerations are a part of the investment decisions following Equinor's strategy and commitments to the energy transition.\n\nClimate considerations are included in the impairment calculations directly by estimating the CO2 taxes in the cash flows. Indirectly, the expected effect of climate change is also included in the estimated commodity prices where supply and demand are considered. The CO2 prices also have effect on the estimated production profiles and economic cut-off of the projects.\n\nImpairment calculations are based on best estimate assumptions. To reflect that carbon will have a cost for all our assets, the current best estimate is considered to be EU ETS for countries outside EU where carbon is not already subject to taxation or where Equinor has not established specific estimates. The EU ETS price has increased significantly from 56 EUR/tonne in 2020 and is expected to remain high, in the region of 80 EUR/tonne for the next couple of years. Then the price is expected to be 65 EUR/tonne (27.5 EUR/tonne) in 2030 and thereafter increasing to 100 EUR/tonne (41 EUR/tonne) in 2050 (assumptions used in 2020 in brackets). Norway's Climate Action Plan for the period 2021-2030 (Meld. St 13 (2020-2021)) which assumes a gradually increased CO2 tax (the total of EU ETS + Norwegian CO2 tax) in Norway to 2,000 NOK/tonne in 2030 is used for impairment calculations of Norwegian upstream assets.\n\nTotal expensed CO2 cost related to emissions and purchase of CO2 quotas for the companies Equinor ASA and Equinor Energy AS related to activities on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (Equinor's share of the operating licences) and land-based operating facilities in Norway owned by Equinor amounts to USD 428 million in 2021, and USD 268 million in 2020.\n\n## Upstream oil & gas (stranded assets)\n\nThe transition to renewable energy, technological development and reduction in global demand for carbon-based energy, may have a negative impact on the future profitability of investments in upstream oil and gas assets, in particular assets with long estimated useful lives, projects in an early development phase and undeveloped assets controlled by Equinor. Equinor seeks to mitigate this risk by focusing on improving the resilience of the existing upstream portfolio, maximising the efficiency of our infrastructure on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and optimising our high-quality international portfolio. Equinor will also continue to selectively explore for new resources with a focus on mature areas that can make use of existing infrastructure to minimise emissions and maximise value. During the",

Equinor's plans to become a net-zero company by 2050 have not resulted in the identification of additional assets being triggered for impairment or earlier cessation of production as of year-end 2021.\n\nAny future exploration may be restricted by regulations, market and strategic considerations. Provided that the economic assumptions would deteriorate to such an extent that undeveloped assets controlled by Equinor should not materialize, assets at risk mainly comprise the intangible assets Oil and Gas prospects, signature bonuses and the capitalised exploration costs, with a total carrying value of USD 4.6 billion. See note 12 Intangible assets for more information regarding Equinor's intangible assets.\n\n## Timing of Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO)\n\nIf the business cases of Equinor's oil and gas producing assets should change materially from governmental initiatives to limit climate change, this could affect the timing of our asset retirement obligations. A shorter production period, accelerating the time for when assets need to be removed after ended production, will increase the carrying value of the liability. The effect of performing removal five years earlier than currently scheduled, is estimated to increase the liability by USD 0.2 billion. See note 21 Provisions and other liabilities for more information regarding Equinor's ARO.\n\n## 4 Segments\n\nAs from 1 June 2021 Equinor's operations are managed through the following operating segments (business areas): Exploration & Production Norway (EPN), Exploration & Production International (EPI), Exploration & Production USA (EPUSA), Marketing, Midstream & Processing (MMP), Renewables (REN), Projects, Drilling and Procurement (PDP) and Technology, Digital & Innovation (TDI) and Corporate staff and functions.\n\nThe main change in the organisational corporate structure compared to previous periods is that the operating segment Development & Production Brazil is merged into the operating segment Exploration & Production International. In addition, the operating segment Exploration is divided and merged into Exploration & Production Norway, Exploration & Production International and Exploration & Production USA. Global Strategy & Business development is divided and merged into the functions for Chief Financial Officer and Safety, Security and Sustainability. The operating segment Technology, Projects & Drilling is split into Technology, Digital & Innovation and Projects, Drilling & Procurement. The new organisational corporate structure has not resulted in any changes in the reportable segments.\n\nThe Exploration & Production business areas are responsible for the discovery and appraisal of new resources and commercial development of the oil and gas portfolios within their respective geographical areas: EPN on the Norwegian continental shelf, EPUSA in USA and EPI worldwide outside of EPN and EPUSA.\n\nThe PDP is responsible for field development, well deliveries and procurement in Equinor.\n\nTDI brings together research, technology development, specialist advisory services, digitalisation, IT, improvement, innovation, ventures and future business to one technology powerhouse.\n\nThe MMP business area is responsible for marketing and trading of oil and gas commodities (crude, condensate, gas liquids, products, natural gas and liquified natural gas), electricity and emission rights, as well as transportation, processing and manufacturing of the above-mentioned commodities, operations of refineries, terminals and processing - and power plants and low carbon solutions including carbon capture and storage which was previously the responsibility of the REN business area.\n\nThe REN business area is responsible for wind parks and other renewable energy solutions.\n\nThe reporting segments Exploration & Production Norway (E&P Norway), Exploration & Production International (E&P International), Exploration & Production USA (E&P USA), Marketing, Midstream & Processing (MMP) and Renewables (REN) consist of the business areas EPN, EPI, EPUSA, MMP and REN respectively. The operating segments, PDP, TDI and corporate staffs and functions are aggregated into the reporting segment 'Other' due to the immateriality of these operating segments. Most of the costs within the operating segments PDP and TDI are allocated to the E&P Norway, E&P International, E&P USA, MMP and REN reporting segments.\n\nThe changes do not have a material effect on comparable figures.\n\nAs from the first quarter of 2021, Equinor changed its reporting as REN became a separate reporting segment. Previously the activities in REN were reported in the segment 'Other'. The new reporting structure has been applied retrospectively with comparable figures reclassified. The change has its basis in the increased strategic importance of the renewable business for Equinor and that the information is regarded useful for the readers of the financial statements.\n\nInter-segment sales and related unrealised profits, mainly from the sale of crude oil and products, are eliminated in the Eliminations column below. Inter-segment revenues are based upon estimated market prices.",

The measurement basis of segment profit is net operating income/(loss). In the tables below, deferred tax assets, pension assets and non-current financial assets are not allocated to the segments.\n\nThe measurement basis for segments is IFRS as applied by the group with the exception of IFRS 16 Leases and the line item Additions to property, plant and equipment (PP&E), intangibles and equity accounted investments. All IFRS 16 leases are presented within the Other segment. The lease costs for the period are allocated to the different segments based on underlying lease payments, with a corresponding credit in the Other segment. Lease costs allocated to licence partners are recognised as other revenue in the Other segment. Additions to PP&E, intangible assets and equity accounted investments in the E&P and MMP segments include the period's allocated lease costs related to activity being capitalised with a corresponding negative addition in the Other segment. The line item Additions to property, plant and equipment (PP&E), intangibles and equity accounted investments excludes movements related to changes in asset retirement obligations.\n\n| Full year 2021

Eni has also closed an agreement to purchase a 10% interest in Dogger Bank C from project partner SSE Renewables on the same terms. The new overall shareholding in Dogger Bank C is SSE Renewables (40%), Equinor (40%) and Eni (20%). The asset was classified as held for sale at 31 December 2021. The carrying amount of the interests to be disposed of is immaterial and is reported in the REN segment. The gain will be reported in the REN segment in the first quarter 2022.\n\n## Equinor Refining Denmark A/S\n\nOn 31 December 2021, Equinor Danmark A/S closed the transaction with the Klesch Group to sell 100% of the shares in Equinor Refining Denmark A/S (ERD). Klesch paid USD 48 million of the total estimated consideration at closing. ERD consists of the Kalundborg refinery and associated terminals and infrastructure. Following an impairment earlier in 2021, the disposal resulted in an immaterial loss. Prior to transaction closing, Equinor received USD 335 million in extraordinary dividend and repayment of paid-in capital from ERD. Following the disposal, a gain of USD 167 million has been recycled from Other comprehensive income (OCI) to the Consolidated statement of income in the line item Other income and has been reflected in the MMP segment.\n\n## Terra Nova\n\nOn 8 September 2021, Equinor closed the transaction with Cenovus and Murphy to sell 100% of its interest, which includes a release of any future obligations and liabilities, in the Terra Nova asset in offshore Canada. The transaction is accounted for in the E&P International segment. The consideration paid, the net carrying amount and the impact to the Consolidated statement of income are immaterial.\n\n## Bakken onshore unconventional field\n\nOn 26 April 2021, Equinor closed the transaction to divest its interests in the Bakken field in the US states of North Dakota and Montana to Grayson Mill Energy, backed by EnCap Investments for an estimated total consideration of USD 819 million, including interim period settlement, for which payment has been received in the first half of 2021. Post-closing settlement adjustments are ongoing, and the consideration will be final in early 2022. The asset was impaired in the first quarter of 2021. During the subsequent three quarters of 2021 insignificant losses were recorded and are presented in the line item Operating expenses in the Consolidated statement of income in the E&P USA segment.\n\n## 10% of Dogger Bank Farm A and B\n\nOn 26 February 2021, Equinor closed the transaction with Eni to sell a 10% equity interest in the Dogger Bank Wind Farm A and B assets in the UK for a total consideration of GBP 206.4 million (USD 285 million), resulting in a gain of GBP 202.8 million (USD 280 million). After closing, the new overall shareholdings in Dogger Bank A and Dogger Bank B are SSE Renewables (40%), Equinor (40%), and Eni (20%). Equinor will continue to equity account for the remaining investment as a joint venture. The gain is presented in the line item Other income in the Consolidated statement of income in the REN segment.\n\n## Non-operated interest in the Empire Wind and Beacon Wind assets on the US east coast\n\nOn 29 January 2021, Equinor closed the transaction with BP to sell 50% of the non-operated interests in the Empire Wind and Beacon Wind assets for a preliminary total consideration after interim period adjustments of USD 1.2 billion, resulting in a gain of USD 1.1 billion for the divested part, of which USD 500 million had been prepaid at the end of December 2020. Through this transaction, the two companies have established a strategic partnership for further growth within offshore wind in the USA. Following the transaction, Equinor remains the operator with a 50% interest. Equinor consolidated the assets until transaction closing, and thereafter the investments are classified as joint ventures and accounted for using the equity method. The gain is presented in the line item Other income in the Consolidated statement of income in the REN segment. For further information about the gain recognition, reference is made to the section Accounting judgement regarding partial divestments and the related policy in note 2 Significant accounting policies.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\n## Wento\n\nOn 5 May 2021, Equinor completed a transaction to acquire 100% of the shares in Polish onshore renewables developer Wento from the private equity firm Enterprise Investors for a cash consideration of EUR 98 million (USD 117 million) after net cash adjustments. In addition, Equinor acquired a receivable of USD 3 million from Enterprise Investors towards investees. The assets and liabilities related to the acquired business have been recognised under the acquisition method. In the second quarter 2021, the acquisition resulted in an increase of Equinor's intangible assets of USD 46 million, goodwill of USD 59 million, deferred tax liability of USD 9 million and other net assets of USD 21 million. The goodwill reflects the expected synergies, competence and access to the Polish renewables market obtained in the acquisition. The transaction has been accounted for in the REN segment.",

In the second quarter, Equinor increased its shareholding in the Bandurria Sur by 5.5% to 30% for a final consideration of USD 44 million. The investment in SPM is accounted for as a joint venture using the equity method and reported in the E&P International segment.\n\n## 6 Financial risk and capital management\n\n## General information relevant to financial risks\n\nEquinor's business activities naturally expose Equinor to financial risk. Equinor's approach to risk management includes assessing and managing risk in activities using a holistic risk approach, by considering relevant correlations at portfolio level between the most important market risks and the natural hedges inherent in Equinor's portfolio. This approach allows Equinor to reduce the number of risk management transactions and avoid sub-optimisation.\n\nThe corporate risk committee, which is headed by the chief financial officer, is responsible Equinor's Enterprise Risk Management and proposing appropriate measures to adjust risk at the corporate level. This includes assessing Equinor's financial risk policies.\n\n## Financial risks\n\nEquinor's activities expose Equinor to market risk (including commodity price risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk), liquidity risk and credit risk.\n\n## Market risk\n\nEquinor operates in the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, and electricity markets and is exposed to market risks including fluctuations in hydrocarbon prices, foreign currency rates, interest rates, and electricity prices that can affect the revenues and costs of operating, investing and financing. These risks are managed primarily on a short-term basis with a focus on achieving the highest risk-adjusted returns for Equinor within the given mandate. Long-term exposures are managed at the corporate level, while short-term exposures are managed according to trading strategies and mandates. Mandates in the trading organisations within crude oil, refined products, natural gas and electricity are relatively small compared to the total market risk of Equinor.\n\nFor more information on sensitivity analysis of market risk see note 26 Financial instruments: fair value measurement and sensitivity analysis of market risk.\n\n## Financial statements and supplements\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements and supplements\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nEquinor's most important long-term commodity risk (oil and natural gas) is related to future market prices as Equinor's risk policy is to be exposed to both upside and downside price movements. The introduction of a future sizeable power price exposure will likely compound the portfolio commodity price risk. To manage short-term commodity risk, Equinor enters into commodity-based derivative contracts, including futures, options, over-the-counter (OTC) forward contracts, market swaps and contracts for differences related to crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, power and emmissions. Equinor's bilateral gas sales portfolio is exposed to various price indices with a combination of gas price markers.\n\nThe term of crude oil and refined oil products derivatives are usually less than one year, and they are traded mainly on the Inter Continental Exchange (ICE) in London, the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), the OTC Brent market, and crude and refined products swap markets. The term of natural gas, power and emission derivatives is usually three years or less, and they are mainly OTC physical forwards and options, NASDAQ OMX Oslo forwards and futures traded on the European Energy Exchange (EEX), NYMEX and ICE.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nEquinor's cash flows from operating activities deriving from oil and gas sales, operating expenses and capital expenditures are mainly in USD, but taxes, dividends to shareholders on the Oslo B\u00f8rs and a share of our operating expenses and capital expenditures are in NOK. Accordingly, Equinor's currency management is primarily linked to mitigate currency risk related to payments in NOK. This means that Equinor regularly purchases NOK, primarily spot, but also on a forward basis using conventional derivative instruments.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nBonds are normally issued at fixed rates in a variety of currencies (among others USD, EUR and GBP). Bonds are normally converted to floating USD bonds by using interest rate and currency swaps. Equinor manages its interest rates exposure on its bond debt based on risk and reward considerations from an enterprise risk management perspective. This means that the fixed/floating mix on interest rate exposure may vary from time to time. For more detailed information about Equinor's long-term debt portfolio see note 19 Finance debt.\n\n## Equity price risk\n\nEquinor's captive insurance company holds listed equity securities as part of its portfolio. In addition, Equinor holds some other listed and non-listed equities mainly for long-term strategic purposes. By holding these assets, Equinor is exposed to equity price risk, defined as the risk of declining equity prices, which can result in a decline in the carrying value of Equinor's assets recognised in the balance sheet. The equity price risk in the portfolio held by Equinor's captive insurance company is managed, with the aim of maintaining a moderate risk profile, through geographical diversification and the use of broad benchmark indexes.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that Equinor will not be able to meet obligations of financial liabilities when they become due. The purpose of liquidity management is to ensure that Equinor has sufficient funds available at all times to cover its financial obligations.\n\nThe main cash outflows include the quarterly dividend payments and Norwegian petroleum tax payments paid six times per year. If the cash flow forecasts indicate that the liquid assets will fall below target levels, new long-term funding will be considered.\n\nShort-term funding needs will normally be covered by the USD 5.0 billion US Commercial paper programme (CP) which is backed by a revolving credit facility of USD 6.0 billion, supported by 19 core banks, maturing in 2024. The facility supports secure access to funding, supported by the best available short-term rating. As at 31 December 2021 the facility has not been drawn.\n\nEquinor raises debt in all major capital markets (USA, Europe and Asia) for long-term funding purposes. The policy is to have a maturity profile with repayments not exceeding 5% of capital employed in any year for the nearest five years. Equinor's non-current financial liabilities have a weighted average maturity of approximately ten years.\n\nFor more information about Equinor's non-current financial liabilities, see note 19 Finance debt.",

Credit risk arises from credit exposures with customer accounts receivables as well as from financial investments, derivative financial instruments and deposits with financial institutions.\n\nPrior to entering into transactions with new counterparties, Equinor's credit policy requires all counterparties to be formally identified and assigned internal credit ratings. The internal credit ratings reflect Equinor's assessment of the counterparties' credit risk and are based on a quantitative and qualitative analysis of recent financial statements and other relevant business. All counterparties are re-assessed regularly.\n\nEquinor uses risk mitigation tools to reduce or control credit risk both on a counterparty and portfolio level. The main tools include bank and parental guarantees, prepayments and cash collateral.\n\nEquinor has pre-defined limits for the absolute credit risk level allowed at any given time on Equinor's portfolio as well as maximum credit exposures for individual counterparties. Equinor monitors the portfolio on a regular basis and individual exposures against limits on a daily basis. The total credit exposure of Equinor is geographically diversified among a number of counterparties within the oil and energy sector, as well as larger oil and gas consumers and financial counterparties. The majority of Equinor's credit exposure is with investment grade counterparties.",

The collateral cash is received as a security to mitigate credit exposure related to positive fair values on interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Cash is called as collateral in accordance with the master agreements with the different counterparties when the positive fair values for the different swap agreements are above an agreed threshold.\n\nUnder the terms of various master netting agreements for derivative financial instruments as of 31 December 2021, USD 24.536 billion have been offset and USD 0.500 billion presented as liabilities do not meet the criteria for offsetting.

The collateral received and the amounts not offset from derivative financial instrument liabilities, reduce the credit exposure in the derivative financial instruments presented in the table above as they will offset in a potential default situation for the counterparty. For trade and other receivables subject to similar master netting agreements USD 4.445 billion have been offset as of 31 December 2021, and respectively USD 1.684 billion as of 31 December 2020.",

The changes are effective from 1 January 2020 and provide companies with a direct tax deduction in the special petroleum tax (56% tax rate) instead of tax depreciation over six years. In addition, the tax uplift benefit, which has increased from 20.8% to 24%, will be recognised over one year instead of four years. Tax depreciation towards the ordinary offshore corporate tax (22% tax rate) will continue with a six-year depreciation profile.",

After netting deferred tax assets and liabilities by fiscal entity and reclassification to Held for Sale, deferred taxes are presented on the balance sheet as follows:\n\n|                                                                    | At 31 December   | At 31 December   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| (in USD million)                                                   | 2021             | 2020             |\n| Deferred tax assets                                                | 6,259            | 4,974            |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                           | 14,037           | 11,224           |\n| Deferred tax assets reported in Assets classified as held for sale | 122              | 0                |\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised based on the expectation that sufficient taxable income will be available through reversal of taxable temporary differences or future taxable income. At year-end 2021 and 2020 the deferred tax assets of USD 6.381 billion and USD 4.974 billion, respectively, were primarily recognised in the UK, Norway, Angola, Canada and Brazil. Of these amounts, USD 4.636 billion and USD 2.328 billion, respectively, is recognised in entities which have suffered a tax loss in either the current or preceding period. The losses will be utilised through reversal of taxable temporary differences and other taxable income mainly from production of oil and gas. It is considered probable based on business forecasts and/or a history of taxable income that such profits will be available.\n\n## Unrecognised deferred tax assets\n\n|                                        | At 31 December   | At 31 December   | At 31 December   | At 31 December   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                                        | 2021             | 2021             | 2020             | 2020             |\n| (in USD million)                       | Basis            | Tax              | Basis            | Tax              |\n| Deductible temporary differences       | 2,900            | 1,203            | 2,866            | 1,204            |\n| Unused tax credits                     | 0                | 264              | 0                | 212              |\n| Tax losses carried forward             | 20,552           | 5,047            | 23,434           | 5,677            |\n| Total unrecognised deferred tax assets | 23,452           | 6,514            | 26,300           | 7,093            |\n\nApproximately 22% of the unrecognised carry forward tax losses can be carried forward indefinitely. The majority of the remaining part of the unrecognised tax losses expire after 2032. The unrecognised tax credits expire from 2030, while the unrecognised deductible temporary differences do not expire under the current tax legislation. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because currently there is insufficient evidence to support that future taxable profits will be available to secure utilisation of the benefits.\n\nAt year-end 2021, unrecognised deferred tax assets in the USA and Angola represents USD 4.206 billion and USD 0.749 billion, respectively, of the total unrecognised deferred tax assets of USD 6.514 billion. Similar amounts for 2020 were USD 4.649 billion in the USA and USD 0.740 billion in Angola, respectively, of a total of USD 7.093 billion. The remaining unrecognised deferred tax assets originate from several different tax jurisdictions.",

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less cost of disposal (FVLCOD) and estimated value in use (VIU).\n\nThe base discount rate for VIU calculations is 5.0% real after tax. The discount rate is derived from Equinor's weighted average cost of capital. For projects, mainly within the REN segment, in periods with fixed low risk income a lower discount rate will be considered. A derived pre-tax discount is in the range of 18-32% for E&P Norway, 5-9% for E&P International, 6-7% for E&P USA and 7% for MMP depending on asset specific characteristics, such as specific tax treatments, cash flow profiles and economic life.

In 2020, the impairments were USD 1.219 billion, mainly because of reduction in future price estimates. Negative reserve revisions and increased cost estimates added to the impairment losses.\n\n## Exploration & Production USA - onshore\n\nIn 2021, the net impairment was USD 48 million of which net reversal of USD 2 million was classified as exploration expenses. The impairments were USD 108 million of which USD 20 million classified as exploration expensed were caused by downward reserve revision and sale of an asset. The reversal of USD 60 million of which USD 22 million was classified as exploration expenses was caused by upward reserve revision.\n\nIn 2020, the net impairment was USD 2.313 billion of which USD 0.680 billion was classified as exploration expenses. The impairment losses of USD 2.547 billion of which USD 0.743 billion classified as exploration expenses, were caused by decreased price assumptions and a change to fair value less cost of disposal valuation in relation to held for sale classification. The impairment reversals of USD 0.234 billion in 2020 were caused by improved production profile.\n\nExploration & Production USA - offshore Gulf of Mexico\n\nIn 2021, the impairment was USD 18 million caused by downward reserve revision.\n\nIn 2020, the impairments were USD 305 million caused by decreased price assumptions.\n\nExploration & Production International - North America offshore other areas In 2021, the impairment reversal was USD 22 million related to sale of an asset. In 2020, the impairment was USD 146 million due to operational issues.\n\nExploration & Production International - Europe and Asia\n\nIn 2021, the net impairment was USD 1.609 billion. Impairments were USD 1.786 billion mainly caused by downward reserve revisions. The reversal of USD 0.177 billion was caused by higher prices\n\nIn 2020, the impairments were USD 1.280 billion due to decreased price assumptions and negative reserve revisions.\n\n## Marketing, Midstream & Processing\n\nIn 2021, the impairment losses were USD 716 million mainly caused by increased CO2 fees and - quotas on a refinery and change to fair value less cost of disposal valuation in connection with a held for sale classification.\n\nIn 2020, the impairment losses were USD 1.052 billion mainly due to reduced refinery margin estimates and increased cost estimates. Reduced volume-estimates from processing added to the impairment loss.\n\n## Accounting assumptions\n\nManagement's future commodity price assumptions and currency assumptions are used for value in use impairment testing. The same assumptions are also used for evaluating investment opportunities, together with other relevant criteria, including among others robustness targets (value creation in lower commodity price scenarios). While there are inherent uncertainties in the assumptions, the commodity price assumptions as well as currency assumptions reflect management's best estimate of the price and currency development over the life of the Group's assets based on its view of relevant current circumstances and the likely future development of such circumstances, including energy demand development, energy and climate change policies as well as the speed of the energy transition, population and economic growth, geopolitical risks, technology and cost development and other factors. Management's best estimate also takes into consideration a range of external forecasts.\n\nEquinor has performed a thorough and broad analysis of the expected development in drivers for the different commodity markets and exchange rates. Significant uncertainty exists regarding future commodity price development due to the transition to a lower carbon economy, future supply actions by OPEC+ and other factors. The management's analysis of the expected development in drivers for the different commodity markets and exchange rates resulted in changes in the long-term price assumptions with effect from the third quarter of 2021. The following price assumptions have been the basis for the impairment assessments.\n\nAll commodity prices are on a real 2021 basis, and comparable prices as per the fourth quarter of 2020 and up to the third quarter of 2021 are given in brackets.\n\nFor Brent blend, Equinor expects a price of 65 USD/bbl in 2025 (67 USD/bbl) then gradually an increase to a peak in 2030 before declining to 64 USD/bbl in 2040 (66 USD/bbl), and further down to below 60 USD/bbl in the 2050s. Price assumptions from 2025 are unchanged compared to year-end 2020, with the exception that the real year has been changed from 2020 to 2021.\n\nFor natural gas in the UK (NBP), we expect some volatility, where the trend is a decrease to 6.4 USD/mmbtu in 2030 (6.7 USD/mmbtu). From 2030, a flatter price-curve is expected, with the price gradually increasing to 7.7 USD/mmbtu in 2040 (8.0 USD/mmbtu). Beyond",

For 2050, the price is expected to be at the pre-2035 level of 7.0 USD/mmbtu (7.7 USD/mmbtu).\n\nHenry Hub is expected to decrease to 3.2 USD/mmBtu in 2030 (3.3 USD/mmbtu) and 3.3 USD/mmbtu in 2040 (3.8 USD/mmbtu), a level that is expected to continue through the 2040s.\n\nThe electricity prices are expected to increase significantly in the future. Due to the increasing gas and CO2 prices the electricity prices in Germany are by the end of fourth quarter expected to be 157 EUR/MWh in 2022 (61 EUR/MWh), the expectation for 2022 by the end of the third quarter was 77 EUR/MWh. In 2030 the prices are expected to be 58 EUR/MWh (43 EUR/MWh) and then rather flat towards 2050.\n\nClimate considerations are included in the impairment calculations directly by estimating the CO2 taxes in the cash flows. Indirectly, the expected effect of climate change is also included in the estimated commodity prices where supply and demand are considered. The prices also have effect on the estimated production profiles and economic cut-off of the projects. Furthermore, climate considerations are a part of the investment decisions following Equinor's strategy and commitments to the energy transition.\n\nThe EU ETS price has increased significantly from 56 EUR/tonne since the third quarter assessment and is expected to remain high, in the region of 80 EUR/tonne for the next few years. Then the price is expected to be 65 EUR/tonne (27.5 EUR/tonne) in 2030 and thereafter increasing to 100 EUR/tonne (41 EUR/tonne) in 2050 (assumptions used in 2020 in brackets). Norway's Climate Action Plan for the period 2021-2030 (Meld. St 13 (2020-2021)) which assumes a gradually increased CO2 tax (the total of EU ETS + Norwegian CO2 tax) in Norway to 2,000 NOK/tonne in 2030 is used for impairment calculations of Norwegian upstream assets.\n\nImpairment calculations are based on what is considered to be best estimate. To reflect that carbon will have a cost for all our assets the current best estimate is considered to be EU ETS for countries outside EU where carbon is not already subject to taxation or where Equinor has not established specific estimates.\n\nThe long-term NOK currency exchange rates are expected to be unchanged. The NOK/USD rate from 2024 and onwards is kept at 8.50, the NOK/EUR at 10.0 and the USD/GBP rate at 1.35.\n\nThe Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) rate is 5%. This rate is basically the interest rate used for upstream activities. For other business areas the discount rate will be determined based on a risk assessment. Typically, the rate will decrease for assets/projects where the revenue is secured by fixed fees or government grants.\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nCommodity prices have historically been volatile. Significant downward adjustments of Equinor's commodity price assumptions would result in impairment losses on certain producing and development assets in Equinor's portfolio including intangible assets that are subject to impairment assessment, while an opposite adjustment could lead to impairment-reversals. If a decline in commodity price forecasts over the lifetime of the assets were 30%, considered to represent a reasonably possible change, the impairment amount to be recognised could illustratively be in the region of USD 9 billion before tax effects. See note 3 Consequences of initiatives to limit climate changes for possible effect of using the prices in a 1.5 o C compatible Net Zero Emission by 2050 scenario as estimated by the International Energy Agency (IEA)\n\nThese illustrative impairment sensitivities, both based on a simplified method, assumes no changes to input factors other than prices; however, a price reduction of 30% or those representing Net Zero Emission scenario is likely to result in changes in business plans as well as other factors used when estimating an asset's recoverable amount. These associated changes reduce the stand-alone impact on the price sensitivities. Changes in such input factors would likely include a reduction in the cost level in the oil and gas industry as well as offsetting foreign currency effects, both of which have historically occurred following significant changes in commodity prices. The illustrative sensitivities are therefore not considered to represent a best estimate of an expected impairment impact, nor an estimated impact on revenues or operating income in such a scenario. In comparison, following the amended assumptions described above in the accounting assumptions section and the decline in commodity prices, the impairment impact recognised is considerably lower. A significant and prolonged reduction in oil and gas prices would also result in mitigating actions by Equinor and its licence partners, as a reduction of oil and gas prices would impact drilling plans and production profiles for new and existing assets. Quantifying such impacts is considered impracticable, as it requires detailed technical, geological and economical evaluations based on hypothetical scenarios and not based on existing business or development plans.",

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized systematically over their estimated economic lives, ranging between 3-20 years.\n\nIncluded in the goodwill of USD 1.467 billion technical goodwill relate to business acquisitions in 2019, USD 0.615 billion in the Exploration & Production Norway area and USD 0.435 billion the Marketing Midstream & Processing area.\n\nIn 2021, Acquisition cost - oil and gas prospects were impacted by net impairment of USD 152 million. Impairments of acquisition cost related to exploration activities of USD 154 million were mainly related to dry wells and uncommercial discoveries in South America and Gulf of Mexico. Net reversal of 2 million related to Exploration and production USA - onshore.\n\nIn 2020, Acquisition cost - oil and gas prospects were impacted by net impairment of signature bonuses and acquisition costs totaling USD 680 million related to unconventional onshore assets in Exploration & Production USA. Impairment of acquisition costs related to exploration activities of USD 657 million was primarily related to dry wells and uncommercial discoveries in Exploration & Production International.\n\nSee note 11 Property, plant and equipment regarding sensitivities.\n\nIn 2020, Equinor decided to impair capitalised well costs of USD 982 million related to Equinor's Block 2 exploration license in Tanzania. The impairment was presented in the line-item Exploration expenses.\n\nImpairment losses and reversals of impairment losses are presented as Exploration expenses and Depreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses on the basis of their nature as exploration assets (intangible assets) and other intangible assets, respectively. The impairment losses and reversal of impairment losses are based on recoverable amount estimates triggered by changes in reserve estimates, cost estimates and market conditions. See note 11 Property, plant and equipment for more information on the basis for impairment assessments.\n\nThe table below shows the aging of capitalised exploration expenditures.\n\n| (in USD million)                           | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Less than one year                         | 234    | 604    |\n| Between one and five years                 | 692    | 623    |\n| More than five years                       | 1,033  | 1,033  |\n| Total capitalised exploration expenditures | 1,958  | 2,261  |\n\nThe table below shows the components of the exploration expenses.\n\n|                                                          | Full year   | Full year   | Full year   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| (in USD million)                                         | 2021        | 2020        | 2019        |\n| Exploration expenditures                                 | 1,027       | 1,371       | 1,584       |\n| Expensed exploration expenditures previously capitalised | 171         | 2,506       | 777         |\n| Capitalised exploration                                  | (194)       | (394)       | (507)       |\n| Exploration expenses                                     | 1,004       | 3,483       | 1,854       |",

In October 2021 Equinor announced an increase in the second tranche of the new share buy-back programme, from initially USD 300 million to USD 1.0 billion. For the first tranche Equinor entered into an irrevocable agreement with a third party for up to USD 99 million of shares to be purchased in the open market, while for the second tranche a similar irrevocable agreement with a third party was entered into for up to USD 330 million of shares to be purchased in the open market. For the first tranche around USD 201 million, and for the second tranche around USD 670 million worth of shares from the Norwegian State will in accordance with an agreement with the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy be redeemed at the next annual general meeting in May 2022, in order for the Norwegian State to maintain their ownership percentage in Equinor.\n\nThe first order in the open market was concluded in September 2021. The second order in the open market was concluded in January 2022. As of 31 December, USD 99 million order from the first trance has been acquired in the open market and the full amount has been settled, while USD 232 million of the USD 330 million second order has been acquired in the open market, of which USD 222 million has been settled.\n\nDue to the irrevocable agreement with the third party, both the first and second order in the open market, in total USD 429 million, has been recognised as a reduction in equity as treasury shares. The remaining order of the second tranche has been accrued for and along with acquired shares not settled, classified as Trade, other payables and provisions. The recognition of the State's share will be deferred until the decision at the annual general meeting in May 2022.\n\nOn 8 February 2022, the Board announced an annual share buy-back programme for 2022 with up to USD 5.0 billion, including shares to be redeemed from the Norwegian State, subject to authorisation from the annual general meeting. The annual share buy-back programme is expected to be executed when Brent Blend oil price is in or above the range of 50-60 USD/bbl, Equinor's net debt to capital employed adjusted stays within the communicated ambition of 15-30 % and this is supported by commodity prices. The purpose of the share buy-back programme is to reduce the issued share capital of the company. All shares repurchased as part of the programme will be cancelled.\n\nOn 8 February 2022, the board of directors resolved the commencement of the first tranche of the share buy-back programme for 2022 of a total of USD 1.0 billion, including shares to be redeemed from the Norwegian State. The first tranche will end no later than 25 March 2022..\n\n| Number of shares                        | 2021       | 2020         |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------|--------------|\n| Share buy-back programme at 1 January   | 0          | 23,578,410   |\n| Purchase                                | 13,460,292 | 3,142,849    |\n| Cancellation                            | 0          | (26,721,259) |\n| Share buy-back programme at 31 December | 13,460,292 | 0            |",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements and supplements\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\n## 20 Pensions\n\nThe main pension plans for Equinor ASA and its most significant subsidiaries are defined contribution plans, in which the pension costs are recognised in the Consolidated statement of income in line with payments of annual pension premiums. The pension contribution plans in Equinor ASA also includes certain unfunded elements (notional contribution plans), for which the annual notional contributions are recognised as pension liabilities. These notional pension liabilities are regulated equal to the return on asset within the main contribution plan. See note 2 Significant accounting policies to the Consolidated financial statements for more information about the accounting treatment of the notional contribution plans reported in Equinor ASA.\n\nIn addition, Equinor ASA has a defined benefit plan. This benefit plan was closed in 2015 for new employees and for employees with more than 15 year to regular retirement age. Equinor's defined benefit plans are generally based on a minimum of 30 years of service and 66% of the final salary level, including an assumed benefit from the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme. The Norwegian companies in the group are subject to, and complies with, the requirements of the Norwegian Mandatory Company Pensions Act.\n\nThe defined benefit plans in Norway are managed and financed through Equinor Pensjon (Equinor's pension fund - hereafter Equinor Pension). Equinor Pension is an independent pension fund that covers the employees in Equinor's Norwegian companies. The pension fund's assets are kept separate from the company's and group companies' assets. Equinor Pension is supervised by the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway (\"Finanstilsynet\") and is licenced to operate as a pension fund.\n\nEquinor is a member of a Norwegian national agreement-based early retirement plan ('AFP'), and the premium is calculated based on the employees' income, but limited to 7.1 times the basic amount in the National Insurance scheme (7.1 G). The premium is payable for all employees until age 62. Pension from the AFP scheme will be paid from the AFP plan administrator to employees for their full lifetime. Equinor has determined that its obligations under this multi-employer defined benefit plan can be estimated with sufficient reliability for recognition purposes. Accordingly, the estimated proportionate share of the AFP plan is recognised as a defined benefit obligation.\n\nThe present values of the defined benefit obligation, except for the notional contribution plan, and the related current service cost and past service cost are measured using the projected unit credit method. The assumptions for salary increase, increases in pension payments and social security base amount are based on agreed regulation in the plans, historical observations, future expectations of the assumptions and the relationship between these assumptions. At 31 December 2021, the discount rate for the defined benefit plans in Norway was established on the basis of seven years' mortgage covered bonds interest rate extrapolated on a yield curve which matches the duration of Equinor's payment portfolio for earned benefits, which was calculated to be 15.2 years at the end of 2021. Social security tax is calculated based on a pension plan's net funded status and is included in the defined benefit obligation.\n\nThe recognition of a net surplus for the funded plan is based on the assumption that the net assets represent a future value for Equinor, either as possible distribution to premium fund which can be used for future funding of new liabilities, or disbursement of equity in the pension fund.\n\nEquinor has more than one defined benefit plan, but the disclosure is made in total since the plans are not subject to materially different risks. Pension plans outside Norway are not material and as such not disclosed separately. The tables in this note present pension costs on a gross basis, before allocation to licence partners. In the Consolidated statement of income, the pension costs in Equinor ASA are presented net of costs allocated to licence partners.\n\n## Net pension cost\n\n| (in USD million)                                              | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Current service cost                                          | 209    | 184    | 206    |\n| Past service cost                                             | 3      | -      | -      |\n| Losses/(gains) from curtailment, settlement or plan amendment | -      | -      | 3      |\n| Notional contribution plans                                   | 60     | 55     | 56     |\n| Defined benefit plans                                         | 272    | 238    | 265    |\n| Defined contribution plans                                    | 213    | 192    | 182    |\n| Total net pension cost                                        | 488    | 432    | 446    |\n\nIn addition to the pension cost presented in the table above, financial items related to defined benefit plans are included in the Consolidated statement of income within Net financial items. Interest cost and changes in fair value of notional contribution plans amounts to USD 238 million in 2021 and USD 203 million in 2020. Interest income of USD 106 million has been recognised in 2021, and USD 117 million in 2020.",

The estimated effects on the financial result would differ from those that would actually appear in the Consolidated financial statements because the Consolidated financial statements would also reflect the relationship between these assumptions.",

In the third quarter 2021, this provision has been settled resulting in a payment of the settled amount and reversal of the remaining amount of the provision. The reversal of the provision is reflected within the line item Operating expenses in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\nThe timing of cash outflows of asset retirement obligations depends on the expected production cease at the various facilities.\n\nIn certain production sharing agreements (PSA), Equinor's estimated share of asset retirement obligation (ARO) is paid into an escrow account over the producing life of the field. These payments are considered down-payments of the liabilities and included in line item Amounts charged against provisions and other liabilities.\n\nThe Claims and litigations category mainly relate to expected payments for unresolved claims. The timing and amounts of potential settlements in respect of these claims are uncertain and dependent on various factors that are outside management's control. For further information on provisions and contingent liabilities, see note 24 Other commitments, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.\n\nFor further information about methods applied and estimates required, see note 2 Significant accounting policies.\n\n## Restatement of ARO due to change in the discount rate\n\nThe discount rate used in the calculation of ARO no longer includes Equinor's own credit risk element. See note 2 Significant accounting policies for a description of this change. The impact of this ARO calculation policy change on affected financial statement lines of previous years' Consolidated financial statements is summarised in the table below. For 2021, the effect on the line items PPE and Provisions and other liabilities amounted to approx.

Equinor is mostly a lessee and the use of leases serves operational purposes rather than as a tool for financing.\n\nCertain leases, such as land bases, supply vessels, helicopters and office buildings are entered into by Equinor for subsequent allocation of costs to licences operated by Equinor. These lease liabilities are recognized on a gross basis in the balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flows when Equinor is considered to have the primary responsibility for the full lease payments. Lease liabilities related to assets dedicated to specific licences, where each licence participants are considered to have the primary responsibility for lease payments, are reflected net of partner share. This would typically involve drilling rigs dedicated to specific licences on the Norwegian continental shelf.\n\n## Information related to lease payments and lease liabilities\n\n| (in USD million)                                       |         | 2021    |         | 2020    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Lease liabilities at 1 January                         |         | 4,406   |         | 4,339   |\n| New leases, including remeasurements and cancellations |         | 476     |         | 1,349   |\n| Gross lease payments                                   | (1,350) |         | (1,415) |         |\n| Lease interest                                         | 91      |         | 102     |         |\n| Lease repayments                                       | (1,259) | (1,259) | (1,313) | (1,313) |\n| Foreign currency translation effects                   |         | (61)    |         | 31      |\n| Lease liabilities at 31 December                       |         | 3,562   |         | 4,406   |\n| Current lease liabilities                              |         | 1,113   |         | 1,186   |\n| Non-current lease liabilities                          |         | 2,449   |         | 3,220   |\n\n## Lease expenses not included in lease liabilities\n\n| (in USD million)          |   2021 |   2020 |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Short-term lease expenses |    160 |    342 |",

The contractual commitments reflect Equinor's proportional share and mainly comprise construction and acquisition of property, plant and equipment as well as committed investments/funding or resources in equity accounted entities.\n\nAs a condition for being awarded oil and gas exploration and production licences, participants may be committed to drill a certain number of wells. At the end of 2021, Equinor was committed to participate in 36 wells, with an average ownership interest of approximately 46%. Equinor's share of estimated expenditures to drill these wells amounts to USD 409 million. Additional wells that Equinor may become committed to participating in depending on future discoveries in certain licences are not included in these numbers.\n\n## Other long-term commitments\n\nEquinor has entered into various long-term agreements for pipeline transportation as well as terminal use, processing, storage and entry/exit capacity commitments and commitments related to specific purchase agreements. The agreements ensure the rights to the capacity or volumes in question, but also impose on Equinor the obligation to pay for the agreed-upon service or commodity, irrespective of actual use. The contracts' terms vary, with durations of up to 2060.\n\nTake-or-pay contracts for the purchase of commodity quantities are only included in the table below if their contractually agreed pricing is of a nature that will or may deviate from the obtainable market prices for the commodity at the time of delivery.\n\nObligations payable by Equinor to entities accounted for in the Equinor group using the equity method are included in the table below with Equinor's full proportionate share. For assets (such as pipelines) that are included in the Equinor accounts through joint operations or similar arrangements, and where consequently Equinor's share of assets, liabilities, income and expenses (capacity costs) are reflected on a line-by-line basis in the Consolidated financial statements, the amounts in the table include the net commitment payable by Equinor (i.e. Equinor's proportionate share of the commitment less Equinor's ownership share in the applicable entity).\n\nThe table below also includes USD 2.022 billion as the non-lease components of lease agreements reflected in the accounts according to IFRS 16, as well as leases not yet commenced. Leases not commenced include one rig to be used on the NCS and an increased number of vessels supporting the growing LPG and LNG business. For commenced leases, please refer to note 23 Leases.\n\nNominal minimum other long-term commitments at 31 December 2021:\n\n| (in USD million)                  |        |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|\n| 2022                              | 2,663  |\n| 2023                              | 2,077  |\n| 2024                              | 1,520  |\n| 2025                              | 1,307  |\n| 2026                              | 1,026  |\n| Thereafter                        | 4,547  |\n| Total other long-term commitments | 13,140 |",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements and supplements\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\n## Guarantees\n\nEquinor has guaranteed for its proportionate share of some of our associate's long-term bank debt, payment obligations under contracts, and certain third-party obligations. The total amount guaranteed at year-end 2021 is USD 439 million. The book value of the guarantees is immaterial.\n\n## Contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\n## Redetermination process for Agbami field\n\nThrough its ownership in OML 128 in Nigeria, Equinor is a party to an ownership interest redetermination process for the Agbami field, which will reduce Equinor's ownership interest. A non-binding agreement for settlement of the redetermination was reached during the fourth quarter of 2018. The parties to the non-binding agreement have thereafter continued to work towards a final settlement and agreed-upon ownership percentage adjustment. In June 2021, Equinor paid a total of USD 822 million to two of the partners in the Agbami Unit. The payment covered outstanding amounts between the three parties as of 31 March 2021. Following the payment, an adjustment to the previous provision by USD 57 million was reflected in the E&P International segment under Other Revenue. The remaining Agbami redetermination related provision reflected in Trade and other payables in the Consolidated balance sheet at yearend is immaterial.\n\n## Mineral rights dispute along the Missouri riverbank\n\nEquinor produces minerals from wells in spacing units along the Missouri River in which ownership of the mineral rights associated with the near shore region up to the ordinary high-water mark has been disputed. As operator of wells in those units, Equinor has a right to part of the proceeds, and a responsibility to distribute the remainder of the proceeds from the production to the owners of the mineral rights. As the riverbank has moved continuously over time, updated river-surveys have resulted in interest claims from several parties, including the State of North Dakota, the United States, and private parties. During the second quarter of 2021, Equinor received updated title opinions reflecting the latest State survey that resulted in clarification among the main parties. Certain limited procedural matters remain, but Equinor's maximum exposure in the case was significantly reduced and at this stage is minor. Amounts reflected in the matter in the Consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2021 and in the Consolidated statement of income during the year 2021 are immaterial.\n\n## Claim from Petrofac regarding multiple variation order requests performed in Algeria (In Salah)\n\nPetrofac International (UAE) LLC ('PIUL') was awarded the EPC Contract to execute the ISSF Project (the In Salah Southern Fields Project which has finalized the development of 4 gas fields in central Algeria). Following suspension of activity after the terrorist attack at another gas field in Algeria (In Amenas) in 2013, PIUL issued multiple Variation Order Requests ('VoRs') related to the costs incurred for stand-by and remobilization costs after the evacuation of expatriates. Several VoRs have been paid, but the settlement of the remaining has been unsuccessful. PIUL initiated arbitration in August 2020 claiming an estimated amount of USD 533 million, of which Equinor holds a 31.85% share. Equinor's maximum exposure amounts to USD 163 million. Equinor has provided for its best estimate in the matter.\n\n## Withholding tax dispute regarding remittances from Brazil to Norway\n\nRemittances made from Brazil for services are normally subject to withholding income tax. In 2012, Equinor's subsidiaries in Brazil filed a lawsuit to avoid paying this tax on remittances made to Equinor ASA and Equinor Energy AS for services without transfer of technology based on the Double Tax Treaty Brazil has with Norway. The first level decision from 2013 was in Equinor's favour and since 2014, withholding tax has not been paid. In 2017, a second level decision was rendered also in favour of Equinor, but this decision was appealed. The trial session concluded in July 2021, overruling the previous favourable decision based on procedural aspects only. Equinor has filed a motion for clarification which had the effect of temporarily suspending the unfavourable decision and is currently awaiting the court's decision, on the basis of which Equinor's further legal steps in the case will be determined. Equinor's maximum exposure is estimated at approximately USD 135 million. Equinor is of the view that all applicable tax regulations have been applied in the case and that Equinor has a strong position. No amounts have consequently been provided for in the financial statements.\n\n## Suit for an annulment of Petrobras' sale of the interest in BM-S-8 to Equinor\n\nIn March 2017, an individual connected to the Union of Oil Workers of Sergipe (Sindipetro) filed a class action suit against Petrobras, Equinor, and ANP - the Brazilian Regulatory Agency - to seek annulment of Petrobras' sale of the interest and operatorship in BM-S-8 to Equinor, which was closed in November 2016 after approval by the partners and authorities. In February 2022, sentence in the annulment case was issued at the first instance level, and Equinor won on all merits. Equinor is expecting the case to be appealed and is currently evaluation next steps. At the end of 2021, the acquired interest remains in Equinor's balance sheet as intangible assets of the Exploration & Production International (E&P International) segment.\n\n## ICMS indirect tax (Imposto sobre Circula\u00e7ao de Mercadorias - Tax on the Circulation of Goods and Certain Services)\n\nIn Brazil, the State of Rio de Janeiro in 2015 published a law whereby crude oil extraction would be subject to a 18% ICMS indirect tax, for which the Brazilian Industry Association challenged the law's constitutionality. In March 2021 the plenary of Brazil's Supreme Court declared the State of Rio de Janeiro's law to be unconstitutional, and the decision became final in May 2021. Following the Supreme Court's decision, Equinor evaluates the probability of any cash outflow in relation to the legal proceedings currently ongoing for the Roncador and Peregrino fields to be remote. The maximum exposure for Equinor is at year-end 2021 estimated at USD 460 million. As no",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements and supplements\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nprovisions have previously been made in the matter, the Brazilian Supreme Court's decision does not impact Equinor's Consolidated financial statements for the year 2021.\n\n## New Brazilian law creating uncertainty regarding certain tax incentives\n\nIn 2021, a law came into effect in Brazil in the State of Rio de Janeiro, requiring taxpayers that benefited from ICMS tax incentives (i.e. Repetro) to deposit 10% of the savings made from such benefits into a state fund. This law had slightly different features from a previous similar law effective in the period 2017 to 2020. Equinor is of the opinion that specific incentives so far relevant for the Roncador and Peregrino fields are not in scope of the new law, nor were they in scope of the previous one. State tax authorities in Rio de Janeiro may interpret the laws differently and require deposits to be paid with the addition of fines and interests. Several legal actions to oppose such developments have therefore been initiated by Equinor's peers and the Brazilian Petroleum and Gas Institute (IBP). So far, Equinor is party to two of the cases. At year-end 2021, the maximum exposure for Equinor in these various matters has been estimated to a total of USD 112 million, the main part of which will likely have to be deposited with the relevant authorities in 2022 to avoid losing ICMS tax incentives while litigation is ongoing. Equinor is of the opinion that the laws in question are unconstitutional, especially for Repetro incentives, and that this will be upheld in future legal proceedings. No amounts have consequently been provided for in the financial statements.\n\n## KKD oil sands partnership\n\nCanadian tax authorities have issued a notice of reassessment for 2014 for Equinor's Canadian subsidiary which was party to Equinor's divestment of 40 % of the KKD Oil Sands partnership at that time. The reassessment, which has been appealed, adjusts the allocation of the proceeds of disposition of certain Canadian resource properties from the partnership. Maximum exposure is estimated to be approximately USD 397 million. The appeal process with the Canadian tax authorities, as well as any subsequent litigation that may become necessary, may take several years. No taxes will become payable until the matter has been finally settled. Equinor is of the view that all applicable tax regulations have been applied in the case and that Equinor has a strong position. No amounts have consequently been provided for in the financial statements.\n\n## Deviation notices and disputes with Norwegian tax authorities\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, Equinor received a decision from the Norwegian tax authorities related to the capital structure of the subsidiary Equinor Service Center Belgium N.V. The decision concludes that the capital structure has to be based on the arm length's principle and the decision covers the fiscal years 2012 to 2016. Maximum exposure is estimated to be approximately USD 182 million, for which Equinor has received a claim that was settled in 2021. Equinor has brought the case to court and if Equinor's view prevails, the tax payment will be refunded. It continues to be Equinor's view that the group has a strong position, and at year-end 2021, no amounts have consequently been expensed in the financial statements.\n\nEquinor has an ongoing dispute regarding the level of Research & Development cost to be allocated to the offshore tax regime. Based on Equinor's correspondence with the Norwegian tax authorities in the matter and the Petroleum Taxation Appeal Board's decision regarding some of the income years, the maximum exposure in this matter is estimated to approximately USD 206 million. Equinor has provided for its best estimate in the matter.\n\nThe Oil Taxation Office has challenged the internal pricing of certain products of natural gas liquids sold from Equinor Energy AS to Equinor ASA in the years 2011-2020. During 2021 there has been development is various elements of the case, where parts of the exposure are resolved, while for another element, a first-tier court decision ruled in Equinor's favour but has been appealed. Second level court proceedings are scheduled in June 2022. Other parts of the dispute remain outstanding. Where relevant, exposure for the period 2020-2021 has been added. Following these developments, which did not impact the Consolidated statement of income significantly, the maximum exposure regarding the gas liquid pricing remains at an estimated USD 100 million. Equinor has provided for its best estimate in the matter.\n\n## Other claims\n\nDuring the normal course of its business, Equinor is involved in legal proceedings, and several other unresolved claims are currently outstanding. The ultimate liability or asset, in respect of such litigation and claims cannot be determined at this time. Equinor has provided in its Consolidated financial statements for probable liabilities related to litigation and claims based on its best estimate. Equinor does not expect that its financial position, results of operations or cash flows will be materially affected by the resolution of these legal proceedings. Equinor is actively pursuing the above disputes through the contractual and legal means available in each case, but the timing of the ultimate resolutions and related cash flows, if any, cannot at present be determined with sufficient reliability.\n\nProvisions related to claims other than those related to income tax are reflected within note 21 Provisions and other liabilities. Uncertain income tax related liabilities are reflected as current tax payables or deferred tax liabilities as appropriate, while uncertain tax assets are reflected as current or deferred tax assets.",

        "page_content": "## 25 Related parties\n\n## Transactions with the Norwegian State\n\nThe Norwegian State is the majority shareholder of Equinor and also holds major investments in other Norwegian companies. As of 31 December 2021, the Norwegian State had an ownership interest in Equinor of 67.0% (excluding Folketrygdfondet, the Norwegian national insurance fund, of 3.7%). This ownership structure means that Equinor participates in transactions with many parties that are under a common ownership structure and therefore meet the definition of a related party. The Minister of Trade, Industry and Fisheries took over the constitutional responsibility for following-up of the Norwegian State's ownership in Equinor with effect from 1 July 2021. The responsibility for the Norwegian State's shareholding in Equinor has been transferred from the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy to the Ministry of Trade and Industry on 1 January 2022.\n\nTotal purchases of oil and natural gas liquids from the Norwegian State amounted to USD 9.572 billion, USD 5.108 billion and USD 7.505 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Total purchases of natural gas regarding the Tjeldbergodden methanol plant from the Norwegian State amounted to USD 0.088 billion, USD 0.018 billion and USD 0.036 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These purchases of oil and natural gas are recorded in Equinor ASA. In addition, Equinor ASA sells in its own name, but for the Norwegian State's account and risk, the Norwegian State's gas production. These transactions are presented net. For further information please see note 2 Significant accounting policies. The most significant items included in the line-item Payables to equity accounted associated companies and other related parties in note 22 Trade and other payables, are amounts payable to the Norwegian State for these purchases.\n\nThe line-item Prepayments and Financial Receivables includes USD 0.435 billion which represent a gross receivable from the Norwegian state under the Marketing Instruction in relation to the state's (SDFI) expected participation in the gas sales activities of a foreign subsidiary of Equinor. At year end 2020 the corresponding amount was USD 0.169 billion.\n\nIn July 2021 Equinor launched the first tranche of around USD 300 million of the new share buy-back programme, for 2021, totaling USD 600 million. For more details, please see note 18 Shareholder's equity and dividends.\n\n## Other transactions\n\nIn relation to it ordinary business operations Equinor enters into contracts such as pipeline transport, gas storage and processing of petroleum products, with companies in which Equinor has ownership interests. Such transactions are included within the applicable captions in the Consolidated statement of income. Gassled and certain other infrastructure assets are operated by Gassco AS, which is an entity under common control by the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy. Gassco's activities are performed on behalf of and for the risk and reward of pipeline and terminal owners, and capacity payments flow through Gassco to the respective owners. Equinor payments that flowed through Gassco in this respect amounted to USD 1.030 billion, USD 0.896 billion and USD 1.076 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These payments are mainly recorded in Equinor ASA. The stated amounts represent Equinor's capacity payment net of Equinor's own ownership interests in Gassco operated infrastructure. In addition, Equinor ASA manages, in its own name, but for the Norwegian State's account and risk, the Norwegian State's share of the Gassco costs. These transactions are presented net.\n\nEquinor has had transactions with other associated companies and joint ventures in relation to its ordinary business operations, for which amounts have not been disclosed due to materiality.\n\nEquinor leases two office buildings, located in Bergen and Harstad, owned by Equinor's pension fund ('Equinor Pensjon'). The lease contracts extend to the years 2034 and 2037 and Equinor ASA has recognised lease liabilities of USD 284 million related to these contracts.\n\nRelated party transactions with management are presented in note 7 Remuneration .\n\n## Financial statements and supplements\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes",

For Equinor this category will, in most cases, only be relevant for investments in listed equity securities and government bonds.\n\nLevel 2, fair value based on inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1, which are derived from observable market transactions, includes Equinor's non-standardised contracts for which fair values are determined on the basis of price inputs from observable market transactions. This will typically be when Equinor uses forward prices on crude oil, natural gas, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as inputs to the valuation models to determine the fair value of it derivative financial instruments.\n\nLevel 3, fair value based on unobservable inputs, includes financial instruments for which fair values are determined on the basis of input and assumptions that are not from observable market transactions. The fair values presented in this category are mainly based on internal assumptions. The internal assumptions are only used in the absence of quoted prices from an active market or other observable price inputs for the financial instruments subject to the valuation.\n\nThe fair value of certain earn-out agreements and embedded derivative contracts are determined by the use of valuation techniques with price inputs from observable market transactions as well as internally generated price assumptions and volume profiles. The discount rate used in the valuation is a risk-free rate based on the applicable currency and time horizon of the underlying cash flows adjusted for a credit premium to reflect either Equinor's credit premium, if the value is a liability, or an estimated counterparty credit premium if the value is an asset. In addition, a risk premium for risk elements not adjusted for in the cash flow may be included when applicable. The fair values of these derivative financial instruments have been classified in their entirety in the third category within current derivative financial instruments and non-current derivative financial instruments. Another reasonable assumption, that could have been applied when determining the fair value of these contracts, would be to extrapolate the last relevant forward prices with inflation. If Equinor had applied this assumption, the fair value of the contracts included would have increased by approximately USD 0.4 billion at end of 2021, while at end of 2020 the impact was approximately USD 0.1 billion.\n\nThe reconciliation of the changes in fair value during 2021 and 2020 for financial instruments classified as level 3 in the hierarchy is presented in the following table.",

The USD 108 million recognised in the Consolidated statement of income during 2021 are mainly related to changes in fair value of certain earn-out agreements where USD 20 million included in the opening balance for 2021 has been fully realised as the underlying volumes have been delivered during 2021.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis of market risk\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nThe table below contains the commodity price risk sensitivities of Equinor's commodity based derivatives contracts. For further information related to the type of commodity risks and how Equinor manages these risks, see note 6 Financial risk and capital management.\n\nEquinor's assets and liabilities resulting from commodity based derivatives contracts consist of both exchange traded and non-exchange traded instruments, including embedded derivatives that have been bifurcated and recognised at fair value in the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\nPrice risk sensitivities at the end of 2021 and 2020 at 30% are assumed to represent a reasonably possible change based on the duration of the derivatives. Since none of the derivative financial instruments included in the table below are part of hedging relationships, any changes in the fair value would be recognised in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\n| Commodity price sensitivity                         | At 31 December   | At 31 December   | At 31 December   | At 31 December   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                                                     | 2021             | 2021             | 2020             | 2020             |\n| (in USD million)                                    | - 30%            | + 30%            | - 30%            | + 30%            |\n| Crude oil and refined products net gains/(losses)   | 735              | (735)            | 1,025            | (1,025)          |\n| Natural gas, electricity and CO2 net gains/(losses) | 227              | (141)            | 184              | (94)             |",

As of 31 December 2020, a change of 8% in the most relevant foreign currency exchange rates were viewed as a reasonable possible change. With reference to table below, an increase in the foreign currency exchange rates means that the disclosed currency has strengthened in value against all other currencies.

On 28 February 2022, Equinor announced it has decided to stop new investments into Russia and start the process of exiting Equinor's joint arrangements in Russia following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. At the end of 2021, Equinor had USD 1.2 billion in non-current assets in Russia within the E&P International segment. Equinor has reported net proved reserves of 88 million boe related to investments in Russia as at 31 December 2021 and an entitlement production in 2021 of 21.6 mboe/d. Equinor expects that the process of exiting the joint arrangements in Russia will result in impairments.",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements and supplements\n\nSupplementary oil and gas information\n\n## 4.2 Supplementary oil and gas information (unaudited)\n\nIn accordance with the US Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification \"Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas\" (Topic 932), Equinor is reporting certain supplemental disclosures about oil and gas exploration and production operations. While this information is developed with reasonable care and disclosed in good faith, it is emphasised that some of the data is necessarily imprecise and represents only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgement involved in developing such information. Accordingly, this information may not necessarily represent the present financial condition of Equinor or its expected future results.\n\nFor further information regarding the reserves estimation requirement, see note 2 Significant accounting policies - Estimation uncertainty regarding determining oil and gas reserves and Estimation uncertainty; Proved oil and gas reserves.\n\nThe effective date of the recently announced agreement to divest our interests in the Corrib field in Ireland is 1 January 2022. This will result in an estimated reduction in proved reserves of 13 million boe at year-end 2022.\n\nEquinor's intention to exit its business activities in Russia is expected to reduce the net proved reserves in Eurasia excluding Norway by 88 million boe. No other events have occurred since 31 December 2021 that would result in a significant change in the estimated proved reserves or other figures reported as of that date.\n\nFor information related to the Agbami redetermination process and the dispute between the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and the partners in Oil Mining Lease (OML) 128 concerning certain terms of the OML 128 Production Sharing Contract (PSC), see note 24 Other commitments, contingent liabilities and contingent assets to the Consolidated financial statements. The effect of the redetermination on proved reserves, which is estimated to be immaterial, is not yet included.\n\n## Proved oil and gas reserves\n\nEquinor's proved oil and gas reserves have been estimated by its qualified professionals in accordance with industry standards under the requirements of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X. Statements of reserves are forward-looking statements. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible-from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations-prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.\n\nThe determination of these reserves is part of an ongoing process subject to continual revision as additional information becomes available. Estimates of proved reserve quantities are dynamic and change over time as new information becomes available. Moreover, identified reserves and contingent resources that may become proved in the future are excluded from the calculations.\n\nEquinor's proved reserves are recognised under various forms of contractual agreements, including production sharing agreements (PSAs) where Equinor's share of reserves can vary due to commodity prices or other factors. Reserves from agreements such as PSAs are based on the volumes to which Equinor has access (cost oil and profit oil), limited to available market access. At 31 December 2021, 6% of total proved reserves were related to such agreements, representing 11% of the oil, condensate and NGL reserves and 1% of the gas reserves. This compares with 5% of total proved reserves for both 2020 and 2019. Net entitlement oil and gas production from fields with such agreements was 49 million boe during 2021, compared to 59 million boe for 2020 and 68 million boe for 2019. Equinor participates in such agreements in Algeria, Angola, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Libya, Nigeria and Russia 1 .\n\nEquinor is recording, as proved reserves, volumes equivalent to our tax liabilities under negotiated fiscal arrangements (PSAs) where the tax is paid on behalf of Equinor. Reserves are net of royalty volumes in the US and net of royalty paid in-kind in PSA fields. Proved reserves does not include quantities consumed during production.\n\nRule 4-10 of Regulation S-X requires that the estimation of reserves is based on existing economic conditions, including a 12-month average price determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-of-the month price for each month within the reporting period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Volume weighted average prices for the total Equinor portfolio, and the Brent blend price, is presented in the following table:",

The positive revisions due to price are in general a result of later economic cut-off. For fields with a production-sharing type of agreement this is to some degree offset by lower entitlement to the reserves. These changes are all included in the revision category in the tables below, giving a net increase of Equinor's proved reserves at year-end.\n\nFrom the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS), Equinor is responsible for managing, transporting and selling the Norwegian State's oil and gas on behalf of the Norwegian State's direct financial interest (SDFI). These reserves are sold in conjunction with the Equinor reserves. As part of this arrangement, Equinor delivers and sells gas to customers in accordance with various types of sales contracts on behalf of the SDFI. In order to fulfil the commitments, Equinor utilises a field supply schedule which provides the highest possible total value for the joint portfolio of oil and gas between Equinor and the SDFI.\n\nEquinor and the SDFI receive income from the joint natural gas sales portfolio based upon their respective share in the supplied volumes. For sales of the SDFI natural gas, to Equinor and to third parties, the payment to the Norwegian State is based on achieved prices, a net back formula calculated price or market value. All of the Norwegian State's oil and NGL is acquired by Equinor. The price Equinor pays to the SDFI for the crude oil is based on market reflective prices. The prices for NGL are either based on achieved prices, market value or market reflective prices.\n\nThe regulations of the owner's instruction, as described above, may be changed or withdrawn by the Equinor ASA's general meeting. Due to this uncertainty and the Norwegian State's estimate of proved reserves not being available to Equinor, it is not possible to determine the total quantities to be purchased by Equinor under the owner's instruction.\n\nTopic 932 requires the presentation of reserves and certain other supplemental oil and gas disclosures by geographic area, defined as country or continent containing 15% or more of total proved reserves. At 31 December 2021, Norway is the only country in this category, with 71% of the total proved reserves. Since the USA contained 16% of the proved reserves at the beginning of 2017, management has determined that the most meaningful presentation of geographical areas also in 2021 would be Norway, US, and the continents of Eurasia excluding Norway, Africa, and Americas excluding USA.\n\n## Proved reserves movements 2021\n\n## Norway\n\nThe increase of 465 million boe in revisions and improved recovery in Norway is the combined effect of positive revisions following increased certainty in the ultimate recovery at many fields, prolonged economic lifetime at several fields due to the increased commodity prices, and decisions to install low pressure production facilities increasing the future recovery at the Oseberg and Ormen Lange fields.\n\n## Eurasia excluding Norway\n\nThe net decrease of 16 million boe in equity accounted assets in the revisions and improved recovery category is related to proved reserves in Russia 23 , where negative revisions of 35 million boe due to reduced production potential in some areas was partially offset by positive revisions based on increased certainty in the expected ultimate recovery in other areas.\n\n## USA\n\nThe increase of 78 million boe in revisions and improved recovery is the combined effect of positive revisions following increased certainty in the ultimate recovery, and prolonged economic lifetime at several fields mainly due to the increase in commodity prices. Sale of petroleum in place of 89 million boe is a result of the divestment of our interests in the Bakken assets which was completed in 2021.\n\n## Americas excluding USA\n\nThe increase of 62 million boe in revisions and improved recovery are mainly related to proved reserves in Brazil and is the combined effect of positive revisions following increased certainty in the ultimate recovery, and prolonged economic lifetime due to the increased commodity prices. The increase of 210 million boe in extensions and discoveries is the result of sanctioning of the Bacalhau development in Brazil, and the 14 million boe of equity accounted additions in the same category represent drilling of new wells in previously unproven areas at the Bandurria Sur development in Argentina.",

This was mainly due to reduced activity levels as well as shorter economic field lifetime caused by reduced oil and gas prices. The reduced prices have also affected some of our Gulf of Mexico fields negatively. The increase of 101 million boe in extension and discoveries was the result of new wells drilled in previously unproven areas in our onshore developments.\n\n## Americas excl USA\n\nThe net decrease of 55 million boe in revisions and improved recovery was mainly due to shorter economic lifetime for fields in Brazil caused by the reduced oil prices. The equity accounted increase of 6 million boe in purchase of reserves-in-place is in Argentina.\n\n## Proved reserves movements 2019\n\n## Norway\n\nThe decrease of 66 million boe (equity accounted) was due to a divestment of a 16% shareholding in Lundin after which Equinor no longer carried any equity accounted proved reserves in Norway in 2019.\n\n## Eurasia excl Norway\n\nThe net increase of 52 million boe in revisions and improved recovery was mainly related to positive revisions on fields in the UK but did also include some additional volumes from an increased recovery project in Azerbaijan. The increase of 110 million boe in extensions and discoveries (equity accounted) was in Russia 24 where a new development project was sanctioned.\n\n## Africa\n\nThe net increase of 25 million boe in revisions and improved recovery was mainly due to positive revisions on several fields with production sharing agreements in Algeria and Angola.\n\n## USA\n\nThe increase of 126 mill boe in extensions and discoveries was due to continued drilling of new wells in previously undrilled areas in our onshore developments.\n\nChanges to the proved reserves in 2021 are also described by each geographic area in section 2.10 Operational performance, Proved oil and gas reserves. Development of the proved undeveloped reserves is described in section 2.10 Operational performance, Development of reserves.\n\nThe following tables reflect the estimated proved reserves of oil and gas at 31 December 2018 through 20201 and the changes therein.\n\n## Financial statements and supplements\n\n## Supplementary oil and gas information",

Production cost is based on operating expenses related to production of oil and gas. From the operating expenses certain expenses such as; transportation costs, accruals for over/underlift position and royalty payments costs are excluded. These expenses and mainly upstream business administration are included as other expenses in the tables below. Other revenues mainly consist of gains and losses from sales of oil and gas interests and gains and losses from commodity-based derivatives within the upstream segments.\n\nIncome tax expense is calculated on the basis of statutory tax rates adjusted for uplift and tax credits. No deductions are made for interest or other elements not included in the table below.\n\n## Consolidated companies\n\n| (in USD million)                                     | Norway   | Eurasia  excluding  Norway   | Africa   | USA     | Americas  excluding  USA   | Total    |\n|------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------|----------|---------|----------------------------|----------|\n| Full year 2021                                       |          |                              |          |         |                            |          |\n| Sales                                                | 97       | 476                          | 638      | 207     | 16                         | 1,434    |\n| Transfers                                            | 38,578   | 960                          | 2,021    | 3,712   | 1,249                      | 46,520   |\n| Other revenues                                       | 711      | (14)                         | 0        | 221     | 14                         | 932      |\n| Total revenues                                       | 39,386   | 1,422                        | 2,659    | 4,140   | 1,279                      | 48,886   |\n| Exploration expenses                                 | (363)    | (108)                        | 23       | (211)   | (362)                      | (1,021)  |\n| Production costs                                     | (2,600)  | (196)                        | (497)    | (397)   | (378)                      | (4,068)  |\n| Depreciation, amortisation and net impairment losses | (4,900)  | (2,462)                      | (444)    | (1,734) | (416)                      | (9,956)  |\n| Other expenses                                       | (1,052)  | (140)                        | 53       | (674)   | (292)                      | (2,105)  |\n| Total costs                                          | (8,915)  | (2,906)                      | (865)    | (3,016) | (1,448)                    | (17,150) |\n| Results of operations before tax                     | 30,471   | (1,484)                      | 1,794    | 1,124   | (169)                      | 31,736   |\n| Tax expense                                          | (22,887) | 835                          | (652)    | (14)    | (201)                      | (22,919) |\n| Results of operations                                | 7,585    | (649)                        | 1,142    | 1,110   | (370)                      | 8,817    |\n| Net income/(loss) from equity accounted investments  | 0        | 176                          | 0        | 0       | 39                         | 215      |",

The analysis is computed in accordance with Topic 932, by applying average market prices as defined by the SEC, year-end costs, year-end statutory tax rates and a discount factor of 10% to year-end quantities of net proved reserves. The standardised measure of discounted future net cash flows is a forward-looking statement.\n\nFuture price changes are limited to those provided by existing contractual arrangements at the end of each reporting year. Future development and production costs are those estimated future expenditures necessary to develop and produce year-end estimated proved reserves based on year-end cost indices, assuming continuation of year-end economic conditions. Pre-tax future net cash flow is net of decommissioning and removal costs. Estimated future income taxes are calculated by applying the appropriate year-end statutory tax rates. These rates reflect allowable deductions and tax credits and are applied to estimated future pre-tax net cash flows, less the tax basis of related assets. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using a discount rate of 10% per year. Discounting requires a year-by-year estimate of when future expenditures will be incurred and when reserves will be produced. The standardised measure of discounted future net cash flows prescribed under Topic 932 requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of future development and production costs and income from the production of proved reserves. The information does not represent management's estimate or Equinor's expected future cash flows or the value of its proved reserves and therefore should not be relied upon as an indication of Equinor's future cash flow or value of its proved reserves.",

The 'Net change in sales and transfer prices and in production (lifting) costs related to future production' is, on the other hand, related to the future net cash flows at 31 December 2020. The proved reserves at 31 December 2020 were multiplied by the actual change in price, and change in unit of production costs, to arrive at the net effect of changes in price and production costs. Development costs and taxes are reflected in the line items 'Change in estimated future development costs' and 'Net change in income taxes' and are not included in the 'Net change in sales and transfer prices and in production (lifting) costs related to future production'.",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements and supplements\n\nParent company financial statements and notes\n\n## Notes to the Financial statements Equinor ASA\n\n## 1 Organisation and significant accounting policies\n\nEquinor ASA is the parent company of the Equinor Group (Equinor), consisting of Equinor ASA and its subsidiaries. Equinor ASA's main activities include shareholding in group companies, group management, corporate functions and group financing. Equinor ASA also carries out activities related to external sales of oil and gas products, purchased externally or from group companies, including related refinery and transportation activities. Reference is made to disclosure note 1 Organisation in Equinor's Consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe financial statements of Equinor ASA (\"the company\") are prepared in accordance with simplified IFRS pursuant to the Norwegian Accounting Act \u00a73-9 and regulations regarding simplified application of IFRS issued by the Norwegian Ministry of Finance on 3 November 2014. The presentation currency of Equinor ASA is US dollar (USD), consistent with the presentation currency for the group financial statements and with the company's functional currency, as USD is the currency for which Equinor's operations are mainly linked to. Translation currency rates (NOK/USD) applicable for the period are as follows: 8.53 (31 December 2020), 8.82 (31 December 2021) and 8.60 (year-average).\n\nThese parent company financial statements should be read in connection with the Consolidated financial statements of Equinor, published together with these financial statements. With the exceptions described below, Equinor ASA applies the accounting policies of the group, as described in Equinor's disclosure note 2 Significant Accounting Policies, and reference is made to this note for further details. Insofar that the company applies policies that are not described in the Equinor note due to group level materiality considerations, such policies are included below if necessary for a sufficient understanding of Equinor ASA's accounts.\n\n## Subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures\n\nShareholdings and interests in subsidiaries and associated companies (companies in which Equinor ASA does not have control, or joint control, but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, generally when the ownership share is between 20% and 50%), as well as Equinor ASA's participation in joint arrangements that are joint ventures, are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment is carried on the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in Equinor ASA's share of net assets of the entity, less distribution received and less any impairment in value of the investment. Goodwill may arise as the surplus of the cost of investment over Equinor ASA's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, joint venture or associate. Goodwill included in the balance sheets of subsidiaries and associated companies is tested for impairment as part of the related investment in the subsidiary or associated company. The Statement of income reflects Equinor ASA's share of the results after tax of an equity accounted entity, adjusted to account for depreciation, amortisation and any impairment of the equity accounted entity's assets based on their fair values at the date of acquisition in situations where Equinor ASA has not been the owner since the establishment of the entity. Net income/loss from equity accounted investments is presented as part of Total revenues and other income, as these investments in other companies engaged in energy-related business activities are considered part of Equinor ASA's main operating activities.\n\nReserves for valuation variances included within the Company's equity are established based on the sum of contributions from the individual equity accounted investment, with the limitation that the net amount cannot be negative.\n\n## Expenses related to the Equinor group as operator of joint operations and similar arrangements (licences)\n\nIndirect operating expenses incurred by the company, such as personnel expenses, are accumulated in cost pools. Such expenses are allocated in part on hours incurred cost basis to Equinor Energy AS, to other group companies and to licences where Equinor Energy AS or other group companies are operators. Costs allocated in this manner reduce the expenses in the company's statement of income, with the exception of operating subleases and cost recharges related to lease liabilities being recognised gross, which are presented as revenues in Equinor ASA.\n\n## Asset transfers between the company and its subsidiaries\n\nTransfers of assets and liabilities between the company and the entities that it directly or indirectly controls are accounted for at the carrying amounts (continuity) of the assets and liabilities transferred, when the transfer is part of a reorganisation within the Equinor group.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nEmbedded derivatives within sales or purchase contracts between Equinor ASA and other companies within the Equinor group are not separated from the host contract.",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements and supplements\n\nParent company financial statements and notes\n\n## Dividends payable and group contributions\n\nDividends are reflected as Dividends payable within current liabilities. Group contributions for the year to other entities within Equinor's Norwegian tax group are reflected in the balance sheet as current liabilities within Liabilities to group companies. Under simplified IFRS the presentation of dividends payable and payable group contributions differs from the presentation under IFRS, as it also includes dividends and group contributions payable which at the date of the balance sheet is subject to a future annual general meeting approval before distribution.\n\n## Reserves for unrealised gains\n\nReserves for unrealised gains included within the Company's equity consists of accumulated unrealised gains on non-exchange traded financial instruments and the fair value of embedded derivatives, with the limitation that the net amount cannot be negative.\n\n## 2 Financial risk management and measurement of financial instruments\n\n## General information relevant to financial risks\n\nEquinor ASA's activities expose the company to market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, and the management of such risks does not substantially differ from the group's. See note 6 Financial risk and capital management in the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Measurement of financial instruments by categories\n\nThe following tables present Equinor ASA's classes of financial instruments and their carrying amounts by the categories as they are defined in IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement. For financial investments, the difference, between measurement as defined by IFRS 9 categories and measurement at fair value, is immaterial. For trade and other receivables and payables, and cash and cash equivalents, the carrying amounts are considered a reasonable approximation of fair value.\n\nSee note 19 Finance debt in the Consolidated financial statements, for fair value information of non-current bonds and bank loans and note 26 Financial instruments: fair value measurement and sensitivity analysis of market risk in the Consolidated financial statements where fair value measurement is explained in detail. See note 2 Significant accounting policies in the Consolidated financial statements for further information regarding measurement of fair values.",

At 31 December 2020, a change of 8% in the main foreign currency exchange rates were viewed as a reasonable possible change. With reference to table below, an increase in the foreign currency exchange rates means that the disclosed currency has strengthened in value against all other currencies. The estimated gains and the estimated losses following from a change in the foreign currency exchange rates would impact the company's statement of income.\n\nCurrency risk sensitivity for Equinor ASA mainly differ from currency risk sensitivity in Group due to interest bearing receivables and liabilities from/to subsidiaries.

Reference is made to the section Remuneration report for a detailed description of the remuneration and remuneration policy for executive management applicable for the years 2021 and 2022.\n\n## Severance pay arrangements\n\nThe chief executive officer and the executive vice presidents are entitled to a severance payment equivalent to six months' salary, commencing after the six months' notice period, when the resignation is requested by the company. The same amount of severance payment is also payable if the parties agree that the employment should be discontinued, and the executive vice president gives notice pursuant to a written agreement with the company. Any other payment earned by the executive vice president during the period of severance payment will be fully deducted. This relates to earnings from any employment or business activity where the executive vice president has active ownership.\n\nThe entitlement to severance payment is conditional on the chief executive officer or the executive vice president not being guilty of gross misconduct, gross negligence, disloyalty or other material breach of his/her duties.\n\nAs a general rule, the chief executive officer's/executive vice president's own notice will not instigate any severance payment.\n\n## 5 Share-based compensation\n\nEquinor's share saving plan provides employees with the opportunity to purchase Equinor shares through monthly salary deductions. If the shares are kept for two full calendar years of continued employment, following the year of purchase, the employees will be allocated one bonus share for each one they have purchased.\n\nEstimated compensation expense including the contribution by Equinor ASA for purchased shares, amounts vested for bonus shares granted and related social security tax was USD 70 million in 2021, and USD 67 million in 2020. For the 2022 programme (granted in 2021),  the estimated  compensation expense is USD 77  million. At 31 December 2021,  the amount of compensation cost yet to be expensed throughout the vesting period is USD 157 million.\n\n## 6 Auditor's remuneration\n\n## Auditor's remuneration\n\n| (in USD million, excluding VAT)   |   2021 |   2020 |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Audit fee Ernst & Young           |    6.9 |    5.8 |\n| Audit related fee Ernst & Young   |    0.1 |    0.3 |\n| Total remuneration                |    7.1 |    6.1 |\n\nThere are no fees incurred related to tax advice or other services.",

In October 2021 Equinor announced an increase in the second tranche of the new share buy-back programme, from initially USD 300 million to USD 1 000 million. For the first tranche Equinor entered into an irrevocable agreement with a third party for up to USD 99 million of shares to be purchased in the open market, while for the second tranche a similar irrevocable agreement with a third party was entered into for up to USD 330 million of shares to be purchased in the open market. For the first tranche around USD 201 million, and for the second tranche around USD 670 million worth of shares from the Norwegian State will in accordance with an agreement with the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy be redeemed at the next annual general meeting in May 2022, in order for the Norwegian State to maintain their ownership percentage in Equinor.\n\nThe first order in the open market was concluded in September 2021. The second order in the open market was concluded in January 2022. As of 31 December 2021, USD 99 million order from the first tranche has been acquired in the open market and the full amount has been settled, while USD 232 million of the USD 330 million second order has been acquired in the open market, of which USD 222 million has been settled.\n\nDue to the irrevocable agreement with the third party, both the first and second order in the open market, in total USD 429 million, has been recognised as a reduction in equity as treasury shares. The remaining order of the second tranche has been accrued for and along with acquired shares not settled, classified as Trade, other payables and provisions. The recognition of the State's share will be deferred until the decision at the annual general meeting in May 2022.",

Equinor ASA has guaranteed for its proportionate portion of an associate's long-term bank debt, payment obligations under the contracts and some third-party obligations, amounting to USD 314 million. The fair value and book value of the guarantees is immaterial.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nEquinor ASA is the participant in certain entities (\"DAs\") in which the company has unlimited responsibility for its proportionate share of such entities' liabilities, if any, and also participates in certain companies (\"ANSs\") in which the participants in addition have joint and several liabilities. For further details, see note 10 Investments in subsidiaries and other equity accounted investments.\n\n## Deviation notices from Norwegian tax authorities\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, Equinor received a decision from the Norwegian tax authorities related to the capital structure of the subsidiary Equinor Service Center Belgium N.V. The decision concludes that the capital structure has to be based on the arm length's principle and the decision covers the fiscal years 2012 to 2016. Maximum exposure is estimated to be approximately USD 182 million, for which Equinor has received a claim that was settled in 2021. Equinor has brought the case to court and if Equinor's view prevails, the tax payment will be refunded. It continues to be Equinor's view that the group has a strong position, and at year-end 2021 no amounts have consequently been expensed in the financial statements.\n\n## Other claims\n\nDuring the normal course of its business, Equinor ASA is involved in legal proceedings, and several other unresolved claims are currently outstanding. The ultimate liability or asset in respect of such litigation and claims cannot be determined at this time. Equinor ASA has provided in its financial statements for probable liabilities related to litigation and claims based on the company's best judgment. Equinor ASA does not expect that its financial position, results of operations or cash flows will be materially affected by the resolution of these legal proceedings.\n\nProvisions related to claims and disputes are reflected within note 18 Provisions and other liabilities.",

Equinor is also listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker code EQNR, trading in the form of American Depositary Shares (ADS).\n\nEquinor's shares have been listed on the Oslo B\u00f8rs and the New York Stock Exchange since our initial public offering on 18 June 2001. The ADSs traded on the New York Stock Exchange are evidenced by American Depositary Receipts (ADR), and each ADS represents one ordinary share.\n\n## Dividend policy and dividends\n\nIt is Equinor's ambition to grow the annual cash dividend measured in USD per share in line with long-term underlying earnings.\n\nEquinor's board approves first, second and third quarter interim dividends, based on an authorisation from the annual general\n\nmeeting (AGM), while the AGM approves the fourth quarter dividend and implicitly the total annual dividend based on a proposal from the board. It is Equinor's intention to pay quarterly dividends, although when deciding the interim dividends and recommending the total annual dividend level, the board will take into consideration expected cash flow, capital expenditure plans, financing requirements and appropriate financial flexibility.\n\nIn addition to cash dividend, Equinor might buy-back shares as part of total distribution of capital to the shareholders. The shareholders at the AGM may vote to reduce, but may not increase, the fourth quarter dividend proposed by the board of directors. Equinor announces dividend payments in connection with quarterly results. Payment of quarterly dividends is expected to take place within six months after the announcement of each quarterly dividend.\n\nThe following table shows the cash dividend amounts to all shareholders since 2017 on a per share basis and in aggregate.\n\n|             | Ordinary dividend per share   | Ordinary dividend per share   | Ordinary dividend per share   | Ordinary dividend per share   | Ordinary dividend per share   | Ordinary dividend per share   | Ordinary dividend per share   | Ordinary dividend per share   |       | Ordinary            |\n|-------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------|---------------------|\n| Fiscal year | Curr.                         | Q1                            | Curr.                         | Q2                            | Curr.                         | Q3                            | Curr.                         | Q4                            | Curr. | dividend  per share |\n| 2017        | USD                           | 0.2201                        | USD                           | 0.2201                        | USD                           | 0.2201                        |                               | USD  0.2300                   | USD   | 0.8903              |\n| 2018        | USD                           | 0.2300                        | USD                           | 0.2300                        |                               | USD  0.2300                   | USD                           | 0.2600                        | USD   | 0.9500              |\n| 2019        | USD                           | 0.2600                        | USD                           | 0.2600                        |                               | USD  0.2600                   | USD                           | 0.2700                        | USD   | 1.0500              |\n| 2020        | USD                           | 0.0900                        | USD                           | 0.0900                        | USD                           | 0.1100                        |                               | USD  0.1200                   | USD   | 0.4100              |\n| 2021        | USD                           | 0.1500                        | USD                           | 0.1800                        |                               | USD  0.1800                   |                               | USD  0.2000                   | USD   | 0.7100              |\n\nThe board of directors proposes to the AGM a cash dividend of USD 0.20 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021 and to introduce an extraordinary quarterly cash dividend of USD 0.20 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021 and for the first three quarters of 2022. The Equinor share will trade ex-dividend 12 May 2022 on OSE and for ADR holders on NYSE. Record date will be 13 May 2022 on OSE and NYSE. Payment date will be 27 May 2022.\n\nDividends in NOK per share will be calculated and communicated four business days after record date for shareholders at Oslo B\u00f8rs. The NOK dividend will be based on average USD/NOK exchange rates from Norges Bank in the period plus/minus three business days from record date, in total seven business dates.\n\n## Share buy-back\n\nFor the period 2013-2021, the board of directors has been authorised by the annual general meeting of Equinor to repurchase Equinor shares in the market for subsequent annulment. It is Equinor's intention to renew this authorisation at the annual general meeting in May 2022.\n\nOn 14 June 2021 the board of directors of Equinor ASA launched an indicative USD 600 million programme for 2021 and an indicative annual share buy-back programme of up to USD 1.2 billion starting from 2022, subject to board approvals before starting tranches. The first tranche was approved by the board of directors of Equinor ASA on 27 July 2021 with market operations of USD 99 million and commenced on 28 July 2021 and ended 28 September 2021. The second tranche of the market operations of the programme of USD 330 million were approved by the board of directors of Equinor ASA on 26 October and commenced on 27 October 2021 and ended 31 January 2022. The share buy-back programme is expected to be executed when Brent oil prices are in or above the range of 50-60 USD/bbl and Equinor's net debt ratio 25 stays within the communicated ambition of 15-30% and this is supported by commodity prices.",

The purpose of this plan is to strengthen the business culture and encourage loyalty through employees becoming part-owners of the company.\n\nThrough regular salary deductions, employees can invest up to 5% of their base salary in Equinor shares. In addition, the company contributes 20% of the total share investment made by employees in Norway, up to a maximum of NOK 1,500 per year (approximately USD 175). This company contribution is a\n\ntax-free employee benefit under 2021 Norwegian tax legislation. The company will contribute in 2022 but as a taxable income. After a lock-in period of two calendar years, one extra share will be awarded for each share purchased. Under current Norwegian tax legislation, the share award is a taxable employee benefit, with a value equal to the value of the shares and taxed at the time of the award.\n\nThe board of directors is authorised to acquire Equinor shares in the market on behalf of the company.

Morgan as depositary, the company is required to repay to JPMorgan certain amounts paid to the company in prior periods.\n\n## Taxation\n\n## Norwegian tax consequences\n\nThis section describes material Norwegian tax consequences for shareholders in connection with the acquisition, ownership and disposal of shares and American Depositary Shares ('ADS') in Equinor. The term 'shareholders' refers to both holders of shares and holders of ADSs, unless otherwise explicitly stated.\n\nThe outline does not provide a complete description of all Norwegian tax regulations that might be relevant (i.e. for investors to whom special regulations may apply, including shareholders that carry on business activities in Norway, and whose shares or ADSs are effectively connected with such business activities), and is based on current law and practice. Shareholders should consult their professional tax advisers for advice about individual tax consequences.\n\n## Taxation of dividends received by Norwegian shareholders\n\nCorporate shareholders (i.e. limited liability companies and similar entities) residing in Norway for tax purposes are generally subject to tax in Norway on dividends received from Norwegian companies. The basis for taxation is 3% of the dividends received, which is subject to the standard income tax rate of 22%.\n\nIndividual shareholders residing in Norway for tax purposes are subject to the standard income tax rate of 22% for dividend income exceeding a basic tax free allowance. However, dividend income exceeding the basic tax free allowance is grossed up with a factor of 1.44 before being included in the ordinary taxable income, resulting in an effective tax rate of 31.68% (22% x 1.44) for the income year 2021. The tax free allowance is computed for each individual share or ADS and corresponds as a rule to the cost price of that share or ADS multiplied by an annual risk-free interest rate. Any part of the calculated allowance for one year that exceeds the dividend distributed for the share or ADS ('unused allowance') may be carried forward and set off against future dividends received on (or gains upon the realisation of, see below) the same share or ADS. Any unused allowance will also be added to the basis for computation of the allowance for the same share or ADS the following year.\n\nIndividual shareholders residing in Norway for tax purposes may hold the listed shares in companies resident within the EEA through a stock savings account. Dividend on shares owned through the stock savings account is only taxable when the dividend is withdrawn from the account.\n\n## Taxation of dividends received by foreign shareholders\n\nNon-resident shareholders are as a starting point subject to Norwegian withholding tax at a rate of 25% on dividends from Norwegian companies. The distributing company is responsible for deducting the withholding tax upon distribution to nonresident shareholders.\n\nCorporate shareholders that carry on business activities in Norway, and whose shares or ADSs are effectively connected with such activities are not subject to withholding tax. For such shareholders, 3% of the received dividends are subject to the standard income tax of 22%.\n\nCertain other important exceptions and modifications are outlined below.\n\nThe withholding tax does not apply to corporate shareholders in the EEA that are comparable to Norwegian limited liability companies or certain other types of Norwegian entities, and are further able to demonstrate that they are genuinely established and carry on genuine economic business activity within the EEA, provided that Norway is entitled to receive information from the country of residence pursuant to a tax treaty or other international treaty. If no such treaty exists with the country of residence, the shareholder may instead present confirmation issued by the tax authorities of the country of residence verifying the documentation.\n\nThe withholding rate of 25% is often reduced in tax treaties between Norway and other countries. The reduced withholding tax rate will generally only apply to dividends paid on shares held by shareholders who are able to properly demonstrate that they are the beneficial owner and entitled to the benefits of the tax treaty.\n\nIndividual shareholders residing for tax purposes in the EEA may apply to the Norwegian tax authorities for a refund if the tax withheld by the distributing company exceeds the tax that would have been levied on individual shareholders resident in Norway.\n\nIndividual shareholders residing for tax purposes in the EEA may hold the listed shares in companies resident within the EEA through a stock savings account. Dividend on shares owned through the stock savings account will only be subject to withholding tax when withdrawn from the account.\n\n## Procedure for claiming a reduced withholding tax rate on dividends:\n\nA foreign shareholder that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax on dividends, may request that the exemption or reduction is applied at source by the distributor. Such request must be accompanied by satisfactory documentation which supports that the foreign shareholder is entitled to a reduced withholding tax rate. Specific documentation requirements apply.\n\nFor holders of shares and ADSs deposited with JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. (JPMorgan), documentation establishing that the holder is eligible for the benefits under a tax treaty with Norway, may be provided to JPMorgan. JPMorgan has been granted permission by the Norwegian tax authorities to receive dividends from us for redistribution to a beneficial owner of shares and ADSs at the applicable treaty withholding rate.\n\nThe statutory 25% withholding tax rate will be levied on dividends paid to shareholders (either directly or through a depositary) who have not provided the relevant documentation to the relevant party that they are eligible for a reduced rate. The beneficial owners will in this case have to apply to Skatteetaten (The Norwegian Tax Administration) for a refund of the excess amount of tax withheld. Please refer to the tax",

Capital losses are not deductible.\n\nIndividual shareholders residing in Norway for tax purposes are subject to tax in Norway on the sale, redemption or other disposal of shares or ADSs. Gains or losses in connection with such realisation are included in the individual's ordinary taxable income in the year of disposal, which is subject to the standard income tax rate of 22%. However, the taxable gain or deductible loss is grossed up with a factor of 1.44 before included in the ordinary taxable income, resulting in an effective tax rate of 31.68% (22% x 1.44) for the income year 2021.\n\nThe taxable gain or deductible loss (before gross up) is calculated as the sales price adjusted for transaction expenses minus the taxable basis. A shareholder's tax basis is normally equal to the acquisition cost of the shares or ADSs. Any unused allowance pertaining to a share may be deducted from a taxable gain on the same share or ADS but may not lead to or increase a deductible loss. Furthermore, any unused allowance may not be set off against gains from the realisation of the other shares or ADSs.\n\nIf a shareholder disposes of shares or ADSs acquired at different times, the shares or ADSs that were first acquired will be deemed to be first sold (the 'FIFO' principle) when calculating gain or loss for tax purposes.\n\nIndividual shareholders residing in Norway for tax purposes may hold listed shares in companies resident within the EEA through a stock savings account. Gain on shares owned through the stock savings account will only be taxable when withdrawn from the account whereas loss on shares will be deductible when the account is terminated.\n\nA corporate shareholder or an individual shareholder who ceases to be tax resident in Norway due to Norwegian law or tax treaty provisions may, in certain circumstances, become subject to Norwegian exit taxation on unrealised capital gains related to shares or ADSs.\n\nShareholders not residing in Norway are generally not subject to tax in Norway on capital gains, and losses are not deductible on the sale, redemption or other disposal of shares or ADSs in Norwegian companies, unless the shareholder carries on business activities in Norway and such shares or ADSs are or have been effectively connected with such activities.\n\n## Wealth tax\n\nThe shares or ADSs are included in the basis for the computation of wealth tax imposed on individuals residing in Norway for tax purposes. Norwegian limited liability companies and certain similar entities are not subject to wealth tax. The marginal wealth tax rate for the income year 2021 is 0.85% of the value assessed. The assessment value of listed shares (including ADSs) is 55% of the listed value of such shares or ADSs on1 January 2022.\n\nNon-resident shareholders are not subject to wealth tax in Norway for shares and ADSs in Norwegian limited liability companies unless the shareholder is an individual and the shareholding is effectively connected with the individual's business activities in Norway.\n\n## Inheritance tax and gift tax\n\nNo inheritance or gift tax is imposed in Norway.\n\n## Transfer tax\n\nNo transfer tax is imposed in Norway in connection with the sale or purchase of shares or ADSs.\n\n## United States tax matters\n\nThis section describes the material United States federal income tax consequences for US holders (as defined below) of the ownership and disposition of shares or ADSs. It only applies to you if you hold your shares or ADSs as capital assets for United States federal income tax purposes. This discussion addresses only United States federal income taxation and does not discuss all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to you in light of your individual circumstances, including foreign, state or local tax consequences, estate and gift tax consequences, and tax consequences arising under the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the alternative minimum tax. This section does not apply to you if you are a member of a special class of holders subject to special rules, including dealers in securities, traders in securities that elect to use a mark-tomarket method of accounting for securities holdings, tax-exempt organisations, insurance companies, partnerships or entities or arrangements that are treated as partnerships for United States federal income tax purposes, persons that actually or constructively own 10% of the combined voting power of voting stock of Equinor or of the total value of stock of Equinor, persons that hold shares or ADSs as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction, persons that purchase or sell shares or ADSs as a part of a wash sale for tax purposes, or persons whose functional currency is not USD.\n\nThis section is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations, published rulings and court decisions, all as currently in effect, and the Convention between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Norway for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Property (the 'Treaty'). These laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. In addition, this section is based in part upon the representations of the depositary and the assumption that each obligation in the deposit agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms. For United States federal income tax purposes, if you hold ADRs evidencing ADSs, you will generally be treated as the owner of the ordinary shares represented by those ADRs. Exchanges of shares for ADRs and ADRs for shares will not generally be subject to United States federal income tax.\n\nA 'US holder' is a beneficial owner of shares or ADSs that is, for United States federal income tax purposes: (i) a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a United States domestic corporation; (iii) an estate whose income is subject to United States federal income tax regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if a United States court can exercise primary supervision over",

        "page_content": "## Additional information\n\nthe trust's administration and one or more United States persons are authorised to control all substantial decisions of the trust.\n\nYou should consult your own tax adviser regarding the United States federal, state and local and Norwegian and other tax consequences of owning and disposing of shares and ADSs in your particular circumstances.\n\nThe tax treatment of the shares or ADSs will depend in part on whether or not we are classified as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for United States federal income tax purposes. Except as discussed below, under '-PFIC rules', this discussion assumes that we are not classified as a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes.\n\n## Taxation of distributions\n\nUnder the United States federal income tax laws, the gross amount of any distribution (including any Norwegian tax withheld from the distribution payment) paid by Equinor out of its current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for United States federal income tax purposes), other than certain pro-rata distributions of its shares, will be treated as a dividend that is taxable for you when you, in the case of shares, or the depositary, in the case of ADSs, receive the dividend, actually or constructively. If you are a non-corporate US holder, dividends that constitute qualified dividend income will be eligible to be taxed at the preferential rates applicable to longterm capital gains as long as, in the year that you receive the dividend, the shares or ADSs are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States or Equinor is eligible for benefits under the Treaty. We believe that Equinor is currently eligible for the benefits of the Treaty and we therefore expect that dividends on the ordinary shares or ADSs will be qualified dividend income. To qualify for the preferential rates, you must hold the shares or ADSs for more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date and meet certain other requirements. The dividend will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to United States corporations in respect of dividends received from other United States corporations.\n\nThe amount of the dividend distribution that you must include in your income will be the value in USD of the payments made in NOK determined at the spot NOK/USD rate on the date the dividend distribution is includible in your income, regardless of whether or not the payment is in fact converted into USD. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for United States federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of your tax basis in the shares or ADSs and, to the extent in excess of your tax basis, will be treated as capital gain. However, Equinor does not expect to calculate earnings and profits in accordance with United States federal income tax principles. Accordingly, you should expect to generally treat distributions we make as dividends.\n\nSubject to certain limitations, the 15% Norwegian tax withheld in accordance with the Treaty and paid to Norway will be creditable or deductible against your United States federal income tax liability, unless a reduction or refund of the tax withheld is available to you under Norwegian law. Special rules apply in determining the foreign tax credit limitation with respect\n\nto dividends that are subject to the preferential tax rates. Dividends will generally be income from sources outside the United States and will generally be 'passive' income for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowable to you. Any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations during the period from the date you include the dividend payment in income until the date you convert the payment into USD will generally be treated as US-source ordinary income or loss and will not be eligible for the special tax rate.\n\n## Taxation of capital gains\n\nIf you sell or otherwise dispose of your shares or ADSs, you will generally recognise a capital gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the value in USD of the amount that you realise and your tax basis, determined in USD, in your shares or ADSs. Capital gain of a non-corporate US holder is generally taxed at preferential rates if the property is held for more than one year. The gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. If you receive any foreign currency on the sale of shares or ADSs, you may recognise ordinary income or loss from sources within the United States as a result of currency fluctuations between the date of the sale of the shares or ADSs and the date the sales proceeds are converted into USD. You should consult your own tax adviser regarding how to account for payments made or received in a currency other than USD.\n\n## PFIC rules\n\nWe believe that the shares and ADSs should not currently be treated as stock of a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes and we do not expect to become a PFIC in the foreseeable future. However, this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus may be subject to change. It is therefore possible that we could become a PFIC in a future taxable year. If we were to be treated as a PFIC, a gain realised on the sale or other disposition of the shares or ADSs would in general not be treated as a capital gain. Instead, unless you elect to be taxed annually on a mark-to-market basis with respect to the shares or ADSs, you would generally be treated as if you had realised such gain and certain 'excess distributions' ratably over your holding period for the shares or ADSs. Amounts allocated to the year in which the gain is realised or the 'excess distribution' is received or to a taxable year before we were classified as a PFIC would be subject to tax at ordinary income tax rates, and amounts allocated to all other years would be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for each such year to which the gain or distribution was allocated, together with an interest charge in respect of the tax attributable to each such year. With certain exceptions, your shares or ADSs will be treated as stock in a PFIC if we were a PFIC at any time during the period you held the shares or ADSs. Dividends that you receive from us will not be eligible for the preferential tax rates if we are treated as a PFIC with respect to you, either in the taxable year of the distribution or the preceding taxable year, but will instead be taxable at rates applicable to ordinary income.\n\n## Foreign Account Tax Compliance Withholding\n\nA 30% withholding tax will be imposed on certain payments to certain non-US financial institutions that fail to comply with information reporting requirements or certification",

        "page_content": "requirements in respect of their direct and indirect United States shareholders and/or United States accountholders. To avoid becoming subject to the 30% withholding tax on payments to them, we and other non-US financial institutions may be required to report information to the IRS regarding the holders of shares or ADSs and to withhold on a portion of payments under the shares or ADSs to certain holders that fail to comply with the relevant information reporting requirements (or hold shares or ADSs directly or indirectly through certain non-compliant intermediaries). However, under proposed Treasury regulations, such withholding will not apply to payments made before the date that is two years after the date on which final regulations defining the term 'foreign passthru payment' are enacted. The rules for the implementation of these requirements have not yet been fully finalised, so it is impossible to determine at this time what impact, if any, these requirements will have on holders of the shares and ADSs.\n\n## Major shareholders\n\nThe Norwegian State is the largest shareholder in Equinor, with a direct ownership interest of 67%. Its ownership interest is managed by the Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, the Norwegian State had a 67% direct ownership interest in Equinor and a 3.6% indirect interest through the National Insurance Fund (Folketrygdfondet), totalling 70.6%.\n\nEquinor has one class of shares, and each share confers one vote at the general meeting. The Norwegian State does not have any voting rights that differ from the rights of other ordinary shareholders. Pursuant to the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act, a majority of at least twothirds of the votes cast as well as of the votes represented at a general meeting is required to amend our articles of association. As long as the Norwegian State owns more than one-third of our shares, it will be able to prevent any amendments to our articles of association. Since the Norwegian State, acting through the Norwegian Minister of Petroleum and Energy, has in excess of two-thirds of the shares in the company, it has sole power to amend our articles of association. In addition, as majority shareholder, the Norwegian State has the power to control any decision at general meetings of our shareholders that requires a majority vote, including the election of the majority of the corporate assembly, which has the power to elect our board of directors and approve the dividend proposed by the board of directors.\n\nThe Norwegian State endorses the principles set out in \"The Norwegian Code of Practice for Corporate Governance\", and it has stated that it expects companies in which the State has ownership interests to adhere to the code. The principle of ensuring equal treatment of different groups of shareholders is a key element in the State's own guidelines. In companies in which the State is a shareholder together with others, the State wishes to exercise the same rights and obligations as any other shareholder and not act in a manner that has a detrimental effect on the rights or financial interests of other shareholders. In addition to the principle of equal treatment of shareholders, emphasis is also placed on transparency in relation to the State's ownership and on the general meeting being the correct arena for owner decisions and formal resolutions.",

        "page_content": "## 5.2 Use and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures\n\nSince 2007, Equinor has been preparing the Consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European union (EU) and as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. IFRS has been applied consistently to all periods presented in the 2021 Consolidated financial statements.\n\nEquinor is subject to SEC regulations regarding the use of nonGAAP financial measures in public disclosures. Non-GAAP financial measures are defined as numerical measures that either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded or included in the comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles: (i.e, IFRS in the case of Equinor). The following financial measures may be considered non-GAAP financial measures:\n\n- a) Net debt to capital employed ratio, Net debt to capital employed ratio adjusted, including lease liabilities and Net debt to capital employed ratio adjusted\n- b) Return on average capital employed (ROACE)\n- c) Organic capital expenditures\n- d) Free cashflow and organic free cashflow\n- e) Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings after tax\n- f) Total shareholder return (TSR)\n- g) Gross capital expenditure (gross capex)\n\n## a) Net debt to capital employed ratio\n\nIn Equinor's view, net debt ratio provides a more informative picture of Equinor's financial strength than gross interestbearing financial debt. Three different net debt ratios are provided below; 1) net debt to capital employed ratio, 2) net debt to capital employed ratio adjusted, including lease liabilities, and 3) net debt to capital employed ratio adjusted.\n\nThe calculation is based on gross interest-bearing financial debt in the balance sheet and adjusted for cash, cash equivalents and current financial investments. Certain adjustments are made, e.g. collateral deposits classified as cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated balance sheet are considered non-cash in the non-GAAP calculations. The financial investments held in Equinor Insurance AS are excluded in the non-GAAP calculations as they are deemed restricted. These two adjustments increase net debt and give a more prudent definition of the net debt to capital employed ratio than if the IFRS based definition was to be used. Following implementation of IFRS16 Equinor presents a 'net debt to capital employed adjusted' excluding lease liabilities from the gross interestbearing debt. Net interest-bearing debt adjusted for these items is included in the average capital employed. The table below reconciles the net interest-bearing debt adjusted, the capital employed and the net debt to capital employed adjusted ratio with the most directly comparable financial measure or measures calculated in accordance with IFRS.",

capital employed (ROACE)\n\nThis measure provides useful information for both the group and investors about performance during the period under evaluation. Equinor uses ROACE to measure the return on capital employed adjusted, regardless of whether the financing is through equity or debt. The use of ROACE should not be viewed as an alternative to income before financial items,\n\nincome taxes and minority interest, or to net income, which are measures calculated in accordance with IFRS or ratios based on these figures. For a reconciliation for adjusted earnings after tax, see e) later in this section.\n\nROACE was 22,7% in 2021, compared to 1,8% in 2020 and 12.0% in 2019. The change from 2020 is mainly due to increase in adjusted earnings after tax.",

Among items excluded from the organic capital expenditure in 2021 were acquisition of 100% interest in Polish onshore renewables developer Wento and additions of Right of Use (RoU) assets related to leases, resulting in organic capital expenditure of USD 8.1 billion.\n\nIn 2020, capital expenditures were USD 9.8 billion as per note 4 Segments to the Consolidated financial statements. A total of USD 2.0 billion were excluded from the organic capital expenditures. Among items excluded from the organic capital expenditure in 2020 were acquisition of 30% interest in the Bandurria Sur onshore block in Argentina, acquisition of a 49% share in LLC KrasGeoNaC in Russia, and additions of Right of Use (RoU) assets related to leases, resulting in organic capital expenditure of USD 7.8 billion.\n\n## d) Free cash flow\n\nFree cash flow includes the following line items in the Consolidated statement of cash flows: Cash flows provided by operating activities before taxes paid and working capital items (USD 42.0 billion), taxes paid (negative USD 8.6 billion), cash used in business combinations (USD 0.1 billion), capital expenditures and investments (negative USD 8.0 billion), (increase)/decrease in other items interest-bearing (USD 0.0 billion), proceeds from sale of assets and businesses (USD 1,9 billion), dividend paid (negative USD 1.8 billion) and share buyback (negative USD 0,3 billion), resulting in a free cash flow of USD 25 billion in 2021.\n\n## e) Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings after tax\n\nManagement considers adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings after tax together with other non-GAAP financial measures as defined below, to provide an indication of the underlying operational and financial performance in the period (excluding financing) by adjusting by items that are not well correlated to Equinor's operating performance, and therefore better facilitate comparisons between periods.\n\nThe following financial measures may be considered non-GAAP financial measures:\n\nAdjusted earnings are based on net operating income/(loss) and adjusts for certain items affecting the income for the period in order to separate out effects that management considers may not be well correlated to Equinor's underlying operational performance in the individual reporting period. Management considers adjusted earnings to be a supplemental measure to Equinor's IFRS measures, which provides an indication of Equinor's underlying operational performance in the period and facilitates an alternative understanding of operational trends between the periods. Adjusted earnings include adjusted revenues and other income, adjusted purchases, adjusted operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, adjusted depreciation expenses and adjusted exploration expenses. Adjusted earnings adjusts for the following items:\n\n- \u00b7 Changes in fair value of derivatives: Certain gas contracts are, due to pricing or delivery conditions, deemed to contain embedded derivatives, required to be carried at fair value. Also, certain transactions related to historical divestments include contingent consideration, are carried at fair value. The accounting impacts of changes in fair value of the aforementioned are excluded from adjusted earnings. In addition, adjustments are also made for changes in the unrealised fair value of derivatives related to some natural gas trading contracts. Due to the nature of these gas sales contracts, these are classified as financial derivatives to be measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. Unrealised gains and losses on these contracts reflect the value of the difference between current market gas prices and the actual prices to be realised under the gas sales contracts. Only realised gains and losses on these contracts are reflected in adjusted earnings. This presentation best reflects the underlying performance of the business as it replaces the effect of temporary timing differences associated with the re-measurements of the derivatives to fair value at the balance sheet date with actual realised gains and losses for the period\n- \u00b7 Periodisation of inventory hedging effect: Commercial storage is hedged in the paper market and is accounted for using the lower of cost or market price. If market prices increase above cost price, the inventory will not reflect this increase in value. There will be a loss on the derivative hedging the inventory since the derivatives always reflect changes in the market price. An adjustment is made to reflect the unrealised market increase of the commercial storage. As a result, loss on derivatives is matched by a similar adjustment for the exposure being managed. If market prices decrease below cost price, the write-down of",

        "page_content": "## Additional information\n\n- the inventory and the derivative effect in the IFRS income statement will offset each other and no adjustment is made\n- \u00b7 Over/underlift : Over/underlift is accounted for using the sales method and therefore revenues were reflected in the period the product was sold rather than in the period it was produced. The over/underlift position depended on a number of factors related to our lifting programme and the way it corresponded to our entitlement share of production. The effect on income for the period is therefore adjusted, to show estimated revenues and associated costs based upon the production for the period to reflect operational performance and comparability with peers.\n- \u00b7 The operational storage is not hedged and is not part of the trading portfolio. Cost of goods sold is measured based on the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method, and includes realised gains or losses that arise due to changes in market prices. These gains or losses will fluctuate from one period to another and are not considered part of the underlying operations for the period\n- \u00b7 Impairment and reversal of impairment are excluded from adjusted earnings since they affect the economics of an asset for the lifetime of that asset, not only the period in which it is impaired or the impairment is reversed. Impairment and reversal of impairment can impact both the exploration expenses and the depreciation, amortisation and impairment line items\n- \u00b7 Gain or loss from sales of assets is eliminated from the measure since the gain or loss does not give an indication of future performance or periodic performance; such a gain or loss is related to the cumulative value creation from the time the asset is acquired until it is sold\n- \u00b7 Eliminations (Internal unrealised profit on inventories:): Volumes derived from equity oil inventory will vary depending on several factors and inventory strategies, i.e. level of crude oil in inventory, equity oil used in the refining process and level of in-transit cargoes. Internal profit related to volumes sold between entities within the group, and still in inventory at period end, is eliminated according to IFRS (write down to production cost). The proportion of realised versus unrealised gain will fluctuate from one period to another due to inventory strategies and consequently impact net operating income/(loss). Writedown to production cost is not assessed to be a part of the underlying operational performance, and elimination of internal profit related to equity volumes is excluded in adjusted earnings\n- \u00b7 Other items of income and expense are adjusted when the impacts on income in the period are not reflective of Equinor's underlying operational performance in the reporting period. Such items may be unusual or infrequent transactions but they may also include transactions that are significant which would not necessarily qualify as either unusual or infrequent. Other items are carefully assessed\n\n- and can include transactions such as provisions related to reorganisation, early retirement, etc.\n- \u00b7 Change in accounting policy are adjusted when the impacts on income in the period are unusual or infrequent, and not reflective of Equinor's underlying operational performance in the reporting period\n\nAdjusted earnings after tax - equals the sum of net operating income/(loss) less income tax in business areas and adjustments to operating income taking the applicable marginal tax into consideration. Adjusted earnings after tax excludes net financial items and the associated tax effects on net financial items. It is based on adjusted earnings less the tax effects on all elements included in adjusted earnings (or calculated tax on operating income and on each of the adjusting items using an estimated marginal tax rate). In addition, tax effect related to tax exposure items not related to the individual reporting period is excluded from adjusted earnings after tax. Management considers adjusted earnings after tax, which reflects a normalised tax charge associated with its operational performance excluding the impact of financing, to be a supplemental measure to Equinor's net income. Certain net USD denominated financial positions are held by group companies that have a USD functional currency that is different from the currency in which the taxable income is measured. As currency exchange rates change between periods, the basis for measuring net financial items for IFRS will change disproportionally with taxable income which includes exchange gains and losses from translating the net USD denominated financial positions into the currency of the applicable tax return. Therefore, the effective tax rate may be significantly higher or lower than the statutory tax rate for any given period. Adjusted taxes included in adjusted earnings after tax should not be considered indicative of the amount of current or total tax expense (or taxes payable) for the period.\n\nAdjusted earnings and adjusted earnings after tax should be considered additional measures rather than substitutes for net operating income/(loss) and net income/(loss), which are the most directly comparable IFRS measures. There are material limitations associated with the use of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings after tax compared with the IFRS measures as such non-GAAP measures do not include all the items of revenues/gains or expenses/losses of Equinor that are needed to evaluate its profitability on an overall basis. Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings after tax are only intended to be indicative of the underlying developments in trends of our ongoing operations for the production, manufacturing and marketing of our products and exclude pre-and post-tax impacts of net financial items. Equinor reflects such underlying development in our operations by eliminating the effects of certain items that may not be directly associated with the period's operations or financing. However, for that reason, adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings after tax are not complete measures of profitability. These measures should therefore not be used in isolation.",

        "page_content": "## 5.3 Legal proceedings\n\nEquinor is involved in a number of proceedings globally concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of its business. No further update is provided on previously reported legal or arbitration proceedings. Equinor does not believe such proceedings will, individually or in the aggregate, have a significant effect on Equinor's financial position, profitability, results of operations or liquidity. See also note 10 Income taxes and note 24 Other commitments, contingent liabilities and contingent assets to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 5.4 Report on payments to governments\n\n## Reporting in accordance with the Norwegian transparency rule\n\nPursuant to Norwegian Accounting Act \u00a73-3d and the Norwegian Security Trading Act \u00a75-5a, Equinor has prepared Report on payments to governments. The companies involved in extractive and logging activities are required to disclose payments made to governments at project and country level and additional contextual information, consisting of certain legal, monetary, numerical and production volume information, related to the extractive part of the operations or to the entire group.\n\n## Basis for preparation\n\nThe regulation requires Equinor to prepare a consolidated report for the previous financial year on direct payments to governments, including payments made by subsidiaries, joint operations and joint ventures, or on behalf of such entities involved in extractive activities.\n\n## Scope and validity\n\nEquinor's extractive activities covering the exploration, prospecting, discovery, development and extraction of oil and natural gas are included in this report. Additional contextual information is disclosed for legal entities engaged in extractive activities or for the entire group, on a country or legal entity basis, as applicable.\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nThe report includes payments made directly by Equinor to governments, such as taxes and royalties. Payments made by the operator of an oil and/or gas licence on behalf of the licensed partners, such as area fees, are also included in this report. For assets where Equinor is the operator, the full payment made on behalf of the whole partnership (100%) is included. No payment will be disclosed in cases where Equinor is not the operator, unless the operator is a state-owned entity and it is possible to distinguish the payment from other cost recovery items.\n\nHost government production entitlements paid by the licence operator are also included in the report. The size of such entitlements can in some cases constitute the most significant payments to governments.\n\nFor some of our projects, we have established a subsidiary to hold the ownership in a joint venture. For these projects, payments may be made to governments in the country of\n\noperation as well as to governments in the country where the subsidiary resides.\n\nPayments to governments are reported in the year that the actual cash payment was made (cash principle). Amounts included as contextual information are reported in the year the transaction relates to (accrual principle), regardless of when the cash flows occurred, except for Income tax paid (cash principle). Amounts are subject to rounding. Rounding differences may occur in summary tables.\n\n## Government\n\nIn the context of this report, a government is defined as any national, regional or local authority of a country. It includes any department, agency or undertaking (i.e. corporation) controlled by that government.\n\n## Project definition\n\nA project is defined as the operational activity governed by a single contract, licence, lease, concession or similar legal agreement and that forms the basis for payment obligations to a government.\n\nPayments not directly linked to a specific project but levied at the company entity level, are reported at that level.\n\n## Materiality\n\nPayments constitute a single payment, or a series of related payments that equal or exceed USD 100,000 during the year. Payments below the threshold in a given country will not be included in the overview of projects and payments.\n\n## Reporting currency\n\nPayments to governments in foreign currencies (other than USD) are converted to USD using the average annual 2021 exchange rate.\n\n## Payment types disclosed at project or legal entity level that are relevant for Equinor\n\nThe following payment types are disclosed for legal entities involved in extractive activities. They are presented on a cash basis, net of any interest expenses, whether paid in cash or inkind. In-kind payments are reported in millions of barrels of oil equivalent and the equivalent cash value.\n\n- \u00b7 Tax levied on the income, production or profits of companies includes severance tax and taxes paid in-kind. The value of taxes paid in-kind is calculated based on the market price at the time of the in-kind payment. Taxes levied on consumption, such as value added tax, personal income tax, sales tax, withholding tax, property tax and environmental tax are excluded. Negative amounts represent tax refunds received from governments\n- \u00b7 Royalties are usage-based payments for the right to the ongoing use of an asset\n- \u00b7 Fees are typically levied on the right to use a geographical area for exploration, development and production and include rental fees, area fees, entry fees, concession fees and other considerations for licences and/or concessions. Administrative government fees that are not specifically related to the extractive activities or to access extractive resources, are excluded\n- \u00b7 Bonuses are payments made when signing an oil and gas",

        "page_content": "lease, when discovering natural resources and/or when production has commenced. Bonuses often include signature-, discovery- and production bonuses and are a commonly used payment type, depending on the petroleum fiscal regime. Bonuses can also include elements of social contribution\n\n- \u00b7 Host government production entitlements are the host government's share of production after oil production has been allocated to cover costs and expenses under a production sharing agreement (PSA). Host government production entitlements are most often paid in-kind. The value of these payments is calculated based on the market price at the time of the in-kind payment. For some PSAs, the host government production entitlements are sold by the operator, and the related costs are split between the partners. For these contracts, Equinor does not make payments directly to governments, but to the operator\n\n## Contextual information at country level\n\nThe report discloses contextual information for legal entities engaged in extractive activities in Equinor, as listed below. All information is disclosed in accordance with the accrual accounting principle.\n\n- \u00b7 Investments are defined as additions to property, plant and equipment (including leases), capitalised exploration expenditures, intangible assets, long-term share investments and investments in associated companies\n- \u00b7 Revenues associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas related to our extractive activities. Revenues include third party revenues and other income, intersegment revenues and net income/(loss) from equity accounted investments\n- \u00b7 Cost shows the sum of operating expenses, SG&A (sales, general and administrative expenses) and exploration expenses, adjusted for net impairments\n- \u00b7 Equity production volumes are the volumes that correspond to Equinor's ownership interest in a field and do not include production of the Norwegian State's share of oil and natural gas\n\n## Contextual information at entity level\n\nThe following contextual information is disclosed for all of Equinor's legal entities as of 31 December 2021. The information is structured based on country of incorporation, which is the jurisdiction in which the company is registered.\n\n- \u00b7 Country of operation is the country where the company performs its main activities\n- \u00b7 The description of the core business activity is presented according to the business areas where the business operations take place. Each company is associated to a business area. Section 2.2 Business overview, Corporate structure of the Strategic report chapter in the annual report provides the descriptions of the business areas\n- \u00b7 Number of employees (per company) is based on the registered company location. The actual number of employees present in a country can deviate from the reported figures due to expatriation. In some companies there are no employees. These may purchase man-hours from other companies in the Equinor group, as applicable\n- \u00b7 Net intercompany interest is the company's net intercompany interest expense (interest expense minus\n\n## Additional information\n\ninterest income) to companies in another jurisdiction. Interest between companies within the same jurisdiction is eliminated. Intercompany interest is the interest levied on long-term and short-term borrowings within the Equinor group\n\n- \u00b7 Revenues as presented in the Consolidated statement of income, including third party revenues and other income, inter-company revenues and net income/(loss) from equity accounted investments\n- \u00b7 Income before tax as presented in the Consolidated statement of income\n- \u00b7 Income tax expense as defined in note 2 and note 10 to the Consolidated financial statements\n- \u00b7 Income tax paid are reconciled to the amount presented in the Consolidated statement of cash flows and in addition include taxes paid in-kind in Algeria, Libya, and Nigeria\n- \u00b7 Retained earnings include the gains and losses accumulated by the companies together with currency translation adjustments and other comprehensive income. Being part of shareholders equity, retained earnings are presented as reported in Equinor accounting system for consolidation purposes\n- \u00b7 Retained earnings can be impacted by the dividend paid, group contributions and reclassifications between paid in capital and retained earnings. The retained earnings as presented in this report may be different compared to the figures in the statutory financial statement due to the differences in functional currency and accounting principles for group reporting versus local requirements.\n- \u00b7 The parent company's shares in subsidiaries are not considered for impairment when the local statutory reporting is based on accounting principles different from IFRS or there are no local statutory requirements for impairment since these effects would be eliminated on the group reporting.",

The overview is based on the location of the receiving government. The total payments to each country may be different from the total payments disclosed in the overview of payments for each project in the report. This is because payments disclosed for each project relate to the\n\ncountry of operation, irrespective of the location of the receiving government.\n\nIn 2021, there is an upward trend in overall payments with increased taxes due to higher liquids and gas prices and the development in foreign exchange rates, as explained in section 2.11 Financial review of the Strategic report chapter in the annual report.\n\n| Payments to governments per country   related to extractive activities  (in USD million)   | Taxes 1)   | Royalties   | Fees   | Bonuses   | Host  government  entitlements  (USD million)   | Host  government  entitlements  (mmboe)   | Total  (value)   2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|--------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Algeria                                                                                    | 157        | -

Payments made by the operator of an oil and/or gas licence on behalf of the licensed partners, such as area fees, are included. For assets where Equinor is the operator, the full payment made on behalf of the whole partnership (100%) is reported. In cases, where Equinor is not the operator, payments are not disclosed, unless the operator is a state-owned entity and it is possible to distinguish the payment from other cost recovery items. Host government production entitlements paid by the licence operator are reported.",

This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining internal controls, maintaining adequate records, and making estimates that are relevant to the preparation of the Report, such that it is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## EY's responsibilities\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion on the presentation of the Report based on the evidence we have obtained.\n\nWe conducted our engagement in accordance with the International Standard for Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information ('ISAE 3000'), and the terms of reference for this engagement as agreed with Equinor ASA's on 17 February 2022. Those standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to express a conclusion on whether we are aware of any material modifications that need to be made to the payments to governments in order for it to be in accordance with the Criteria, and to issue a report. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risk of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion.\n\n## Our Independence and Quality Control\n\nWe have maintained our independence and confirm that we have met the requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, and have the required competencies and experience to conduct this assurance engagement.\n\nEY also applies International Standard on Quality Control 1, Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Financial Statements, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements, and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Description of procedures performed\n\nProcedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Our procedures were designed to obtain a limited level of assurance on which to base our conclusion and do not provide all the evidence that would be required to provide a reasonable level of assurance.\n\nAlthough we considered the effectiveness of management's internal controls when determining the nature and extent of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on internal controls. Our procedures did not include testing controls or performing procedures relating to checking aggregation or calculation of data within IT systems.\n\nA limited assurance engagement consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for preparing the Report and related information, and applying analytical and other appropriate procedures.",

        "page_content": "## 5.5 EU Taxonomy for sustainable activities\n\nWith effect for 2021 Equinor implemented the EU Taxonomy in accordance with EU Regulation 2020/852 and the Delegated Acts related to Article 8 (specifying the information to be disclosed), 10 (climate change mitigation) and 11 (climate change adaption) that require the disclosure about the environmental performance of the company's assets and economic activities. The regulation establishes the criteria to determine whether an economic activity qualifies as environmentally sustainable and specifies quantitative economic performance indicators to disclose the degree of sustainability. The regulation has not yet been enacted in Norwegian legislation, and Equinor's reporting is thus a voluntary reporting.\n\nAn economic activity is eligible under the Taxonomy regulation if it is included in the list of economic activities described in the annexes of the Delegated Acts under the Taxonomy irrespective of whether that economic activity meets any or all of the technical screening criteria laid down in those Delegated Acts. For a taxonomy-eligible economic activity to be considered a taxonomy-aligned economic activity, the activity must comply with the established performance thresholds ('technical screening criteria'). Technical screening criteria are developed to determine under what conditions the economic activity substantially contributes to one or more of the Taxonomy's environmental objectives.\n\nFor an economic activity to be considered taxonomy-eligible the economic activity must be within one of the following three categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Economic activities directly contributing to the environmental objectives\n- \u00b7 Economic activities that enable other activities to make a substantial contribution\n- \u00b7 Economic activities that support the transition to a climate neutral economy\n\n## Environmentally sustainable economic activities\n\nThe eligible economic activities must comply with the technical screening criteria related to the environmental objectives to be taxonomy-aligned, as shown in the figure below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAn economic activity qualifies as environmentally sustainable under the EU Taxonomy if it contributes substantially to one or more of the following environmental objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate Change mitigation*\n- \u00b7 Climate Change adaption*\n- \u00b7 Protection of water**\n- \u00b7 Circular economy**\n- \u00b7 Pollution prevention**\n- \u00b7 Biodiversity**\n- * Delegated Act published and included in the 2021 reporting\n\n** Related Delegated Act to be published by the EU in 2022 and\n\nincluded from the 2022 reporting\n\nAn economic activity also qualifies as environmentally sustainable if it enables other economic activities to make a substantial contribution to one or more of the environmental objectives and does not lead to a lock-in effect that undermines the performance of the environmental objectives.\n\nAn economic activity that supports the transition to a climateneutral economy in line with the Paris agreement is an aligned economic activity under the Taxonomy if it:\n\n- \u00b7 has greenhouse gas emission levels that correspond to best practice\n- \u00b7 does not hinder the development of low carbon alternatives\n- \u00b7 does not lead to a lock-in of carbon intensive assets considering the economic lifetime of these assets\n\nThe eligible economic activities must result in no significant harm to the other environmental objectives, and they must comply with the minimum social safeguards set in the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nBy the year-end 2021, the key performance indicators consist of the portion of taxonomy-eligible economic activities in the total turnover, capital and operational expenditures in accordance with the Delegated Act related to Article 8 of EU Regulation 2020/852 Article 10.1. The eligible economic activities by yearend 2021 cover the two environmental objectives climate change mitigation and climate change adaption.\n\nThe technical screening criteria for the four remaining environmental objectives will be published during 2022 and be effective from 1 January 2023. From 2023, all taxonomy-eligible economic activities will be assessed for taxonomy-alignment with all the six environmental objectives in accordance with the technical screening criteria set out in the Taxonomy regulation and included in the reporting for the financial year 2022.\n\n## Key performance indicators (KPIs)\n\n## Basis for preparation\n\nThe key performance indicators (KPIs) for 2021 included in the table below consist of the portion of taxonomy-eligible activities in the total turnover, capital (capex) and operational (opex) expenditures as specified in the Consolidated financial statements and balance sheet prepared in accordance with IFRS, and in accordance with the principles described below. Double counting of the relevant amounts of turnover and expenditure across the reporting was avoided because the",

        "page_content": "eligible economic activities included in the KPIs are independent activities.\n\n## KPI denominators\n\n## Turnover\n\nTotal turnover consists of the reported amount included in the revenue line item in the Consolidated financial statements. Net income/(loss) from equity accounted investments and other income (i.e. gain on divestment of assets) are excluded from the definition, and not part of the revenue denominator. For Equinor the KPI denominator related to turnover will be highly impacted by changes in commodity prices.\n\n## Capex\n\nTotal capital expenditures consist of additions to property, plant and equipment line item as specified in note 11 Property, plant and equipment and additions to intangible assets as specified in note 12 Intangible assets in the Consolidated financial statements. Capitalised exploration and acquisition costs of oil and gas prospects related to exploration are recognised as intangible assets, and by interpretation of the Taxonomy regulation, considered to be included the KPI denominator, as this is a part of Equinor's ongoing activity (see assessment below). Goodwill acquired through business combinations is excluded from the capital expenditure KPI in accordance with the Taxonomy regulations.\n\n## Opex\n\nTotal operating expenditures under the Taxonomy cover direct non-capitalised costs that relate to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term lease, maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and equipment that are necessary to ensure the continued and effective functioning of such assets.\n\nFor Equinor the operating expenditures included in the denominator are considered to be represented by the reported amounts included in the operating expenses and selling general and administration expense line items in the Consolidated financial statements. The Taxonomy opex definition does not include operating cost related to e.g. purchases, depreciation, amortisation, impairment and exploration expenses (see assessment below).\n\n## Application of the KPIs\n\nThe definition of the capex KPI includes intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38. Acquired goodwill and capitalised costs\n\n## Key performance indicators 2021\n\nProportion of Taxonomy-eligible economic activities in total turnover, opex and capex\n\n| (in %)                                |   Turnover |   Capex |   Opex |\n|---------------------------------------|------------|---------|--------|\n| Taxonomy-eligible economic activities |          0 |       2 |      2 |\n\n## Additional information\n\naccording to the successful efforts method under IFRS 6 is out of the scope of IAS 38. The rationale for excluding IFRS 6 from the capex KPI is not clearly stated in the Taxonomy regulation. Equinor regards exploration activities as part of the ongoing core activities and has included capitalised exploration costs in the capex denominator. The definition of the opex KPI refers to non-capitalised costs relating to day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and equipment. Exploration costs have been considered not to be covered by the Taxonomy opex definition. Exploration expenditures do not have significant effect on the reported opex and capex KPIs by year-end 2021.\n\nThe denominators are calculated based on reported IFRS numbers in the Consolidated financial statements. For Equinor this has the effect that the proceeds from the sale of the Norwegian State's (SDFI) oil production on the NCS, that Equinor markets and sells on their behalf (see note 25 Related Parties to the Consolidated financial statements), that is reported on gross basis and recognised as revenue in the income statement, will have a negative impact on the reported KPI related to taxonomy-eligible revenue. Total purchases of oil and natural gas liquids from the Norwegian state amounted to USD 10 billion in 2021.\n\n## KPI numerators\n\nThe KPI numerators consist of the taxonomy-eligible part of the turnover, operating expenses and capital expenditures included in the denominator.\n\nWhen identifying taxonomy-eligible economic activities within the Equinor group, the starting point has been the reporting entities and profit centres established for group reporting purposes and included in the group consolidation system. For reporting entities with one economic activity that has been assessed as a taxonomy-eligible activity, total revenue, total capex additions and operating and selling general and administration expenses are included in the calculation of the KPIs.\n\nFor reporting entities with several taxonomy-eligible economic activities, and where both eligible and non-eligible economic activities have been identified, the eligible economic activities are identified per cluster, profit centre, or lower levels depending on where the cost related to the activity is booked in Equinor. Total revenue and costs related to the eligible economic activity are included in the calculation of the KPIs.",

        "page_content": "## Additional information\n\nEquinor's ambition is to become a net-zero emissions company in 2050. To reach such ambition, the company performs significant activities that are not qualified as eligible activities under the EU Taxonomy and consequently are not measured through the above KPIs. As commented below the KPIs i.e. exclude activities performed through equity accounted investments, for which most of Equinor's activities within the Renewables segment is reported. Emission reducing activities that are supporting the continued operating of oil and gas\n\nproduction may contribute to the lock-in effects described in the Taxonomy, and hence these activities may not meet the technical screening criteria.\n\n## Description of EU taxonomy-eligible activities by year-end 2021\n\nBelow is an illustration of which activities in Equinor's value chain are eligible and non-eligible according to the assessment done in 2021.\n\n## Equinor's value chain and the outcome of the eligibility assessment in 2021\n\n## Eligible activities\n\n## Non-eligible activities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Wind power                 |\n|----------------------------|\n| Solar power                |\n| Carbon capture and storage |\n| Hydrogen (blue and green)  |\n\nExploration, development and production of oil and gas\n\nProcessing and refining\n\nMarketing and trading\n\nProduct transportation\n\nCO2-reduction including offshore electrification\n\nEquity-accounted investments are not included in the eligible activities for the EU taxonomy .\n\nBelow is an overview of Equinor's eligible activities which directly contribute to the environmental objectives climate change mitigation and climate change adaption in the EU Taxonomy.\n\n## Underground permanent geological storage of CO2\n\nThis activity covers permanent storage of captured CO2 in appropriate underground geological formations. Equinor is involved in several early phase developing activities by yearend 2021 .\n\nThe main activities in 2021 included:\n\n- \u00b7 Net Zero Teesside : Equinor with partners is working to decarbonise the Teesside industrial cluster with carbon capture. CO2 emissions will be transported through pipelines to permanent storage developed by Northern Endurance Partnership,\n- \u00b7 Northern Endurance Partnership (NEP): The partnership with five other energy companies is developing CO2 offshore transport and storage infrastructure in the UK, which is intended to serve the Net Zero Teesside power project and the Zero Carbon Humber project with the greater aim of decarbonising the Teeside and Humberside industrial clusters.\n- \u00b7 Barents Blue Polaris : The project is linked to the lowcarbon ammonia project that Equinor and partners Horisont Energi and V\u00e5r Energi are developing in Finnmark. CO2 will be captured and stored in a saline aquifer in the Barents Sea. In December 2021 the partnership submitted a licence application for the CO2 storage formation. Equinor is the operator for the CO2 transport and storage solution.\n\n## Electricity generation from wind power\n\nThe activity covers development of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity from wind power. Equinor is engaged in offshore wind projects in Norway, Europe, the US and Asia and is accelerating the development of this technology. Floating wind is still at an early development phase. Eligible activities consist only of wind projects that are proportionally consolidated by year-end 2021. Equity accounted investments for which a 'one-line consolidation' is applied, are not within the scope of the Taxonomy.\n\nThe main activities in 2021 included:\n\n- \u00b7 Oc\u00e9ole : Equinor, RES and Green Giraffe joined forces to develop floating offshore wind in France.\n- \u00b7 Utsira Nord : Equinor teamed up with V\u00e5rgr\u00f8nn to prepare application for floating wind in Norway\n- \u00b7 S\u00f8rlig Nordsj\u00f8 II : Equinor teamed up with RWE and Hydro to prepare application for offshore wind in Norway\n- \u00b7 Firefly floating offshore wind farm and Donghae 1 : Two of Equinor's projects in South Korea were granted power licences\n- \u00b7 The Sheringham extension project (SEP ): a project with total installed capacity up to 317 MW in north of the operating Sheringham Shoal Offshore Wind Farm\n\n## Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology\n\nThe activity covers construction or operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity using solar photovoltaic (PV) technology. At year-end 2021, Equinor has no projects included in the scope of the taxonomy that have started production.\n\nThe main activities in 2021 included :\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Wento : In 2021, Equinor acquired 100% of the shares in a Polish onshore renewables developer with a net pipeline of 1.6 GW of solar projects\n\n## Manufacture of hydrogen\n\nThe activity covers manufacturing of hydrogen and hydrogenbased synthetic fuels. Equinor perceives blue hydrogen projects where CO2 is captured and stored, as an efficient and sustainable key to decarbonisation of the energy system going forward and is involved in several early phase projects by yearend 2021 covering future production of both blue and green hydrogen.\n\nThe main activities in 2021 included:\n\n- \u00b7 Hydrogen to Humber (H2H) Saltend : Equinor is developing the low-carbon hydrogen production project to provide for fuel switch to multiple industries in the Humber region of UK.\n- \u00b7 Barents Blue Ammonia : Equinor and partners Horisont Energi and V\u00e5r Energi are developing a low-carbon ammonia project in Finnmark. The project comprises the realisation of an ammonia plant with up to three trains. Natural gas will be provided from the Melk\u00f8ya plant. The CO2 captured will be handled by Barents Blue Polaris.\n- \u00b7 Aurora Energy : Equinor and partners Air Liquide (operator) and BKK are developing a liquid hydrogen project in southwestern Norway. The purpose is to establish a full value chain for decarbonising the maritime sector - an enabler offering green liquid hydrogen to customers, typically within the maritime sector.\n- \u00b7 Tri-State Clean Energy Hub : Equinor and U. S. Steel examine the potential for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS) development in the tri-state region of Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.\n- \u00b7 Clean Hydrogen to Europe: (CHE): Equinor is investigating the opportunities in realising large scale blue hydrogen production in Norway, both for domestic demand but moreover for exports to Europe. Current ambitions are to build a plant to be in operation by 2030 and to scale this up during the 2030s.\n- \u00b7 H2Morrow Steel : Equinor, Open Grid Europe (OGE) and Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe (tkSE) have been working on a concept for the generation and transport of blue hydrogen to the largest German steelworks in Duisburg. An autothermal reforming plant (ATR) on the German or Dutch North Sea coast.\n- \u00b7 H2M Eemshaven : Equinor, Vattenfall and Gasunie have evaluated the possibilities of converting Vattenfall's gas power plant Magnum in the Netherlands into a hydrogenpowered plant.\n\n## Activities not included in the KPIs per year-end 2021 Electrification of offshore asset\n\nEquinor is developing the Hywind Tampen floating wind farm intended to provide electricity for the Snorre and Gullfaks offshore oil and gas fields. Electricity generation from wind power contributes directly to the environmental objectives and is not a transitional or enabling economic activity subject to the assessment of the lock-in effects, even if it would provide for continuing operation of oil and gas installations. However, the current project plan is to provide electricity specifically for the Snorre and Gullfaks licences. The development costs will be shared by the licence partners and according to current plans\n\nno turnover will be generated. Hence based on the current plan the project is not regarded an economic activity as defined in the Taxonomy regulation and not included in eligible activities by year-end 2021.\n\n## Co-processing bio-fuel Mongstad\n\nAt the Mongstad refinery biofuel raw material is bought and processed together with other fossil raw materials. Parts of the final product blends have a minor bio-fuel content. The coprocessing of biofuel reduces the volume of fossil raw materials processed at Mongstad, replacing it with a renewable source. Equinor assesses the eligible activity 'Manufacture of biogas or biofuels for use in transport and of bioliquids' to cover manufacture of pure biofuel feedstocks and has not included the production of blended products in the eligible activities by yearend 2021.\n\n## Investments in equity consolidated entities\n\nA significant part of Equinor's eligible activities related to electricity generation from wind and are conducted through equity consolidated investments. The activities consist of producing offshore wind farms in the UK and Germany, and building material clusters in the North Sea, the US East coast and in the Baltic Sea. In addition, solar activities in Argentina and Brazil and parts of the underground permanent geological storage of CO2 activities conducted through the Northern Light project are equity accounted and hence not included in the KPI.\n\nThe eligible economic activities in equity consolidated entities are not a significant part of Equinor's total activity by year-end 2021. In 2021, Equinor has not applied the voluntary option in the EU Taxonomy regulation to disclose additional KPIs where the effect from the investments in equity consolidated entities would be included. The share of capital expenditures 26 related to renewables in the Sustainability report of 11 % (page 21) includes gross capex additions from equity accounted investments.",

Natural gas volumes are converted to barrels on the basis of energy content\n- \u00b7 Condensates: The heavier natural gas components, such as pentane, hexane, iceptane and so forth, which are liquid under atmospheric pressure - also called natural gasoline or naphtha\n- \u00b7 Crude oil, or oil: Includes condensate and natural gas liquids\n- \u00b7 Development: The drilling, construction, and related activities following discovery that are necessary to begin production of crude oil and natural gas fields\n- \u00b7 Downstream: The selling and distribution of products derived from upstream activities\n- \u00b7 Equity and entitlement volumes of oil and gas: Equity volumes represent volumes produced under a production sharing agreement (PSA) that correspond to Equinor's percentage ownership in a particular field. Entitlement volumes, on the other hand, represent Equinor's share of the volumes distributed to the partners in the field, which are subject to deductions for, among other things, royalties and the host government's share of profit oil. Under the terms of a PSA, the amount of profit oil deducted from equity volumes will normally increase with the cumulative return on investment to the partners and/or production from the licence. The distinction between equity and entitlement is relevant to most PSA regimes, whereas it is not applicable in most concessionary regimes such as those in Norway, the UK, Canada and Brazil. The overview of equity production provides additional information for readers, as certain costs described in the profit and loss analysis were directly associated with equity volumes produced during the reported years\n- \u00b7 Heavy oil: Crude oil with high viscosity (typically above 10 cp), and high specific gravity. The API classifies heavy oil as crudes with a gravity below 22.3\u00b0 API. In addition to high viscosity and high specific gravity, heavy oils typically have low hydrogen-tocarbon ratios, high asphaltene, sulphur, nitrogen, and heavymetal content, as well as higher acid numbers\n- \u00b7 High grade: Relates to selectively harvesting goods, to cut the best and leave the rest. In reference to exploration and production this entails strict prioritisation and sequencing of drilling targets\n- \u00b7 Hydro: A reference to the oil and energy activities of Norsk Hydro ASA, which merged with Equinor ASA\n- \u00b7 IOR (improved oil recovery): Actual measures resulting in an increased oil recovery factor from a reservoir as compared with the expected value at a certain reference point in time. IOR comprises both of conventional and emerging technologies\n- \u00b7 Liquids: Refers to oil, condensates and NGL\n- \u00b7 LNG (liquefied natural gas): Lean gas - primarily methane converted to liquid form through refrigeration to minus 163 degrees Celsius under atmospheric pressures\n- \u00b7 LPG (liquefied petroleum gas): Consists primarily of propane and butane, which turn liquid under a pressure of six to seven atmospheres. LPG is shipped in special vessels\n- \u00b7 Midstream: Processing, storage, and transport of crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and sulphur\n- \u00b7 Naphtha: inflammable oil obtained by the dry distillation of petroleum\n- \u00b7 Natural gas: Petroleum that consists principally of light hydrocarbons. It can be divided into 1) lean gas, primarily methane but often containing some ethane and smaller\n\n- quantities of heavier hydrocarbons (also called sales gas) and 2) wet gas, primarily ethane, propane and butane as well as smaller amounts of heavier hydrocarbons; partially liquid under atmospheric pressure\n- \u00b7 NGL (natural gas liquids): Light hydrocarbons mainly consisting of ethane, propane and butane which are liquid under pressure at normal temperature\n- \u00b7 Oil sands: A naturally occurring mixture of bitumen, water, sand, and clay. A heavy viscous form of crude oil\n- \u00b7 Oil and gas value chains: Describes the value that is being added at each step from 1) exploring; 2) developing; 3) producing; 4) transportation and refining; and 5) marketing and distribution\n- \u00b7 Oslo B\u00f8rs: Oslo stock exchange (OSE)\n- \u00b7 Peer group: Equinor's peer group consists of Equinor, bp, Chevron, ConocoPhilips, Eni, ExxonMobil, Galp, Lundin, Repsol, Shell, TotalEnergies and \u00d8rsted.\n- \u00b7 Petroleum: A collective term for hydrocarbons, whether solid, liquid or gaseous. Hydrocarbons are compounds formed from the elements hydrogen (H) and carbon (C). The proportion of different compounds, from methane and ethane up to the heaviest components, in a petroleum find varies from discovery to discovery. If a reservoir primarily contains light hydrocarbons, it is described as a gas field. If heavier hydrocarbons predominate, it is described as an oil field. An oil field may feature free gas above the oil and contain a quantity of light hydrocarbons, also called associated gas\n- \u00b7 Proved reserves: Reserves claimed to have a reasonable certainty (normally at least 90% confidence) of being recoverable under existing economic and political conditions and using existing technology. They are the only type the US Securities and Exchange Commission allows oil companies to report\n- \u00b7 Refining reference margin: Is a typical average gross margin of our two refineries, Mongstad and Kalundborg. The reference margin will differ from the actual margin, due to variations in type of crude and other feedstock, throughput, product yields, freight cost, inventory etc\n- \u00b7 Rig year: A measure of the number of equivalent rigs operating during a given period. It is calculated as the number of days rigs are operating divided by the number of days in the period\n- \u00b7 Storting: the Norwegian Parliament\n- \u00b7 TSR: Total shareholder return\n- \u00b7 Upstream: Includes the searching for potential underground or underwater oil and gas fields, drilling of exploratory wells, subsequent operating wells which bring the liquids and or natural gas to the surface\n- \u00b7 VOC (volatile organic compounds): Organic chemical compounds that have high enough vapour pressures under normal conditions to significantly vaporise and enter the earth's atmosphere (e.g. gasses formed under loading and offloading of crude oil)",
