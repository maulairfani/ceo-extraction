        "page_content": "## 1.2  Chair's review\n\n## Dear Shareholders,\n\nI am pleased to provide our Annual Report for FY2021.\n\nIn a year that has seen COVID/hyphen.uc19 continue to challenge the lives and livelihoods of so many, I am proud of the resilience and commitment our people have demonstrated to deliver an outstanding set of results in FY2021.\n\nThe strong operational performance driven by/uni00A0our teams across the world, combined with a/uni00A0diversi/f.shortied portfolio and disciplined approach to capital allocation, has seen the Board determine a dividend of US$3.01 per share for FY2021. This means we have returned US$15 billion to shareholders this year,/uni00A0and more/uni00A0than US$38 billion over the past/uni00A0three years. In a year of signi/f.shorticant /f.shortinancial disruption/uni00A0across the globe, these results demonstrate the health/uni00A0of/uni00A0your company.\n\nBHP is in a strong position and it is against this backdrop that we are making transformative changes.\n\nWe have announced our intention to unify BHP's corporate structure to a single listing on the Australian Securities Exchange. Creating one BHP today positions the company to deliver on our strategy in the future. We will be more agile, e/ff.shorticient and /f.shortlexible, while still enabling BHP shareholders around the world to support the company as they have done for decades.\n\nWe have also announced a number of strategic steps towards the future of your company, as/uni00A0we continue to grow our portfolio in future facing commodities. We have announced a/uni00A0US$5.7 billion investment in Jansen Stage/uni00A01, a top tier potash asset in Canada. BHP has also announced our intention to merge our Petroleum assets with Woodside. The resulting global top 10 independent oil and gas company will have the resilience and optionality to succeed in the energy transition.\n\nThe essential resources we produce at BHP are/uni00A0not only fundamental to the way we live now, they are fundamental to the way we will/uni00A0live in the future.\n\nBased on the climate change scenario analysis we undertook last year, we believe that the more action the world takes to limit climate change, the better it will be for BHP.\n\nCommodities like copper, nickel and iron ore will be essential for building the infrastructure and technology that will aid the world's decarbonisation ambitions, and potash will help/uni00A0feed the world's growing population.\n\nInvesting in future facing commodities creates great opportunities for BHP - it means our strategic goals align with our climate goals but/uni00A0it also creates a challenge. The world needs to increase production of commodities that support the transition and do so ever more sustainably. BHP has made progress against our greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets and goals, but we intend to continue to challenge ourselves to reduce our own emissions, and work in partnership with our customers and suppliers to reduce emissions along the value chain.\n\nOur response to climate change and the decarbonisation challenge is just one aspect of our broader commitment to deliver social value. Social value is the positive contribution we make to the environment and society. It goes hand in hand with /f.shortinancial value in our decision-making, and we believe this approach is in the long-term best interests of shareholders. We have been able to provide signi/f.shorticant support to the communities in which we operate. This includes US$11.1 billion in taxes, royalties and other payments to governments in FY2021 - and US$84.0 billion over the past 10 years.\n\nIn FY2021, we continued to broaden our relationships with our Indigenous partners on whose land our operated assets lie. Our Cultural Heritage team has worked to ensure our operational decision-making is informed by reliable and contemporary heritage information, and any decision regarding cultural heritage is made by the most senior site leadership. We have also set out Regional Indigenous Peoples Plans that outline our commitment to agreement-making, Indigenous procurement, employment and social investment.\n\nThe delivery of the South Flank project was an important milestone for the Group in FY2021, and we would like to acknowledge the support of the Banjima people in helping us to deliver the project.\n\nOur Board renewal process continued this year as we welcomed Xiaoqun Clever and Christine O'Reilly as independent Non-executive Directors in October 2020. We are pleased that Michelle Hinchli/ffe will join the BHP Board on 1 March 2022. Michelle has signi/f.shorticant expertise in /f.shortinancial risk management and strong global experience, and we look forward to welcoming Michelle early next year.\n\nWe have also announced that Anita Frew and Susan Kilsby will retire from the BHP Board at the end of the 2021 Annual General Meetings. Both Anita and Susan have recently accepted Chair roles at signi/f.shorticant international companies, and we wish them well. I thank Anita and Susan for the invaluable contribution they have made to BHP. Gary Goldberg has replaced Susan as BHP's Senior Independent Director, and Christine O'Reilly has been appointed Chair/uni00A0of the Remuneration Committee.\n\nFinally, we achieve nothing unless we do it safely. While we are pleased that it has now been over two years since the last fatality at our operated assets, we know that a commitment to health and safety requires more than this. We are committed to stamping out sexual assault and harassment at all our sites. This is a critical issue for BHP and for our industry. We have been working on this for some time, but we know we must do more to make our workplaces safe and inclusive for everyone.\n\nI am con/f.shortident the decisions we are making to build our company for the future, together with continued strong operational performance and commitment to those who rely on us, will see us/uni00A0continue to grow BHP and create value for our shareholders and our broader stakeholders for decades to come.\n\nThank you for your continued support of BHP.\n\nKen MacKenzie Chair\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n' The strong operational performance driven by our teams across the world, combined with a diversi/f.shortied portfolio and/uni00A0disciplined approach to capital allocation, has seen the Board determine/uni00A0a/uni00A0dividend of US$3.01 per share for FY2021.'\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 1.3  Chief Executive O/ff.shorticer's review\n\n## Dear Shareholders,\n\nI am pleased to report that BHP performed strongly in FY2021, with no one fatally injured across BHP's global operations, and record production and throughput in a number of businesses. We completed four major capital projects on time and on budget, a notable feat given the pandemic context, and our approach to capital allocation remained disciplined, generating strong returns for shareholders. I want to thank our employees and all those who supported us in delivering these outcomes.\n\nOur operational and /f.shortinancial results provide the strong foundation upon which we have announced our investment in the Jansen Stage/uni00A01 potash project, the intended merger of BHP's Petroleum business with Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (Woodside), and the intention to unify the BHP corporate structure under a single primary listing in Australia. These strategic steps are intended to underpin BHP's ability to continue to grow shareholder value in the coming decades.\n\nThe future is clear. We believe that the world is going to need increasing supply of the essential commodities BHP produces in order to sustain global economic growth and in order to decarbonise the global economy. It is important for the world that this growing demand is met sustainably, and BHP is ideally positioned to do so given our portfolio of existing assets, our strong track record on sustainability and social value creation, our operating and /f.shortinancial discipline, and most importantly our people.\n\nThe intended uni/f.shortication of BHP's corporate structure will position us even more strongly to be able to continue growing shareholder value. We will be a simpler, more e/ff.shorticient and more agile company. This is expected to enable us to be more competitive and to more quickly create and capitalise on opportunities to continue to/uni00A0grow value.\n\nThe intended merger of BHP's Petroleum business with Woodside will create a global top/uni00A010 independent exploration and production company, with increased scale and resilience. We expect shareholders to bene/f.shortit from signi/f.shorticant synergies arising from the intended merger, and they will have greater choice in how to shape the relative commodity exposures in their own portfolios.\n\nThe decision to proceed with the Jansen Stage/uni00A01 potash project in Canada is a signi/f.shorticant milestone for BHP. Potash is a future facing commodity that enables more e/ff.shorticient and sustainable farming, which will be increasingly important in feeding a growing global population and in meeting the world's need to decarbonise. Jansen Stage 1 also opens up a new front for future growth for BHP. We will be ideally positioned to meet potential future growth in global demand for potash with Jansen Stages 2 through 4, which we anticipate will o/ffer high returns and faster paybacks.\n\nThese decisions and intended steps are anticipated to result in around half of BHP's revenues being derived from the future facing commodities of copper, potash and nickel by the end of this decade. We also expect the other half, comprising iron ore and higherquality coking coal, to see upside as the world decarbonises.\n\nBHP continues to take action on climate change. In the past year we announced a new suite of climate change related targets and goals, together with an assessment of the performance of BHP's portfolio under di/fferent climate scenarios. The latter indicated that BHP's overall portfolio is resilient and, in fact, many of our commodities would perform best under our Paris-aligned scenario that sees more rapid decarbonisation and an increase in average global temperature of no more than 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nWe progressed towards our operational emissions reduction targets and goal by entering into renewable power supply agreements for our Kwinana nickel re/f.shortinery and Queensland Coal operations - adding to the Escondida and Spence copper mine agreements announced in FY2020.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nWith a focus on Scope 3 emissions, we entered into partnerships with major steel producers in China and Japan, targeting technologies to/uni00A0reduce emissions from steel making.\n\nThe combined output of these steel companies equates to around 10 per cent of reported global steel production. We also entered into a series of innovative initiatives that seek to help reduce emissions in bulk shipping.\n\nFinally, we continue to invest in people. In FY2021, we trained more than 500 apprentices and trainees through our FutureFit Academy in Australia, and have committed to creating 2,500 new Australian apprenticeship and trainee positions over the next /f.shortive years. We have continued our progress towards gender balance and female participation in our workforce increased to 29.8 per cent during the year, complementing our already gender-balanced Executive Leadership Team. Our Indigenous participation rate has also increased to 7.2 per cent in Australia and 7.5 per cent in Chile. We are leading the way in building the workforce of the future.\n\nI hope that you can see that this has been a very good year for BHP. We have taken action to shape BHP's future, while delivering very strong operational and /f.shortinancial results.\n\nThe combination of a clear strategic outlook, increasing operational excellence and greater exposure to future facing commodities is expected to enable us to deliver positive returns and grow more value for all of our stakeholders in the years ahead.\n\nThank you for your ongoing support.\n\nMike Henry Chief Executive O/ff.shorticer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n' I am pleased to report that BHP performed strongly in FY2021, with no one fatally injured across BHP's global operations, and record production and throughput in/uni00A0a number of businesses.

These portfolio and capability changes are intended to enable us to even more strongly grow long-term value by sustainably producing the commodities the world needs for continued economic growth and decarbonisation. We seek to grow value while continuing to provide climate leadership and considering social value and /f.shortinancial value in the decisions we make.\n\n## Petroleum business merger proposal - creating a global top 10/uni00A0independent energy company\n\nBHP and Woodside have entered into a merger commitment deed to combine their respective oil and gas portfolios by an all-stock merger. The proposed merger would create a global top 10 independent energy company by production, with a global top 10 position in the lique/f.shortied natural gas (LNG) industry, and would be the largest energy company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).\n\nWith the combination of two high-quality asset portfolios, the combined business would have a high-margin oil portfolio, long-life LNG assets and the /f.shortinancial resilience to help supply the energy needed for global growth and development over the energy transition.\n\nThe proposed merger is subject to con/f.shortirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of full form transaction documents, and satisfaction of conditions precedent, including shareholder, regulatory and other approvals.\n\nThe proposed merger is expected to be completed in the /f.shortirst half of CY2022. On completion, it is expected that Woodside would be owned approximately 52 per cent and 48 per cent by existing Woodside and BHP shareholders respectively. The Woodside shares would be immediately distributed to BHP shareholders. Woodside intends to remain listed on the ASX with listings on additional exchanges being considered.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Jansen Stage 1 potash project entry into a top-tier potash basin\n\nBHP's Board approved a US$5.7 billion investment in Jansen Stage 1 in Canada, which is aligned with our strategy of growing our exposure to future facing commodities in world class assets. The project is expected to produce 4.35 million tonnes of potash per year with initial production targeted for 2027, ramping up to full production over two years.\n\nJansen is located in the world's best potash basin and is in an attractive investment jurisdiction. It opens up a new front for growth for BHP and is an expandable resource that can support a century or more of operations. Potash provides us with greater diversi/f.shortication by commodity, country, and customer.\n\nPotash is a potassium-rich salt mainly used in fertiliser and potassium is an essential nutrient for plant growth.\n\n## A uni/f.shortied corporate structure /f.shortlexibility for the future\n\nBHP currently operates as a Dual Listed Company with two parent entities, both holding/uni00A0primary listings: BHP Group Limited (BHP Ltd) in Australia and BHP Group Plc (BHP/uni00A0Plc) in the United Kingdom.\n\nWe are proposing to adopt a single company structure under BHP Ltd, with a primary listing on the ASX. The company would hold a standard listing on the London Stock Exchange, a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and an American Depositary Receipt program listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nWe believe a simpli/f.shortied corporate structure would be more e/ff.shorticient and agile, better positioning the company for continued performance and growth. One-o/ff uni/f.shortication costs are expected to range between US$400 to US$500 million.\n\nIf a uni/f.shortied model is implemented, eligible BHP Plc shareholders would receive one share in BHP Ltd for each BHP Plc share they hold. The holdings of BHP Ltd shareholders would not change. BHP's dividend policy and ability to distribute fully franked dividends also would not change.\n\nSubject to /f.shortinal Board approval, BHP shareholders are expected to vote on uni/f.shortication at shareholder meetings planned for the /f.shortirst half of CY2022.\n\nPotash demand is underpinned by a growing global population and the requirement for more productive farming with a lower environmental footprint.\n\nJansen Stage 1 is expected to be low cost and one of the world's most sustainable potash mines, designed for a low-carbon footprint and low water intensity.\n\nJansen Stage 1 is expected to create 3,500 jobs during peak construction and 600 jobs in ongoing operations, and opportunities for local and Indigenous businesses. Our goal is for the Jansen workforce to be gender balanced and for First Nations employees to make up 20 per cent of the team. In the /f.shortirst of their kind in the potash industry, we have signed Opportunity Agreements with six First Nations communities around the site.\n\n## Adding to our early stage options in future facing commodities\n\nConsistent with our strategy to secure further growth opportunities in future facing commodities, in July 2021 we made a public all-cash o/ffer to acquire Noront Resources to gain access to a highly prospective nickel basin in an attractive region in Canada, following which Noront's Board recommended shareholders accept BHP's o/ffer. During the year, we also signed an agreement for a nickel exploration alliance with Midland Exploration in Canada and exercised an option to sign a farm-in agreement with Encounter Resources for the Elliott copper project in Australia.\n\n## Update on our non-core coal divestment process\n\nIn August 2020, we announced plans to divest our interests in BHP Mitsui Coal (BMC), New South Wales Energy Coal and Cerrej\u00f3n to focus our coal portfolio on higher-quality metallurgical coals used in steelmaking.\n\nIn June 2021, we announced the signing of a Sale and Purchase Agreement to divest our 33.3 per cent interest in Cerrej\u00f3n for US$294 million cash consideration. Subject to the satisfaction of customary competition and regulatory requirements, this is expected to complete in the second half of FY2022.\n\nThe process for BMC and New South Wales Energy Coal is progressing, in line with the two-year timeframe set last year. We remain open to all options and continue consultation with relevant stakeholders.\n\n1\n\n3\n\n4",

We then develop a long-term capital plan and guidance for the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.6.3  How our choice of commodities and assets helps deliver value\n\n## Our purpose is to bring together people and resources to build a better world.\n\nBuilding a better world requires the decarbonisation of the global economy and the protection and improvement of the quality of life of people everywhere. The world needs sustainable industries and products, cleaner infrastructure and more of the types of jobs people aspire to. This transformation cannot happen without resources and companies like BHP that seek to produce them more safely, responsibly and e/ff.shorticiently.\n\nUnder our Paris-aligned 1.5\u00b0C scenario, (1) we expect demand for many of our commodities to be driven by continued growth in population and the global economy, decarbonisation and electri/f.shortication. In our 1.5\u00b0C scenario, we anticipate demand for primary copper almost doubling and demand for primary nickel almost quadrupling over the next 30 years, compared to the past 30 years. We also expect demand for steel to almost double in the same period. We believe a wholesale shift away from blast furnace steelmaking, which depends on metallurgical coal, is still decades in the future.\n\nHowever, we are moving to concentrate our coal portfolio on higher-grade coals used for steelmaking (metallurgical coal) that have the greatest potential upside for quality premiums as steelmakers seek to improve blast furnace utilisation and reduce emissions intensity.\n\nPotash is expected to become vital for more e/ff.shorticient agricultural practices as governments and industry seek more e/ff.shorticient and environmentally sustainable agriculture, as well as to ease pressure on increasingly scarce land for farming.\n\nAs the shift to cleaner energy sources occurs, we expect the world will still need oil and gas to power mobility and everyday life on the pathway to decarbonisation. We see oil and gas remaining attractive in terms of their investment fundamentals for at least the next decade.\n\nThere is no easy path to achieving net zero emissions, but we believe the world has a responsibility to meet this challenge. The task of reducing emissions is more di/ff.shorticult in some sectors and countries, and that activities that reduce or remove carbon, such as natural climate solutions or carbon capture, use and storage, will be required to o/ffset those carbon-\n\nemitting activities that are harder to abate, such as industrial processes like steel and cement manufacturing, as the world aims for net zero emissions.\n\nWe are taking action to play our part in operating more responsibly to provide essential resources. We have been taking action on climate for decades and continue to work towards our target of reducing operational emissions by at least 30 per cent by FY2030 (from FY2020 levels (2) ) and our goal of achieving net zero operational emissions by 2050. (3) We are working to support the acceleration of decarbonisation in our value chain, including in the hard to abate steelmaking sector. And we will continue to progress work to assess the potential physical impacts of climate change and what will be required to build resilience. For more information regarding our goals to reduce our emissions, refer to section 1.13.7.\n\nThrough our focus on operational and /f.shortinancial excellence, ever more sustainable production and use of our commodities, and the creation of broader social value, we believe BHP will play an important role in achieving a cleaner and more prosperous world, while creating greater value for our stakeholders through doing so.\n\n- (1)  Refer to our Climate Change Report 2020 for the assumptions and outputs and limitations of our 1.5\u00b0C scenario, used in our most recent portfolio analysis.\n\n(2)  The FY2020 baseline will be adjusted for any material acquisitions and divestments based on greenhouse gas emissions at the time of the transaction. Carbon o/ffsets will be used as required.\n\n- (3)  These positions are expressed using terms that are de/f.shortined in the Glossary, including the terms 'net zero', 'target' and 'goal'.",

Underlying attributable pro/f.shortit increased by 88/uni00A0per cent to US$17.1 billion.\n\nThe shareholder dividend for the /f.shortirst half was 101 US cents per share. Combined with 200 US cents per share in the second half, the total return for the year was a record 301 US cents per share. This represents an 89 per cent payout ratio.\n\nOur total direct economic contribution for FY2021 was US$40.9 billion. This includes payments to suppliers, wages and bene/f.shortits for our approximately 80,000 employees and contractors, dividends, taxes and royalties, and voluntary investment in social projects across the communities where we operate.\n\nIn FY2021, our tax, royalty and other payments to governments totalled US$11.1 billion. Of this, 84.7 per cent or US$9.4 billion was paid in Australia. Our global adjusted e/ffective tax rate in FY2021 was 34.1 per cent, which is broadly in line with our average adjusted e/ffective tax rate over the past decade of 33.4 per cent. Once royalties are included, our FY2021 rate increases to 40.7 per cent.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nThe Western Australia Iron Ore underlying Return on Capital Employed of 89 per cent is an outstanding result, helped by higher iron ore prices but also record production. Our copper assets are showing the bene/f.shortits of capital investment and higher prices. Our focus remains on improving returns in other parts of the business.\n\nBased on the consistent performance of the past /f.shortive years, and despite the cyclical nature of our industry, our earnings and returns are re/f.shortlective of our high-quality stable business. These FY2021 results demonstrate the resilience of our diversi/f.shortied portfolio.\n\nThank you for your continued support of BHP. I look forward to speaking with more of our shareholders in the months ahead.\n\nDavid Lamont Chief Financial O/ff.shorticer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have continued to apply the Capital Allocation Framework to direct cash where it can generate the best returns. Over the year, underlying Return on Capital Employed strengthened to 32.5 per cent.\n\n' Our operational performance, when combined with higher iron ore and copper prices, drove underlying EBITDA up 69/uni00A0per cent to US$37.4 billion - at a margin of 64 per cent. Underlying attributable pro/f.shortit increased by 88 per cent to US$17.1 billion.'\n\n1",

Attributable pro/f.shortit of US$11.3 billion in FY2021 includes an exceptional loss of US$5.8 billion (after tax), compared to an attributable pro/f.shortit of US$8.0 billion, including an exceptional loss of US$1.1 billion (after tax) in the prior period. The FY2021 exceptional loss mainly relates to impairment charges recognised in relation to the Group's energy coal and Potash assets as well as the Samarco dam failure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on Exceptional items refer to note 3 'Exceptional items' in section 3\n\nRevenue of US$60.8 billion increased by US$17.9 billion, or 42 per cent, from FY2020. This increase was primarily attributable to higher average realised prices for iron ore, copper, nickel, oil, natural gas and thermal coal, partially o/ffset by lower average realised prices for metallurgical coal and LNG. Record volumes achieved at WAIO, along with the highest annual production at Olympic Dam since our acquisition in 2005, were more than o/ffset by the impacts of expected grade declines at Escondida and Spence, natural /f.shortield decline in/uni00A0Petroleum and adverse weather events.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor information on our average realised prices and production of our commodities refer to section 1.17\n\nTotal expenses excluding net /f.shortinance costs of US$34.5 billion increased by US$5.7 billion, or 20 per cent, from FY2020. This includes a US$2.0 billion increase of net impairment charges recognised against the Group's Potash assets of US$1.3 billion and at NSWEC of US$1.1 billion recognised in FY2021 compared to US$0.4 billion at Cerro Colorado in FY2020. The increase also included higher price linked costs of US$0.9 billion re/f.shortlecting higher royalties due to higher realised prices for iron ore and US$0.5 billion of higher third party concentrate purchase costs. Depreciation and amortisation expense increased by US$0.7 billion re/f.shortlecting a decrease in estimated remaining reserves at Bass Strait due to underperformance of the reservoir in the Turrum /f.shortield and lower overall condensate and natural gas liquids (NGL) recovery from the Bass Strait gas /f.shortields and higher depreciation at WAIO due to a change in Yandi's life of mine. This was combined with higher foreign exchange losses of US$1.6 billion re/f.shortlecting the impact of the stronger Australian dollar and Chilean peso against the US dollar on our cost base.\n\nLoss from equity accounted investments, related impairments and expenses of US$(0.9) billion in/uni00A0FY2021, increased by US$0.4 billion from FY2020. The increase was primarily due to unfavourable foreign exchange impacts in relation to the Samarco dam failure provision\n\n## Principal factors that a/ffect Underlying EBITDA\n\nThe following table

This re/f.shortlects the investment in an additional 28 per cent working interest in Shenzi from Hess Corporation of US$0.5 billion, increasing our share from 44/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent to 72 per cent; partially o/ffset by lower purchases of property plant and equipment of US$0.3 billion as the Group commissioned SGO and South Flank in FY2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information and a breakdown of capital and exploration expenditure on a commodity basis refer to section 1.17\n\nNet /f.shortinancing cash out/f.shortlows of US$17.9 billion increased by US$8.2 billion. This re/f.shortlects the higher repayment of interest bearing liabilities of US$6.0 billion mainly due to bond repayments on maturity of US$3.5 billion and early repurchase of hybrid bonds of US$3.4 billion. This was combined with higher dividends paid in FY2021 of US$1.0 billion re/f.shortlecting the record half year dividend and higher dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of US$1.1 billion driven by higher pro/f.shortits achieved at Escondida.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to section 1.8.4 and note 20 'Net/uni00A0debt' in section 3\n\n## Underlying Return on Capital Employed\n\n(ROCE) of 32.5 per cent increased by 15.6/uni00A0percentage points (FY2020: 16.9 per cent) re/f.shortlecting the signi/f.shorticant increase in pro/f.shortit after taxation excluding net /f.shortinance costs and exceptional items of US$9.5 billion. The Underlying ROCE in FY2021 includes US$12.1 billion of Assets under Construction (average of ending balances for FY2021 of US$10.4 billion and FY2020 of US$13.8 billion) including major projects in Potash and Mad Dog Phase Two, that are not yet producing their/uni00A0planned contribution to earnings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on Assets/uni00A0under Construction refer to note 11 'Property, plant and/uni00A0equipment' in section 3\n\n## 1.8.4  Debt and sources of liquidity\n\nOur policies on debt and liquidity management have the following objectives:\n\n- -  a strong balance sheet through the cycle\n- -  diversi/f.shortication of funding sources\n- -  maintain borrowings and excess cash predominantly in US dollars\n\n## Interest bearing liabilities, net debt and gearing\n\nAt the end of FY2021, Interest bearing liabilities were US$21.0 billion (FY2020: US$27.0 billion) and Cash and cash equivalents were US$15.2 billion (FY2020: US$13.4 billion). This resulted in Net debt (1) of US$4.1 billion, which represented a decrease of US$7.9 billion compared with the net debt position at 30 June 2020.\n\n- (1) We use APMs to re/f.shortlect our underlying /f.shortinancial performance. Refer to section 4.2 for a discussion on the APMs we use. For the de/f.shortinition and method of calculation of APMs, refer to section 4.2.1. For the composition of net debt, refer to note 20 'Net debt' in section 3.\n\nThis was primarily due to the signi/f.shorticant operating cash /f.shortlow generated from strong /f.shortinancial and operational performance, and the favourable commodity price environment experienced during the year. Gearing, which is the ratio of Net debt to Net debt plus Net assets, was 6.9 per cent at 30 June 2021, compared with 18.8 per cent at 30 June 2020.\n\nDuring FY2021, two multi-currency hybrid debt repurchase programs were completed (US$1.7 billion on 17 September 2020 and US$1.1 billion on 23 November 2020) and were funded from surplus cash. The Group also redeemed US$1.0 billion of 6.250 per cent hybrid notes on 19 October 2020, US$0.3 billion of 6.750 per cent hybrid notes on 30 December 2020 (the balance following the repurchase programs), and \u20ac1.25 billion of 4.750 per cent hybrid notes on 22 April 2021 using surplus cash.\n\nAt the subsidiary level, Escondida borrowed US$550 million to re/f.shortinance maturing long-term debt during FY2021.",

        "page_content": "1\n\n## 1.9  How we manage risk\n\n## Risk management helps us to protect and create value, and is central to achieving our purpose and/uni00A0strategic objectives.\n\nOur Risk Framework has four pillars: risk strategy, risk/uni00A0governance, risk process and/uni00A0risk intelligence.\n\n## Risk strategy\n\n## Risk classi/f.shortication\n\nWe classify all risks to which BHP is exposed using our Group Risk Architecture. This is a tool designed to identify, analyse, monitor and report risk, which provides a platform to understand and manage risks. Similar risks are considered together in groups and categories. This gives the Board and management visibility over the aggregate exposure to risks on a Group-wide basis and supports performance monitoring and reporting against BHP's risk appetite.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nBHP's Risk Appetite Statement is approved by the Board and is a foundational element of our Risk Framework. It provides guidance to management on the amount and type of risk we seek to take in pursuing our objectives.\n\n## Key risk indicators\n\nKey risk indicators (KRIs) are set by management to help monitor performance against our risk appetite. They also support decision-making by providing management with information about /f.short inancial and non-/f.shortinancial risk exposure at a Group level. Each KRI has a target, or optimal level of risk we seek to take, as well as upper and lower limits. Where either limit is exceeded, management will review potential causes to understand if BHP may be taking too little or too/uni00A0much risk and to identify whether further action is required.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nOur risk management approach is underpinned by a risk culture that supports decision-making in accordance with BHP's values, objectives and risk appetite.\n\nWe use a common foundation across BHP to build the tools and capabilities required to enable us to understand, monitor and manage our risk culture. These include tailored cultural assessments, Group-wide risk culture dashboards/uni00A0and the inclusion of behavioural auditing in our internal audit plan.\n\n## Strategic business decisions\n\nStrategic business decisions and the pursuit of our strategic objectives can inform, create or a/ffect risks to which BHP is exposed. These risks may represent opportunities as well as threats. Our Risk Appetite Statement and KRIs assist in determining whether a proposed course of/uni00A0action is within BHP's risk appetite.\n\nOur focus when managing risks associated with strategic business decisions is to enable the pursuit of high-reward strategies. Therefore, as well as having controls designed to protect BHP from threats, we seek to implement controls to enhance and/or increase the likelihood of opportunities being realised. For example, we might establish additional governance, oversight or reporting to help ensure new initiatives remain on track.\n\n## Risk governance\n\n## Three lines model\n\nBHP uses the 'three lines model' of risk governance and management to de/f.shortine the role of di/fferent teams across the organisation in managing risk. This approach sets clear accountabilities for risk management and provides appropriate 'checks and balances' to/uni00A0support us in protecting and growing value.\n\nThe /f.shortirst line is provided by our frontline sta/ff, operational management and people in functional roles - anyone who makes decisions, deploys resources or contributes to an outcome is responsible for identifying and managing the associated risks. The Risk team and other second-line functions are responsible for providing expertise, support, monitoring and challenge on risk-related matters, including by de/f.shortining Group-wide minimum standards. The third line, our Internal Audit and Advisory team, is responsible for providing independent and objective assurance over the control environment (governance, risk management and internal controls) to the Board and Executive Leadership Team. Additional assurance may also be provided by external providers, such as/uni00A0our External Auditor.\n\n## BHP Board and Committees\n\nThe Board reviews and monitors the e/ffectiveness of the Group's systems of /f.shortinancial and non-/f.shortinancial risk management and internal control. The broad range of skills, experience and knowledge of the Board assists in providing a diverse view on risk management. The Risk and Audit Committee (RAC) and Sustainability Committee assist the Board by reviewing and considering BHP's risk pro/f.shortile (covering operational, strategic and emerging risks) on/uni00A0a/uni00A0biannual basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nrefer to sections 2.1.7, 2.1.10 and 2.1.11\n\nPerformance against risk appetite is monitored and reported to the RAC, as well as the Sustainability Committee for HSEC matters, enabling the Board to challenge and hold management to account where necessary.\n\nSecond-line risk-based reviews are undertaken to provide greater oversight and enhance our understanding and management of the Group's most signi/f.shorticant risks, with outcomes reported to management, the RAC and Sustainability Committee. These outcomes may be used to\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndevelop remediation plans, adjust BHP's Risk Appetite Statement or KRIs, enhance our Risk Framework or inform strategic decisions.\n\nAdditional information on risk management and internal controls is shared between the Board, the RAC and, for HSEC matters, the Sustainability Committee, and is provided by the Business Risk and Audit Committees (covering each business region), management committees, our Internal Audit and Advisory team and our External Auditor.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information\n\nrefer to section 2.1\n\n## Risk process\n\nOur Risk Framework requires identi/f.shortication and management of risks (both threats and opportunities) to be embedded in business activities through the following process:\n\n- -  Risk identi/f.shortication - threats and opportunities are identi/f.shortied and each is assigned an owner, or accountable individual.\n- -  Risk assessments - risks are assessed using appropriate and internationally recognised techniques to determine their potential impacts and likelihood, prioritise them and inform risk treatment options.\n- -  Risk treatment - controls are implemented to prevent, reduce or mitigate threats, and enable or enhance opportunities.\n- -  Monitoring and review - risks and controls are reviewed periodically and on an ad hoc basis (including where there are highpotential events or changes in the external environment) to evaluate performance.\n\nOur Risk Framework includes requirements and guidance on the tools and process to manage current and emerging risks.\n\n## Current risks\n\nCurrent risks are risks that could impact BHP today or in the near future, and comprise current operational risks (risks that have their origin inside BHP or occur as a result of our activities) and current strategic risks (risks that may enhance or impede the achievement of our strategic objectives).\n\nCurrent risks include material and non-material risks (as de/f.shortined by our Risk Framework). The materiality of a current risk is determined by estimating the maximum foreseeable loss (MFL) if that risk was to materialise. The MFL is the estimated impact to BHP in a worst-case scenario without regard to probability and assuming all risk controls, including insurance and hedging contracts, are ine/ffective.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur principal risks\n\nare described in section 1.16",

        "page_content": "## 1.9  How we manage risk continued\n\nOur focus for current risks is to prevent their occurrence or minimise their impact should they occur, but we also consider how to maximise possible bene/f.shortits that might be associated with strategic risks (as described in/uni00A0the 'Risk strategy' section). Current material risks are required to be evaluated once a year at/uni00A0a minimum to determine whether our exposure to/uni00A0the risk is within our risk appetite.\n\n## Emerging risks\n\nEmerging risks are newly developing or changing risks that are highly uncertain and di/ff.shorticult to quantify. They are generally driven by external in/f.shortluences and often cannot be prevented.\n\nBHP maintains a 'watch list' of emerging themes that provides an evolving view of the changing external environment and how it might impact our business. We use the watch list to support the identi/f.shortication and management of/uni00A0emerging risks, as well as to inform and test/uni00A0our corporate strategy.\n\nOnce identi/f.shortied, our focus for emerging risks is on structured monitoring of the external environment, advocacy e/fforts to reduce the likelihood of the threats manifesting and identifying options to increase our resilience to/uni00A0these threats.\n\n## Risk intelligence\n\nThe Risk team provides the Board and senior management with insights on trends and aggregate exposure for our most signi/f.shorticant risks, as well as performance against risk appetite.

It comprises underground and surface operations, and is a fully integrated processing facility from ore to metal.\n\nOre mined underground is hauled by an automated train system to crushing, storage and ore hoisting facilities or trucked directly to the surface.\n\nOlympic Dam has a fully integrated metallurgical complex with a grinding and concentrating circuit, a hydrometallurgical plant incorporating solvent extraction circuits for copper and uranium, a copper smelter, a copper re/f.shortinery, including an electro-re/f.shortinery and an electrowinning-re/f.shortinery, and a recovery circuit for precious metals.\n\n## Key developments in FY2021\n\nCopper production increased by 20 per cent to 205 kilotonnes (kt) (172 kt in FY2020), re/f.shortlecting improved smelter performance and strong underground mine performance. This was the highest annual copper production since Olympic Dam was acquired in 2005. Record gold/uni00A0production of 146 thousand troy/uni00A0ounces (koz) was also achieved.\n\nThe short-term focus remains on completing the multi-year asset integrity program designed to improve the reliability of operations, which is on track heading into a planned major smelter maintenance campaign in FY2022. A new re/f.shortinery crane commenced operation in FY2021 to improve stability and reliability at the electrore/f.shortinery. At Oak Dam, next stage resource de/f.shortinition drilling commenced in May 2021 to inform resource characterisation and potential development pathways.\n\n## Iron ore\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Western Australia Iron Ore\n\n## Overview\n\nWestern Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) is an integrated/uni00A0system of four processing hubs and six/uni00A0open-cut mines in the Pilbara region of/uni00A0northern/uni00A0Western Australia, connected by/uni00A0more/uni00A0than 1,000/uni00A0kilometres of rail infrastructure/uni00A0and port facilities.\n\nWAIO's Pilbara reserve base is relatively concentrated, allowing development through integrated mining hubs connected to the mines and satellite orebodies by conveyors or spur lines. This approach seeks to maximise the value of installed infrastructure by using the same processing plant and rail infrastructure for/uni00A0several orebodies.\n\nOre is crushed, bene/f.shorticiated (where necessary) and blended at the processing hubs - Mt Newman\n\noperations, Yandi, Mining Area C and Jimblebar - to create lump and /f.shortines products that are transported along the Port Hedland-Mt Newman\n\nrail line to the Finucane Island and Nelson Point port facilities at Port Hedland.\n\nThere are four main WAIO joint ventures (JVs): Mt Newman, Yandi, Mt Goldsworthy (which includes the new South Flank mining hub) and Jimblebar. BHP's interest in each is 85 per cent, with Mitsui and ITOCHU owning the remaining 15/uni00A0per cent. The joint ventures are unincorporated,/uni00A0except Jimblebar.\n\nBHP, Mitsui, ITOCHU and POSCO are also participants in the POSMAC JV. BHP's interest in/uni00A0POSMAC is 65 per cent. The ore from the POSMAC JV is sold to the main joint ventures.\n\nAll ore is transported on the Mt Newman JV and Mt Goldsworthy JV rail lines. The Nelson Point port facility is owned by the Mt Newman JV and the Finucane Island facility is owned by the Mt Goldsworthy JV. WAIO's current licensed export capacity is 290 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa).\n\n<!-- image -->",

This was achieved despite signi/f.shorticant wet weather impacts, temporary rail labour shortages due to COVID/hyphen.uc19 related border restrictions and the planned tie-in activity to integrate South Flank with the Mining Area C processing hub. Strong operational performance across the supply chain re/f.shortlected continued improvements in car dumper performance and/uni00A0reliability, and improved train cycle times.\n\nYandi commenced its end-of-life ramp-down as South/uni00A0Flank ramped up.

It has access to infrastructure in the Bowen Basin, including a modern, multi-user rail network and its own coal-loading terminal at Hay Point, near Mackay. Queensland Coal also has contracted capacity at three other multi-user port facilities the Port of Gladstone (RG Tanna Coal Terminal), Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal and North\n\nQueensland Export Terminal (formerly known as/uni00A0Abbot Point Coal Terminal).\n\nBMA operates seven metallurgical coal mines - Goonyella Riverside, Broadmeadow, Daunia, Peak/uni00A0Downs, Saraji, Blackwater and Caval Ridge. With the exception of the Broadmeadow underground longwall operation, BMA's mines are/uni00A0open cut. BMA also owns and operates the/uni00A0Hay/uni00A0Point Coal Terminal near Mackay.\n\nBMC owns and operates two open-cut metallurgical coal mines - South Walker Creek/uni00A0and Poitrel.\n\n## Key developments in FY2021\n\nQueensland Coal's metallurgical coal production was 41 Mt (41 Mt in FY2020), re/f.shortlecting a strong operational performance including record production at Goonyella and record tonnes from Broadmeadow, but o/ffset by operational delays due to signi/f.shorticant wet weather impacts and planned wash plant maintenance at Saraji and Caval Ridge. At South Walker Creek, despite record stripping, production decreased as a result of higher strip ratios due to ongoing impacts from geotechnical constraints and lower yields.\n\nThe divestment process for our interests in BMC that was announced in August 2020 is progressing, in line with the two-year timeframe we set last year.

This was due to our strategy to focus on higher-quality products in response to increased price premiums for these products, and reduced port capacity following damage to a shiploader at the Newcastle port in November 2020. The shiploader returned to/uni00A0operation in July 2021.\n\nThe divestment process for NSWEC that was announced in August 2020 is progressing, in line with the two-year timeframe we set last year.

        "page_content": "## 1.11  Exploration\n\n## Our exploration program is focused on copper and nickel to/uni00A0replenish our resource base and/uni00A0enhance our portfolio.\n\nThe purpose is to generate attractive, lowcost, value-accretive options by leveraging our competitive strengths. For the /f.shortirst time, the Petroleum and Metals teams partnered together on a Joint Global Endowment study to explore future growth opportunities and global, yet-to-/f.shortind\n\nvolume and metal accumulations through the use of data analytics and augmented intelligence. The study is expected to create a competitive advantage and position BHP for future access to new search spaces.\n\nFollowing exploration results in previous drilling phases, which con/f.shortirmed mineralised intercepts of copper with associated gold, uranium and silver, in May 2021 the Oak Dam copper discovery in South Australia commenced the next stage of de/f.shortinition drilling to inform future design of the\n\ndeposit. Elsewhere during the year, we continued to seek, secure and test concessions in regions such as Ecuador, south-western United States, South Australia, Chile and Peru. Green/f.shortield nickel exploration activities were initiated in Western Australia and we started to look beyond Australia for new nickel opportunities through a partnership in Canada.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Exploration in FY2021\n\n## Metals (copper, nickel)\n\nThe Metals Exploration teams are focused on identifying and gaining access to new search spaces to test the best targets capable of delivering large, high-quality, Tier 1 deposits and maintaining research and technology activities aligned with our exploration strategy. Despite the slowdown and restrictions on movement due to the COVID/hyphen.uc19 pandemic, the /f.shortield teams were active in Chile, Peru, Ecuador, the United States and Australia. These activities involved early stage reconnaissance work through target de/f.shortinition and drill testing. With the addition of nickel to the exploration portfolio, the sphere of work expanded into Western Australia, where BHP holds a signi/f.shorticant land position and drill programs are scheduled pending appropriate clearances. Metals Exploration also extended its partnership with Midland Exploration, a Canadian company with interests in copper and nickel projects in northern Qu\u00e9bec in Canada, to generate nickel targets in Qu\u00e9bec, including the completion of a regional airborne electromagnetic survey. We initiated a global assessment of new nickel opportunities to/uni00A0further strengthen the pipeline.\n\nTechnology collaboration and research partnerships are key to our metals exploration strategy. In particular, we are focused on developing and deploying technologies that will allow us to get to the 'Next 400' (that is below the /f.shortirst 400 metres of the Earth's surface). Similarly, we are conducting research in collaboration with university groups to determine controls on high-grade mineralisation and undertaking programs in Chile and the United States to further our own exploration e/ffort under cover. These two elements are intended to allow us to continue to be successful in discovery within the areas where we operate that are often incorrectly considered mature.\n\nOur business partnerships continue to deliver encouraging results as we continued to add to our early stage options in future facing commodities. During FY2021, we advanced our earn-in with Luminex in Ecuador, undertaking drilling at our Tarqui project. Elsewhere in Ecuador, we maintained a 13.6 per cent ownership in SolGold plc, the majority owner and operator of the Alpala porphyry coppergold project. We also own a 5/uni00A0per cent interest in Midland Exploration Inc., a mineral exploration company in Canada. In Mexico, the team continued the /f.shortinancial agreement with Riverside Resources, which exposes BHP to new search spaces and exploration opportunities. In Australia, we committed to a partnership with Encounter Resources to explore for sediment-hosted copper deposits in/uni00A0the/uni00A0Northern Territory of Australia.\n\nIn addition, on 27 July 2021, we entered into a de/f.shortinitive Support Agreement with Noront Resources (Noront) to extend the Company an allcash takeover o/ffer, following which Noront's Board of Directors recommended shareholders accept BHP's o/ffer. Noront owns the Eagles Nest nickelcopper deposit in the James Bay Lowlands, Ontario, in an area highly prospective for nickel known as the/uni00A0Ring of Fire.\n\n## Petroleum\n\nIn FY2021, Petroleum continued to add to and mature the exploration potential of our portfolio.\n\nIn the US Gulf of Mexico, we expanded our acreage positions through lease sale participation. In July 2020, the regulator awarded BHP two blocks (1) in Green Canyon, central Gulf of Mexico and three blocks (2) in the western Gulf of Mexico. We additionally progressed our partnering strategy in the Gulf of Mexico through lease exchange agreements with Chevron, expanding our portfolio in the central Gulf of Mexico.",

The survey was completed in the March 2021 quarter. The results will be incorporated into the current evaluation of the Trion opportunity. In addition, we received formal approval for a 124-day extension for the evaluation and exploration periods through 1 July 2021 and 1 July 2022 respectively, because of the suspension of activities in 2020 due to COVID/hyphen.uc19 restrictions.\n\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, we drilled the Broadside-1 exploration well on Block 3, which fully satis/f.shortied the remaining drilling obligations on the Southern exploration licenses. The Broadside-1 well reached the main reservoir on 22 October 2020 and did not encounter hydrocarbons. The well was a dry hole and was plugged and abandoned on 8 November 2020. The Southern licenses expired in June 2021, and BHP elected to participate in a Market Development Phase (MDP) for Block 5 to retain the acreage around the LeClerc and Victoria discoveries. The proposed MDP is pending regulatory approval. The Transocean drilling rig arrived on location and commenced drilling of two Calypso gas appraisal wells for our northern licenses in July 2021.\n\nIn Australia, BHP participated in a multi-client 3D seismic acquisition in the Gippsland Basin that was completed in September 2020.

We create and promote an inclusive and diverse environment where the safety and wellbeing of our people is the highest priority. To enable our people to perform at their best, we continue to invest in technology and innovative ways to manage risk, streamline processes and improve productivity. We also o/ffer competitive remuneration that rewards expertise and invest in the development of our people to build capability and improve performance.\n\n## Developing our capabilities and an/uni00A0enabled culture\n\nTo drive continuous improvement, we respect people's di/fferences and encourage self-accountability, a hunger to learn and a commercial mindset.\n\nOne of the ways we achieve this is by applying the/uni00A0BHP Operating System (BOS) practices to help build leader capability. BOS is a way of leading and working that focuses on the safety of our people, value for our customers and a mindset of zero waste. In FY2021, we continued to train our leaders through BOS learning academies to improve operational capability and culture.\n\nWe also deploy a simpli/f.shortied Engagement and Perception Survey (EPS) three times a year. After each EPS, leaders are accountable for identifying actions to address improvement areas, as shaped by employee feedback, in the following 90 days. With a strong response rate (81 per cent) and overall engagement scores of 84 per cent, two to three percentage points under top decile of global organisation benchmarks provided by Qualtrics, we believe our overall workforce feels supported and engaged.\n\nIn 2018, we created a new business unit, Operations Services, to provide maintenance and production services across our Minerals Australia assets. Operations Services employs its people on a permanent basis and supports skill building through a structured coaching and in-/f.shortield training program designed to enable the workforce to deliver consistent equipment operation and maintenance that balances safety, maximum productivity and equipment reliability. As at 30 June 2021, Operations Services employed more/uni00A0than 3,700 employees and is expected to continue to grow.\n\nAs part of a new national training program to help bolster Australia's skills base and create new career pathways into the mining sector, the BHP FutureFit Academy (FFA) provides a pathway to join Operations Services through either an accredited maintenance traineeship or a trade apprenticeship. Once trained and quali/f.shortied, employees move to/uni00A0a/uni00A0job at one of our Australian operations. In FY2021, the FFA trained more than 500 apprentices and trainees as the /f.shortirst cohort graduated (163 graduates in FY2021).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on BHP's/uni00A0FutureFit Academy see our case study at bhp.com/people\n\n## Inclusion and diversity\n\nAn inclusive and diverse workforce promotes safety, productivity and wellbeing, and underpins our ability to attract new employees. We employ, develop and promote based on people's strengths and do not tolerate any form of discrimination, bullying, harassment, exclusion or victimisation. Our systems, processes and practices are designed to support fair treatment for all of our people. In July 2020, we published our Inclusion and Diversity Statement con/f.shortirming our vision, commitment and contributions to inclusion and diversity.\n\nOur employees are encouraged to celebrate diversity and to speak up if they encounter behaviours inconsistent with our values and expectations. To help mitigate gender pay disparities, we have taken steps to reduce potential bias in recruitment and conduct an annual gender pay review, the results of which are reported to the BHP Remuneration Committee.\n\nRespect is one of Our Charter values and is fundamental to building stronger teams and being an inclusive and diverse workplace. For some people, this has not been their experience of working at BHP. We are determined to address this.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor information on our approach to addressing sexual harassment and sexual assault refer to section 1.13.4\n\nOur ambition to achieve a more diverse and inclusive workplace is focused on four areas:\n\n- -  embedding /f.shortlexibility in the way we work\n- -  encouraging and working with our supply chain partners to support our commitment to/uni00A0inclusion and diversity\n- -  uncovering and taking steps to mitigate potential bias in our behaviours, systems, policies and processes\n- -  ensuring our brand and workplaces are attractive to a diverse range of people\n\n## Gender balance (1)\n\nAt the end of FY2021 we had 5,257 more female employees than reported in 2016. In FY2021, we increased the representation of women working at BHP by 2.7 per cent. Overall, women represent 29.8/uni00A0per cent of our employee workforce including employees on extended absence such as parental leave. The Executive Leadership Team is con/f.shortident of achieving 40 per cent female representation by the end of FY2025, meeting the de/f.shortinition of gender balance used by entities such as the International Labor Organization and HESTA, which/uni00A0consider balance to be a minimum of 40/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent women and 40 per cent men.\n\nThe percentage of employees newly hired to work/uni00A0for BHP in FY2021 was 52.1 per cent male and/uni00A047.9/uni00A0per cent female. This is a marked increase on our FY2015 baseline for our aspirational goal, which was 10.4 per cent female.\n\nWe also improved our representation of women in/uni00A0leadership by 2.8 percentage points compared to FY2020, with 25.2 per cent female leaders as at/uni00A0the end of FY2021.\n\nTo further accelerate female representation in/uni00A0FY2021, we worked to:\n\n- -  improve employment messaging to target diverse audiences about why they should work/uni00A0for BHP\n- -  progress market mapping to proactively target people or groups of people not actively looking to work for BHP or our industry\n- -  broaden our employment and brand reach across social, digital and traditional media channels\n- -  enhance our workforce development and retention through coaching and support materials for leaders\n- -  develop a Ways of Working Framework to guide employees and leaders to 'Work where you get great outcomes'\n- -  implement mentoring and support networks for women\n\nIn 2016 we publicly announced our aspiration to achieve gender balance within our employee workforce globally by the end of FY2025.\n\nThe table below shows the gender composition of our employees, senior leaders and the Board over the last three /f.shortinancial years.\n\n|                                                    | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Female employees (2)                               | 11,868 | 8,072  | 6,874  |\n| Male employees (2)                                 | 27,953 | 23,517 | 22,052 |\n| Female senior managers (3)(4)                      | 90     | 67     | 70     |\n| Male senior managers (3)(4)                        | 189    | 185    | 227    |\n| Female Executive Leadership Team (ELT) members (3) | 5      | 4      | 4      |\n| Male Executive Leadership Team (ELT) members (3)   | 5      | 6      | 7      |\n| Female Board members (3)                           | 4      | 3      | 4      |\n| Male Board members (3)                             | 8      | 9      | 7      |",

BHP recognises, as part of our Global Indigenous Peoples Strategy, that we can contribute to the economic empowerment of Indigenous peoples through providing opportunities for employment, training, procurement and supporting Indigenous enterprises. Pre-employment training, employment, career development and retention of/uni00A0Indigenous employees are key to this.\n\nWe have set targets to achieve Indigenous employment of 8 per cent in our Australian workforce by the end of FY2025, 10 per cent in our workforce in Chile by the end of FY2026 and 20/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent in our Potash workforce in Canada by the end of FY2027.\n\nIndigenous employment within our employee and contractor workforce (5) as at 30 June 2021 was 7.2/uni00A0per cent in Australia, 7.5 per cent at our operations in Chile and 13.7 per cent at our/uni00A0Jansen/uni00A0Potash Project in Canada.\n\n## LGBT+ inclusion\n\nOur LGBT+ ally employee inclusion group, Jasper, was established in 2017 as a natural extension of our inclusion and diversity aspirations and to re/f.shortlect Our Charter value of respect. The membership base of LGBT+ employees and allies has grown substantially with eight regional chapters globally.\n\nIn February 2021, we launched our Gender A/ff.shortirmation Policy and leader toolkit outlining how we will support employees a/ff.shortirming their gender.\n\n## Flexible working\n\nOur focus on /f.shortlexible working over the past few years assisted our o/ff.shortice-based workers to adapt to remote working requirements caused by the COVID/hyphen.uc19 pandemic.\n\nWe expect to maintain a hybrid working model for employees based in corporate o/ff.shortices, allowing o/ff.shortice and home-based working arrangements, while requiring 30 to 50 per cent of their work to be based in the o/ff.shortice (excluding times when COVID19-related workplace restrictions are in place) depending on the nature of their work.\n\nWe also understand many site-based employees are in roles that by their very nature cannot be performed remotely.

It describes our purpose, our values, how we measure our success, who we are, what we do/uni00A0and what we stand for.\n\nOur Code of Conduct demonstrates how to practically apply the commitments and values set out in Our Charter and re/f.shortlects many of the standards and procedures we apply throughout BHP.\n\nThrough these documents, we make it clear that discrimination on any basis is not acceptable and we give full and fair consideration to applications for employment received from all candidates, having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\njob-share arrangements, /f.shortlexible rosters and career breaks.\n\n## Employee relations\n\nOur four key focus areas for employee relations are:\n\n- -  ensuring we comply with legal obligations and regional labour regulations\n- -  negotiating where there are requirements to collectively bargain\n- -  closing out agreements with our workforce in South America and Australia, with no lost time due to industrial action, to the extent possible\n- -  creating solid relations with our workforce based on a culture of trust and cooperation\n\nDuring FY2021, Minerals Americas participated in seven collective bargaining processes, which were important to enable our business objectives in relation to /f.shortinancial performance, organisational capabilities, culture change and behaviour management.\n\nEscondida signed three collective bargaining agreements: with the supervisors' union for 36 months (1 October 2020 to 30 September 2023), the Intermel (Operators and Maintainers) union for 24 months (1 April 2021 to 31 March 2023) and Escondida and Union No. 1 (Operators and Maintainers) for 36 months (2 August 2021 to 1 August 2024). Spence signed two 36-month collective bargaining agreements: with the supervisors' union (1 December 2020 to 30 November 2023) and the Operator and Maintainers union (1 June 2021 to 31 May 2024). Cerro Colorado executed a collective agreement for 36 months with the supervisors' union (1 June 2021 to 31 May 2024).\n\nThe Specialists and Supervisors Union for BHP Chile Inc. invoked article 342 of the Chilean Labor Code, under which employees had their current entitlements under existing collective agreement preserved for the next 18 months (June 2021 to December 2022). In the collective bargaining between BHP Chile Inc. and the Specialists and Supervisors Union, there were 13 days of legal strike action (27 May 2021 to 8 June 2021). Contingency plans were put in place to hand over management of the control rooms back to the operations and planned maintenance activities were undertaken ahead of time, resulting in no operational downtime due to this strike.\n\nIn instances where employees require support for a disability, we work with them to identify roles that meet their skills, experience and capability, and o/ffer retraining where required.\n\nOur Human Rights Policy Statement outlines our commitment to respecting human rights, which includes rights related to workplace health, safety and labour. We commit to operating in a manner consistent with the terms of the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.\n\nThe Our Requirements standards outline the mandatory minimum standards we expect of those who work for or on behalf of BHP.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNegotiations to renew the collective agreements with Cerro Colorado Operators and Maintainers union is expected to be completed in the /f.shortirst quarter of FY2022.\n\n## Impacts and challenges from COVID/hyphen.uc19 related to our people\n\nThe impact of COVID/hyphen.uc19 and the resulting measures taken by governments within Australia to control its spread, resulted in changes to working patterns for our employees and contractors. In Australia and Chile, there was an increase in unplanned absenteeism due to COVID/hyphen.uc19 restrictions. As a result of the COVID/hyphen.uc19 restrictions, we implemented a range of employee measures across our business to reduce the number of workers required onsite, such as remote working arrangements, increased health and safety requirements, vaccination campaigns and hybrid working.\n\nWith state border closures restricting the mobilisation of employees and contractors to our operating sites in Australia, changes to rosters and hours of work were made to ensure operational requirements for essential work were met. There has also been a further extension of /f.shortlexible work options for employees and contractors in Australia in response to government-imposed lockdowns preventing them from attending their normal place of work. These /f.shortlexible work options included staggered start times, working from home and reduced working hours. Our contractor workforce was reduced after the Spence Growth Option (SGO) transitioned to the operation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor information on the impact of/uni00A0COVID/hyphen.uc19 to our workforce refer to section 1.13.5\n\n- (5)  Based on a 'point in time' snapshot of employees and/uni00A0labour hire contractors as at 30 June 2021.\n\nSome of those standards relate to people activities, such as recruitment and talent retention.\n\nOur all-employee share purchase plan, Shareplus, is available to all permanent full-time and part-time employees and those on /f.shortixed-term contracts, except where local regulations limit operation of the scheme. In these instances, alternative arrangements are in place.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on people is/uni00A0available at bhp.com/people",

We also understand there will be times when we/uni00A0must make di/ff.shorticult choices involving trade-o/ffs, some of which may lead to di/fferences of opinion and concern among some stakeholders. While we seek to gain and maintain the support of all our stakeholders, we also respect the right of every stakeholder to disagree with a decision or choice we may make.\n\nThere may be adverse impacts in the production and use of our products, and while our aim is to avoid them, the nature of our activities and products means this will not always be possible. We seek to minimise and mitigate these impacts where we can and look for ways to contribute to the long-term health of/uni00A0society and the natural environment.\n\nWe view our management of sustainability as core to our e/fforts to generate social value including:\n\n- -  putting the health and safety of our people /f.shortirst\n- -  being environmentally responsible\n- -  respecting human rights\n- -  supporting the communities where we operate\n\nWe recognise sustainability is integral to the work we do at BHP. We believe it leads to higher performance by making us more productive and safe.\n\nOur approach to sustainability is de/f.shortined by Our Charter and governed through the Our Requirements standards. These standards describe our mandatory minimum performance requirements and provide the foundation to develop and implement management systems at our operated assets.\n\nAcross the Group, we embed sustainability performance measures through our public /f.shortive-year sustainability targets. Achieving these targets and working towards our goals aligns with our commitments to the Paris Agreement goals and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs). It also drives improvement in our sustainability performance. Our current /f.shortive-year public sustainability targets conclude at the end of FY2022, and we are developing new targets. We have already set a climate change target to reduce operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 from our operated assets) by at least 30 per cent from FY2020 levels (1) by FY2030. Our long-term goal is to achieve net zero (2) operational emissions by 2050. (3)\n\nWe commit to several sustainability frameworks, standards and initiatives and disclose data according to their requirements. Our sustainability reporting, including on our website is prepared in accordance with the\n\nGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards comprehensive-level reporting, (4) the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Sustainable Development Framework, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Metals and Mining standard. It also serves as our United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) Communication on Progress on implementation of the UNGC Ten Principles and/uni00A0support for its broader development objectives.\n\nBHP's Board oversees our approach to sustainability. The Board's Sustainability Committee has oversight of health, safety, environmental and community (HSEC) matters and assists the Board with/uni00A0governance/uni00A0and monitoring.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information about the Sustainability Committee and its work refer to section 2.1.11\n\nThere is a growing number of sustainability standards we commit to voluntarily or as part of our memberships. In FY2021, we completed a number of self-assessments across di/fferent operated assets for the ICMM Mining Principles and associated performance expectations. In October 2020, BHP signed a letter of commitment to the CopperMark (5) assurance process for our copper producing assets (Olympic Dam, Escondida and Spence) and completed self-assessments as part of this commitment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) The FY2020 baseline will be adjusted for any material acquisitions and divestments based on greenhouse gas emissions at/uni00A0the time of the transaction.

The highest number of events with potential for one or more fatalities were related to vehicle and mobile equipment accidents. High-potential injury trends will remain a primary focus to assess progress against our most important safety objective, eliminating fatalities\n- -  a decrease in total recordable injury frequency (TRIF) of 11 per cent from FY2020. The highest number of injuries is related to slips, trips and falls for both employees and contractors\n- -  an increase in /f.shortield leadership activities, which occurred at a sustainable frequency rate of 9,400 activities per million hours worked with over 1,573,000 activities completed in the period and over 44,000 employees and contractors participating in the program at least once. Scheduled activities compared to/uni00A0non-scheduled activities increased by 72 per cent from FY2020 and coaching increased by 5 per cent\n- -  we took a number of signi/f.shorticant steps to improve our controls to /a.altddress sexu/a.altl /a.altss/a.altult /a.altnd sexu/a.altl harassment, however we/uni00A0have further to go to fully stop this behaviour from occurring across BHP\n- -  no safety /f.shortines were received at our operated/uni00A0assets in FY2021\n\nOur results were achieved through a sustained focus on improving our management of risk through new and existing programs including:\n\n- -  Fatality Elimination Program\n- -  Integrated Contractor Management Program\n- -  Field Leadership Program\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n## Fatality Elimination Program\n\nIn FY2021, we introduced our Fatality Elimination Program to enable a step change towards our goal of no fatalities across our business.\n\nFatality elimination is not a new priority for us. We have been seeking to improve our safety performance over a number of years and more recently, have considerably reduced high potential injuries. However, there is more to do and we are taking additional steps to systematise a common set of controls. In FY2021, the Fatality Elimination Program:\n\n- -  engaged subject-matter experts and mining, equipment, technology and services (METS) organisations to provide control solutions to/uni00A0our top 10 safety risks\n- -  identi/f.shortied over 60 recommended controls for our top 10 safety risks, including new controls and material improvements to existing controls\n- -  conducted assessments at our operated assets and relevant functions against the recommended controls to determine the actions that need to be taken\n- -  established a global project team to prioritise and deliver a global /f.shortive-year fatality/uni00A0elimination roadmap\n- -  commenced planning to update the Our Requirements for Safety standard and coordinate a selection of control and human performance improvement initiatives in FY2022\n\n## Integrated Contractor Management/uni00A0Program\n\nOur Integrated Contractor Management Program is designed to make it safer and easier for our contractors to work with us. Introduced in FY2020, the program is focused on building long-term mutually bene/f.shorticial relationships with our contractors, integrating and simplifying processes and systems, and creating an inclusive, respectful and caring workforce culture.\n\nIn 2021, we launched our new global contractor performance standard, establishing global requirements for how we work with contractors (including subcontractors and consultants).\n\n## Performance data - workforce health and safety for FY2021 (1) High-potential injury events (2)\n\n| Year ended 30 June           |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| High potential injury events |     33 |     42 |     50 |\n\n|                                     |   Employees |   Contractors |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------|---------------|\n| High-potential injury frequency (3) |        0.02 |          0.05 |\n\n## Total recordable injury frequency\n\n| Year ended 30 June                    |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total recordable injury frequency (4) |    3.7 |    4.2 |    4.7 |\n\n|                                       |   Employees |   Contractors |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------|---------------|\n| Total recordable injury frequency (3) |        0.67 |           0.8 |\n\nThis replaced existing local frameworks and provides a standardised way of working with contractors to drive best practice. To embed the/uni00A0standard, a number of initiatives and tools have been developed:\n\n- -  Our Scope of Work Library is an online resource containing best practice examples for di/fferent types of contractor engagements. This assists our contractor partners to better understand the work required at our sites, enabling them to assign contractors with the right skills and/uni00A0competencies to perform the work.\n- -  To assist in de/f.shortining the minimum requirements for key roles, governance and process routines, we introduced an operational tiering model. The model factors in work scope, operational safety risks and contract arrangements to inform the robustness of process requirements, including key performance indicators.\n- -  We developed a speci/f.shortic contractor perception survey to ensure we receive contractor feedback on our culture and their/uni00A0experience working at BHP.\n- -  We developed systems to support the contractor management process to improve supervision and training of contractors across our operated assets. A pilot was conducted at one of our Australian operated assets to/uni00A0ensure the system was /f.shortit-for-purpose before broader implementation.\n\n## Field Leadership Program\n\nLeaders spending time in the /f.shortield is vital to maintaining safe operations. Our global Field Leadership Program involves leaders engaging with workers in the /f.shortield to drive a common approach to improving health, safety and environment (HSE) performance. These engagements are used to verify critical safety controls are in place, being applied and are e/ffective in reducing the risk of fatalities.\n\nThe program encourages the workforce to provide feedback to their leaders about safety and to look out for the safety of themselves and/uni00A0their colleagues.\n\n## In FY2021 we:\n\n- -  increased supervisor time in the /f.shortield through the BHP Operating System (BOS) and reduced the large spans of control that some supervisors had over their teams\n- -  continued to improve the quality of /f.shortield leadership activities by increasing coaching and delivery of /f.shortield leadership engagements at our operated assets\n- -  focused on ensuring our leaders were proactively scheduling /f.shortield leadership activities and executing them to plan to ensure adequate veri/f.shortication of all fatality risks/uni00A0across our operated assets\n- -  developed a global, standardised /f.shortield leadership procedure designed to increase the e/ffectiveness of /f.shortield leadership activities by reducing variances in practices across the business",

This conduct is completely unacceptable, contrary to our values and unlawful. Over a number of years, we have taken action to prevent sexual harassment including through education, encouraging reporting and security measures. While we have/uni00A0made important progress, this continues to be an issue at BHP and, as long as it does, we/uni00A0must and will do more and we continue to focus and invest in preventing this behaviour.\n\nIn 2018, we formally de/f.shortined sexual assault and sexual harassment as a health and safety risk. As part of the risk assessment processes, we engaged experts in health and safety, harassment and inclusion and diversity. We introduced a range of controls including security measures such as on-site security guards, additional CCTV, increased security patrols in public areas and improved lighting, with a further AU$300 million for planned improvements to occur in FY2022. We have also introduced trauma informed emergency response, victim-centric investigations and a dedicated support service that provides end-toend assistance and advice to anyone impacted by sexual assault and sexual harassment. We are committed to the full implementation of all requisite controls in FY2022, and have tied completion of actions to executive and employee remuneration. We also recognise that we can improve the coordination of our work to address this issue and have set up a project management o/ff.shortice for this purpose.\n\nSexual assault and sexual harassment are risks/uni00A0for BHP and the industry, and we are working with others in the industry to address/uni00A0these risks, as we have done with other/uni00A0health and safety matters. We participated/uni00A0in the Minerals Council of Australia Taskforce that developed and released/uni00A0an industry statement and Code of Conduct aimed at eradicating sexual assault and sexual harassment from our industry. We also made a submission to the Inquiry in Western Australia into sexual harassment against women in the FIFO mining/uni00A0industry to/uni00A0contribute to the industry addressing this/uni00A0issue which can be found at BHP Submission - WA Inquiry in relation to Sexual Harassment in FIFO mining industry.pdf (parliament.wa.gov.au).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(1)\n\nFor more information on reported cases refer to section 1.13.6\n\nMore information on safety is available at bhp.com/safety\n\n## 1.13.5  Health\n\nWe are committed to protecting the health and wellbeing of our employees and contractors.\n\nWe set clear mandatory minimum standards to/uni00A0identify and assess health risks, manage their impact and monitor the health of our people.\n\n## Occupational illness\n\nThe reported incidence of occupational illness (1) for employees in FY2021 was 308 which was 4.36 per million hours worked, representing a minor increase compared to FY2020 which was 4.30 per million hours worked.\n\nFor our contractor workforce, the reported incidence of occupational illness was 180 which was 1.87 per million hours worked, an increase of 31 per cent compared with FY2020. Due to regulatory regimes and limited access to data, we do not have full oversight of the incidence of contractor noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL)/uni00A0cases.\n\nMusculoskeletal illness accounts for the majority of our reported occupational illnesses.\n\nThese are conditions impacting the musculoskeletal system and connective tissues caused by repetitive work-related stress or strain or exposure over time. Musculoskeletal illness does not include disorders caused by slips, trips, falls or similar incidents.\n\nThe main change in the incidence of occupational illness in FY2021 as compared to FY2020 was an increase in the rate of employee cases of NIHL reported by our operated assets in South America. This was due to an increase in testing for noise induced hearing loss this year because of a suspension of testing activities due to COVID/hyphen.uc19 impacts last year.\n\nOur occupational illness data excludes cases of COVID/hyphen.uc19 among our employees and contractors. In settings of high levels of community transmission and with an evolving understanding of the epidemiological criteria for infection and emerging COVID/hyphen.uc19 variants with evidence of increased transmission, it is di/ff.shorticult to conclude, with reasonable certainty, that a person was infected because of workrelated activities or exposure. For information on our response to COVID/hyphen.uc19, refer to the 'COVID/hyphen.uc19' section on the next page.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNoise-induced hearing loss         Musculoskeletal illness         Other Illnesses\n\n- (1) The data for FY2017 and FY2018 includes Continuing and Discontinued operations (Onshore US assets).

        "page_content": "## Occupational exposures\n\nOccupational exposure limits (OELs) for our most material exposures are set according to the latest scienti/f.shortic evidence, which for a number of agents, such as diesel particulate matter (DPM), resulted in lower limits than the then regulatory requirements. Where exposures potentially exceed regulatory limits or our stricter limits, respiratory protective equipment is required.\n\nFor our most material exposures to DPM, silica and coal mine dust, we have a /f.shortive-year target to achieve, by FY2022, a 50 per cent reduction in the number of workers potentially exposed (1) as compared to our 30 June 2017 baseline exposure pro/f.shortile. (2)(3) In FY2016, we committed to applying an OEL of 0.03 mg/m 3 for DPM and in FY2017, we committed to applying OELs of 1.5 mg/m3 for respirable coal mine dust by 1 July 2020 and 0.05 mg/m 3 for silica by 1 July 2021. Exposure data in this Annual Report is based on/uni00A0these limits and in all cases discounts the e/ffect of personal protective equipment.\n\nIn FY2021, material exposures overall reduced by 70 per cent compared to the adjusted FY2017 baseline which is better than our FY2020 target. This includes a reduction of 29/uni00A0per cent compared to FY2020 in the number/uni00A0of workers potentially exposed to silica/uni00A0in excess of our OEL and this reduction was largely due to reduction in exposures by our/uni00A0Minerals Americas operated assets where there was a 35 per cent reduction compared to/uni00A0the previous year.\n\nIn addition, work to control exposure to DPM at Nickel West and Olympic Dam resulted in a 12/uni00A0per cent reduction compared to FY2020 in the number of workers potentially exposed to DPM. No potential exposures in excess of our OEL for respirable coal mine dust were reported in FY2020; however, in FY2021 we have identi/f.shortied a workgroup as being potentially exposed in excess of our OEL at one of our coal operated assets. We are committed to reducing this potential exposure to below the OEL in the next/uni00A0reporting period.\n\n## Coal mine dust lung disease\n\nIn FY2021, there were four coal mine dust lung/uni00A0disease (CMDLD) (4) claims accepted, which/uni00A0consisted of two current workers and/uni00A0two/uni00A0former workers at our BMA asset.\n\n## Mental health\n\nThe mental health of our people continues to be a focus. In FY2021, good progress was made with implementing our Group-wide Mental Health Framework to raise awareness of mental wellbeing, reduce stigma and increase the capacity of our leaders to recognise and support individuals experiencing mental illness.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nWe also became a founding member of the/uni00A0Global Business Collaboration for Better Workplace Mental Health, which seeks to advance progress across the globe by committing senior leaders to a pledge to create/uni00A0mentally healthy workplaces.\n\nTo support the proactive management of mental wellbeing and give our workforce the tools and skills they need to build resilience and positive mental health, we provide and promote the Employee Assistance Program, our mental health toolkit, Thrive, education and awareness campaigns (including stigma reduction) and the/uni00A0BHP Resilience Program.\n\nIn May 2021, we held our inaugural Mental Health month, with the aim of increasing mental wellbeing in the communities where we operate and encouraging everyone to support and look out for one another. We also continue to support global mental health campaigns, including World Mental Health Day, R U OK? Day and Movember.\n\nWe plan to progress our e/fforts in FY2022 by addressing psychosocial hazards in the workplace using a risk management approach to further support better workplace/uni00A0mental health.\n\n## COVID/hyphen.uc19\n\nThroughout FY2021, we continued to navigate the challenges of the global COVID/hyphen.uc19 pandemic and prioritise the health and safety of our people and workplaces. This included the removal of vulnerable workers from the workplace and an increase in testing regimes for site-based workforce during periods of high community transmissions.\n\nAcross BHP's global workforce, (5) we estimated there were as many as 5,000 con/f.shortirmed (6) COVID/hyphen.uc19 cases including three deaths, with with around 1,100 of those con/f.shortirmed cases potentially infectious while at work (7) (/f.short igures for persons potentially infectious while at work are included irrespective of where infection may have occurred). We recognise the signi/f.shorticant impact COVID/hyphen.uc19 has had on the daily lives of our people and the communities where we operate and we o/ffer our deep sympathies to the families of our colleagues who tragically were amongst the many people who have lost their lives to COVID/hyphen.uc19. Almost all/uni00A0con/f.shortirmed cases were from people in/uni00A0our Minerals Americas workforce.\n\nWe conduct COVID/hyphen.uc19 tests as part of our workplace entry screening, which includes mainly polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and a small percentage of antigen testing. In FY2021, we conducted 27,261 tests in our Petroleum operated assets and 440,000 tests in our Minerals Americas operated assets and\n\nidenti/f.shortied 248 and 2,277 con/f.shortirmed cases respectively. This included symptomatic and asymptomatic cases that may not have been identi/f.shortied otherwise.\n\nOur support extended to areas impacted by high community transmissions and reduced local medical capabilities. This included establishing telehealth services, in-home PCR testing, emergency ambulance support, mental wellness support and provision of medical support (e.g. procurement of oxygen concentrators in India) to support ill workers and/uni00A0their family members.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on health including a case study on how we supported our people and the communities where we operate through COVID/hyphen.uc19 is available at bhp.com/health\n\n## 1.13.6  Ethics and business conduct\n\n## Our conduct\n\nOur Code of Conduct (Our Code) (8) brings our values to life so we can make the right choices every day. It applies to everyone who works for us or on our behalf. To ensure everyone understands how Our Code applies and the standards of behaviour we expect, annual training is mandatory for all employees and contractors. There are also consequences for breaching Our Code and we encourage people to speak up where a decision or action is not in/uni00A0line with Our Code or Our Charter .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Code is available in /f.shortive languages and/uni00A0accessible at bhp.com\n\nEthicsPoint is our con/f.shortidential reporting tool that is accessible to all, including external stakeholders and the public, to report conduct that may be unethical, illegal or inconsistent with Our Code .\n\nIn 2021, 4,162 reports were received into EthicsPoint (of these 3,541 were classi/f.shortied as business conduct concerns (9) ), representing an increase of 52 per cent from FY2020. This increase coincides with enhanced training on Our Code and e/fforts to increase awareness of the requirement for line leaders to log all concerns relating to Our Code in EthicsPoint. Of the reports received, 42 per cent were made anonymously, (10) compared with 53 per cent in FY2020, a reduction from FY2020, which may indicate that reporters have greater con/f.shortidence in the EthicsPoint process.

We believe these transparency initiatives will reduce corruption risk and improve our ability to/uni00A0operate and compete for resources.\n\n## Anti-corruption\n\nWe are determined to play a signi/f.shorticant role in the global /f.shortight against corruption in the resources industry. Our Charter and Our Code provide the framework for our anti-corruption compliance program. All activities that potentially involve higher risks of exposure to corruption require review or approval by our Ethics and Compliance function.\n\nThis function has a mandate to design and govern our compliance frameworks for key\n\ncompliance risks, including anti-bribery and corruption. The function is independent of our assets and regions, and reports to the Chief Legal Governance and External A/ffairs O/ff.shorticer. The Chief Compliance O/ff.shorticer reports quarterly to the Risk and Audit Committee on ethics and compliance issues and meets at least annually with the Committee Chair.\n\nOur Ethics and Compliance function also participates in all risk assessments in respect of operated assets or functions that are considered to carry material anti-corruption risks. In FY2021, the Ethics and Compliance team provided input into 41 risk assessments.\n\nAs part of our commitment to anti-corruption, we prohibit authorising, o/ffering, giving or promising anything of value directly or indirectly to a government o/ff.shorticial to in/f.shortluence o/ff.shorticial action, or to anyone to encourage them to perform their work disloyally or otherwise improperly. We also prohibit facilitation payments, which are payments to government o/ff.shorticials for routine government actions. Our people must take care that third parties acting on our behalf do not violate anti-corruption laws. Disciplinary action, including dismissal or termination of contractual relationships, may follow from a breach of/uni00A0these requirements.\n\nWe regularly review our anti-corruption compliance program to ensure it meets the requirements of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, the Australian Criminal Code and the applicable laws and regulatory developments of all places where we do business. These laws are consistent with the standards of the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public O/ff.shorticials in International Business Transactions. Recognising the challenges posed to normal ways of working by COVID/hyphen.uc19, in FY2021 we increased the frequency of our compliance monitoring to support the timely identi/f.shortication of activities that could potentially present an enhanced compliance risk. By regularly calibrating our compliance processes, we work to ensure optimal resource allocation to areas presenting the highest corruption risks to our business. Our e/fforts are complementary to the BHP Foundation's global partnership with Transparency International, which is supporting governments to identify and address corruption risks in mining licencing processes.\n\nAnti-corruption training is provided to all employees and contractors as part of mandatory annual training on Our Code . In FY2021, additional risk-based anti-corruption training was also undertaken by 3,879 employees and contractors, as well as employees of certain of our business partners and community partners.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on ethics and business/uni00A0conduct is available at bhp.com/ethics\n\n## 1.13.7  Climate change and portfolio/uni00A0resilience\n\nWe believe the world must pursue the Paris Agreement goals with increased levels of national and global ambition to limit the impacts of climate change. Providing access to a/ffordable and clean energy and other products\n\nis essential to meet sustainable development goals. At BHP, we advocate for e/ffective actions in line with the Paris Agreement goals while recognising the challenge of achieving these goals is of global scale and historic complexity.\n\nIn September 2021, BHP published its Climate Transition Action Plan 2021, which sets out our strategic approach to our goal to reduce operational GHG emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 from our operated assets) to net zero (2) by 2050, and our enhanced Scope 3 position for GHG emissions in our value chain. The Plan, together with more information on our climate commitments, actions and performance, including our Climate Change Report 2020, is/uni00A0available at bhp.com/climate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on our climate commitments, actions and performance, including our Climate Change Report 2020,/uni00A0is/uni00A0available at bhp.com/climate\n\n## Governance and management\n\nClimate change is a material governance and/uni00A0strategic issue for us. Our Board is actively engaged in the governance of climate change issues, including our strategic approach and performance against our commitments, supported by the Sustainability Committee and the Risk and Audit Committee (for more information, refer to section 2.1).\n\nBelow the level of the Board, key management decisions are made by the CEO and management, in accordance with their delegated authority. Management has primary responsibility for the design and implementation of our climate change strategy and execution of that strategy is overseen by the Climate Change Steering Committee. BHP has a dedicated Climate Change Team that is responsible for advising the Executive Leadership Team. The team collaborates with BHP's functions and asset teams, external partners and industry to develop practical climate change solutions, designed to preserve and unlock long-term value for BHP. It regularly prepares information and advice for the Executive Leadership Team,/uni00A0Sustainability Committee, Risk and Audit/uni00A0Committee and the Board on climate-related strategy, risks and performance against/uni00A0climate-related metrics. It also monitors key indicators and signposts against our appetite for climate change-related risks (both threats and opportunities).\n\n## Addressing climate risks\n\nBHP applies a single, Group-wide approach to the management of risk, known as the Risk Framework. When new and emerging risks are identi/f.shortied, each is assigned an owner in the part of the business where the risk occurs. Risks are assessed to determine their potential impacts and likelihood, enable prioritisation and determine risk treatment options. We then implement controls designed to prevent, reduce or mitigate downside risks and increase the likelihood of opportunities being realised. Risks and controls are reviewed periodically and/uni00A0on an ad-hoc basis to evaluate performance of the controls against the risks.",

        "page_content": "Climate-related risks can be grouped in two categories: transition risk and physical risk.\n\nTransition risks arise from policy, regulatory, legal, technological, market and other societal responses to the challenges posed by climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy. For more information on BHP's exposure to and management of transition risks,/uni00A0refer to section 1.16.\n\nPhysical risks refer to acute risks that are eventdriven, including increased severity of extreme weather events, and chronic risks resulting from longer-term changes in climate patterns. For more information on BHP's exposure to and management of physical risks, refer to 'Adaptation to physical risks' below in this section and to section 1.16.\n\n## Adaptation to physical risks\n\nBHP's vision for adapting to the physical risks of climate change is to take a proactive and collaborative approach to building the climate resilience of our operated assets, investments, portfolio, supply chain, communities and ecosystems, to achieve mutually bene/f.shorticial outcomes for our stakeholders.\n\nIn FY2021, following external benchmarking and internal engagement, we /f.shortinalised our updated Adaptation Strategy as set out below.\n\nThe focus in FY2021 was on enhancing governance structures, developing a more consistent and comprehensive approach to the use of climate data, and improving how we integrate physical climate risk within the existing risk management process in order to identify and resource priority actions.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nIn FY2022, we intend to build these priority actions into planning and capital allocation processes, and continue to analyse identi/f.shortied risks in more detail. This will provide the basis from which we can develop our ability to report on speci/f.shortic material physical risks and their potential /f.shortinancial impacts (including material expenditure on climate change adaptation) in later years.\n\n## Portfolio analysis and capital/uni00A0alignment\n\nThe world must undergo multiple transitions arising from commitments to reduce GHG emissions. These transitions are complex, multifaceted and could reasonably be expected to manifest in unique ways across di/fferent regions, re/f.shortlecting heterogeneous local conditions. However, we believe that together they comprise a global transition to a lower-carbon economy that can mitigate the impacts of climate change. We see steps towards these transitions in the emergence of electric mobility and the rapid cost declines of renewable power generation. Global accords such as the Paris Agreement and subsequent government commitments suggest these transitions are likely to accelerate.\n\nThe Paris Agreement has set an ambition to pursue e/fforts to limit global temperature increases to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, which will require aggressive action to reduce GHG emissions. Abatement commensurate with limiting temperature increases to 1.5\u00b0C would reduce the potential physical impact of climate change on our assets, our employees, our communities and our markets, and potentially generate signi/f.shorticant value for our portfolio.\n\n## Building blocks of our Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (FY2021 - 2025)\n\n## Intelligence and capability\n\nEnhance approach to collation and use of climate / climate-related data and information; Build knowledge and capability\n\n## Risk\n\nIdentify and assess physical risks; De/uni00A0ine adaptation measures for the short, medium and longer term\n\n## Strategy and planning\n\n## Investment / execution\n\n## Collective action\n\nEnhance adaptation plans; Integrate adaptation into operational and investment decisions through strategy, planning and evaluation frameworks\n\nInvest in technology, Nature-based Solutions (NbS) and operational changes to build resilience, realise opportunities and deliver multiple bene/uni00A0its for our business, surrounding communities and ecosystems\n\nContribute to increasing the climate resilience of communities and ecosystems, and across our industry, supply chain and markets\n\n## Governance\n\nEnhance ownership and accountability for climate adaptation Ensure e/uni00A0ective monitoring, reporting and compliance with requirements\n\n- (1) https://www.bhp.com/climate\n- (2)  Scenarios highlight critical elements of assumed future states and draw attention to the key factors that may drive future developments. They are hypothetical constructs, not forecasts, predictions or sensitivity analyses. As they are a tool to enhance critical strategic thinking, a key feature of scenarios is they should challenge conventional wisdom about the future. In a world of uncertainty, scenarios are intended to explore alternatives that may signi/f.shorticantly alter the basis for 'business as usual' assumptions. There are inherent limitations with scenario analysis and it is di/ff.shorticult to predict which, if any, of the scenarios might eventuate. Scenarios do not constitute de/f.shortinitive outcomes for us. Scenario analysis relies on assumptions that may or may not be, or prove to be, correct and may or may not eventuate, and scenarios may be impacted by additional factors to the assumptions disclosed.\n- (3)  This scenario aligns with the Paris Agreement goals and requires steep global annual GHG emissions reductions, sustained for decades, to stay within a 1.5\u00b0C carbon budget. Refer to the BHP Climate Change Report 2020 available at bhp.com for information about the assumptions, outputs and limitations of our 1.5\u00b0C Paris-aligned scenario. 1.5\u00b0C is above pre-industrial levels.\n\nIn the BHP Climate Change Report 2020, (1) we described the impact on our business of four divergent scenarios (2) across a range of temperature outcomes, including our Parisaligned 1.5\u00b0C scenario. (3) Our most recent portfolio analysis indicated that under our 1.5\u00b0C scenario, the world would need around twice as much steel and copper, and four times as much nickel in the next 30 years as it did in the last 30. Potash demand, required for higher agricultural yields due to land use competition, also grows under that scenario.\n\nToday's signposts do not yet indicate that the appropriate measures are in place to drive decarbonisation at the pace or scale required to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. However, as governments, institutions, companies and society increasingly focus on addressing climate change, the potential for a non-linear transition and the subsequent impact on opportunities and risk increases.\n\nWe intend to systematically integrate one or more Paris-aligned scenarios (including 1.5\u00b0C scenarios) into our strategy and capital prioritisation processes beginning in FY2022. This will enhance our current approach, in which our 1.5\u00b0C scenario is used to inform and/uni00A0test strategic portfolio decisions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on the BHP Climate Transition Plan 2021,/uni00A0is/uni00A0available at bhp.com/climate\n\n## Disclosure\n\nPhysical risks, including opportunities; Adaptation planning; Internal and collective adaptation actions",

We have also set a medium-term target to reduce operational GHG emissions by at least 30/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent from FY2020 levels (2) by FY2030. (3) This re/f.shortlects our commitment to decarbonising BHP's operations and a recognition that we have a part to play in accelerating the global pathway to decarbonisation.\n\nWe are also working to achieve our shortterm target for FY2022 to maintain our total operational GHG emissions at or below FY2017 levels (4) while continuing to grow our business.\n\nOur operational GHG emissions are measured against our target performance based on an operational control, market-based methodology. We also disclose operational GHG emissions by equity share and /f.shortinancial control in section/uni00A04.8.5.\n\nIn FY2021, total operational energy consumption increased 3 per cent from FY2020 due to increased drilling activity in our Trinidad and Tobago operations, the use of diesel generators to provide power to our Angostura facility during/uni00A0the Ruby project tie-in and increased diesel usage at our Queensland Coal operated assets. Building on our Light Electric Vehicle (LEV) trials at Olympic Dam and Queensland Coal, we have commenced LEV trials at Nickel West using onboard battery power. This trial is anticipated to reduce noise, heat and diesel particulate matter, as well as consumption of fossil fuel. We have increased the renewable component of our energy consumption in FY2021 due to the start of the renewable power purchasing agreement (PPA) at Queensland Coal.\n\nIn FY2021, operational GHG emissions were 11 per cent higher than the adjusted FY2017 baseline of 14.6 MtCO2-e on a Continuing operations basis, re/f.shortlecting increased production at our Minerals Australia operated assets since FY2017. However, as a result of actions taken in FY2020 and FY2021, particularly securing the supply of renewable energy at some operations, our forecasted operational GHG emissions are currently tracking in line with our/uni00A0FY2022 and FY2030 targets (see Progress/uni00A0on decarbonisation, below).\n\n## Progress on decarbonisation\n\nIn FY2021:\n\n- -  We signed a renewable PPA to supply up to 50/uni00A0per cent of our electricity needs at the Nickel West Kwinana Re/f.shortinery from the Merredin Solar Farm.\n- -  We secured /f.shortirm renewable electricity via a PPA to meet half of the electricity needs across Queensland Coal mines from lowemissions sources.\n- (1) Net zero includes the use of carbon o/ffsets as required.\n\n## Operational energy consumption by source (TWh) (1)(2)\n\n| Year ended 30 June                                               |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Consumption of fuel                                              |   32.6 |   31.6 |   31.7 |\n| - Coal and coke                                                  |    0.2 |    0.2 |    0.2 |\n| - Natural gas                                                    |    6.3 |    5.8 |    6.6 |\n| - Distillate/gasoline                                            |   25.5 |   25   |   24.2 |\n| - Other                                                          |    0.6 |    0.7 |    0.7 |\n| Consumption of electricity                                       |   10.3 |   10.1 |    9.6 |\n| Consumption of electricity from grid                             |    9.1 |    8.9 |    8.5 |\n| Total operational energy consumption                             |   42.9 |   41.7 |   41.3 |\n| Operational energy consumption from renewable/uni00A0sources (3) |    0.1 |    0   |    0   |\n\n## Operational GHG emissions by source (MtCO2-e) (1)(2)(4)(5)(11)\n\n|                                                                                                                 | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Scope 1 GHG emissions (6)                                                                                       | 10.0   | 9.6    | 9.7    |\n| Scope 2 GHG emissions (7)                                                                                       | 6.2    | 6.3    | 6.2    |\n| Total operational GHG emissions                                                                                 | 16.2   | 15.9   | 15.9   |\n| Total operational GHG emissions (adjusted/uni00A0for  Discontinued/uni00A0operations) (8)                       | 16.2   | 15.9   | 15.5   |\n| Operational GHG emissions intensity (tonnes CO2-e per  tonne/uni00A0of/uni00A0copper equivalent production) (9) | 2.2    | 2.0    | 2.4    |\n| Percentage of Scope 1 GHG emissions covered under  an/uni00A0emissions-limiting regulation (10)                 | 81%    | 80%    | 75%    |\n| Percentage of Scope 1 GHG emissions from/uni00A0methane                                                         | 21%    | 19%    | 19%    |\n| Scope 2 GHG emissions (location based) (7)                                                                      | 5.0    | 5.1    | 5.1    |\n| Carbon o/ffsets retired (12)                                                                                    | 0.3    |        |        |\n| Total operational GHG emissions (including carbon o/ffsets) (12)                                                | 15.9   |        |        |\n\n- (2) Calculated based on an operational control approach in line with World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development guidance. Consumption of fuel and consumption of electricity refers to annual quantity of energy consumed from the combustion of fuel; and the operation of any facility; and energy consumed resulting from the purchase of electricity, heat, steam or cooling by the company for its own use. Over 99.9 per cent of BHP's energy consumption and operational GHG emissions occurs outside the UK and offshore area (as de/f.shortined in the relevant UK reporting regulations). UK energy consumption of 99,762 kWh and GHG emissions of 21 tCO2-e is associated with electricity consumption from our of/f.shortice in London. One TWh equals 1,000,000,000 kWh. Data has been rounded to the nearest 1 PJ or 0.1 TWh to be consistent with asset/regional energy information in this Annual Report. In some instances, the sum of totals for sources, commodities and assets may differ due to rounding.\n\n- (7) Scope 2 refers to indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heat or cooling that is consumed by operated assets. Our Scope 2 GHG emissions have been calculated using the market-based method using supplier speci/f.shortic emission factors, in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance unless otherwise speci/f.shortied. A residual mix emission factor is currently unavailable to account for grid electricity emissions remaining after removal of quantities directly contracted between parties; this may result in double counting of low emissions or renewable electricity contributions across gridsupplied consumers.",

        "page_content": "- -  We continued to implement PPAs for renewable electricity commencing from FY2022 at our Chilean copper operated assets, Escondida and Spence, which are on track to reach net zero Scope 2 GHG emissions by the mid-2020s.\n\nThese agreements are intended to help meet our FY2022 and FY2030 operational GHG emissions targets. We regularly monitor our forecasted GHG emissions to check we are on track.\n\nIn FY2021, we partnered with Rio Tinto and Vale to launch the 'Charge on Innovation Challenge', a mining truck electri/f.shortication initiative, facilitated by Austmine. The initiative aims to develop innovative charging infrastructure in parallel with/uni00A0the development of battery-electric trucks.\n\nIn August 2021, BHP became a founding member of Komatsu's GHG Alliance, which aims to develop commercially viable zeroGHG emissions haul trucks. BHP will provide engineering and technical resources to Komatsu, enabling BHP's real-time access to technology in development and giving Komatsu the opportunity to draw on BHP's mining expertise to accelerate its path to market. Also in/uni00A0August 2021, BHP and TransAlta announced plans to build two solar farms and a battery storage system to help power the Mt/uni00A0Keith and/uni00A0Leinster operations at Nickel West.\n\nIn FY2022, we intend to look for further opportunities to collaborate with original equipment manufacturers, source renewable electricity for our Australian operated assets and/uni00A0progress studies for diesel displacement at/uni00A0our operated assets.\n\n## Value chain emissions\n\nWe recognise the importance of supporting e/fforts to reduce emissions in our value chain. In 2020, BHP set Scope 3 emissions goals for 2030 for processing of our steelmaking products and maritime transportation of our products, supported by an action plan and aligned to a long-term vision to support the economy-wide transition necessary to meet the Paris Agreement goals by working with customers and suppliers to/uni00A0achieve sectoral decarbonisation.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nThose goals are to:\n\n- -  Support industry to develop technologies and pathways capable of 30 per cent emissions intensity reduction in integrated steelmaking, with widespread adoption expected post 2030;\n- -  Support 40 per cent emissions intensity reduction of BHP-chartered shipping of our products.\n\nIn our Climate Transition Action Plan 2021, we are building on these medium-term goals. Our position re/f.shortlects the challenges and opportunities in line with our strategy for increasing long-term portfolio exposure towards future facing commodities. Our recent proposed portfolio changes (1) are aligned with our strategic approach to manage risk and maximise value. While these decisions were not made for the purpose of setting a future Scope 3 position, upon completion, the changes would lower our/uni00A0total Scope 3 emissions inventory.\n\nAs we shape our portfolio for the future, we are announcing our enhanced Scope 3 position. (2)\n\nWhile we cannot ensure the outcome alone, for our reshaped portfolio, (3) we are pursuing the long-term goal of net zero (4) Scope 3 GHG emissions by 2050 to support the transition that the world must make. To progress towards this goal:\n\n- -  we are targeting net zero for the operational GHG emissions of our direct suppliers (5) and the emissions from maritime transport of our products; and\n- -  recognising the particular challenge of a net zero pathway for customers' processing of our products, (6) which is dependent on the development and downstream deployment of solutions and supportive policy, we cannot set a target, but will continue to partner with customers and others to accelerate the transition to carbon neutral (7) steelmaking and other downstream processes. We will also support the value chain by pursuing carbon neutral production of our future facing commodities, such as copper, nickel and potash, to provide the essential building blocks of a net zero transition.\n\nWe have therefore set these Scope 3 targets: (8)\n\n- -  We will target net zero (9) by 2050 for the operational GHG emissions of our direct suppliers, (10) subject to the widespread availability of carbon neutral (11) goods and services to meet our requirements.\n- -  We will target net zero (12) by 2050 for GHG emissions from all shipping (13) of our products, (14) subject to the widespread availability of carbon-neutral (15) solutions including low/zero-emission technology on board suitable ships and low/zero-emission marine fuels.\n\n## Action on our value chain GHG/uni00A0emissions/uni00A0goals in FY2021 Steelmaking\n\nIn FY2021, BHP signed memoranda of understanding for partnerships with three of our customers, China Baowu, JFE and HBIS, to invest up to a total of US$65 million in research and development of steel decarbonisation pathways. We also established a research program with the University of Newcastle in Australia to study raw material properties in lowcarbon iron and steelmaking. Additionally, BHP Ventures is strategically investing in a range of emerging companies, including some focused on low- or no-carbon steelmaking.\n\nIn FY2022, we intend to progress research and development and develop plans for operational testing and trials under the three steelmaking partnerships. We also plan to explore new steelmaking partnerships to jointly study lowcarbon steelmaking technologies.\n\n## Maritime\n\nIn FY2021, BHP committed to becoming one of the founding members of the Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation. The Centre is to be set up in Singapore and act as a focal point for the global maritime industry's e/fforts in decarbonisation and innovation. In April 2021, we participated in the /f.shortirst marine biofuel trial involving an ocean-going vessel bunkering in Singapore in collaboration with Oldendor/ff Carriers and GoodFuels, and supported by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore. BHP also issued and awarded\n\n- (1) On 17 August 2021, BHP announced it had entered into a merger commitment deed with Woodside to combine their respective oil and gas portfolios by an all-stock merger.

In FY2022, we intend to begin to integrate the use of LNG-fuelled bulk carriers into our maritime operations and assess the suitability of a range of routes for LNG or biofuelled bulk carriers. We are also developing a sustainability analytics platform to analyse the operational energy e/ff.shorticiency and emissions of BHP-chartered vessels. This will enable more energy-e/ff.shorticient vessel selection, as well as more targeted emissions reduction insights and actions that can be pursued with our shipping partners.\n\n## Scope 3 GHG emissions performance\n\nThe most signi/f.shorticant contributions to BHP's total reported Scope 3 emissions inventory come from the downstream processing of our products, in particular from the GHG emissions generated by steelmaking through the processing of iron ore and metallurgical coal. Our analysis indicates that in FY2021, GHG emissions associated with the processing of our commodities (primarily iron ore and metallurgical coal to steel; together with copper concentrate and cathode to copper wire) were 306 MtCO2-e. GHG emissions associated with the use of our energy/uni00A0products (energy coal, oil and gas) (1) /uni00A0were/uni00A076 MtCO2-e.\n\nWhile we have worked to eliminate major 'double-counting' in our Scope 3 inventory of GHG emissions from iron ore and metallurgical coal used in steelmaking, a degree of overlap in reporting boundaries still occurs due to our involvement at multiple points in the life cycle of the commodities we produce and consume. Refer to footnotes (1) and (7) to the table to the side for more information.\n\nWe continue to consider ways to understand di/fferent metrics for measuring Scopes 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions intensity and tracking their impact on long-term decarbonisation. To this end, in FY2021 we continued to engage with Climate Action 100+ (CA100+) and the Transition Pathway Initiative on their methodology for the diversi/f.shortied mining sector. We also progressed pilot traceability studies in copper and nickel that measure the value-chain GHG emissions of/uni00A0our products.\n\n## Investing in decarbonisation\n\nIn FY2020, we announced a commitment of at least US$400 million to invest in GHG emissions reduction across our operated assets and value chain over the /f.shortive-year life of our Climate Investment Program. In FY2021, we spent US$29 million under this program, targeting operational, maritime, steelmaking and BHP Ventures investments, and committed to spend signi/f.shorticantly more, including up to US$65 million over coming years towards partnerships with our customers in the steel sector.\n\n## Scope 3 GHG emissions by category (MtCO2-e) (1)\n\n| Year ended 30 June                             | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Upstream                                       |        |        |        |\n| Purchased goods and services                   |        |        |        |\n| (including capital goods) (2)                  | 8.9    | 8.8    | 8.7    |\n| Fuel and energy related activities (3)         | 1.1    | 1.2    | 1.2    |\n| Upstream transportation and distribution (4)   | 3.8    | 3.8    | 3.6    |\n| Business travel (2)                            | 0.1    | 0.1    | 0.2    |\n| Employee commuting (2)                         | 0.4    | 0.2    | 0.2    |\n| Downstream                                     |        |        |        |\n| Downstream transportation and distribution (5) | 3.8    | 4.0    | 4.0    |\n| Investments (i.e. our non-operated assets) (6) | 2.5    | 2.6    | 3.1    |\n| Processing of sold products (7)                |        |        |        |\n| GHG emissions from steelmaking (8)             | 300.5  | 292.9  | 283.7  |\n| - Iron ore processing to crude steel           | 260.7  | 252.8  | 242.4  |\n| - Metallurgical coal processing to crude steel | 39.8   | 40.1   | 41.3   |\n| Copper processing                              | 5.0    | 5.2    | 5.1    |\n| Total processing of sold products              | 305.5  | 298.1  | 288.8  |\n| Use of sold products                           |        |        |        |\n| Energy coal (9)                                | 38.3   | 56.4   | 67.0   |\n| Natural gas (9)                                | 19.5   | 20.6   | 28.3   |\n| Crude oil and condensates (9)                  | 16.8   | 17.9   | 23.3   |\n| Natural gas liquids (9)                        | 1.8    | 1.9    | 2.8    |\n| Total use of sold products                     | 76.4   | 96.8   | 121.4  |\n| Total Scope 3 GHG emissions (10)               | 402.5  | 415.7  | 431.1  |",

        "page_content": "We estimate potential spend of between US$100 and US$200 million per year over the next /f.shortive years in support of operational decarbonisation at our operated assets. This estimate has been included in existing capital guidance. Going forward, as our climate response is further integrated into business-as-usual planning, our spending on climate initiatives is expected to become increasingly indistinguishable from normal business spending.\n\nWe assess and rank each decarbonisation project across our operated assets through our Capital Allocation Framework, where our decarbonisation commitments rank alongside maintenance capital in the hierarchy of our capital allocation. Through our studies and investment governance process, we seek to optimise the risk and reward proposition for these projects to allocate capital and optimise decarbonisation at a portfolio level. We have developed an internal marginal abatement cost curve designed to support the allocation of capital towards the most economically e/ff.shorticient and e/ffective decarbonisation projects.\n\nWe include regional carbon price forecasts in our assessment of all projects in the Capital Allocation Framework. In recognition that explicit carbon pricing regimes in many instances do not fully re/f.shortlect the implicit regulatory risk and value of carbon across our value chain, we are developing additional qualitative and quantitative metrics to better capture the future cost and value of GHG emissions abatement to inform corporate strategy and core business decisions.\n\n## Green revenue\n\nGreen revenue is intended as a measure of the extent to which products and services contribute to the transition to a green economy. (1) While these contributions will be measured on a range of important indicators (including water conservation, biodiversity or reforestation), much of the discussion about green revenue is focused around the contribution to the transition to renewable energy that is vital for climate change mitigation.\n\nThere is no settled methodology for classifying green revenue in the resources sector. In response to increased investor interest in the concept, in FY2021 BHP reviewed potential approaches to classi/f.shortication and measurement of green revenue, starting with consideration of/uni00A0how our products contribute to addressing the challenge of climate change.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nWe expect many of our commodities to be important to the energy transition. For example, the International Energy Agency's 'The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions' report (2) highlights the critical role of copper and nickel, and BHP's 1.5\u00b0C scenario (3) indicates that the case for copper, nickel and potash could be even more compelling as the world takes action to decarbonise. Iron ore also fares slightly better under our 1.5\u00b0C scenario versus other scenarios, as steel requirements of the energy transition are expected to be considerable. The most commonly used measure for green revenue is based on end use of products. However, this measure is not straightforward, for/uni00A0two reasons:\n\n- -  Identifying the end use of some commodities is challenging. Copper and iron ore, in particular, undergo multiple stages of processing and have a diverse range of/uni00A0end uses.\n- -  The way in which commodities are produced/uni00A0is not captured by end use measures. However, production methods for the resource sector can in themselves be an important contributor to achieving a green economy. For example, our Chilean copper operated asset at Escondida is on track to have 100 per cent renewable electricity supply by the mid-2020s and source desalinated water for operational purposes, minimising water extraction from sensitive Andean aquifers.\n\nEnd use may therefore not be the sole appropriate measure of products' contribution to the energy transition, and other measures (such as how they are produced) may also be useful, and even more appropriate in some circumstances.\n\nIn FY2021, we have applied an approach to green revenue based on end use, using nickel and uranium by way of illustration. At this stage, these are the most straightforward of our commodities for which to determine contribution to the energy transition from their end use. In FY2022, we intend to continue to consult with investors, industry and standard setters to explore ways of establishing clear methodologies for classi/f.shortication and measurement of green revenue. We also plan to/uni00A0work with our customers, suppliers and others in our value chain to improve the traceability of our products and the GHG emissions produced by their use.\n\nBattery manufacture contributes to climate change mitigation. (4) Therefore, for illustrative purposes, (5) we have measured the revenue from our sales to battery materials suppliers as\n\ngreen revenue. Seventy-two per cent of BHP's battery-suitable nickel metal (6) was sold to global battery material suppliers in FY2021. (7) For FY2021, BHP's green revenue from battery-suitable nickel metal amounted to/uni00A0US$760 million. (8)\n\nAustralian uranium is sold for nuclear power generation only, a low emissions source of electricity, and therefore, also for illustrative purposes, we have measured all revenue from uranium as green revenue. For FY2021, BHP's green revenue from uranium amounted to US$249 million.\n\n## Carbon o/ffsets\n\nBHP's approach to carbon o/ffsetting is to prioritise emission reduction projects at our operated assets, with investments in external carbon o/ffset projects considered complementary to this 'structural abatement'. We work with others to promote the development of carbon market mechanisms, particularly for natural climate solutions.\n\nAlthough we prioritise our internal emission reduction projects, we acknowledge a role for high-quality o/ffsets in a temporary or transitional capacity while abatement options are being studied, as well as for 'hard to abate' emissions with limited or no current technological solutions.\n\nIn FY2021, we retired 0.3 million carbon o/ffsets in the form of veri/f.shortied carbon units equivalent to the net increase in our FY2021 operational GHG emissions from FY2020. The o/ffsets were sourced from high-quality projects, such as the Cordillera Azul National Park REDD+Project and the Kasigau Corridor REDD Project, (9) representing additional, permanent and otherwise unclaimed emission reductions from/uni00A0activities designed to avoid contributing to/uni00A0social or environmental harms.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on how BHP manages o/ffsets refer to bhp.com/o/ffsets-2021\n\n## Natural climate solutions\n\nInvesting in natural ecosystems is a coste/ffective and immediately available solution to mitigate climate change that often provides sustainability co-bene/f.shortits, such as biodiversity conservation, improved water quality or support for local communities. We work to support the development of market mechanisms that channel private sector /f.shortinance into projects that increase carbon storage or avoid GHG emissions through conservation, restoration and improved management of terrestrial landscapes, wetlands and coastal and marine\n\n- (8)  Calculated based on gross revenue from battery-suitable nickel metal multiplied by percentage of BHP's sales of nickel metal to battery material suppliers.\n- (9)  REDD and REDD+ are UN programs for reducing GHG emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.",

Solutions will require a multi-stakeholder approach including the local community, investors and /f.shortinanciers, government at all levels and, of course, resource companies such as BHP.\n\nIn FY2022, we plan to develop our approach to 'Just Transition' taking into consideration the evolving Climate Action 100+ Net-Zero Company Benchmark (NZCB).\n\n## Engagement and disclosure\n\nAchieving the Paris Agreement goals will require supportive policy across jurisdictions globally. The policy-making process is complex and change is unlikely to be smooth or linear. We believe BHP can best support policy development by ensuring we meet our own climate commitments, continuing to make the case for the economic opportunities arising from the energy transition, and focusing on those policy areas where we are likely to have the greatest ability to in/f.shortluence change. We engage on policy matters directly with government and through our membership of industry associations and issuespeci/f.shortic coalitions and initiatives.\n\nOur Global Climate Policy Standards clarify how our policy positions on climate change should be re/f.shortlected in our own advocacy and that of associations to which we belong, globally. Over the past /f.shortive years, BHP has introduced a range of measures to strengthen the Company's governance of its member associations and their climate change advocacy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information on our approach to industry associations can be found at bhp.com/our-approach/operating-withintegrity/industry-associations-bhps-approach/\n\nBHP was one of the /f.shortirst companies to align its climate-related disclosures with the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

Our actions and approach to community engagement, social investment, cultural heritage, working with Indigenous peoples and human rights practices are governed by/uni00A0 Our Code .\n\nWe understand our activities have potential social, cultural, environmental and human rights impacts. We assess those impacts and consider external factors such as changing sociopolitical and economic content and societal expectations and community concerns.\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of the context in which we operate, our operated assets are required to conduct periodic social research activities. We seek to implement and conduct these planned activities in a culturally sensitive and socially inclusive manner which can include social baseline analysis, social impact and opportunity assessments, human rights impact assessments, stakeholder mapping and community perception surveys. Through these activities, we seek to better understand social and reputational impacts, threats and opportunities and make more informed decisions.\n\nWe provide a range of opportunities for communities to express their views, experiences, concerns and complaints. The Our Requirements for Community standard requires all operated assets to have culturally appropriate complaint and grievance mechanisms in place which are accessible to all stakeholders, including Indigenous peoples.\n\nTo further strengthen these mechanisms, we have established globally consistent principles aligned with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights to be applied across/uni00A0each of our operated assets.\n\n## In FY2021:\n\n- -  Community perception research was conducted at 11 of our operated assets providing an aggregated view of local community perceptions and a valuable input/uni00A0into asset planning.\n- -  All of our operated assets had a stakeholder engagement plan in place and conducted regular stakeholder engagement activities, including one-on-one meetings, dialogue tables (multi-issue, multi-stakeholder), consultation groups (issue based), written communications and open days.\n- -  The primary concerns of community members, as reported to our operated assets, largely related to community support/uni00A0(including economic contribution, capacity building, resilience and social inclusion), environmental sustainability and a desire for more communications or/uni00A0engagement from BHP.\n- -  Complaints and grievance mechanisms were/uni00A0in place across all our operated assets.\n- -  103 community complaints (four classi/f.shortied as/uni00A0grievances (1) ) were received globally across/uni00A0our operated assets. While this was a 10/uni00A0per cent decrease in community complaints compared to FY2020, we are revising our approach to reporting to ensure we capture and record all concerns, complaints and grievances received through our community engagement channels.\n- -  No signi/f.shorticant community incidents were recorded, meeting our /f.shortive-year public target of no signi/f.shorticant community events between FY2017 and FY2022. (2)\n- -  No artisanal or small-scale mining on or adjacent to our operations was reported.\n\nAs part of our commitment to respecting human rights, we recognise water access, sanitation and hygiene as fundamental human rights and acknowledge traditional, spiritual and cultural connections to water. Engaging with communities on water challenges is a component of our water stewardship work outlined in our Water Stewardship Position Statement. In FY2021, we sought to strengthen our engagement with stakeholders on water-related threats and opportunities at the community and catchment levels through the commencement of Water Resource Situation Analysis projects, to identify the shared water challenges and collective action opportunities across the catchment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on community is/uni00A0available/uni00A0at bhp.com/community\n\n## 1.13.9  Human rights\n\nWe are committed to respecting internationally recognised human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, and operating in a way that is consistent with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the UNGC Ten Principles.\n\nOur commitments are implemented through Our Charter values, Our Code of Conduct , the Human Rights Policy Statement (HRPS) and the Our Requirements standards. We seek to meet those commitments through policies and processes, due diligence activities, training and by monitoring activities that may have human rights impacts.\n\nBHP's HRPS sets out our expectations of our people, business partners and other relevant parties to respect human rights. In FY2021, our annual review of the HRPS identi/f.shortied two areas in which stakeholders are seeking greater transparency and a more explicit commitment:\n\n- (1) An event or community complaint relating to an adverse impact/event that has escalated to the point where a third-party intervention or adjudication is required to resolve it.

Results of the HRIAs are also expected to be better integrated into our existing risk assessment processes to enhance our understanding of the full spectrum of identi/f.shortied risks, and where required, develop additional controls. Social value assessments are intended to include HRIA results to ensure our operated assets have a deep understanding of their operating context and external environment as inputs into their/uni00A0business planning.\n\nDuring FY2021, we reviewed the risk of an actual/uni00A0or perceived failure to prevent or mitigate an adverse human rights impact linked to our supply chain (directly or indirectly), including maritime activities. We continued to focus on embedding and building the maturity of our supply chain due diligence program taking a risk-based approach to assessing potential human rights breaches by our suppliers, including extended due diligence for high or/uni00A0very high risk suppliers based on our initial risk rating processes.\n\nIn FY2021, we started to align our supply chain due diligence with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance on Con/f.shortlict-A/ffected and High Risk Areas. This work is to be completed by the end of FY2022 with an update on alignment activities planned for inclusion in/uni00A0our/uni00A0FY2022 Modern Slavery Statement.\n\n## Modern slavery\n\nOur Modern Slavery Statement FY2021, prepared under the UK Modern Slavery Act (2015) and the Australian Modern Slavery Act (2018), is available at bhp.com.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on our approach to human rights is available at bhp.com/humanrights\n\n## 1.13.10  Indigenous peoples\n\nWe respect the rights of Indigenous peoples and acknowledge their right to maintain their culture, identity, traditions and customs. We also recognise the signi/f.shorticant contribution Indigenous peoples make to national and international economic prosperity brought about by mining.\n\nMany of our operated assets around the world are located on or near the traditional lands of Indigenous peoples. We believe this establishes a fundamental relationship with Indigenous peoples who are critical partners and, in many jurisdictions, rights-holders under law. As global events of the past 18 months have reinforced, the continued success of BHP and the industry more broadly is dependent on having strong and trusting relationships with Indigenous peoples.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn FY2021, we established a new global Indigenous Engagement team to lead Indigenous engagement, agreement-making and advocacy to enhance our focus on our engagement with Indigenous peoples. We also continued our focus on cultural heritage management practices. Our Cultural Heritage team has enhanced our systems and processes to ensure operational decisionmaking is informed by the most up to date heritage information.\n\nThis program of work commenced with enhancements to Western Australia Iron Ore's cultural heritage databases and information systems, enabling us to better integrate cultural heritage considerations into our mine planning processes. As a result, we can better understand and engage with Traditional Owners on cultural heritage sites that may be impacted by our activities earlier in the planning process. A staged rollout across Minerals Australia will continue in FY2022, with relevant lessons to be applied beyond Australia.\n\nWe further strengthened our engagement with Traditional Owners and other representative Indigenous bodies during the year. This includes the introduction of a set of Principles on Cultural Heritage in Australia agreed with the First Nations Heritage Protection Alliance. The Principles are jointly developed to guide and inform BHP's approach to Indigenous cultural heritage in Australia. The Principles represent an important, further contribution to BHP's commitments in relation to Indigenous peoples, agreement-making and cultural heritage and will apply in addition to the existing requirements in relation to Indigenous engagement and cultural heritage set out in BHP's agreements with Traditional Owners.\n\nBeyond cultural heritage engagement, we implement Regional Indigenous Peoples Plans, which set expectations for our relationships with Indigenous peoples across our operated assets. We believe we are well positioned to bring economic participation opportunities to/uni00A0Indigenous communities where we operate and through these plans, we articulate our approach to agreement-making, Indigenous procurement, employment and social investment, which are core components of/uni00A0our/uni00A0Indigenous Peoples Strategy.\n\nOur e/fforts are complementary to the BHP Foundation's global programs supporting Indigenous peoples. These include the landmark '10 Deserts' project in Australia that has enabled and supported Indigenous land management activities across 35 per cent of the Australian landmass, and similar projects supporting Indigenous peoples' participation in/uni00A0the management and protection of traditional/uni00A0lands in the Boreal Forest of Canada/uni00A0and the Peruvian Amazon.\n\n## Minerals Australia\n\nThere has been broad support and wideranging community e/fforts to further strengthen the laws, policies and practices regulating how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural heritage values are managed in Australia.",

The Committee's Terms of Reference include considering the e/ffectiveness and adequacy of state and federal laws in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural heritage in each jurisdiction. In December 2020, the Committee released its Interim Report with recommendations calling for stronger cultural heritage protection legislation and noting the Western Australian Government is in the process of progressing heritage law reform.\n\nConsultation with Aboriginal people, industry representatives, heritage professionals and the broader community on Western Australia's Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Bill 2020 (WA) concluded in FY2021. The passage of new legislation remains subject to parliamentary processes.\n\nA Heritage Advisory Council comprising Banjima Elders and senior BHP representatives has been established to provide input into mine planning at South Flank.

In January 2021, the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) was published, part of an independent governmental, social and environmental assessment and licensing process led by the United States Forest Service (USFS) under the National Environmental Policy Act. In March 2021, the US Department of Agriculture directed/uni00A0the USFS to rescind the FEIS.\n\nWe recognise the Resolution Copper project area includes sites of cultural signi/f.shorticance for Native American Tribes and their members. Resolution Copper Mining has indicated it intends to continue to engage in the regulatory processes determined by the United States Government and has publicly stated its commitment to ongoing engagement with Native American Tribes. Resolution Copper is working to seek consent before any decision is made on the development of the project, consistent with the ICMM Position Statement on Indigenous Peoples and Mining.

Our long-standing commitment is to invest not less than 1 per cent of pre-tax pro/f.shortits (3) in voluntary social and environmental initiatives.\n\nIn FY2021, our voluntary social investment totalled US$174.84 million, an increase of 17 per cent compared with FY2020. This investment consisted of US$100.41 million in direct community development and environmental projects and donations, US$7.96 million equity share to non-operated joint venture social investment programs and a US$50 million donation to the BHP Foundation and US$2.08 million under the Matched Giving Program.

In conjunction, a Cultural Heritage Management Plan was agreed, providing for the protection and appropriate management of Aboriginal cultural heritage at the mine. Further work is/uni00A0underway with the Widi people in relation to shared country at South Walker Creek.\n\nIn FY2021, Minerals Australia saw a 17 per cent increase, to A$114.6 million, in our direct spend with Indigenous businesses across our operated assets as compared to FY2020 levels. Of this A$48.4 million was with BHP Considered Traditional Owner Businesses. (1) Compared to FY2020 levels, we also increased the number of/uni00A0Indigenous businesses we directly procure from by 35 per cent.\n\n## Minerals Americas\n\nIn line with our Indigenous Peoples Plan for South America, we seek to work closely with the communities where we operate to make a positive contribution, including through key agreement-making with local communities.\n\nWe reviewed our cultural heritage risks in FY2021 and are continuing work to improve our processes for the management of cultural heritage across all our activities and supporting the work being undertaken by our non-operated joint ventures where we have the opportunity to do so. We established a permanent Minerals Americas Indigenous Engagement team to enhance our work and have sought to use our Indigenous peoples global working group to better ensure alignment and sharing of leading practices.\n\nIn Chile, our operated asset Escondida, the Attorney General's O/ff.shortice, the Peine Atacamanian Indigenous community and the Council of Atacamanian Peoples recently entered into an agreement to improve the environmental sustainability of the Salar de/uni00A0Punta Negra following the settlement of a/uni00A0legal/uni00A0claim.

Our operations and growth strategy depend on obtaining and maintaining the right to access environmental resources. However, with growing pressure on, and competition for these resources, and with climate change amplifying certain sensitivities of our natural systems, our environmental performance and management of our environmental impacts on the communities where we operate are critical to creating social value.\n\nAt every stage in the life cycle of our operated assets, we seek to avoid, minimise and mitigate our adverse environmental impacts in line with our de/f.shortined risk appetite. We recognise our activities have an environmental footprint and commit to making voluntary contributions to support environmental resilience across the regions where we operate. Our Group-wide approach to environmental management is set out in the Our Requirements for Environment and Climate Change standard and our mandatory minimum performance requirements for risk management. These standards have been designed taking account of the ISO management system requirements, including ISO14001 for Environmental Management, and set the basis for how we manage risk, including realising opportunities, to achieve our/uni00A0environmental objectives.\n\nThe Our Requirements for Environment and Climate Change standard requires us to take an integrated, risk-based approach to managing any actual or reasonably foreseeable operational impacts (direct, indirect and cumulative) on land, biodiversity, water and air. This includes establishing and implementing environmental risk monitoring and review practices throughout our business planning and project evaluation cycles. In addition to the broader environmentspeci/f.shortic components, the standard includes climate change related requirements for our operated assets.\n\nTo support continuous improvement, each of our operated assets is required to have an Environmental Management System (EMS) that aligns with ISO14001 standards and set target environmental outcomes for land, biodiversity, air and water resources that are consistent with the assessed risks and potential impacts. Target environmental outcomes are included in/uni00A0the life of asset plan and approved by the relevant Asset President or equivalent.\n\n## Social Investment Framework\n\n| Theme                  | Aim                                                                                                                                                                                  | FY2021                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Future of   work       | We aim to enhance human capability/uni00A0and/uni00A0social  inclusion through/uni00A0education and vocational  training and skills development.                                     | -  Through our support, approximately 19,000 people completed  education or training courses in digital, technology, leadership and/ or problem-solving initiatives.

Water is also integral to what we do and we cannot operate without it. In FY2017, we adopted a Water Stewardship Strategy to improve our management of water, increase transparency and contribute to the resolution of shared water challenges. Our Water Stewardship Position Statement was developed in FY2019 and outlines our 2030 vision.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## More information is available at bhp.com/water\n\nWe recognise our responsibility to e/ffectively manage our interactions with and minimise our adverse impacts on water resources. E/ffective water stewardship begins within our operations. We use water in a number of ways, including but not limited to: extracting it for ore processing and to access ore; dust suppression; processing mine tailings; providing drinking water and sanitation facilities; and using marine water for desalination. By improving water management and stewardship within our operations, we can more credibly collaborate with others to /f.shortind solutions for water challenges and opportunities, including water scarcity or high variability in water supply. We work to identify and assess opportunities to reduce stress on water resources as a result of our operations and implement actions where appropriate.\n\nKey opportunities identi/f.shortied during FY2020 and/uni00A0FY2021 included working with stakeholders to identify shared water challenges through Water Resource Situation Analysis (WRSAs) and ongoing engagements and adoption of new water technologies. The outcomes of the WRSAs will be publicly available to support continued collaboration between stakeholders who share the same water resources we use in/uni00A0our operations.\n\nDuring FY2021, we focused on better understanding our catchment-level risks, developing long-term water strategies at our operated assets and setting performance standards for operational water-related risk. We also commenced a pilot program\n\n## Performance against freshwater withdrawal reduction target\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFreshwater withdrawal         FY2022 15% reduction target\n\nfocused on catchment-level WRSAs to inform development of new public context-based water/uni00A0targets for our operated assets.\n\nWe have made progress on our current public target for water. In FY2017, we announced a /f.shortive-year water target of reducing FY2022 freshwater withdrawal (1) by 15 per cent from FY2017 levels (2) across our operated assets. In FY2021, freshwater withdrawal decreased by 11 per cent (113,444 megalitres compared to/uni00A0126,997 megalitres in FY2020). Our FY2021 result also represents a 27 per cent reduction on/uni00A0the adjusted FY2017 baseline, exceeding our/uni00A015 per cent reduction target.\n\nProgress on the target is primarily due to ongoing reduction of groundwater withdrawal over the last /f.shortive years, and from the cessation of groundwater withdrawal for operational consumption purposes from the Salar Punta Negra and Monturaqui aquifers at Escondida in December 2019. We remain on track to sustain reductions and meet the 15 per cent reduction target by the end of FY2022.\n\nOur global freshwater withdrawals from FY2017 to FY2021 are shown in the chart below.\n\nAll water performance data presented in this Annual Report is from operated assets during FY2021. For a year-on-year comparison of data related to operated assets and further analysis of our water data and performance, refer to section 4.8.6. We report on the water metrics, risks and management, as described in section 4.8, in the ICMM 'A Practical Guide to Consistent Water Reporting' (ICMM guidance), and the Minerals Council of Australia's Water Accounting Framework (WAF). Generally, these align with the reporting requirements documented in the GRI Standards and the CEO Water Mandate. Currently, water withdrawal data reported is considered to be at a high accuracy level based on WAF determination. This is predominately driven by a high degree of accurately measured withdrawal quantity data at our Escondida desalination facility which represents just over half of our water withdrawal volumes. For more information about water accounting, including accuracy levels with respect to our discharge volumes and water data quality, refer to section 4.8.6 and bhp.com/water.\n\nIn FY2021, we began to report on water volumes for those operated assets classed by the WWF Water Risk Filter (3) as being located in high or extremely high water stress areas. The disclosure of water data in high-stress areas is required by numerous reporting frameworks, including the ICMM Water Reporting: Good practice guide (2nd Edition).\n\n- (1) Where 'withdrawal' is de/f.shortined as water withdrawn and intended for use (in accordance with 'A Practical Guide to Consistent Water Reporting', ICMM (2017)). 'Fresh water' is de/f.shortined as waters other than seawater, wastewater from third parties and hypersaline groundwater. Freshwater withdrawal also excludes entrained water that would not be available for other uses. These exclusions have been made to align with the target's intent to reduce the use of freshwater sources of potential value to other users or the environment.\n- (2) The FY2017 baseline data has been adjusted to account for: the materiality of the strike a/ffecting water withdrawals at Escondida in FY2017 and improvements to water balance methodologies at WAIO, BMA and BMC and exclusion of hypersaline, wastewater, entrainment, supplies from desalination and Discontinued operations (Onshore US assets) in FY2019 and FY2020.\n- (3)  https://waterrisk/f.shortilter.panda.org/",

In FY2021 we collated information on change in water storage as described in the revised ICMM Water Reporting Guidance and used it to support further assessment of the validity of assumptions underpinning asset water models and water balances. Water modelling contains a degree of uncertainty due to inclusion of estimates and assumptions. The collation of information to inform reporting of change in water storage has identi/f.shortied areas for improvement in the estimated and simulated data within the water models as currently used at our Coal assets.\n\nWe intend to undertake work during FY2022 to assess underlying assumptions in an e/ffort to improve the water modelling at those assets, as well as further maturing the measurement of changes in water storage across the Group. For this reason, we have not included change in water storage data in our reporting for FY2021.\n\nWe seek to minimise our withdrawal of highquality fresh water. Seawater continues to be our largest source of water withdrawal, representing more than half of total withdrawals, predominantly for desalination at Escondida and use of seawater in our Petroleum operated assets. Groundwater is our most signi/f.shorticant freshwater source, at close to one-quarter of total water withdrawals. In FY2021, approximately 80 per cent of our water withdrawals consisted of water classi/f.shortied as low quality. The de/f.shortinitions for water quality types are provided in section 4.11.4 and a detailed description is available in section 2.4 of the WAF.\n\nBeyond our operational activities, we have committed to engaging across communities, government, business and civil society with the aim of catalysing actions to improve water governance, increase recognition of water's diverse values and advance sustainable solutions. We continue to collaborate with the CEO Water Mandate to support harmonisation of water accounting standards as part of our commitment to strengthen transparency and collaboration across all sectors for improved water governance.\n\nIn the context of an environmental damage lawsuit in relation to the Salar de Punta Negra (SPN), Escondida, the Attorney General O/ff.shortice, the Indigenous Community of Peine and the Council of Atacamanian Peoples reached an environmental agreement that considers the implementation of a longterm environmental management plan, as well as a series of compensation and repair measures. A participatory governance arrangement, comprising representatives of all the involved parties, will work together for the implementation of the plan. Escondida stopped extracting water in SPN in 2017 and then completely ceased the use of groundwater from the SPN and Monturaqui Andean aquifers/uni00A0in 2019.\n\nFollowing a court ruling regarding Cerro Colorado's main environmental licence in January 2021, the Chilean Environmental Authority is re-evaluating the licence\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nconditions permitting Cerro Colorado to extract water from the Lagunillas aquifer, and is carrying out a consultation process with an Indigenous community to assess potential environmental impacts.\n\nIn August 2021 an individual commenced a legal action through the First Environmental Court of Antofagasta (Court) that alleges Cerro Colorado's water extraction from the Lagunillas aquifer has caused damage to the Lagunillas aquifer, the Huantija lagoon, and nearby wetlands. The Court granted an injunction requiring Cerro Colorado to suspend water extraction from the Lagunillas aquifer commencing on 1 October 2021 for a period of ninety days which may be extended. Cerro Colorado is evaluating its legal and operational options.\n\nFor more information on our approach to water stewardship, progress against our water strategy, water performance in FY2021 and case studies on activities we are taking to progress towards meeting our water stewardship vision, refer to section 4.8.6 and bhp.com/water.\n\n## 1.13.14  Land and biodiversity\n\nThe nature of our activities means we have a signi/f.shorticant responsibility for land and biodiversity management. We own or manage more than 8 million hectares of land and sea; however, only 2 per cent is disturbed (physical or chemical alteration that substantially disrupts the pre-existing habitats and land cover) for our/uni00A0operational activities.\n\nAt each of our operated assets, we look to manage threats and realise opportunities to achieve our environmental objectives. We apply the mitigation hierarchy (avoid, mitigate, rehabilitate and, where appropriate, apply compensatory measures) to any potential or residual adverse impacts on marine or terrestrial ecosystems.\n\nWe respect legally designated protected areas and commit to avoiding areas or activities where we consider the environmental risk is outside our risk appetite. As part of our commitments:\n\n- -  We do not explore or extract resources within the boundaries of World Heritage listed properties.\n- -  We do not explore or extract resources adjacent to World Heritage listed properties, unless the proposed activity is compatible with the outstanding universal values for which the World Heritage property is listed.\n- -  We do not explore or extract resources within or adjacent to the boundaries of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Protected Areas Categories I to/uni00A0IV, unless a plan is implemented that meets/uni00A0regulatory requirements, takes into account stakeholder expectations and contributes to the values for which the protected area is listed.\n- -  We do not operate where there is a risk of direct impacts to ecosystems that could result in the extinction of an IUCN Red List Threatened Species in the wild.\n\n- -  We do not dispose of mined waste rock or tailings into a river or marine environment.\n\nOur operated assets are required to have plans and processes that re/f.shortlect local biodiversity risks and regulatory requirements. In FY2021, we prepared internal guidance on biodiversityrelated elements of the Our Requirements for Environment and Climate Change standard to support more consistent interpretation and application of those standards at our operated assets. We have a /f.shortive-year target to improve marine and terrestrial biodiversity outcomes by developing a framework by the end of FY2022. This will enable us to better monitor the/uni00A0impacts of our activities on biodiversity and/uni00A0to avoid, reduce and o/ffset adverse impacts/uni00A0in/uni00A0a/uni00A0coordinated way.\n\nDevelopment of the framework started in FY2018 and we are progressing this work with Conservation International and Proteus, a voluntary partnership between the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP WCMC) and 12 extractive industry companies.\n\nDuring FY2021, we assessed all our operated assets using an early stage methodology developed by UNEP WCMC and developed a prototype scorecard based on this methodology to test and re/f.shortine how we track biodiversity status and trends at our operated assets. The framework will be used to track achievement of our long-term biodiversity goal: that by FY2030, we will have made a measurable contribution to the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of marine and terrestrial ecosystems in all regions where we operate in/uni00A0line with UNSDGs 14 and 15.\n\nMore information on our approach to biodiversity and land management and current performance, including operated assets owned, leased, managed in or adjacent to protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas is available in Section/uni00A04.8.4/uni00A0Environment - performance data and at bhp.com/biodiversity.\n\n## Closure\n\nWe recognise the potentially signi/f.shorticant social, environmental and /f.shortinancial risks associated with future closure of our operations. We seek to integrate closure into our planning, decisionmaking and operations through the entire life cycle of our operated assets.\n\nAs a global leader in the development of natural resources, we have a responsibility to demonstrate a planned and purposeful approach to closure through the life cycle of our operated assets. This process requires the consideration of threats and opportunities for the communities and environment in which we operate, as well as our workforce and shareholder value. It drives towards optimised closure outcomes for our sites by balancing our values, obligations, safety, costs and the expectations of external stakeholders to enable an outcome that involves one or a combination of alternative land uses, ongoing management, relinquishment or responsible divestment.",

        "page_content": "## 1.13  Sustainability continued\n\nEach of our operations (whether projects, producing, in care and maintenance or a closed site) must have a closure management plan, documenting the implementation of the closure management process. This process includes collating relevant knowledge and data, undertaking risk and opportunity assessments, framing and comparing alternative closure options, and selecting the optimised closure outcomes. Closure management plans are required to be supported by stakeholder engagement across the life cycle of the site, and/uni00A0should balance business and stakeholder needs while meeting the following objectives:\n\n- -  comply with legal requirements and obligations, and our mandatory minimum performance requirements for closure\n- -  achieve safe and stable outcomes and meet/uni00A0approved environment outcomes\n- -  manage pre and post-closure risks (including opportunities)\n- -  progressively reduce obligations, including progressive closure of the area disturbed by/uni00A0our operational footprint\n- -  manage and optimise closure costs\n\nClosure management plans are also required to include long-term monitoring to verify any controls implemented to manage closure risks and and seek to realise opportunities throughout the life of our operations, including closure and post-closure, are e/ffective, and that performance standards are achieved and maintained after operations cease.\n\nProgressive closure of areas no longer required for operational purposes is included in our closure management plans and integrated into operational plans. Our closure management plans are regularly reviewed to re/f.shortlect updated asset planning and include current knowledge obtained from onsite experience, locally, across our business and globally across the industry.\n\nInformation about our /f.shortinancial provision related to closure and rehabilitation liabilities is available in note 15 'Closure and rehabilitation provisions' in section 3.\n\nWe report annually on the status of land disturbance and rehabilitation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information is available in section 4.8.4\n\nMore information on our approach to closure is available at bhp.com/ sustainability/environment/closure\n\n## 1.13.15  Tailings storage facilities\n\nEnsuring the integrity of our tailings storage facilities (TSFs) is a primary focus across our business. Our aspiration is to achieve zero harm from tailings and we will continue to work with others and share our progress in an e/ffort to make/uni00A0this a reality.\n\nIn 2015, after the tragic failure of the Fund\u00e3o dam at Samarco BHP immediately initiated a Dam Risk Review to assess the management of major TSFs. The catastrophic failure of the Brumadinho dam at Vale's operation in Brazil\n\nin/uni00A0January 2019 further strengthened our resolve to reduce tailings failure risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor information about the Samarco tragedy and our progress with the response, refer to section 1.15\n\nIn CY2019 we created a Tailings Taskforce (TTF) team reporting to the Executive Leadership Team and the Board's Sustainability Committee. The TTF, accountable for accelerating our short-, medium- and long-term strategies and embedding leading practice, was integrated into the Resource Centre of Excellence at the end of FY2021 to create a permanent Tailings Excellence team.\n\n## Governance\n\nIn FY2021, we further strengthened the governance and assurance of our operated TSFs. We updated our mandatory minimum performance requirements for the e/ffective management of TSF failure risks, aligning our internal requirements to the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM). This is intended to ensure our technical TSF and/uni00A0cross-functional guidance is consistent with the GISTM and the requirements are embedded across the business.\n\nOur focus is on gap assessments against the GISTM, completing corporate, asset and TSFlevel evaluations to inform our implementation planning towards conformance within the timelines outlined by the ICMM. A BHP Tailings Storage Facility Policy Statement has been published on our website, outlining our Board of Directors' commitment to the safe management of TSFs, emergency preparedness and response, recovery in the event of a failure and transparency. We also de/f.shortined our Accountable Executive (AE) positions, who are direct reports of the BHP Chief Executive O/ff.shorticer and answerable to the BHP Board's Sustainability Committee in conformance with GISTM requirements. The AE roles include an AE accountable for the/uni00A0companywide TSF governance framework, and AEs accountable for the safety of TSFs, tasked with avoiding or minimising the potential environmental and social impacts of a TSF failure, tailings management training and emergency preparedness and response. Their responsibilities will include having regular communication with TSF operational and technical employees.\n\nIn FY2021, we continued to progress critical work on TSF failure risk management. We completed the independent reviews of TSF failure risks across our operations with /f.shortindings incorporated into risk remediation plans. These reviews partner leading industry experts with our technical leads to review and enhance our global tailings governance framework. The process is in addition to other governance activities, including Dam Safety Reviews, Independent Tailings Review Boards and project speci/f.shortic Independent Peer Reviews. Key risk indicators (KRIs) set by management help to monitor the performance in dam integrity and design, overtopping//f.shortlood management and emergency response planning. These KRIs have/uni00A0been updated to align to the GISTM.\n\nWe engaged in a partnership with Rio Tinto and the University of Western Australia to support the Future Tails Initiative, focused on training, education, research and best-practice guides in the tailings management space. This is a major step towards supporting safe stewardship of TSFs for the industry and we intend to continue this collaboration to build capacity and/uni00A0knowledge within the industry.\n\n## Strategy\n\nOur short-term strategy continues to focus on improving KRI performance in line with de/f.shortined targets. We are completing studies at all our operated assets focused on reducing and mitigating potential downstream impacts particularly to populations at risk (PAR). Most assets have completed these studies resulting in a diverse range of options to reduce the PAR exposure at our TSF sites or mitigate TSF failure risk. In some cases, we have elected to proactively eliminate the risk of catastrophic failure. For example, we have relocated a TSF at a Legacy Asset (an operated asset, or part thereof, located in the Americas that is in the closure phase) site in Miami, Arizona, to a nearby depression on the interior of the mine site which is expected to eliminate the risk of failure to people in the potential impact zone.\n\nOur medium- and long-term strategies focus on the development of technologies to improve tailings management storage, which we believe are important to achieving our aspiration of zero harm from tailings. Asset-speci/f.shortic strategies have been developed for all of our operated and legacy assets and seek longterm alternative tailings solutions. In addition, while our non-operated joint ventures (NOJVs) are independently controlled and have their own operating and management standards, we encourage NOJVs to consider long-term alternative tailings solutions as an option in asset planning.\n\n## Transparency\n\nWe fully support the GISTM and are working towards implementation at our sites. We have prioritised and actioned a phased disclosure approach to support our journey towards conformance, starting with an update to our previously published Church of England Disclosure. We have contributed to improvements in tailings storage management across the mining industry, including through the ICMM Tailings Working Group. We are participants in other tailings working groups globally, including those associated with the Canadian Dam Association, Australian National Committee on Large Dams, Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Minerals Council of Australia, Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration, and Fundaci\u00f3n Chile. We have continued to participate in the Investor Mining and Tailings Safety Initiative, an investor-led engagement convening institutional investors active in extractive industries, including major asset owners and/uni00A0asset managers.",

It is important to note the TSF classi/f.shortication is one element of TSF risk management, but does not represent risk itself. It re/f.shortlects the modelled, hypothetical most signi/f.shorticant possible failure and consequences without controls. It does not re/f.shortlect the current physical stability of the TSF and it is possible for TSF classi/f.shortications to change over time, for example, following changes to the operating context of a dam. As such, this data represents the status of the portfolio as at 30 June 2021. The TSF classi/f.shortication informs the design, surveillance and review components of risk management. Therefore, TSFs with a higherlevel classi/f.shortication will have more rigorous requirements than TSFs that have a lower level/uni00A0of classi/f.shortication.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nIn total, there are 72 TSFs (1) at our operated assets, 29 of which are of upstream design. Of the 72 operated facilities, three are classi/f.shortied as extreme and a further 17 classi/f.shortied as very high. Fourteen of our operated facilities are active. A substantial portion of our inactive portfolio (58) at our assets is due largely to the number of historic tailings facilities associated with our North American legacy assets portfolio. Further detail of the risk reduction work underway for high consequence classi/f.shortication facilities is provided above in the Strategy and Governance sections and online at our case studies.\n\nThere are 12 TSFs at our non-operated joint ventures, which are all located in the Americas. The four active tailings facilities are located in Antamina in Peru, which is of downstream construction, Patilla Norte Pit, an in-pit TSF at Cerrej\u00f3n in Colombia, and two TSFs at Samarco in Brazil, Alegria Sul TSF, which is co-mingled dry stack, and Alegria Sul Pit, an in-pit TSF.\n\n## Types of operated tailings storage facilities (1)(2)(8)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Centreline   |   7 |\n|--------------|-----|\n| Downstream   |  19 |\n| Upstream     |  29 |\n| Other        |  17 |\n\nIn addition, there are eight inactive facilities. These comprise of two upstream facilities at Samarco (Germano) in Brazil being decommissioned following the February 2019 rulings by the Brazilian Government on upstream dams in Brazil; three upstream inactive facilities and one inactive modi/f.shortied centreline facility at Resolution Copper in the United States; one downstream inactive facility at Bullmoose in Canada and one inactive downstream facility, Cantor TSF, at Cerrej\u00f3n in Colombia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on our management of/uni00A0TSFs and global governance strategy is/uni00A0available at bhp.com/tailings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) The number of tailings storage facilities (TSFs) is based on the de/f.shortinition agreed to by the ICMM Tailings Advisory Group at the original time of submission and expanded to align with the TSF de/f.shortinition established in the Global Industry Standard for Tailings Management (GISTM). An increase of /f.shortive TSFs is reported since our Church of England submission in 2019 due to the/uni00A0updated BHP de/f.shortinition of TSF to align with the GISTM. We keep this de/f.shortinition under review.\n- (2)   The Island Copper tailing facility originally disclosed in our Church of England submission in 2019 for the purposes of transparency has been removed as it is not a dam nor considered a/uni00A0TSF/uni00A0under the GISTM de/f.shortinition of a TSF. Tailings at Island Copper were deposited in the ocean under an approved license and environmental impact assessment. This historic practice ceased in the 1990s. We have since committed not to dispose of mine waste rock or tailings in river or marine environments. We continue to conduct environmental e/ffects monitoring.\n- (3)   The following classi/f.shortications aligned to the CDA classi/f.shortication system. It is important to note that the classi/f.shortication is based on the modelled, hypothetical most signi/f.shorticant failure mode and/uni00A0consequences possible without controls, and not on the current physical stability of the dam.\n- (4)   For the purposes of this chart, ANCOLD and other classi/f.shortications have been converted to their CDA equivalent.\n- (5)  Hamburgo TSF at Escondida is an inactive facility where tailings were deposited into a natural depression. Hamburgo TSF is not considered a dam and is, therefore, not subject to CDA classi/f.shortication, the assessment to determine the GISTM classi/f.shortication will be completed in CY2021.\n- (6)  SP1/2 and SP3 TSF at NSWEC are inactive facilities which have been assessed to have no credible failure modes and are therefore shown as not having a CDA classi/f.shortication.\n- (7)  Seven TSFs are currently under assessment to determine their consequence classi/f.shortication.\n- (8)  'Other' includes dams with a raising method that combines upstream, downstream and centreline or are of in-pit design.\n- (9)   'Inactive' includes facilities not in operational use, under reclamation, reclaimed, closed and/or in post-closure care and maintenance.",

The collation of water storage data during FY21 has identi/f.shortied uncertainty in the water models currently used at BHP's Coal Assets (BMA, BMC and NSW Energy Coal). As a result, the disclosed water performance data for the Coal Assets is subject to estimation uncertainty but is based on the best information available at the time of reporting. Our conclusion is not modi/f.shortied in respect of this matter.\n\n## Key responsibilities\n\n## EY's responsibility and independence\n\nOur responsibility was to express limited and reasonable assurance conclusions on the noted subject matter as de/f.shortined in the 'what we assured' column in the tables above (Subject Matter).\n\nWe were also responsible for maintaining our independence and con/f.shortirm that we have met the requirements of the APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) and have the required competencies and experience to conduct this assurance engagement.\n\n## BHP's responsibility\n\nBHP's management was responsible for selecting the Criteria and preparing and fairly presenting information presented and referenced in the FY21 Annual Report in accordance with that Criteria. This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining internal controls, adequate records and making estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.\n\n## Our approach to conducting the Review\n\nWe conducted our procedures in accordance with the International Federation of Accountants' International Standard for Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (ISAE 3000), the Standard for Assurance on Greenhouse Gas Statements (ISAE 3410) and the terms of reference for this engagement as agreed with BHP on 27 January 2021.\n\nWe adapted our approach to undertaking our review procedures in response to the COVID/hyphen.uc19 travel restrictions and social distancing requirements. We visited one BHP site in person with the remaining 'site visits' undertaken virtually by phone and video-conference. The performance of the year end corporate review procedures at head o/ff.shortice was also required to be conducted remotely and was supported through the use/uni00A0of collaboration platforms for discussions and delivery/uni00A0of requested evidence.\n\nThe procedures we performed were based on our professional judgement and included, but were not limited to\n\n- -Interviewing select corporate and site personnel to understand the reporting process at group, business, asset and site level, including management's processes to identify BHP's material issues\n- -Reviewing BHP policies and management standards to/uni00A0determine alignment with the ICMM's 10 Sustainable Development principles and position statements\n- -Checking the FY21 Annual Report to understand how BHP's identi/f.shortied material risks and opportunities are re/f.shortlected within the qualitative disclosures\n- -Evaluating whether the information disclosed in the FY21 Annual Report and related disclosures is consistent with our understanding of sustainability management and performance at BHP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -Evaluating the suitability and application of the Criteria and that the Criteria have been applied appropriately to/uni00A0the Subject Matter\n- -Conducting a mix of virtual and in-person site procedures at eight BHP locations to evidence site level data collection and reporting to Group as well as to identify completeness of reported water and emission sources\n- -Undertaking analytical procedures of the quantitative disclosures in the FY21 Annual Report and related online disclosures\n- -Reviewing data, information or explanation about the sustainability performance data and statements included in the FY21 Annual Report and related online disclosures\n- -Reviewing other information within the FY21 Annual Report for consistency and alignment with our assurance subject matter\n- -On a judgemental sample basis, re-performing calculations to check accuracy of claims in the FY21/uni00A0Annual Report\n- -Checking the water balance for each asset and judgementally selecting a sample of water streams for/uni00A0further testing\n- -On a sample basis, based on our professional judgement, agreeing claims to source information to check accuracy and completeness of claims, which included invoices, incident reports, meter calibration records, and meter data\n- -For our reasonable assurance of Greenhouse Gas emissions, selecting key items and representative sampling, based on statistical audit sampling tables and agreeing to source information to check accuracy and completeness of performance data, which included invoices, metre calibration records and metre data.\n\nWe believe that the evidence obtained is su/ff.shorticient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable and limited assurance conclusions\n\n## Other Matters\n\nWe have not performed assurance procedures in respect of any information relating to prior reporting periods, including those presented in the FY21 Annual Report, other than sustainability data and disclosures relating to BHP's Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2020. Our report does not extend to any disclosures or assertions made by BHP relating to case studies and future performance plans and/or strategies disclosed in the FY21 Annual Report. While we considered the e/ffectiveness of management's internal controls when determining the nature and extent of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on internal controls. Our procedures did not include testing controls or performing procedures relating to checking aggregation or calculation of data within IT systems.\n\n## Limited and Reasonable Assurance\n\nProcedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. While our procedures performed for our reasonable assurance engagement are of a higher level of assurance, due to the use of sampling techniques, it is not a guarantee that it will always detect material misstatements.\n\n## Use of our Assurance Statement\n\nWe disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this assurance report to any persons other than management and the directors of BHP, or for any purpose other than that for which it was prepared.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ernst & Young\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMelbourne, Australia\n\n2 September 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMathew Nelson Partner",

Samarco is a non-operated joint venture (NOJV) owned by BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda (BHP Brasil) and Vale S.A. (Vale), with each having a 50 per cent shareholding.\n\nA signi/f.shorticant volume of tailings (39.2 million cubic metres) resulting from the iron ore bene/f.shorticiation process was released. Tragically, 19 people died - /f.shortive community members and 14 people who were working on the dam. The communities of Bento Rodrigues, Gesteira and Paracatu de Baixo were /f.shortlooded and other communities and the environment downstream in the Rio Doce basin were also a/ffected.\n\nIn December 2020, Samarco restarted its operations at a reduced production level\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor information on Samarco's restart and/uni00A0its operations\n\nrefer to section 1.10.3\n\n## Our response and support for Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova\n\nBHP Brasil has been and remains fully committed to supporting the extensive ongoing remediation and compensation e/fforts of the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova in Brazil.\n\nThe Framework Agreement entered into between Samarco, Vale and BHP Brasil and the relevant Brazilian authorities in March 2016 established Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova, a not-for-pro/f.shortit, private foundation that is implementing 42 remediation and compensatory programs. BHP Brasil provides support to Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova, including through representation on/uni00A0the foundation's governance structures.\n\nBHP Brasil has provided US$1.6 billion (1) to fund Framework Agreement programs when Samarco has been unable to do so.\n\n## Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova\n\n## Resettlement\n\nOne of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's priorities is the resettlement of the communities of Bento Rodrigues, Paracatu de Baixo and Gesteira. This involves ongoing engagement and consultation with a large number of stakeholders, including the a/ffected community members, their technical advisers, state prosecutors, municipal leaders, regulators and/uni00A0other interested parties.\n\nThe resettlement process for Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu de Baixo involves designing new towns on land that has been chosen by the communities, to be as close as possible to the previous layout, attending to the wishes and needs of the families and communities, while also meeting permitting requirements.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nIn Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu de Baixo, the implementation of precautionary measures in response to COVID/hyphen.uc19, including a suspension of works between March and June 2020, as well as increases to the technical scope for resettlement of the communities and permitting delays have impacted the timeline for completion.\n\nResettlement works resumed from mid-June 2020 and are continuing with a reduced workforce. Currently, there is no schedule to return to full workforce capacity given COVID/hyphen.uc19 restrictions. At Bento Rodrigues, the construction of the public school, healthcare facilities and public infrastructure has been completed and the construction of housing is continuing to progress. At Paracatu, infrastructure works and the construction of/uni00A0some public buildings (such as the public school) were completed and the /f.shortirst houses are underway.\n\nIn addition to the community resettlements, some families from the rural area chose to rebuild their houses on their previous property. Some other families have chosen not to join the resettlement of their previous community and Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova is assisting them to purchase properties.\n\nAt Gesteira, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova o/ffered the families a payment solution in which they would be able to purchase property through a 'letter of credit'. Most families of Gesteira have chosen this option and the agreements are being rati/f.shortied by the 12th Federal Court.\n\nUpdates on the progress of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's resettlement program are available at fundacaorenova.org/en/repair-data/ resettlement-and-infrastructure.\n\n## Compensation and /f.shortinancial assistance\n\nFunda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova continues to provide fair compensation to people impacted by the dam failure.\n\nCompensation and /f.shortinancial assistance of approximately R$4.7 billion (approximately US$1.1 billion (1) ) has been paid to support approximately 336,000 people a/ffected by/uni00A0the/uni00A0dam failure up until 30 June 2021.\n\nMore than 10,500 general damages claims have been resolved and more than 270,000 people have been paid a total of approximately R$280 million (approximately US$65 million (1) ) for temporary water interruption. The general damages component includes loss of life, injury, property damage, business impacts, loss of income and moral damages. Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova continues to provide /f.shortinancial assistance cards and other income support to those whose livelihoods continue to be impacted by the dam failure, including /f.shortisherfolk whose activities are a/ffected by /f.shortishing restrictions.\n\nIn addition, approximately R$1.6 billion (approximately US$300 million (1) ) was paid to more than 17,000 people under the courtmandated simpli/f.shortied indemnity system (known as the 'Novel' system), which is designed to provide compensation for informal workers who have had di/ff.shorticulty proving the damages they su/ffered, such as cart drivers, sand miners, artisanal miners and street vendors.\n\nUpdates on the progress of the compensation program are available at fundacaorenova.org/ en/repair-data/indemnities-and-productiveresumption.\n\n## Other socio-economic programs\n\nFunda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova continues to implement a wide range of socio-economic programs in addition to the resettlement and compensation programs. These programs cover health and infrastructure projects in the Rio Doce basin, promotion of economic development in the impacted communities and sewage treatment facilities to improve the water quality in the Rio Doce.\n\n## Environmental remediation\n\nSince December 2019, the riverbanks and/uni00A0/f.shortloodplains have been vegetated, river margins stabilised and in general, water quality and sediment qualities have returned to historic levels. Long-term remediation work is continuing to re-establish agriculture and native vegetation.\n\nA ban on /f.shortishing activities along the coast of Esp\u00edrito Santo and a precautionary conservation restriction preventing /f.shortishing for native /f.shortish species in the Rio Doce in Minas Gerais remain in place. Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova continues to support the recovery of habitats and aquatic ecology and engage with the authorities with the goal of lifting the restrictions.\n\n## Legal proceedings\n\nBHP Group Limited, BHP Group Plc and BHP Brasil are involved in legal proceedings relating to the Samarco dam failure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the signi/f.shorticant legal/uni00A0proceedings involving BHP refer to section 4.9",

        "page_content": "## 1.16  Risk factors\n\nOur principal risks are described below and may occur as a result of our activities globally, including in connection with our operated and non-operated assets, third parties engaged by BHP or through our value chain.\n\nOur principal risks, individually or collectively, could threaten our viability, strategy, business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity and reputation. They could also materially and adversely a/ffect the health and safety of our people or members of the public, the environment, the communities in which we or our third-party partners operate, or the interests of our stakeholders leading to litigation (including class actions) or a loss of stakeholder and/or investor con/f.shortidence. References to '/f.shortinancial performance' includes our /f.shortinancial condition and liquidity, including due to decreased pro/f.shortitability or increased operating costs, capital spend, remediation costs or contingent liabilities. While the risks described in this section represent our principal risks, BHP is also exposed to other risks that are not/uni00A0described in this section.\n\nEach of our principal risks may present opportunities as well as threats. We take risk/uni00A0for/uni00A0strategic reward in the pursuit of our strategy and purpose, including to grow our asset portfolio and develop the right capabilities for the future of our business. Potential threats and opportunities associated with each of our principal risks are described below, along with the key controls to manage them. These controls are not exhaustive and many Group-wide controls (such as Our Code of Conduct , Risk Framework, mandatory minimum performance requirements for risk management, health, safety and other matters, dedicated non-operated joint venture teams and our Contractor Management Framework) help to support e/ffective and e/ff.shorticient management of all risks in line with our risk appetite. While we implement preventative and/or mitigating controls designed to reduce the likelihood of a threat from occurring and minimise the impacts if it does, these may not/uni00A0be e/ffective.\n\nKey changes to our principal risks in FY2021 are the introduction of risks associated with inadequate business resilience and adopting technologies. The way in which we articulate our other principal risks has also changed since our FY2020 Annual Report. For example, risks associated with operational events have been consolidated into a single risk factor rather than being discussed across two risk factors. We have also disaggregated and combined elements of principal risks. For example, risks associated with third-party performance are embedded throughout our principal risks and climate change risks have been separated to provide a greater focus on transition risks, while risks associated with the potential physical impacts of climate change are addressed alongside other business resilience risks (as/uni00A0well/uni00A0as across other relevant principal risks).\n\nWe have also simpli/f.shortied the presentation of our principal risks. These changes are designed to provide greater accessibility and/uni00A0value to stakeholders in understanding our/uni00A0principal risks.\n\nWith the exception of risks associated with operational events, exposure to all of our principal risks increased in FY2021. These increases were largely driven by uncertainties in the external environment, such as the continuing global impacts of the COVID/hyphen.uc19 pandemic, heightened geopolitical tensions and societal and stakeholder expectations of business (including in relation to social, environmental and climate-related risks), and increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks against companies in the resources industry and governments. While our in/f.shortluence over most of these aspects of our external environment is limited, we continue to monitor signals and review our control environment to improve management of associated risks.\n\n## Operational events\n\nRisks associated with operational events in connection with our activities globally, resulting in signi/f.shorticant adverse impacts on our people, communities, the environment or our business.\n\n## Why is this important to BHP?\n\nWe engage in activities that have the potential to cause harm to our people and assets, and/or communities and the environment, including serious injuries, illness and fatalities, loss of infrastructure, amenities and livelihood and damage to sites of cultural signi/f.shorticance.

Our usual policy and practice is to sell our products at prevailing market prices and as such /f.shortluctuations in commodity prices may a/ffect our /f.shortinancial performance. For example, a US$1 per tonne decline in the average iron ore price and US$1 per barrel decline in the average oil price would have an estimated impact on FY2021 pro/f.shortit after taxation of US$163 million and US$24 million, respectively. Long-term price volatility or sustained low prices may adversely impact our /f.shortinancial performance as we do not generally have the ability to o/ffset costs through price increases.\n\n## Examples of potential opportunities\n\n- -  Acquisition of new resources in future facing commodities may strengthen our portfolio and protect and grow value over the/uni00A0long term.\n- -  Ability to predict long-term commodity demand, supply and price trends may lead to BHP being able to identify and acquire new future facing commodities and assets ahead of our competitors or exit from declining commodities in a timely manner, strengthening our portfolio and leading to/uni00A0long-term portfolio returns.\n- -  BHP may be perceived as a welcome and valued or preferred partner for the development of new resource opportunities,/uni00A0enabling us to secure new assets or exploration opportunities to create long-term optionality in the portfolio.\n\n## Key management actions\n\n- -  Strategies, processes and frameworks to grow and protect our portfolio and to/uni00A0assist in delivering ongoing returns to/uni00A0shareholders include:\n\n- -  our exploration and business development programs, which focus on replenishing our resource base and enhancing our portfolio (including creating and securing more options in future facing commodities)\n- -  our long-term strategic outlook and ongoing strategic processes to assess our competitive advantage and enable the identi/f.shortication of threats to or opportunities for our portfolio through forecasting and scenario modelling\n- -  monitoring signals to interpret external events and trends, and designing commodity strategies and price protocols that are reviewed by management and the Board\n- -  our Capital Allocation Framework, corporate planning processes, investment/uni00A0approval processes and annual/uni00A0reviews (including resilience testing) of portfolio valuations\n- -  our balance sheet and liquidity framework, which is designed to maintain a robust balance sheet with su/ff.shorticient liquidity and access to diverse sources of funding\n- -  Pursuing a considered approach to new country entry, including development of capability to operate in higher-risk jurisdictions, in order to support portfolio opportunities in new jurisdictions.\n- -  Further developing BHP's social value proposition to position BHP as a preferred partner for the development of resource opportunities in line with the expectations of/uni00A0local communities, host governments and/uni00A0other global stakeholders.\n- -  Managing commodity price exposure through the diversity of commodities, markets, geographies and currencies provided by our portfolio, as well as our /f.short inancial risk management practices in relation to our commercial activities.\n\n## FY2021 insights\n\nOur exposure to risks associated with optimising our portfolio and managing commodity price movements increased in FY2021 as a result of volatility and uncertainty across global economies, including due to the continuing e/ffects of the COVID/hyphen.uc19 pandemic. We announced the sale of Cerrej\u00f3n in June 2021 as part of our intention to consolidate our portfolio of coal assets to higher-quality metallurgical coal, and remain open to all options for BMC and NSWEC.

As a world-leading resources company, BHP is exposed to a range of transition risks that could a/ffect the execution of our strategy or our operational e/ff.shorticiency, asset values and growth options, resulting in a material adverse impact on our /f.shortinancial performance, share price or reputation, including litigation. The complex and pervasive nature of climate change means transition risks are interconnected with and may amplify our other principal risks. Additionally, the inherent uncertainty of potential societal responses to/uni00A0climate change may create a systemic risk/uni00A0to/uni00A0the global economy.\n\n## Examples of potential threats\n\n- -  Introduction or improvement of low-carbon technologies or changes in customer preference for products that support the transition to a low-carbon economy may decrease demand for some of our products (which may be abrupt or unanticipated), increase our costs or decrease the availability of key inputs to production. For example:\n- -  'Green steel' technologies may reduce demand for our metallurgical coal or iron ore, or electric vehicle penetration may reduce demand for/uni00A0our/uni00A0petroleum products.\n- -  Implementing low-carbon processes or new investments to respond to market demand for products that support a low-carbon economy (such as potential capital spend at our Jansen Potash Project to deliver fertiliser products or at our Nickel West asset to supply the battery market) may increase operating or/uni00A0development costs.\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n- -  Failure to address investor concerns on the potential impact of climate change on and from BHP's portfolio and operations may result in reduced investor con/f.shortidence and/or investor actions seeking to in/f.shortluence BHP's climate strategy.\n- -  Social concerns around climate change may result in investors divesting our securities, pressure on BHP to divest or close remaining fossil fuel assets and on /f.shortinancial institutions not to provide /f.shortinancing for our fossil fuel assets, or otherwise adversely impact our ability to optimise our portfolio.\n- -  Perceived or actual misalignment of the resources industry's or BHP's climate actions (goals, targets and performance) with societal and investor expectations, or a failure to deliver our climate actions, may result in damage to our reputation, climaterelated litigation (including class actions) or/uni00A0give rise to other adverse regulatory, legal/uni00A0or/uni00A0market responses.\n- -  Changes in laws, regulations, policies, obligations, government actions, and our ability to anticipate and respond to such changes (which may be abrupt or unanticipated), including emission targets, restrictive licencing, carbon taxes, border adjustments or the addition or removal of/uni00A0subsidies, may give rise to adverse regulatory, legal or market responses.\n\n## Examples of potential opportunities\n\n- -  Our copper, nickel, iron ore and metallurgical coal provide essential building blocks for renewable power generation and electric vehicles, and can play an important part in the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n- -  Our potash fertiliser options can promote more e/ff.shorticient and more pro/f.shortitable agriculture and alleviate the increased competition for arable land.\n- -  Increased collaboration with customers and original equipment manufacturers, such as BHP's partnerships with each of China Baowu, JFE and HBIS for research and development of steel decarbonisation pathways, can provide opportunities for development of new products and markets.\n\n## Key management actions\n\n- -  Establishing public views and commitments on, and mandatory minimum performance requirements for managing, climate change threats and opportunities, which are set out in/uni00A0our Climate Change Position Statement, our Climate Change Report 2020, our Climate Transition Action Plan 2021 and the/uni00A0 Our Requirements for Environment and Climate Change standard.\n- -  Using climate-related scenarios, themes and signposts (such as monitoring policy, regulatory, legal, technological, market and other societal developments) to evaluate the resilience of our portfolio and inform our strategy.\n- -  Considering transition risks (including carbon prices) when making capital expenditure decisions or allocating capital through our Capital Allocation Framework, supporting the prioritisation of capital and investment approval processes.",

Price outlooks for these commodities published in the International Energy Agency's (IEA) Net Zero by 2050: A Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector Special Report (May 2021) (IEA NZE) are also unfavourable to the price outlooks in our current planning cases.\n\nDespite recent progress, all 1.5\u00b0C pathways to 2050 represent a major departure from today's global trajectory and we do not believe the technological, regulatory, or economic foundations for a rapid transition to net zero emissions are currently in place. Therefore, a 1.5\u00b0C Paris-aligned scenario is currently not an input into our planning cases. This is consistent with the IAE's acknowledgement that the window for its Net Zero by 2050 roadmap is/uni00A0narrow, albeit still achievable.\n\nWhile the price outlooks under the IEA NZE and our 1.5\u00b0C Paris-aligned scenario are unfavourable compared to the price outlooks in our current planning cases, recent portfolio announcements and impairments recognised in FY2021 limit the exposure of the carrying value of our assets to long-term commodity prices for energy coal, oil and natural gas, as\n\n- -  On 17 August 2021, we announced the proposed merger of our Petroleum assets with Woodside.

This exposes BHP to risks originating from adopting or implementing new technologies, or failing to take appropriate action to position BHP for the digital future, which may impact the capabilities we require, the e/ffectiveness and e/ff.shorticiency of our operations and our ability to compete e/ffectively. We may also fail to maintain the e/ffectiveness of our existing and future digital landscape, including cyber defences, exposing us to technology availability, reliability and cybersecurity risks.\n\ncon/f.shortirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of full form transaction documents, and satisfaction of conditions precedent including shareholder, regulatory and other approvals. The preliminary terms of the merger did not provide an indicator of impairment for our Petroleum assets at 30 June 2021. The merger is expected to be completed during the /f.shortirst half of CY2022, following which, the Group's revenue would no longer be directly exposed to long-term oil and gas prices, including those under 1.5\u00b0C scenarios.\n\n- -  In June 2021, we entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement to divest our 33.3 per cent interest in the Cerrej\u00f3n energy coal joint venture in Colombia, subject to the satisfaction of customary competition and regulatory requirements. The divestment is expected to complete in the second half/uni00A0of FY2022;\n- -  Following the write downs taken by the Group in FY2021, the carrying value of our NSWEC assets is no longer material. Further, the pro/f.shortitability and cash /f.shortlow of NSWEC assets are immaterial to the Group in FY2021.\n\nIn relation to New South Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC), closure and rehabilitation provisions may be susceptible to the long-term impacts of our 1.5\u00b0C Paris-aligned scenario. In isolation, and without considering the impact of changes management would make to operating and investment plans, bringing forward the majority of rehabilitation activities by one year could increase the closure and rehabilitation provision at NSWEC by approximately US$10 million.",

An inability to adequately implement new technology, or any sustained disruption to our existing technology, may also adversely a/ffect our licence to operate, reputation, results of operations and /f.shortinancial performance.\n\nAs we continue to leverage technology to improve productivity and safety, we expect the importance of safe, secure and reliable technology to our business will continue to grow.\n\n## Examples of potential threats\n\n- -  Failure to achieve e/ff.shorticiencies through our investment in technologies, or to keep pace with advancements in technology, resulting in an inability to access systems or digital infrastructure required to support our operations or customers' and other stakeholders' evolving expectations. For example, delays, costs and failures to achieve e/ff.shorticiencies arising from di/ff.shorticulties in integrating new technologies with existing technologies, or from failures of new technology to perform as expected.\n- -  Failing to identify, access and secure necessary infrastructure and key inputs (including electricity, internet bandwidth, data, software, licences or other rights in intellectual property, hardware and talent) to support new technology innovations and advanced technologies may adversely a/ffect our ability to operate or adopt those technologies. This includes arti/f.shorticial intelligence and machine learning, process automation, robotics, data analytics, cloud computing, smart devices and remote working. For example, adopting new technology to reduce emissions through the/uni00A0use of alternative energy sources may require new infrastructure (such as at our mines and ports), and e/ffective implementation of new digital technologies will be heavily dependent on access to relevant data.\n- -  Failure or outage of our existing or future information and operating technology systems.\n- -  Cyber events or attacks (including ransomware, state-sponsored and other cyberattacks) on our existing or future information and operating technology systems, including on third-party partners and suppliers (such as our cloud service providers). For example, a cyberattack on our/uni00A0autonomous systems for haulage and/uni00A0drilling may reduce operational productivity and/or adversely impact safety.\n\n## Examples of potential opportunities\n\n- -  Application of digital solutions across our operations and value chain may unlock greater productivity and safety performance. For example, using predictive analytics to enable operations to identify asset condition and e/ff.shorticiencies may improve safety, production and equipment availability, and/uni00A0reduce maintenance and other costs.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n- -  Technology solutions to reduce emissions may support BHP and our suppliers and customers in achieving climate action targets. For example, BHP is collaborating with other miners and suppliers to develop new technology to electrify haul trucks.\n- -  Developing and applying arti/f.shorticial intelligence in mine planning, remote operation and advanced robotic technologies may identify or provide access to previously unknown or inaccessible deposits and development of end-to-end autonomous mining systems.\n- -  Using digital simulations and predictive trend modelling may enable us to optimise the deployment of new technologies, such as automation and electri/f.shortication, support early identi/f.shortication of process variances and faults, and support the marketing of our products to customers.\n\n## Key management actions\n\n- -  Our assets, functions and projects are responsible for managing localised or project-speci/f.shortic exposure to technology risks. Enterprise-level risks that are speci/f.shortic to technology, such as those that pose a greater threat to our wider business and strategic opportunities, are generally managed by our global Technology team and other relevant stakeholders to support delivery of our technology strategy.\n- -  We collaborate with industry and research partners to develop technological solutions.\n- -  Our Technology Risk Committee oversees the management and improvement of technology risks and controls, and supports the embedment of a sustainable risk culture in our Technology team.\n- -  We employ a number of measures designed to protect against, detect and respond to cyber events or attacks, including BHP's mandatory minimum performance requirements for technology and cybersecurity, cybersecurity performance requirements for suppliers, cybersecurity strategy and resilience programs, an enterprise security framework and cybersecurity standards, cybersecurity awareness plans and training, security assessments and monitoring, restricted physical access to hardware and crisis management plans.\n\n## FY2021 insights\n\nRisks associated with technology and the pace of technological innovation continue to evolve rapidly. The Group's exposure to technology risks increased in FY2021 due primarily to an increase in the frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks against companies in the resources industry and governments. BHP continues to leverage technology to deliver value while taking actions to manage associated risks and strengthening cyber capabilities. During FY2021, we implemented programs to/uni00A0enable rapid technology development, improve operational performance and to create/uni00A0new analytic capabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHow we deliver value - Technology section/uni00A01.6.2\n\n## Ethical misconduct\n\nRisks associated with actual or alleged deviation from societal or business expectations of ethical behaviour (including breaches of laws or regulations) and wider or cumulative organisational cultural failings, resulting in signi/f.shorticant reputational impacts.\n\n## Why is this important to BHP?\n\nThe conduct of BHP or our people or third-party partners could result in an actual or alleged deviation from expectations of ethical behaviour or breaches of laws and regulations. This may include fraud, corruption, anti-competitive behaviour, money laundering, breaching trade or /f.shortinancial sanctions, market manipulation, privacy breaches, ethical misconduct and wider organisational cultural failings. A failure to act ethically or legally may result in negative publicity (including on social media), investigations, public inquiries, regulatory enforcement action (including /f.shortines), litigation or other civil or criminal proceedings, or increased regulation. It could also threaten the validity of our tenements or permits, or adversely impact our reputation, results of operations, /f.shortinancial performance or share price. Impacts may be ampli/f.shortied if our senior leaders fail to uphold BHP's values or address actual or alleged misconduct in a way that is consistent with societal and stakeholder expectations, and our workplace culture may also be eroded, adversely a/ffecting our ability to attract and retain talent. Ethical misconduct risks and impacts are heightened by the complex and continuously evolving legal and regulatory frameworks that apply to the jurisdictions where we operate and potentially con/f.shortlicting obligations under di/fferent national laws.\n\n## Examples of potential threats\n\n- -  Failing to prevent breaches of international standards, laws, regulations or other legal, regulatory, ethical, environmental, governance or compliance obligations, such as external misstatements, inaccurate /f.shortinancial or operational reporting or a breach of our continuous disclosure obligations.\n- -  Corruption (particularly in high-risk or less economically developed jurisdictions), market conduct or anti-competitive behaviour, including in relation to our joint/uni00A0venture operations.\n- -  Failing to comply with trade or /f.shortinancial sanctions (which are subject to rapid change/uni00A0and may potentially result in con/f.shortlicting obligations), health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, native title and other land right or tax or/uni00A0royalty obligations.\n- -  Failing to protect our people from harm (including to mental and physical health) due to the misconduct of others that takes place in connection with their work, such as discrimination or sexual harassment and assault.",

Societal expectations have also increased - stakeholder dissatisfaction in response to other companies' executive misconduct and failures to uphold corporate or societal values demonstrate the importance of implementing and maintaining e/ffective preventative controls and responding to inappropriate conduct in a/uni00A0timely manner.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Charter and Our Code of Conduct Our conduct - EthicsPoint section 2.1.15 Corporate Governance Statement section 2.1 Safety - Sexual assault and sexual harassment section 1.13.4\n\nEthics and business conduct section 1.13.6\n\n## Inadequate business resilience\n\nRisks associated with unanticipated or unforeseeable adverse events and a failure of planning and preparedness to respond to, manage and recover from adverse events (including potential physical impacts of climate change).\n\n## Why is this important to BHP?\n\nIn addition to the threats described in our other risk factors, our business could experience unanticipated, unforeseeable or other adverse events (internal or external) that could harm our people, disrupt our operations or value chain, or damage our assets or corporate o/ff.shortices, including our non-operated assets over which BHP has less control. A failure to identify or understand exposure, adequately prepare for these events (including maintaining business continuity plans) or build wider organisational resilience may inhibit our (or our third-party partners') ability to respond and recover in an e/ffective and e/ff.shorticient manner. This could cause material adverse impacts on our business, such as reduced ability to access resources, markets and the operational or other inputs required by our business, reduced production or sales of commodities, or increased regulation, which could adversely impact our /f.shortinancial performance, share price or reputation, and could lead to litigation or class actions.\n\n## Examples of potential threats\n\n- -  Geopolitical, global economic, regional or local developments or adverse events, such as social unrest, strikes, work stoppages, labour disruptions, social activism, terrorism, bomb threats, economic slowdown, acts of war or other signi/f.shorticant disruptions in areas where we operate or have interests (for example, in FY2020, stoppages associated with social unrest in Chile impacted copper production at Escondida).\n- -  Natural events, including earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, cyclones, /f.shortires, solar /f.shortlares and pandemics (for example, earthquakes may a/ffect the Andes region in South America where we undertake exploration activities and have operated and/uni00A0non-operated assets).\n- -  Potential physical impacts of climate change, such as acute risks that are event-driven (including increased severity of extreme weather events) and chronic risks resulting from longer-term changes in climate patterns. Hazards and impacts may include changes in precipitation patterns, water shortages, rising sea levels, increased storm intensity, prolonged extreme temperatures and increased drought, /f.shortire and tidal /f.shortlooding.\n- -  Failure by suppliers, contractors or joint venture partners to perform existing contracts or obligations (including due to insolvency), such as construction of large projects or supply of key inputs to our business (for example, consumables for our/uni00A0mining equipment).\n- -  Failure of our risk management or other processes (including controls) to prepare for or manage any of the risks discussed in this 'Risk factors' section may inhibit our (or our third party partners') ability to manage any resulting adverse events and may disrupt our operations or adversely impact our /f.shortinancial performance or reputation.\n\n## Examples of potential opportunities\n\n- -  Risk identi/f.shortication and management supports proactive, focused and prioritised deployment of resources to reduce exposure to adverse events. It may be used to inform priorities and strategies across BHP, supporting a proportionate and cost-e/ffective response, which could provide a competitive advantage at a regional or global level.\n- -  Building wider organisational resilience may help us to mitigate the impacts of unforeseeable adverse events. For example, processes may be redesigned to enhance resilience to adverse events, such as pandemics.\n- -  Adapting to climate change across our operations and value chain could position BHP as a supplier of choice and provide competitive advantage (for example, by ful/f.shortilling our commitment to security of supply). Support for climate vulnerable communities and ecosystems may also improve our social value proposition.\n\n## Key management actions\n\n- -  Implementing Group-wide controls to enhance business resilience, including BHP's mandatory minimum performance requirements for security, crisis and emergency management and business continuity plans.\n- -  Monitoring our current state of readiness (preparedness, redundancy and resilience), including through scenario analysis, to respond to and recover from adverse events to support organisational capability in our operations, functions and senior management to e/ffectively and e/ff.shorticiently respond to events should they materialise.",

While the impacts on BHP have been relatively minor to date, sustained or increased geopolitical tensions, the pandemic and nationalist sentiment may exacerbate the drivers of con/f.shortlict, instability and unrest, including existing inequality within and between nations. This could increase the likelihood of more signi/f.shorticant events that can have a greater impact on our business, such as social unrest and con/f.shortlict (including war and terrorism).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbhp.com/climate\n\n## Robust risk assessment and viability statement\n\nThe Board has carried out a robust assessment of BHP's emerging and principal risks, including those that could result in events or circumstances that might threaten BHP's business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity and reputation.\n\nThe Board has assessed the prospects of BHP over the next three years, taking into account our current position and principal risks.\n\nThe Board believes a three-year viability assessment period is appropriate for the following reasons. BHP has a two-year budget, a /f.shortive-year plan and a longer-term life of asset outlook. As highlighted in the 'Risk factors' section, there is considerable uncertainty in the external environment (which has been ampli/f.shortied by the COVID/hyphen.uc19 pandemic), including due to political and policy uncertainty, evolving stakeholder expectations (for example, in relation to the environment, climate change and human rights), civil unrest or reform in some countries in which we operate, continued market volatility and geopolitical tensions that could a/ffect our ability to access key markets.\n\n|                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                      | Scenario   | Scenario   | Scenario   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Principal risk                                                         | Hypothetical event                                                                                                                                                                   | A          | B          | C          |\n| Operational events                                                     | O/ffshore well blow out involving a drilling  rig/uni00A0that we operate in the US Gulf of Mexico                                                                                    |            |            |            |\n|                                                                        | Catastrophic failure of a tailings storage  facility at an operated asset in Australia                                                                                               |            |            |            |\n| Accessing key markets                                                  | Temporary physical or logistical disruption  of/uni00A0access to key markets preventing the  sale/uni00A0or delivery of commodities to Asia                                          |            |            |            |\n| Optimising portfolio  returns and managing  commodity price  movements | Low commodity price environment for  two years, commencing at the start of the  second half of FY2022, followed by a gradual  recovery by the end of the /f.shortirst half of FY2026 |            |            |            |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nThis could lead to changes to our regulatory environment and stakeholder expectations of our business, increase the risk of commodity price volatility and also a/ffect the longer-term supply, demand and price of our commodities. These factors result in variability in plans and budgets. A three-year period strikes an appropriate balance between long and shortterm in/f.shortluences on performance.\n\nThe viability assessment took into account, among other things:\n\n- -  BHP's commodity price protocols\n- -  the latest funding and liquidity update\n- -  the long-dated maturity pro/f.shortile of BHP's debt/uni00A0and the maximum debt maturing in/uni00A0any/uni00A0one year\n- -  the /f.shortlexibility in BHP's capital and exploration expenditure programs under the Capital Allocation Framework\n- -  the reserve life of BHP's minerals assets and the reserves-to-production life of BHP's oil and gas assets\n- -  the Group-level material risk pro/f.shortile (including climate-related risks) and the mitigating actions available should particular risks materialise\n- -  any actual and further anticipated impacts of the COVID/hyphen.uc19 pandemic on BHP's two-year budget and /f.shortive-year plan\n\nThe Board's assessment also took into account reverse stress testing of the Group's balance sheet to determine the additional levels of debt it could support on forecast commodity prices, as well as the cyclical low price case used in monthly balance sheet stress testing. Results were compared against assessed /f.short inancial impacts for all material risks recorded on the Group's risk pro/f.shortile, enabling the Board to/uni00A0consider the resilience of the balance sheet in the context of identi/f.shortied threats.\n\nIn addition, the balance sheet was stress tested against three hypothetical scenarios. Each scenario modelled two or three hypothetical events, based on our principal risks, occurring simultaneously towards the start of FY2022. Scenarios were designed without regard to the e/ffectiveness of preventative controls and re/f.shortlect market, operational, and a/uni00A0combination of market and operational risks. The simultaneous occurrence of all four events was not considered plausible. Further details are/uni00A0set out in the table below.\n\nA number of our other principal risks may have impacts that are embedded in these scenarios. For example, a cyber event or attack may lead to an operational event, while responses of governments and other stakeholders to a pandemic may result in an economic slowdown and low commodity price environment. For further information on our principal risks, see the 'Risk factors' section.\n\nWhile scenario modelling was undertaken for the duration of BHP's /f.shortive-year plan, con/f.shortidence is higher in the /f.shortirst three years. Stress testing demonstrated the Group's balance sheet was put under the greatest stress by Scenario C, which re/f.shortlects both market and operational risks, with net debt expected to increase to approximately US$48 billion over FY2022 to FY2024 (assuming dividends would be suspended in accordance with our Capital Allocation Framework). In such circumstances, the Board considered that the Group would have a number of further mitigating actions available to it which would be expected to allow the Group to limit net debt to approximately US$30 billion over that period, including deferral of discretionary capital expenditure and divestment of certain assets. BHP would also have access to US$5.5 billion of credit through its revolving credit facility. These mitigating actions would be expected to be su/ff.shorticient to support minimum investment-grade credit ratings over FY2022 to FY2024.\n\nFor the purposes of stress testing, the Board made certain key assumptions regarding management of the portfolio, the alignment of production, capital expenditure and operating expenditure with /f.shortive-year plan forecasts and the alignment of prices with the cyclical low price case used in/uni00A0monthly balance sheet stress testing.\n\nIn making this viability statement, the Board was also mindful of other relevant factors, including key risk indicator performance, monthly balance sheet stress testing against the cyclical low price case, the assessment of the Group's portfolio against scenarios as part of BHP's strategy and corporate planning processes, a Board-level risk identi/f.shortication session to help identify key uncertainties facing the Group, and the proposed changes to the Group's portfolio which are currently expected to complete in FY2022. (1)\n\nTaking account of these matters (including the assumptions) and our current position and principal risks, the Board has a reasonable expectation that BHP will be able to continue in/uni00A0operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three years.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Brent crude oil prices steadily increased through FY2021, rising from around US$40/bbl at the beginning of FY2021 to around US$75/bbl at the close. A recovery in business activity and mobility as economies reduced COVID/hyphen.uc19 controls has supported oil demand.\n\nSupply side curtailments from OPEC+ and capital restraint from US operators have supported oil inventories to rebalance globally. Demand is expected to continue its recovery to pre-COVID/hyphen.uc19 levels in FY2022. The rate at which currently curtailed supply is expected to come back onstream is uncertain. Longer term, we believe oil will remain attractive, even under a plausible low price, for a considerable time to come.\n\n## Lique/f.shortied natural gas\n\nOur average realised sales price for LNG for FY2021 was US$5.63 per Mcf (FY2020: US$7.26 per Mcf). The Japan-Korea Marker (JKM) price for LNG performed strongly in FY2021, hitting an all-time high in January 2021 supported by cold weather, recovery in China, high European gas prices, unplanned outages and less incremental supply coming online. Longer term, we expect the commodity to o/ffer a combination of systematic base decline and an attractive demand trajectory, with new supply likely to be required to balance the market in the middle of this decade, or slightly later. However, gas resource is currently abundant and liquefaction infrastructure comes with large upfront costs and extended pay backs. Within global gas, LNG is expected to gain share. Against this backdrop, LNG assets advantaged by their proximity to existing infrastructure or customers, or both, in addition to being at the lower end of the emissions intensity curve, are expected to remain attractive.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal Petroleum production for FY2021 decreased by 6 per cent to 103 MMboe.\n\nCrude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production decreased by 6 per cent to 46 MMboe due to natural /f.shortield decline across the portfolio, a highly active hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico in the /f.shortirst half of the year and downtime at Atlantis, with tie-in activity in the /f.short irst half of the year and unplanned downtime in the March 2021 quarter. These impacts were partially o/ffset by the earlier than scheduled achievement of /f.shortirst production from the Atlantis Phase 3 project in July 2020 and the additional working interest acquired in Shenzi, completed on 6 November 2020.\n\nNatural gas production decreased by 5 per cent to 341 bcf, re/f.shortlecting planned shutdowns at Angostura related to the Ruby tie-in, lower gas demand at Bass Strait and natural /f.shortield decline across the portfolio. The decline was partially o/ffset by improved reliability at Bass Strait and higher domestic gas sales at Macedon.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on individual asset production in FY2021, FY2020 and FY2019 refer to section 4.5\n\n## Other information\n\n## Drilling\n\nThe number of wells in the process of drilling and/or completion as of 30 June 2021 was as follows:\n\n|               | Exploratory wells   | Exploratory wells   | Development wells   | Development wells   | Total   | Total   |\n|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------|---------|\n|               | Gross               | Net (1)             | Gross               | Net (1)             | Gross   | Net (1) |\n| Australia     | -                   | -                   | -                   | -                   | -       | -       |\n| United States | -                   | -                   | 27                  | 9                   | 27      | 9       |\n| Other (2)     | -                   | -                   | 5                   | 3                   | 5       | 3       |\n| Total         | -                   | -                   | 32                  | 12                  | 32      | 12      |\n\n- (1) Represents our share of the gross well count.\n- (2)  Other is comprised of Trinidad and Tobago.\n\n## Financial results\n\nPetroleum revenue for FY2021 decreased by US$0.1 billion to US$3.9 billion re/f.shortlecting lower production o/ffset by higher average realised prices. Underlying EBITDA for Petroleum increased by US$0.1 billion to US$2.3 billion. Price impacts, net of price-linked costs, increased Underlying EBITDA by US$0.3 billion but were partially o/ffset by the impacts of lower production of US$0.2 billion. Controllable cash costs decreased by US$43 million re/f.shortlecting lower maintenance activity at our Australian assets due to COVID/hyphen.uc19 restrictions and lower exploration seismic activity. This was partially o/ffset by higher workover activity at Atlantis, restructuring costs related to improving future competitiveness and increased business development activity in Mexico due to Trion progressing into pre-feasibility.\n\nPetroleum unit costs increased by 11 per cent to US$10.83 per barrel of oil equivalent due to lower volumes and unfavourable exchange rate movements, partially o/ffset by a reduction in price-linked costs.

        "page_content": "## Petroleum\n\nBHP's net share of capital development expenditure in FY2021, which is presented on a cash basis within this section, was US$994 million (FY2020: US$909 million). While the majority of the expenditure in FY2021 was incurred by operating partners at our Australian and Gulf of Mexico non-operated assets, we also incurred capital expenditure at/uni00A0our operated Australian, Gulf of Mexico, and/uni00A0Trinidad and Tobago assets.\n\n## Australia\n\nBHP's net share of capital development expenditure in FY2021 was US$197 million. The expenditure was primarily related to:\n\n- -  Scarborough gas /f.shortield development\n- -  North West Shelf: Greater Western Flank 3 and Lambert Deep subsea tie back development, Karratha Gas Plant refurbishment projects and facility integrity projects\n- -  Bass Strait: West Barracouta subsea tie/uni00A0back development\n\n## Gulf of Mexico\n\nBHP's net share of capital development expenditure in FY2021 was US$599 million. The expenditure was primarily related to:\n\n- -  Atlantis: execution of approved development on Atlantis Phase 3 Project and Brown/f.shortield subsea tie back to existing Atlantis facility in/uni00A0Gulf of Mexico\n- -  Mad Dog: execution phase of Phase 2 development\n- -  Shenzi: Drilling of Shenzi North and ongoing/uni00A0in/f.shortill drilling\n\n## Trinidad and Tobago\n\nBHP's net share of capital development expenditure in FY2021 was US$152 million. The expenditure was primarily related to:\n\n- -  Ruby: execution of approved development of Block 3a resources in the Ruby and Delaware reservoirs\n\n## Outlook\n\nProduction is expected to be between 99 and 106 MMboe in FY2022, re/f.shortlecting a full year of the additional 28 per cent working interest acquired in Shenzi, increased production at Shenzi from in/f.shortill wells and increased volumes from Ruby following /f.shortirst production in May 2021, o/ffset by natural /f.shortield decline across the portfolio.\n\nUnit costs in FY2022 are expected to be between US$11 and US$12 per barrel (based on an exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.78) re/f.shortlecting the expected impact of an increase in exchange rate and expected higher price-linked costs. In the medium term, we expect an increase in unit costs to be maintained at less than US$13 per barrel (based on an exchange rate of AUD/ USD 0.78) primarily as a result of expected natural /f.shortield decline.\n\nPetroleum capital and exploration expenditure of approximately US$2.3 billion is planned in FY2022.\n\nOn 17 August 2021, the Group announced the proposed merger of our Petroleum assets with\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\nWoodside. On completion of the proposed transaction, BHP's oil and gas business would merge with Woodside, and Woodside would issue new shares to be distributed to BHP shareholders, at which time it is expected that Woodside would be owned 52 per cent and 48 per cent by existing Woodside and BHP shareholders, respectively. The merger, which has a proposed e/ffective date of 1 July 2021, is subject to con/f.shortirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of full form transaction documents, and satisfaction of conditions precedent including shareholder, regulatory and other approvals. The Group continues to assess the full /f.shortinancial reporting impacts of the proposed merger. However, the preliminary terms of the merger did not provide an indicator of impairment for our Petroleum assets at 30 June 2021. The merger is expected to be completed during the /f.shortirst half of CY2022, at which time, we would derecognise the carrying value of our Petroleum assets, which at 30 June 2021 included, but was not limited to, property plant and equipment and closure and rehabilitation provisions of approximately US$11.9 billion and US$3.9 billion, respectively. The outlook for our expected production, unit costs and capital and exploration expenditure in FY2022 does not take into account the proposed merger with Woodside.\n\n## 1.17.2  Copper\n\nDetailed below is /f.shortinancial and operating information for our Copper assets comparing FY2021 to FY2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more detailed /f.shortinancial information on our Copper assets\n\nrefer to section 4.4.2\n\n| Year ended 30 June   US$M           | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Revenue                             | 15,726 | 10,666 |\n| Underlying EBITDA                   | 8,489  | 4,347  |\n| Net operating assets                | 26,928 | 25,357 |\n| Capital expenditure                 | 2,180  | 2,434  |\n| Total copper production/uni00A0(kt) | 1,636  | 1,724  |\n| Average realised prices             |        |        |\n| Copper (US$/lb)                     | 3.81   | 2.50   |\n\n## Key drivers of Copper's /f.shortinancial results\n\n## Price overview\n\nOur average realised sales price for FY2021 was US$3.81 per pound (FY2020: US$2.50 per pound). Copper rode a wave of investor optimism for much of FY2021, hitting an all-time high in May. We believe mine supply and scrap collection will both need to rise to meet demand growth in the medium term. Longer term, traditional end-use demand is expected to be solid, while broad exposure to the electri/f.shortication mega-trend o/ffers attractive upside. Prices are expected to rise compared to historical averages in the long term due to grade decline, resource depletion, increased input costs, water constraints, rising ESG standards, and a scarcity of high-quality future development opportunities after a poor decade for industry-wide exploration. Regulatory risk is/uni00A0an emerging theme across the industry.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal Copper production for FY2021 decreased by 5 per cent to 1,636 kt.\n\nEscondida copper production decreased by 10 per cent to 1,068 kt as continued strong concentrator throughput of 371 ktpd, at record levels, was more than o/ffset by the impact of expected lower concentrator feed grade and lower cathode production as a result of a reduced operational workforce due/uni00A0to/uni00A0COVID/hyphen.uc19 restrictions.\n\nPampa Norte copper production decreased by 10 per cent to 218 kt largely due to a decline in stacking feed grade at Spence of 11 per cent, planned maintenance at Spence and the impact of a reduced operational workforce as a result of COVID/hyphen.uc19 restrictions partially o/ffset by the new stream of concentrate production from the Spence Growth Option that came online in/uni00A0December 2020.\n\nOlympic Dam copper production increased by 20 per cent to 205 kt, the highest annual production achieved since our acquisition in/uni00A02005, re/f.shortlecting improved smelter stability and strong underground mine performance. Olympic Dam also achieved record gold production of 146 koz.\n\nAntamina copper production increased 16 per cent to 144 kt and zinc production increased 64 per cent to a record 145 Kt, re/f.shortlecting both higher copper and zinc head grades.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on individual asset production in FY2021, FY2020 and FY2019\n\nrefer to section 4.5\n\n## Financial results\n\nCopper revenue increased by US$5.1 billion to US$15.7 billion in FY2021 due to higher average realised Copper prices o/ffset by lower production.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA for Copper increased by US$4.1 billion to US$8.5 billion. Price impacts, net of price-linked costs, increased Underlying EBITDA by US$4.3 billion. Lower volumes decreased Underlying EBITDA by US$258 million.\n\nControllable cash costs increased by US$106 million, due to higher inventory drawdowns at Olympic Dam, from stronger mill and smelter performance compared to the prior period, and at Escondida to o/ffset lower material mined during the period due to a reduced operational workforce. This was partially o/ffset by strong cost performance at Escondida, a US$99 million gain from the optimised outcome from renegotiation of cancelled power contracts at Escondida and Spence, and/uni00A0favourable leach pad inventory movements/uni00A0at Escondida and Spence.\n\nNon-cash costs decreased by US$273 million due to lower deferred stripping depletion at Escondida, re/f.shortlecting the planned development phase of the mines. In/f.shortlation and foreign exchange rate negatively impacted Underlying EBITDA by US$514 million which was o/ffset by increased equity accounted investment pro/f.shortits attributable to Antamina of US$411 million.",

This also re/f.shortlects a one-o/ff gain from the optimisation of a settlement outcome for the cancellation of power contracts as part of a shift towards 100 per cent renewable energy at Escondida. The strong unit cost result was achieved despite the impact of unfavourable exchange rate movements, a 4 per cent decline in copper concentrate feed grade and lower cathode volumes as a result of a reduced operational workforce due to COVID/hyphen.uc19 restrictions.

Escondida production of between 1,000 and 1,080 kt is expected in FY2022, re/f.shortlecting a continuing need to catch up on mine development due to reduced material movement in FY2021, as well as uncertainty around COVID/hyphen.uc19 impacts. Decline in the copper grade of concentrator feed in FY2022 is expected to be approximately 2 per cent. Production at Pampa Norte is expected to increase by more than 50 per cent to be between 330 and 370/uni00A0kt in FY2022, re/f.shortlecting the continued ramp-up of the Spence Growth Option (SGO), partially o/ffset by an expected decline in stacking feed grade at Pampa Norte of approximately 9 per cent. The ramp-up to full production capacity at SGO is still expected to take approximately 12 months from /f.shortirst production in December 2020, following which Spence is currently planned to average 300 ktpa of production (including cathodes) over the /f.shortirst four years of operation. At Olympic Dam, production is expected to be between 140 and 170 kt in FY2022 as a result of the planned major smelter maintenance campaign and subsequent rampup planned between August 2021 and February 2022. Antamina Copper production is expected between 120 and 140 kt in FY2022.\n\nEscondida unit costs in FY2022 are expected to be between US$1.20 and US$1.40 per pound (based on an average exchange rate of USD/\n\nCLP 727) re/f.shortlecting expected lower by-product credits, expected higher costs associated with an approximately 20 per cent increase in material mined required to catch up on mine development due to reduced material movement in FY2021 and study costs to increase optionality at Escondida longer term. This also re/f.shortlects the inclusion of COVID/hyphen.uc19 costs (treated as an exceptional item in FY2021) and a further decline in concentrator feed grade of approximately 2 per cent. In the medium term, unit cost guidance remains unchanged at less than US$1.10 per pound (based on an exchange rate of USD/CLP 727).\n\n## 1.17.3  Iron Ore\n\nDetailed below is /f.shortinancial and operating information for our Iron Ore assets comparing FY2021 to FY2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more detailed /f.shortinancial information on our Iron Ore assets\n\nrefer to section 4.4.3\n\n| Year ended 30 June   US$M                       | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Revenue                                         | 34,475 | 20,797 |\n| Underlying EBITDA                               | 26,278 | 14,554 |\n| Net operating assets                            | 18,663 | 18,400 |\n| Capital expenditure                             | 2,188  | 2,328  |\n| Total iron ore production (Mt)                  | 254    | 248    |\n| Average realised prices Iron ore (US$/wmt, FOB) | 130.56 | 77.36  |\n\n## Key drivers of Iron Ore's /f.shortinancial results\n\n## Price overview\n\nIron Ore's average realised sales price for FY2021 was US$130.56 per wet metric tonne (wmt) (FY2020: US$77.36 per wmt). Iron ore prices were elevated throughout FY2021, hitting record highs in the second half. Forces contributing to price gains included strong Chinese pig iron production, a rapid recovery in global markets excluding China and a shortage of branded /f.shortines products as some iron ore mining companies have been producing towards their lower end of guidance. Medium term, we believe China's demand for iron ore is expected to be lower than it is today as crude steel production plateaus and the scrap-to-steel ratio rises. In the long term, we believe prices are expected to be determined by high cost production, on a value-in-use adjusted basis, from Australia or Brazil. Quality di/fferentiation is/uni00A0expected to remain a factor in determining iron ore prices as steelmakers prefer high-quality raw materials for higher productivity and/uni00A0lower-emissions intensity.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal Iron Ore production increased by 2 per cent to 254 Mt.\n\nWAIO production increased by 1 per cent to/uni00A0a record 252 Mt (284 Mt on a 100% basis) re/f.shortlecting record production at Jimblebar and Mining Area C, which included /f.shortirst ore from South Flank in May 2021. This was combined with strong operational performance across the supply chain re/f.shortlecting continued improvements in car dumper performance and reliability, and improved train cycle times. This was achieved despite signi/f.shorticant weather\n\nimpacts, temporary rail labour shortages due to COVID/hyphen.uc19 related border restrictions and the/uni00A0planned Mining Area C and South Flank major tie-in activity to integrate South Flank with/uni00A0the Mining Area C processing hub.\n\nSamarco production was 1.9 Mt following the recommencement of iron ore pellet production at one concentrator in December 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on individual asset production in FY2021, FY2020 and FY2019\n\nrefer to section 4.5\n\n## Financial results\n\nTotal Iron Ore revenue increased by US$13.7 billion to US$34.5 billion in FY2021 re/f.shortlecting higher average realised prices and production. Underlying EBITDA for Iron Ore increased by US$11.7 billion to US$26.3 billion including favourable price impacts, net of pricelinked costs, of US$12.1 billion. Higher volumes increased Underlying EBITDA by US$148 million. This was partially o/ffset by unfavourable foreign exchange impacts of US$416 million. Other items such as in/f.shortlation and one-o/ff items negatively impacted Underlying EBITDA by US$63 million.\n\nWAIO unit costs increased by 17 per cent to US$14.82 per tonne due to the impact of a 12/uni00A0per cent stronger Australian dollar, higher third-party royalties related to higher iron ore prices, incremental costs relating to the rampup of South Flank and higher labour costs relating to increased planned maintenance partially o/ffset by record production and continued production improvements across the/uni00A0supply chain. The calculation of WAIO unit/uni00A0costs is set out in the table below:\n\n| WAIO unit costs   (US$M)    | FY2021   | FY2020   |\n|-----------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Revenue                     | 34,337   | 20,663   |\n| Underlying EBITDA           | 26,270   | 14,508   |\n| Gross costs                 | 8,067    | 6,155    |\n| Less: freight               | 1,755    | 1,459    |\n| Less: royalties             | 2,577    | 1,531    |\n| Net costs                   | 3,735    | 3,165    |\n| Sales (kt, equity share)    | 252,052  | 250,598  |\n| Cost per tonne (US$) (1)(2) | 14.82    | 12.63    |\n\n## Outlook\n\nWAIO production of between 246 and 255 Mt, or between 278 and 288 Mt on a 100 per cent basis, is expected in FY2022 as WAIO looks to focus on incremental volume growth through productivity improvements. We continue with our program to further improve port reliability and this includes a major maintenance campaign on car dumper one planned for the September 2021 quarter. The Yandi resource has commenced its end-of-life ramp-down as South Flank ramps up, and this is expected to continue to provide supply chain /f.shortlexibility with a lower level of production to continue for a few years.\n\nSamarco production of between 3 and 4 Mt (BHP share) is expected in FY2022.",

Metallurgical coal prices faced by Australian producers in the free-onboard (FOB) market were weak for most of FY2021. A spike in uncertainty regarding China's import policy on Australia origin coals distorted the usual trade /f.shortlows and had a key in/f.shortluence on the market. Demand outside China has been promising supported by strong recovery in the steel sector. Prices rebounded sharply towards the end of FY2021, on multi-regional supply disruptions and trade /f.shortlow rebalancing. Going forward, while trade /f.shortlow from Australia into China is inhibited, the metallurgical coal industry could face an uncertain and challenging period ahead. Over time, premium quality coking coals are expected to be particularly advantaged given the drive by steelmakers to improve blast furnace productivity, partly to reduce emissions intensity. We believe a wholesale shift away from blast furnace steelmaking, which requires metallurgical\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\ncoal, is still decades in the future given the high cost of conversion and operation associated with alternative steelmaking technologies.\n\n## Energy coal\n\nOur average realised sales price for FY2021 was US$58.42 per tonne (FY2020: US$57.10 per tonne). The Newcastle 6,000 kcal/kg price reached its high for the /f.shortinancial year in June 2021 amid strong demand and disrupted supply. Newcastle 5,500 kcal/kg coal found demand in India and North Asia given import restrictions into China. Longer term, our base case is that total primary energy derived from coal (power and non-power) is expected to modestly grow at a compound rate slower than that of global population growth. Under deep decarbonisation scenarios, demand is expected to/uni00A0decline in absolute terms.\n\n## Production\n\nMetallurgical coal production decreased by 1 per cent to 41 Mt (73 Mt on a 100 per cent basis). At Queensland Coal strong operational performance, including record production at Goonyella facilitated by record tonnes from Broadmeadow mine, was o/ffset by signi/f.shorticant weather impacts across most operations earlier in the year, as well as planned wash plant maintenance at Saraji and Caval Ridge in the /f.shortirst half of the year. At South Walker Creek, despite record stripping, production decreased as a result of higher strip ratios due to ongoing impacts from geotechnical constraints and lower yields.\n\nEnergy coal production decreased by 17 per cent to 19 Mt. NSWEC production decreased by 11 per cent to 14 Mt despite increased stripping. This decrease re/f.shortlects signi/f.shorticant weather impacts and higher strip ratios, as well as lower volumes due to an increased proportion of washed coal in response to widening price quality di/fferentials consistent with our strategy to focus on higher quality products, and reduced port capacity following damage to a shiploader at the Newcastle port in November 2020. Cerrej\u00f3n production decreased by 30 per cent to 5 Mt mainly as a result of a 91-day strike in the /f.shortirst half of the year and subsequent delays to the restart of production, as well as the impact of a reduced operational workforce due to COVID/hyphen.uc19 restrictions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on individual asset production in FY2021, FY2020 and FY2019 refer to section 4.5\n\n## Financial results\n\nCoal revenue decreased by US$1.1 billion to US$5.2 billion in FY2021 due to lower average realised prices and production.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA for Coal decreased by/uni00A0US$1.3 billion to US$288 million including lower price impacts, net of price-linked costs,/uni00A0of/uni00A0US$0.7 billion. Lower volumes decreased Underlying EBITDA by US$168 million. Controllable cash costs increased by US$102 million driven by increased maintenance costs at Queensland Coal (earth/uni00A0moving equipment maintenance and shiploader maintenance at Hay Point port) as/uni00A0well as increased stripping volumes, which was partially o/ffset by cost reduction initiatives at both Queensland Coal and NSWEC.\n\nOther items including lower fuel and energy prices favourably impacted Underlying EBITDA by US$93 million, but were more than o/ffset by US$512 million of foreign exchange losses.\n\nQueensland Coal unit costs increased by 21 per cent to US$82 per tonne, due to the impact of a 12 per cent stronger Australian dollar, higher planned maintenance in the /f.shortirst half of the year, shiploader maintenance at Hay Point, and lower yields and increased stripping volumes at Poitrel and South Walker Creek. This was partially o/ffset by lower fuel and energy costs, driven by lower diesel prices, and cost reduction initiatives.\n\nNSWEC unit costs increased by 14 per cent to US$64 per tonne, due to the impact of a stronger Australian dollar and lower volumes as a result of signi/f.shorticant weather impacts, higher strip ratios, an increased proportion of washed coal in response to widening price quality di/fferentials and reduced port capacity following damage to a shiploader at the Newcastle port in November 2020. This was partially o/ffset by lower fuel and energy costs, driven by lower diesel prices, as/uni00A0well as cost reduction initiatives.\n\nThe calculation of Queensland Coal's and NSWEC's unit costs is set out in the table below:\n\n## Outlook\n\nMetallurgical coal production is expected to be between 39 and 44 Mt, or 70 and 78 Mt on a 100 per cent basis, in FY2022, as we expect restrictions on coal imports into China to remain for a number of years. Production is expected to be weighted to the second half of the year due to planned wash plant maintenance in the /f.shortirst half of the year.\n\n|                             | Queensland Coal unit costs   | Queensland Coal unit costs   | NSWEC unit costs   | NSWEC unit costs   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| US$M                        | FY2021                       | FY2020                       | FY2021             | FY2020             |\n| Revenue                     | 4,315                        | 5,357                        | 839                | 886                |\n| Underlying EBITDA           | 593                          | 1,935                        | (169)              | (79)               |\n| Gross costs                 | 3,722                        | 3,422                        | 1,008              | 965                |\n| Less: freight               | 69                           | 147                          | -                  | -                  |\n| Less: royalties             | 330                          | 498                          | 66                 | 68                 |\n| Net costs                   | 3,323                        | 2,777                        | 942                | 897                |\n| Sales (kt, equity share)    | 40,619                       | 41,086                       | 14,626             | 15,868             |\n| Cost per tonne (US$) (1)(2) | 81.81                        | 67.59                        | 64.41              | 56.53              |\n\n- (1) FY2021 based on an average exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.75.\n- (2)  FY2021 excludes COVID/hyphen.uc19 related costs of US$0.91 per tonne and US$0.40 per tonne that are reported as exceptional items relating to Queensland Coal and NSWEC respectively.",

We remain focused on cost reduction and productivity initiatives, however given the ongoing uncertainty regarding restrictions on coal imports into China we are unable to provide medium-term volume and unit cost guidance.\n\nNSWEC unit costs are expected to be between US$62 and US$70 per tonne (based on an average exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.78) in FY2022 re/f.shortlecting a continued focus on higher quality products, mine plan optimisation, productivity improvements and cost reduction initiatives.\n\n## 1.17.5  Other assets\n\nDetailed below is an analysis of Other assets' /f.shortinancial and operating performance comparing FY2021 to FY2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more detailed /f.shortinancial information on our Other assets\n\nrefer to section 4.4.5\n\n## Nickel West\n\n## Key drivers of Nickel West's /f.shortinancial results\n\n## Price overview\n\nOur average realised sales price for FY2021 was US$16,250 per tonne (FY2020: US$13,860 per tonne). In FY2021, the nickel price bene/f.shortitted from positive investor sentiment amidst a strong, geographically diverse rebound in end-use demand. An announcement by a major nickel producer during the period that it intends to convert some nickel pig iron to nickel matte in Indonesia, thereby making it suitable for use in the battery supply chain, led to a brief correction in March. Prices subsequently rebounded supported by strong demand, multiregion supply disruptions and falling London Metal Exchange stocks.\n\nLonger term, we believe that nickel will be a substantial bene/f.shorticiary of the global electri/f.shortication mega-trend and that nickel sulphides will be particularly attractive. This is due to their relatively lower cost of production of battery-suitable class-1 nickel than for laterites, and the favourable position of/uni00A0integrated sulphide operations on the emission intensity curve.\n\n## Production\n\nNickel West production in FY2021 increased by 11 per cent to 89 kt re/f.shortlecting strong performance from the new mines and improved operational stability following major quadrennial maintenance shutdowns in the prior year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on individual asset production in FY2021, FY2020 and FY2019\n\nrefer to section 4.5\n\n## Financial results\n\nHigher production combined with higher average realised sales prices resulted in revenue increasing by US$356 million to US$1.5 billion in FY2021.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA for Nickel West increased by US$296 million to US$259 million in FY2021 re/f.shortlecting higher prices and volumes, and lower maintenance costs following the major quadrennial shutdowns in the prior year, as well as lower contractor costs following the transition and ramp-up of new mines. This was partially o/ffset by unfavourable exchange rate movements and the adverse impacts of the stronger nickel price on third-party concentrate purchase costs.\n\n## Potash\n\nPotash recorded an Underlying EBITDA loss of US$167 million in FY2021, and a loss of US$127 million in FY2020.\n\n## 1.17.6  Impact of changes to commodity prices\n\nThe prices we obtain for our products are a key driver of value for BHP.

These statements discuss future expectations concerning the results of assets or /f.shortinancial conditions, or provide other forward-looking information.\n\nExamples of forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report include, without/uni00A0limitation, statements describing: (i) our strategy, our values and how we de/f.shortine/uni00A0our success;\n\n(ii) the emerging uses of and our expectations regarding future demand for certain commodities, in particular copper, nickel, iron ore, metallurgical coal, steel, oil and gas and potash, and our intentions, commitments or expectations with respect to our supply of certain commodities;\n\n(iii) our expectations of a competitive advantage in certain commodities, in particular in copper, nickel and potash;\n\n(iv) the perceived synergies and other bene/f.shortits of the proposed transaction between BHP and Woodside;\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n(v) our future exploration and partnerships plans/uni00A0and the structure of our portfolio; (vi) our outlook for long-term economic growth and other macroeconomic and industry trends; (vii) our projected and expected production levels and development projects across our portfolio of assets;\n\n(viii) our reserves and resources;\n\n(ix) our plans for our major projects and related budget allocations;\n\n(x) our expectations and objectives with respect to decarbonisation, climate change resilience and timelines to achieve such objectives, including our Climate Transition Action Plan, Climate Change Adaptation Strategy and goals, targets and strategies to seek to reduce or support the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and related perceived opportunities for BHP;\n\n(xi) the assumptions, beliefs and conclusions in our climate change-related statements and strategies, including in our Climate Change Report 2020, for example, in respect of future temperatures, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, and climaterelated impacts;\n\n(xii) our commitment to generating social value;\n\n(xiii) our commitments under sustainability frameworks, standards and initiatives; (xiv) our intention to improve tailings storage management;\n\n(xv) our intention to achieve certain inclusion and diversity targets; and\n\n(xvi) our intention to achieve certain targets and outcomes with respect to Indigenous peoples.\n\nForward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and re/f.shortlect judgments, assumptions, estimates and other information available as at the date planning or scenario analysis processes.\n\nof this Annual Report and/or the date of BHP's These statements do not represent guarantees or predictions of future /f.shortinancial or operational performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control and which may cause actual results to di/ffer materially from those expressed in the statements contained in this Annual Report. BHP cautions against reliance on any forward-looking statements or guidance, including in light of the current economic climate and the signi/f.shorticant volatility, uncertainty and disruption arising in connection with COVID/hyphen.uc19.\n\nFor example, our future revenues from our assets, projects or mines described in this Annual Report will be based, in part, on the market price of the minerals, metals or petroleum produced, which may vary signi/f.shorticantly from current levels. These variations, if materially adverse, may a/ffect the timing or the feasibility of the development of a particular project, the expansion of certain facilities or mines, or the/uni00A0continuation of existing assets.\n\nOther factors that may a/ffect the actual construction or production commencement dates, revenues, costs or production output and anticipated lives of assets, mines or facilities include:\n\n(i) our ability to pro/f.shortitably produce and transport the minerals, petroleum and/or metals extracted to applicable markets;\n\n(ii) the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the market prices of the minerals, petroleum or metals we produce;\n\n(iii) activities of government authorities in the countries where we sell our products and in the countries where we are exploring or developing projects, facilities or mines, including increases in taxes;\n\n(iv) changes in environmental and other regulations;\n\n(v) the duration and severity of the COVID/hyphen.uc19 pandemic and its impact on our business;\n\n(vi) political or geopolitical uncertainty;\n\n(vii) labour unrest; and\n\n(viii) other factors identi/f.shortied in the risk factors set/uni00A0out in section 1.16.\n\nExcept as required by applicable regulations or by law, BHP does not undertake to publicly update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events.\n\nPast performance cannot be relied on as/uni00A0a/uni00A0guide to future performance.\n\n## Emissions and energy consumption data\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainty and limitations in measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and operational energy consumption under the calculation methodologies used in the preparation of such data, all GHG emissions and operational energy consumption data or references to GHG emissions and operational energy consumption volumes (including ratios or percentages) in this Annual Report are estimates. There may also be di/fferences in the manner that third parties calculate or report GHG emissions or operational energy consumption data compared to BHP, which means that third party data may not be comparable to our data. For information on how we calculate our GHG emissions and operational energy consumption data, see our Methodology tab in our ESG Standards and Databook.\n\nThe Strategic Report is made in accordance with a resolution of the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKen MacKenzie\n\nChair\n\n2 September 2021",

        "page_content": "## 2.1  Corporate Governance Statement\n\n## 2.1.1  Chair's letter\n\n## Dear Shareholder,\n\nThis year BHP achieved some outstanding results, underpinned by strong operational performance and disciplined capital allocation. For the second consecutive year, there were no fatalities at our operated assets. We also created more value for shareholders and continued to contribute to the communities and partners who support our work.\n\n## Strategy and portfolio\n\nOur purpose is to bring people and resources together to build a better world. Our objective is to deliver sustainable long-term value and returns. We do this by owning a portfolio of world class assets in attractive commodities, operating them exceptionally well, maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation and being leaders in sustainability and creating social value.\n\nWe are proactively positioning the company for the future with a portfolio and capabilities that will enable us to grow long-term value - the commodities we supply are essential to the world now and in the future. We recently announced an investment of US$5.7 billion in the Jansen Stage 1 potash project in Canada, which opens up a new growth front for BHP. We also announced our intention to merge BHP's Petroleum business with Woodside to create a top 10 independent oil and gas company with the capability to support the world's energy needs through the/uni00A0energy transition.\n\nAs well as positioning our portfolio for future growth, we have also announced our intention to move from a Dual Listed Company with two parent entities, to a single company structure under BHP Ltd with a primary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange. We believe uni/f.shortication will make BHP more e/ff.shorticient and agile, and better position the company for continued performance and growth.\n\n## Culture and capability\n\nSuccessful delivery of our strategy relies on workforce capability and a strong culture. We believe that supporting our people's wellbeing, creating and promoting an inclusive and diverse environment for our people to work, and keeping them safe in the workplace is critically important. It is core to our values.\n\nIn FY2021, this has taken on an even greater emphasis as our workforce and their families and communities have adapted to new ways of/uni00A0working as a result of the pandemic.\n\nThis year we have created a simpler Engagement and Perception Survey that runs in 100-day culture improvement cycles. The Board regularly reviews the results of these surveys and any actions that are taken as a result. We also continue to invest in our leaders and in new talent, through programs like our BHP Operating System learning academies, Operations Services and the FutureFit Academies which have seen us recruit/uni00A0hundreds of new apprentices and trainees into our operations in Australia.\n\n## Board composition\n\nIn FY2021, we continued to renew our Board through our structured Board succession process. The Board regularly assesses its current skills and expected requirements for the/uni00A0future and uses that analysis to establish clear succession plans. In October 2020, Christine O'Reilly and Xiaoqun Clever were appointed to the Board as independent Non-executive Directors.\n\nXiaoqun Clever has more than 20 years' experience in technology with a focus on software engineering, data and analytics, cyber security and digitalisation. She held various roles with SAP SE, Ringier AG and ProSiebenSat.1 Media SE. She currently serves on the boards of Capgemini SE, In/f.shortineon Technologies AG and Amadeus IT Group SA.\n\nChristine O'Reilly has more than 30 years' experience in /f.shortinance, public policy and transformational strategy. She held various roles with GasNet Australia Group and Colonial First State Global Asset Management. She currently serves on the boards of Stockland Limited, Medibank Private Limited, Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, and will join the board of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited from November 2021.\n\nWe have also announced the appointment of Michelle Hinchli/ffe as an independent Non-executive Director from 1 March 2022. Ms Hinchli/ffe has over 30 years' experience in KPMG's /f.shortinancial services division and has spent time as a partner and member of the Board of KPMG's Australian and UK practices. She is currently the UK Chair of Audit for KPMG and will retire from KPMG prior to her appointment.\n\n3\n\n4\n\nSusan Kilsby and Anita Frew will retire as BHP Directors at the end of the 2021 Annual General Meetings (AGMs). Susan was appointed as Chair of Fortune Brands in January 2021 and Anita has joined the board of Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc and will become Chair from 1 October 2021. Both directors have stepped down due to the time commitments associated with these new chair roles. I would like to acknowledge and thank both Susan and Anita for their counsel and contribution to BHP and the Board.\n\nWe are continuing our renewal process and/uni00A0will/uni00A0look to add a further independent director in 2022.\n\n## Shareholder engagement\n\nWe are committed to communicating with our shareholders and hearing your views on the company's performance. We do this through our AGMs, shareholder forums and investor meetings where we engage with investors on/uni00A0key areas of market interest.\n\nShareholders also have the opportunity to ask questions directly of the Chief Executive O/ff.shorticer, Mike Henry, through shareholder question and answer sessions webcast through/uni00A0BHP's website.\n\nThe Board also engages with investors and considers their perspectives, including through independent survey results, and regularly seeks feedback from other external stakeholders, such as the Forum on Corporate Responsibility, to ensure it is considering all perspectives and e/ffecting positive change.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI am proud that BHP's people and operations have been resilient, and continued to create value for our shareholders, communities, customers, suppliers and partners.\n\nI look forward to our upcoming AGMs and to engaging with as many shareholders as I can, institutional and retail, throughout the year to/uni00A0hear your views and feedback.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, thank you for your continued support.\n\nKen MacKenzie Chair\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n' This year BHP achieved some outstanding results, underpinned by strong operational performance and disciplined capital allocation.

Committee agendas and papers are provided to all Directors to ensure they are aware of matters to be considered.\n\n## Board and Board Committee attendance in FY2021\n\nTable indicates the number of scheduled and ad hoc meetings attended and held during the period the Director was a member of the Board and/ or Committee.\n\n|                        | Board       | Risk and Audit   Committee   | Nomination and    Governance   Committee   | Remuneration  Committee   | Sustainability  Committee   |\n|------------------------|-------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Terry Bowen            | 12/12       | 11/11                        | 4/4 (1)                                    |                           |                             |\n| Malcolm Broomhead      | 12/12       |                              | 6/6                                        |                           | 5/5                         |\n| Xiaoqun Clever (2)     | 8/8         | 7/7                          |                                            |                           |                             |\n| Ian Cockerill          | 12/12       | 11/11                        |                                            |                           | 5/5                         |\n| Anita Frew             | 12/12       | 11/11                        |                                            | 6/6                       |                             |\n| Gary Goldberg          | 12/12       |                              | 2/2 (3)                                    | 6/6                       | 5/5                         |\n| Mike Henry             | 12/12       |                              |                                            |                           |                             |\n| Susan Kilsby           | 11/12 (4)   |                              | 4/4 (5)                                    | 6/6 (5)                   |                             |\n| Ken MacKenzie          | 12/12       |                              | 6/6                                        |                           |                             |\n| Lindsay Maxsted (6)    | 4/4         | 4/4                          |                                            |                           |                             |\n| John Mogford           | 12/12       |                              | 4/4 (7)                                    |                           | 5/5                         |\n| Christine O'Reilly (8) | 8/8         | 7/7                          | 2/2                                        | 3/3 (5)                   |                             |\n| Shriti Vadera (9)      | 4.5/4.5 (9) |                              | 2/2                                        | 2/3 (10)                  |                             |\n| Dion Weisler           | 12/12       |                              |                                            | 6/6                       |                             |\n\n- (1) Terry Bowen became a member of the Nomination and Governance Committee on 2 December 2020.\n- (2) Xiaoqun Clever became a member of the Board and the Risk and Audit Committee on 1 October 2020.\n- (3) Gary Goldberg became a member of the Nomination and Governance Committee on 1 March 2021.\n- (4) Susan Kilsby was unable to attend the Board meeting on 5 May 2021 as the meeting time was rescheduled and Susan had a pre-existing Board commitment.

The Board is actively engaged and oversees the/uni00A0development of the senior leadership team.\n\nOn 1 December 2020, David Lamont's appointment as Chief Financial O/ff.shorticer (CFO) took e/ffect. Peter Beaven continued as CFO until 30 November 2020 to provide ongoing leadership through to David's commencement, and supported David with handover into early CY2021.\n\nIn August 2020, the Board approved new roles and appointments on the ELT. Ragnar Udd became President Minerals Americas, e/ffective 1 November 2020, replacing Daniel Malchuk. Daniel continued in the role until that time and left BHP at the end of CY2020. Laura Tyler commenced in the new role of Chief Technical O/ff.shorticer on 1 September 2020. This role is an expansion of her previous position on the ELT as Chief Geoscientist. She relinquished her role as Asset President Olympic Dam. Caroline Cox became Chief Legal, Governance and External A/ffairs O/ff.shorticer, e/ffective 1 November 2020, replacing Geo/ff Healy. Geo/ff continued in the role until that time and left BHP at the end of CY2020. Johan van Jaarsveld commenced in the new role of Chief Development O/ff.shorticer on 1 September 2020.\n\n## Culture\n\nThe delivery of our strategy is predicated on our culture and capability. The Board, supported by the Committees, considers a range of qualitative and quantitative information in relation to culture at BHP and monitors and assesses culture on an ongoing basis for alignment with our strategy, purpose and values. Board and Committee papers include workforce planning in the context of COVID/hyphen.uc19, EPS results, inclusion and diversity update, Risk and Audit Committee report-outs on Our Code of Conduct investigations, the culture and capability required to execute our strategy, and culture as a part of asset reviews. Recognising our culture cannot be measured using a single number or index, a culture dashboard was developed in FY2021 to provide the Board with an additional tool to monitor our culture. The dashboard includes simple measures to provide key signposts on the health of our culture. This data combined with the EPS results provides the Board with insight on safety, engagement and enablement. The culture dashboard will be further developed over the next year to provide insight into the execution of our strategy.\n\nDirectors also gain insights into culture through direct engagement with a cross-section of the workforce where they can gain direct feedback on/uni00A0a/uni00A0range of issues, including COVID/hyphen.uc19 impacts, diversity, health, safety, environment and community (HSEC) topics and social value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information\n\nrefer to sections 1.14, 2.1.6 and 1.12\n\n## Climate change\n\nClimate change is a material governance and strategic issue and is routinely on the Board agenda, including as part of strategy discussions, portfolio reviews and investment decisions, risk management oversight and monitoring, and performance against our commitments. The Sustainability Committee assists the Board in overseeing the Group's climate change performance and governance responsibilities. The Risk and Audit Committee and Sustainability Committee assist the Board with the oversight of climate-related risk management, although the Board retains overall accountability for BHP's risk pro/f.shortile. Below the level of the Board, key management decisions are made by the CEO and management, in accordance with their delegated authority.\n\nFollowing discussion by the ELT and Sustainability Committee, in August 2020 the Board approved our medium-term target, Scope 3 emissions goals/uni00A0and the strengthening of links between executive remuneration and climate change performance measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor information regarding our approach to climate change and sustainability\n\nrefer to sections 1.13.7 and 1.13.1",

For example, HSEC updates, site visits (physical and virtual where necessary) involving engagement with community members and government, and engagement with the Forum on Corporate Responsibility. In addition, the Risk and Audit Committee receives reports on engagement with regulators. It also receives reports on material litigation and disputes with third parties and complaints raised through the speak-up hotline, EthicsPoint, which allows our workforce to raise concerns in con/f.shortidence. The strategic framework, focus on social value, our purpose and Risk Appetite Statement re/f.shortlect the signi/f.shorticance of external stakeholders in decision-making.\n\nThe Annual Report includes additional information on our stakeholders, including non-governmental organisations, how we have elicited the views/uni00A0of stakeholders and the outcomes of our engagements with stakeholders, in particular in relation to the Board's decision-making.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nrefer to sections 1.12, 1.13 and 1.14\n\n## Shareholder engagement\n\nPart of the Board's commitment to high-quality governance is expressed through the approach BHP takes to engaging and communicating with our shareholders. As part of our investor relations program to facilitate e/ffective two-way communication with investors, the Board uses formal and informal communication channels to understand and take into account the views of shareholders. BHP provides information about itself and its governance to/uni00A0investors via its website at bhp.com.\n\n## Investor engagement in FY2021\n\n## Chair investor meetings\n\nThe Chair regularly meets with investors to discuss Board priorities and seek shareholder feedback.\n\n## FY2021 activity\n\nVirtual meetings were held in July 2020 between the Chair and investors in Australia, the US, the UK and mainland Europe, with additional meetings held in June 2021. The Chair also held a UK Virtual Shareholder Forum with the CEO in September 2020 to allow shareholders to ask questions in advance of the AGMs. This was arranged after consultation with the UK Shareholders' Association and ShareSoc.\n\n## . Live webcasts and Q&A sessions\n\nProvides a forum to update shareholders on results or other key announcements.\n\n## FY2021 activity\n\nAnnual and half-year results, as well as key announcements are webcast and the materials are made available on our website. The CEO held a shareholder question and answer session in August 2020 via webcast in relation to BHP's FY2020 performance.\n\n## Presentations and brie/f.shortings\n\nPresentation materials are set out on the BHP website.\n\n## FY2021 activity\n\nPresentations delivered relating to our climate change strategy in September 2020, cultural heritage in October 2020, decarbonising steel in November 2020 and/uni00A0tailings storage facilities in June 2021.\n\n## Direct engagement\n\nProvides a conduit to enable the Board and its Committees to be up to date with investor expectations and continuously improve the governance processes of BHP. We also engage with other capital providers, for example, through meetings with bondholders.\n\n## FY2021 activity\n\nThe CEO, CFO, senior management and Investor Relations team held virtual meetings with investors worldwide, including: Australia, Canada, Germany, Hong Kong SAR (China), Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Africa, Sweden, United Arab Emirates, the UK and the US. Topics covered include corporate governance and ESG matters, strategy, /f.shortinance and operating performance.\n\nWe engaged with investors on cultural heritage issues, including the withdrawn shareholder resolution and our updated approach. This included a/uni00A0number of presentations and investor one-on-one meetings through the /f.short irst/uni00A0half of FY2021 to set out the detail of our approach to cultural heritage both in the Pilbara and worldwide.\n\nWe engaged regularly with the Climate Action 100+ lead investors and the broader investor group of the CA100+ on a range of decarbonisation and emissions related topics. We also engaged with the Transparency Pathway Initiative and FTSE Russell about their methodologies relating to the transition and approach to mined commodities.\n\n## Annual General Meetings\n\nOur AGMs provide an opportunity for all investors to question and engage with the Board.\n\n## FY2021 activity\n\nDue to COVID/hyphen.uc19 restrictions, the BHP Group Limited AGM for FY2020 was held as a virtual meeting and the BHP Group Plc AGM for FY2020 was held as a closed meeting. A virtual forum for BHP Group Plc shareholders was held in September 2020 to provide an opportunity to hear from the Chair and CEO and/uni00A0to/uni00A0ask questions via a live text facility. BHP Group Plc shareholders were also invited to attend the BHP Group Limited AGM virtually.\n\nThe CEO had a series of meetings with the CEOs and chief investment o/ff.shorticers of major investors globally to discuss a range of topics including decarbonisation and the criticality of minerals and metals to the transition.\n\nIn addition, we engaged with a range of ESG data providers about their methodologies and responded to enquiries on topics including cultural heritage,/uni00A0industry associations, thermal coal, decarbonisation, Scope 3 emissions, diversity and inclusion, tailings dams, Samarco, non-operated joint/uni00A0ventures, biodiversity, water stewardship and COVID/hyphen.uc19.\n\nThe Risk and Audit Committee considered and oversaw management work in relation to a letter from the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) setting out 'investor expectations for Paris-aligned accounts'.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee also engages with investors on remunerationrelated matters. The Chair of the Remuneration Committee wrote an open letter to shareholders and proxy advisers in September 2020, summarising key/uni00A0aspects of BHP's FY2020 remuneration outcomes and welcoming investor/uni00A0feedback. This letter was published on BHP's website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInformation on our AGMs is available at bhp.com/meetings\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4",

Shareholders can contact us at any time through our Investor Relations team, with contact details available at bhp.com. In addition, shareholders can communicate with us and our registrar electronically.\n\nWe facilitate and encourage shareholder participation at our AGMs. These meetings provide an update for shareholders on our performance and o/ffer an opportunity for shareholders to ask questions and vote. Before an AGM, shareholders are provided with all material information in BHP's possession relevant to their decision on whether or not to elect or re-elect a Director.\n\nProceedings at shareholder meetings are webcast live from our website. Copies of the speeches delivered by the Chair and CEO at the AGMs are released to the relevant stock exchanges and posted on our website. A summary of proceedings and the outcome of voting on the items of business are released to the relevant stock exchanges and posted on our website as soon as they are available. The External Auditor will also be available to answer questions at the AGMs.\n\nAt our AGMs in 2020, resolution 25 (a shareholder-requisitioned resolution to suspend memberships of industry associations that are involved in COVID/hyphen.uc19-related advocacy that is inconsistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement) received the support of 22 per cent of votes cast.\n\nThe key messages received from engagement with shareholders include:\n\n- -  an emphasis that BHP constructively in/f.shortluence its trade associations to further enhance the global energy transition\n- -  ensuring the COVID/hyphen.uc19 pandemic was not used (or seen to be used) as a rationale by associations to impede progress on alignment with the Paris Agreement goals and that the economic recovery measures being considered present a unique opportunity to accelerate clean energy innovation\n- -  enhancing transparency on the alignment between the policy positions held by BHP and those of industry associations of which BHP is a member is/uni00A0important but not su/ff.shorticient. If an industry association is advocating for policy changes inconsistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement, companies must take tangible action to drive consistency\n\nWe are con/f.shortident our existing processes, combined with the reforms outlined below, provide strengthened oversight over industry association advocacy and will help ensure our commitment to responsible and constructive advocacy is shared by the associations of which we are a member.\n\nPrior to the 2020 AGMs, BHP announced a series of industry association reforms, including a new set of Global Climate Policy Standards (applicable to BHP in its direct advocacy and also to the associations of which we are a member) and disclosure enhancements, such as publishing a list of material association memberships (including membership fees) on our website. Since the AGMs, BHP has continued to work to implement the reforms/uni00A0announced in August 2020. This has included:\n\n- -  working with the minerals sector associations of which BHP is a member in Australia (i.e. the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) and the various statebased minerals sector associations) to develop and agree an advocacy protocol. This protocol delineates the policy areas on which the associations will advocate, having regard to their jurisdictional responsibilities\n- -  working with the key associations of which BHP is a member in Australia (i.e. the MCA, the various state-based minerals sector associations, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA) and the Business Council of Australia (BCA)) to develop plans outlining their expected advocacy priorities and activities for the coming year. These plans are now available on the websites of the respective associations or will/uni00A0soon be available pending board approval by the relevant associations\n- -  implementing BHP's new model of disclosing material departures from our Global Climate Policy Standards in 'real time' on the BHP website\n\nBHP has also played an active role in shaping the policy advocacy of its industry associations. This has included working with other members to:\n\n- -  change the American Petroleum Institute's position on methane regulation and carbon pricing\n- -  update the APPEA's climate change policy principles (which now call for Australia to achieve net zero emissions by 2050)\n- -  enable the BCA to provide in-principle support for the Climate Change (National Framework for Adaptation and Mitigation) Bill 2020 that was introduced before the Australian Parliament in November 2020\n\nWe will be conducting our next industry association review in CY2022. Consistent with BHP's culture of continuous improvement, we will work to/uni00A0strengthen the review process. More information on our approach to industry associations is available at bhp.com.",

The Board considers e/ffective workforce engagement a key element of its governance and oversight role.\n\nThe Board has arrangements in place for managing workforce engagement. The Board and its Committees receive information related to the workforce through a range of channels, including direct engagement at Board and Committee meetings and site visits, the Employee Perception Survey (EPS) /f.short indings, culture dashboard insights, gender pay gap reports and updates from the Chief Executive O/ff.shorticer and the Chief People O/ff.shorticer.\n\nAlongside section 1.14, the table below further describes the ways the Board engaged with our workforce in FY2021 and how workforce considerations impacted key decisions.\n\nHaving reviewed these workforce engagement arrangements in FY2021, the Board considers these arrangements to be e/ffective as they enable the Board to hear /f.shortirst-hand from a cross-section of the workforce and to engage with them interactively (e.g. during site visits and Board and Committee meetings), with the opportunity to consider the feedback received in subsequent Board discussions.\n\n## Workforce engagement practices\n\n## Site visits\n\nFor more information refer to section 2.1.9\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDirectors participated in site visits (many of these were virtual in FY2021 due to COVID/hyphen.uc19 travel restrictions) to engage directly with a crosssection of the workforce.\n\nThese engagements deliberately included a cross-section of sta/ff in various regions and provide insight into matters that are front of mind for/uni00A0Directors and the workforce.\n\n## Board and Committee meetings\n\nDirectors hear from employees, up to several levels below the CEO, at each Board and Committee meeting. Topics raised by employees include the health and safety of our people, culture, ethics and compliance, workforce relations, sexual assault and sexual harassment, response to COVID/hyphen.uc19, our purpose, social value, conduct concerns and diversity.\n\n## EthicsPoint\n\nFor more information on refer to sections 1.13.6 and 2.1.15\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMembers of our workforce are able to raise matters of concern through our 24-hour speak-up helpline, EthicsPoint.\n\nThis helps to ensure Board oversight of culture and management response to serious conduct contrary to Our Charter and Our Code of Conduct.\n\n## Employee survey results and culture dashboard\n\nMetrics from the EPS and culture dashboard provide Directors with insight into our culture and areas of focus, including where we are lagging in/uni00A0certain measures.\n\nThe EPS was redesigned in FY2021 to include more targeted questions and a new survey platform to provide leaders with greater insight into the key metrics related to safety, engagement and enablement, which were identi/f.shortied as critical foundations for our performance culture. The culture dashboard was also developed in FY2021 to provide key signposts on the health of our culture.\n\n## Management engagement through webcasts, Q&A sessions and emails\n\nManagement regularly engages with the workforce through a range of formal and informal channels, including webcasts, live Q&A sessions and emails from the CEO and other ELT members. Live Q&A sessions were particularly helpful in providing an opportunity for employees to ask/uni00A0questions of our leaders and receive responses in real time.",

The Board will/uni00A0comprise Directors who have proven past performance and the level of business, executive and non-executive experience required to:\n\n- -  provide the breadth and depth of understanding necessary to e/ffectively create long-term shareholder value\n- -  protect and promote the interests of BHP and its social licence to operate\n- -  ensure the talent, capability and culture of BHP to support the long-term delivery of our strategy\n\n## Attributes and commitment to role\n\nAll Directors are expected to comply with Our Code of Conduct , act with integrity, lead by example and promote the desired culture.\n\nThe Board believes each Non-executive Director has demonstrated the attributes of su/ff.shorticient time to undertake the responsibilities of the role; honesty and integrity; and a preparedness to question, challenge and critique throughout the year through their participation in Board meetings, as well as the other activities that they have undertaken in their roles.\n\nIn accordance with provision 15 of the UK Code, during FY2021 the Board considered Ken MacKenzie's appointment as a part-time adviser at Barrenjoey and approved it on the basis that it did not consider it adversely impacted his role or commitment to BHP. In particular, the Board noted it was not an executive role and Mr MacKenzie committed to the Board that BHP would remain Mr MacKenzie's number one priority. It was also agreed that Barrenjoey will not advise BHP and that Mr MacKenzie himself will not advise on transactions or advise BHP competitors or our signi/f.shorticant customers or suppliers.\n\n## Skills matrix\n\nThe Board skills matrix identi/f.shorties the skills and experience the Board needs for the next period of BHP's development, considering BHP's circumstances and the changing external environment as referred to above.\n\nThe Board collectively possesses all the skills and experience set out in the skills matrix, and each Director satis/f.shorties the Board requirements and attributes discussed above.

The Board also seeks the input of management and other independent advisers. This equips them to consider potential implications of climate change on BHP and its operational capacity, as well as understand the nature of the debate and the international policy response as it develops. In addition, there is a deep understanding of systemic risk and the potential impacts on our portfolio.\n\nThe Board has taken measures designed to ensure its decisions are informed by climate change science and expert advisers. The Board seeks the input of management (including Dr Fiona Wild, our Vice President Sustainability and Climate Change) and other independent advisers. In addition, our Forum on Corporate Responsibility (which includes Don Henry, former CEO of the Australian Conservation Foundation and Changhua Wu, former Greater China Director, the Climate Group) advises operational management teams and engages with the Sustainability Committee and the Board as appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information\n\nrefer to section 1.13.7\n\n## Board tenure and diversity (as at 30 June 2021)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.1.8  Board evaluation\n\nThe Board is committed to transparency in assessing the performance of Directors. The Board conducts regular evaluations of its performance, the performance of its Committees, the Group Chair, Directors and the governance processes that support the Board's work.\n\nThe evaluation considers the balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Group and the Board, its diversity, including gender diversity, and how the Board works together as a unit.\n\nAn evaluation was conducted during the year in accordance with this process. More information is provided below.\n\n## Director review\n\nIn FY2021, an assessment was conducted of Directors' performance with the assistance of an external service provider (Lintstock). Lintstock does not have any other connection with the Group or individual Directors.\n\nThe assessment of Directors focused on the contribution of each Director to the work of the Board and its Committees, and the expectations of Directors as set out in BHP's governance framework. In addition, the assessment focused on how each Director contributes to Board cohesion and e/ffective relationships with fellow Directors, commits the time required to ful/f.shortil their role and e/ffectively performs their responsibilities. Directors were asked to comment on areas where their fellow Directors contribute the greatest value and on potential areas for development. With the introduction of virtual Board and Committee meetings (as a consequence of COVID/hyphen.uc19 health and safety protocols), the assessment also focused on the e/ffectiveness of the Board's virtual interactions.\n\nLintstock provided feedback received to the Chair, which was then discussed with Directors. Feedback relating to the Chair was discussed with the Chair by the Senior Independent Director. As a result of these outcomes, the review supported the Board's decision to endorse those Directors standing for re-election.\n\n## Committee assessments\n\nFollowing an assessment of its work, each Committee concluded that it had met its terms of reference in FY2021.\n\n## External Board review\n\nThe Board conducted an external evaluation in FY2019 using Consilium Board Review, which considered Board, Committee and Chair e/ffectiveness, and assessed the Directors' contributions. The review was concluded in FY2020 and the Nomination and Governance Committee considered the status of implementation of the review /f.shortindings in FY2021.\n\nIn accordance with the UK Code, the Board intends to conduct an external Board review in FY2022.",

Diversity is key to ensuring the Board and its Committees have the right blend of perspectives so that the Board oversees BHP e/ffectively for shareholders. In FY2021, we adopted an Inclusion and Diversity Position Statement, which sets out our diversity policy in relation to the Board, senior management and our workforce, and our priorities to accelerate the development of a more inclusive work environment and enhanced overall workplace diversity. The Inclusion and Diversity Position Statement is available at bhp.com/careers/diversity-and-inclusion/our-approach/ and is summarised in section 1.12.\n\nAs described in our Inclusion and Diversity Position Statement, our aspiration is to achieve gender balance on our Board, among our senior executives and across our workforce by CY2025. Our aspiration includes a /f.shortixed target of maintaining the level of Board diversity above 33 per cent, which we achieved last year and we continue to maintain. We therefore satisfy the guidance of having at least 30 per cent of Directors of each gender in accordance with the ASX Fourth Edition and the target set by the Hampton-Alexander Review in the United Kingdom for all FTSE 100 Boards to have at/uni00A0least 33 per cent female representation by the end of CY2020.\n\nWe also welcome the /f.shortinal Parker Report into ethnic diversity of UK boards and continue to seek additional ethnic diversity on our Board and throughout BHP. Our Board meets the target of having 'at least one Director of colour by 2021' as recommended by the Parker Review.\n\nIn accordance with the UK Code, our gender diversity among senior management (de/f.shortined as the ELT plus the Company Secretary and their direct reports) was 36 per cent.\n\nPart of the Board's role continues to be to consider and approve BHP's measurable objectives for workforce diversity each /f.shortinancial year and to oversee our progress in achieving those objectives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, including our progress against our FY2021 measurable objectives and our employee pro/f.shortile more generally refer to section 1.12\n\n## Evaluation and training\n\n- -  Board evaluation and Director development\n- -  2021 training and development program\n- -  Director induction\n\n## Corporate governance practices\n\n- -  Independence of Non-executive Directors\n- -  Authorisation of situations of actual or potential con/f.shortlict\n- -  Crisis management",

A talent deep dive is conducted by the Board at least once a year to evaluate these pipelines, including the diversity of the pipeline.\n\nSenior management succession is viewed from a /f.shortive-year perspective that considers the readiness of successors across time horizons, contexts and future capability demands. Select Board members are involved in the interview process for executive-level appointments one level below the CEO, and occasionally for roles two levels below the CEO. Appropriate checks are undertaken before appointing a member of the ELT. BHP has a written agreement with each ELT member setting out the terms of their appointment. For more information about CEO and ELT succession, refer to section 2.1.5.\n\n## External recruitment specialists\n\nThe Committee retained the services of external recruitment specialists. Russell Reynolds and MWM Consulting assisted with Non-executive Director candidate searches during FY2021. These recruitment specialists do not have any connection with the Group or any Director.\n\n## Director induction, training and development\n\nUpon appointment, each new Non-executive Director undertakes an induction program tailored to their needs.\n\nFollowing the induction program, Non-executive Directors participate in continuous improvement activities (training and development program), which are overseen by the Nomination and Governance Committee. The training and development program covers matters of a business nature, including environmental, social and governance matters and provides updates on BHP's assets, commodities, geographies and markets. Programs are designed and periodically reviewed to maximise e/ffectiveness, and the results of Director performance evaluations are incorporated into these programs.",

Board Committees review and agree their needs for more brie/f.shortings. The bene/f.shortit of this approach is that induction and learning opportunities can be tailored to Directors' Committee memberships, as well as the Board's speci/f.shortic areas of focus. This approach also ensures a coordinated process on succession planning, Board renewal, training and development and Committee composition. These processes are all relevant to the Nomination and Governance Committee's role in identifying appropriate Nonexecutive Director candidates.\n\n## Independence\n\nThe Board is committed to ensuring a majority of Directors are independent.\n\nThe Board has adopted a policy that it uses to determine the independence of its Directors. This determination is carried out upon appointment, annually and at any other time where the change in circumstances of a Director warrant reconsideration. The Board con/f.shortirms that it considers all of the current Non-executive Directors, including the Chair, to be independent of management and free from any business relationship or other circumstance that could materially interfere with the exercise of objective, unfettered or independent judgement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA copy of the policy on Independence of Directors is available at bhp.com/governance\n\n## Tenure\n\nAt the end of FY2021, Malcolm Broomhead, who was appointed in March 2010, had served on the Board for more than nine years. In light of the retirement of both Susan Kilsby and Anita Frew at the end of the 2021 AGMs, the Board has requested that Mr Broomhead seek re-election at the 2021 AGMs for a further year. Mr Broomhead would step down from the Sustainability Committee and Nomination and Governance Committee following the AGMs but remain on the Board. The Board supports Mr Broomhead's re-election given his extensive knowledge of BHP and the mining and resources sector and the proposed corporate transaction that the Group is undertaking at this time. The Board does not believe his tenure interferes with his ability to act in the best interests of BHP. The Board believes he continues to demonstrate strong independence of character and judgement, and has not formed associations with management (or others) that might compromise his ability to exercise independent judgement or act in the best interests of the Group. The Board has been undergoing a process of renewal and, recognising the importance of continuity on the Board and Mr Broomhead's expertise, considers his continued service to be in the best interests of shareholders.\n\n## Relationships and associations\n\nSome of the Directors hold or have previously held positions in companies that BHP has commercial relationships with. Those positions and companies are listed in the Director pro/f.shortiles in section 2.1.2 and in past Annual Reports. The Board has assessed the relationships between the Group and the companies in which our Directors hold or held positions and has concluded that the relationships do not interfere with the Directors' exercise of objective, unfettered or independent judgement or their ability to act in the best interests of BHP.\n\nFor example, Mr Broomhead was a Director of Orica Limited (a company BHP has commercial dealings with) during FY2021, and Mr Cockerill was also a Director of Orica until August 2019. Orica provides commercial explosives, blasting systems and mineral processing chemicals and services to the mining and resources industry, among others. Mr Cockerill was appointed to the Orica Board in 2010 (prior to his appointment to the BHP Board) and Mr Broomhead was appointed to the Orica Board in 2016 (after his appointment to the BHP Board). At the time of Mr Broomhead's appointment to the Board of Orica, and at the time of Mr Cockerill's appointment to the Board of BHP, the BHP Board assessed the relationship between BHP and Orica and determined (and remains satis/f.shortied) that Mr Broomhead and Mr Cockerill were (and Mr Broomhead remains during FY2021) able to apply objective, unfettered and independent judgement and to act in the best interests of BHP.\n\n## Con/f.shortlicts of interest\n\nBHP Group Plc's Articles of Association allow the Directors to authorise con/f.shortlicts and potential con/f.shortlicts where appropriate. A procedure operates to ensure the disclosure of con/f.shortlicts and for the consideration and, if appropriate, the authorisation of those con/f.shortlicts by non-con/f.shortlicted Directors. The Nomination and Governance Committee supports the Board in this process by reviewing requests from Directors for authorisation of situations of/uni00A0actual or potential con/f.shortlict and making recommendations to the Board. It also regularly reviews any situations of actual or potential con/f.shortlict that have previously been authorised by the Board and makes recommendations on whether the authorisation remains appropriate. In addition, in accordance with Australian law, if a situation arises for consideration where a Director has a material personal interest, the a/ffected Director takes no part in decisionmaking unless authorised by non-interested Directors. Provisions for Directors' interests are set out in the Constitution of BHP Group Limited.",

The RAC considered these certi/f.shortications when recommending the Financial Statements to the Board for approval.\n\n## Signi/f.shorticant issues\n\nIn addition to the Group's key judgements and estimates disclosed throughout the FY2021 Financial Statements, the Committee also considered the following signi/f.shorticant issues relating to /f.shortinancial reporting:\n\n## Divestment of interests in certain of the Group's assets\n\nThe Committee examined management's review of impairment triggers and potential impairment charges for certain of the Group's assets that were subject to divestment processes throughout the year. While the processes were underway, prior to receipt of bids, considerations were consistent with the approach to the Group's other long-term assets as presented below.\n\nThe Committee concurred with management's conclusion on signi/f.shorticant impairments recognised in relation to New South Wales Energy Coal and Cerrej\u00f3n, including associated deferred tax assets.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed other potential Financial Statements impacts, including classi/f.shortication and disclosure as assets held for sale and Discontinued operations.\n\nConclusions from these reviews are re/f.shortlected in notes 3 'Exceptional items', 13 'Impairment of non-current assets' and 31 'Investments accounted for/uni00A0using the equity method' in section 3.\n\n## Carrying value of other long-term assets\n\nThe assessment of carrying values of long-term assets uses a number of signi/f.shorticant judgements and estimates.\n\nThe Committee examined management's review of impairment triggers and potential impairment charges or reversals for the Group's cash generating units.\n\nSpeci/f.shortic consideration was given to market conditions for the Group's commodities, including the impacts of climate change, along with key assumptions underpinning asset valuations. Assumptions include the most recent short, medium and long-term price forecasts, expected production volumes and updated development plans, operating and capital costs, discount rates and other market indicators of fair value.\n\nThe Committee concurred with management's conclusion on the signi/f.shorticant impairment recognised in relation to the Group's Potash assets, including associated deferred tax assets, and that no impairment reversals were appropriate.\n\nThe results of the Olympic Dam impairment assessment were reviewed and the Committee concurred with management that no impairment was required.\n\nConclusions from these reviews are re/f.shortlected in note 13 'Impairment of non-current assets' in section 3.\n\n## Climate change in /f.shortinancial reporting\n\nWhile the Group's understanding of evolving climate risks continues to develop, the potential /f.shortinancial implications, along with appropriate disclosure, are an area of focus for the Committee.\n\nThe Committee was informed of and acknowledged global trends, including increased disclosure within /f.shortinancial statements and more broadly. Speci/f.shortically, the Committee considered a request from the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) for Paris-aligned /f.shortinancial statements and disclosure of material climate risks and the potential impacts to /f.shortinancial statements.\n\nThe Committee considered /f.shortinancial statement disclosures and how the Group's greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments and climate change scenarios, including those aligned with the Paris Agreement goals, are re/f.shortlected in the Group's key judgements and estimates used in the preparation of the Group's FY2021 /f.shortinance statements. This included consideration of portfolio impacts, demand for the Group's commodities and associated price outlooks, costs of decarbonisation and Scope 3 emissions considerations. Speci/f.shortic focus was also given to the potential impact on/uni00A0impairment assessments and the expected timing and cost of closure activities.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the approach proposed by management to provide additional disclosure in relation to the potential /f.shortinancial statement impacts of climate change, including under a Paris-aligned 1.5\u00b0C scenario.\n\nThe Committee, recognising the evolving nature of climate change risks and responses, concluded that climate change has been appropriately considered by management in key judgements and estimates and concurred with the disclosures proposed by management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nrefer to the Basis of Preparation in section 3 and the Climate change risk factor in section 1.16",

Samarco is jointly owned by BHP Brasil and Vale S.A.\n\nBHP Brasil's 50 per cent interest in Samarco is accounted for as an equity accounted joint venture investment.\n\n## Samarco's provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nThe Committee reviewed updates to matters relating to the Samarco dam failure, including developments on existing and new legal proceedings, judicial reorganisation and changes to the estimated costs of remediation and compensation.\n\nBHP Brasil's loss from Equity Accounted Investments includes impairments arising from working capital funding provided to Samarco and revisions to/uni00A0the Samarco dam failure and Germano decommissioning provisions during the year ended 30 June 2021.\n\nPotential direct /f.shortinancial impacts to BHP Brasil\n\nThe Committee considered:\n\n- -  changes to the estimated cost of remediation and compensatory programs under the Framework Agreement\n- -  developments in existing and new legal proceedings, including judicial reorganisation, on the provision related to the Samarco dam failure and related disclosures\n- -  the provisions recognised and contingent liabilities disclosed by BHP Brasil or other BHP entities\n\nBased on currently available information, the Committee concluded that the accounting for the equity investment in Samarco, the provision recognised by BHP Brasil (including the decommissioning of the Germano tailings dam complex) and contingent liabilities disclosed in the Group's Financial Statements are appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nrefer to note 4 'Signi/f.shorticant events - Samarco dam failure' in section 3\n\n## Closure and rehabilitation provisions\n\nDetermining the closure and rehabilitation provision is a complex area requiring signi/f.shorticant judgement and estimates, particularly given the timing and quantum of future costs, the unique nature of each site and the long timescales involved.\n\nThe Committee considered the various changes in estimates for closure and rehabilitation provisions recognised during the year, including a reduction to the discount rates applied.\n\nSpeci/f.shortic consideration was given to ongoing and recently completed study, survey and characterisation activity, changes to current cost estimates and the expected timing of closure activities.

KPMG were the auditors of BHP Group prior to Ernst & Young (EY). There were no key /f.shortindings arising from the AQRT's review. The review /f.shortindings, which were not considered to be signi/f.shorticant, were discussed with KPMG. The company made EY aware of the/uni00A0actions that KPMG had proposed to implement had they still been the auditors of the company and if similar circumstances were to prevail.\n\n## Review of BHP Group's Annual Report and Accounts\n\nThe UK FRC carried out a review of the Group's published Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2020. This review considered compliance with reporting requirements and, given the inherent limitations of the review, provided no assurance that the Annual Report and Accounts were correct in all material respects. There were no exchanges of substantive correspondence as a result of this review and the FRC con/f.shortirmed, based on the review performed, it had no questions or queries that it wished to raise.\n\n## External Auditor\n\nThe RAC manages the relationship with the External Auditor on behalf of the Board. It considers the independence and reappointment of the External Auditor each year, as well as remuneration and other terms of engagement and makes a recommendation to the Board.\n\n## Audit tender and transition\n\nBHP con/f.shortirms that during FY2021, it was in compliance with the provisions of The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.\n\nConsistent with the UK and EU requirements in regard to audit /f.shortirm tender and rotation, the Committee conducted an audit tender process during FY2017 to appoint a new external auditor to replace KPMG, resulting in the appointment of EY in 2019.\n\n## Evaluation of External Auditor and external audit process\n\nThe RAC evaluates the objectivity and independence of the External Auditor and the quality and e/ffectiveness of the external audit arrangements. As part of this evaluation, the RAC considers speci/f.shortied criteria, including delivering value to shareholders and BHP, and also assesses the adequacy of/uni00A0the external audit process with emphasis on quality, e/ffectiveness and performance. It does so through a range of means, including:\n\n- -  the Committee considers the External Audit Plan, in particular to gain assurance that it is tailored to re/f.shortlect changes in circumstances from the prior year\n- -  throughout the year, the Committee meets with the audit partners, particularly the lead Australian and UK audit engagement partners, without management present\n- -  following the completion of the audit, the Committee considers the quality of the External Auditor's performance drawing on survey results. The survey is based on a two-way feedback model where the BHP and EY teams assess each other against a range of criteria. The criteria against which the BHP team evaluates EY's performance include ethics and integrity, insight, service quality, communication, reporting and responsiveness\n- -  reviewing the terms of engagement of the External Auditor\n- -  discussing with the audit engagement partners the skills and experience of the broader audit team\n- -  reviewing audit quality inspection reports on EY published by the UK Financial Reporting Council in considering the e/ffectiveness of the audit\n\nIn addition, the RAC reviews the integrity, independence and objectivity of the External Auditor and assesses whether there is any element of the relationship that impairs or appears to impair the External Auditor's judgement or independence. The External Auditor also certi/f.shorties its independence to/uni00A0the RAC.\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nAlthough the External Auditor does provide some non-audit services, the objectivity and independence of the External Auditor are safeguarded through restrictions on the provision of these services with some services prohibited from being undertaken.\n\n## Pre-approved services\n\nThe RAC has adopted a policy entitled 'Provision of Audit and Other Services by the External Auditor' covering the RAC's pre-approval policies and procedures to maintain the independence of the External Auditor, which re/f.shortlects the requirements for External Auditors contained in the Ethical Standards published by the UK Financial Reporting Council.\n\nThe categories of 'pre-approved' services are:\n\n- -  Audit services - work that constitutes the agreed scope of the statutory audit and includes the statutory audits of BHP and its entities (including interim reviews). This category also includes work that is reasonably related to the performance of an audit or review and is a logical extension of the/uni00A0audit or review scope. The RAC monitors the audit services engagements and if necessary, approves any changes in terms and conditions resulting from changes in audit scope, Group structure or other relevant events.\n- -  Audit-related and other assurance services - work that is outside the scope of the statutory audit but is consistent with the role of the external statutory auditor, is of an assurance or compliance nature, is work the External Auditor must or is best placed to undertake and is permissible under/uni00A0the relevant applicable standard.",

In addition, any engagement for other services with a value over US$100,000, even if listed as a 'pre-approved' service, requires the approval of the RAC.\n\nAll engagements for other services whether 'pre-approved' or not and regardless of the dollar value involved are reported quarterly to the RAC. While not prohibited by BHP's policy, any proposed non-audit engagement of the External Auditor relating to internal control (such as a review of internal controls) requires speci/f.shortic prior approval from the RAC. With the exception of the external audit of BHP's Financial Statements, any engagement identi/f.shortied that contains an internal control-related element is not considered to be pre-approved. In addition, while the categories of 'pre-approved' services include a list of certain pre-approved services, the use of the External Auditor to perform these services will always be subject to our overriding governance practices as articulated in the policy.\n\nIn addition, the RAC did not approve any services during the year ended 30 June 2021 pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2/hyphen.uc01 of SEC Regulation S/hyphen.ucX (provision of services other than audit).\n\nFees paid to BHP's external auditor during FY2021 for audit and other services were US$15.5 million, of which 77 per cent comprised audit fees (including in relation to SOX matters), 11 per cent for audit-related fees and 12 per cent for all other fees. No fees were paid in relation to tax services. Details of the fees paid are set out in note 36 'Auditor's remuneration' in section 3.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our policy on Provision of Audit and Other Services by the External Auditor is available at\n\nbhp.com/governance\n\n## Business Risk and Audit Committees\n\nBusiness Risk and Audit Committees (Business RACs), covering each asset group, assist management in providing the information to enable the RAC to ful/f.shortil its responsibilities. They are management committees and perform an important monitoring function in the governance of BHP. Meetings take place annually as part of our /f.shortinancial governance framework.\n\nAs management committees, the appropriate member of the ELT participates, but the Committee is chaired by a member of the RAC. Each Committee also includes the Group Financial Controller, the Chief Risk O/ff.shorticer and the Group Assurance O/ff.shorticer.\n\nSigni/f.shorticant operational and risk matters raised at Business RAC meetings are reported to the RAC by management.\n\n## Risk function\n\nThe Risk function's role is to create and maintain the Group's Risk Framework, and to support, verify, oversee and provide insight on the e/ffective application of the Risk Framework for all risks, including strategic, operational and emerging risks.\n\nThe RAC assists the Board with the oversight of risk management, although the Board retains accountability for BHP's risk pro/f.shortile. In addition, the Board requires the CEO to implement a system of control for identifying and managing risk. The Directors, through the RAC, review the systems that have been established, regularly review the e/ffectiveness of those systems and monitor that necessary actions have been taken to remedy any signi/f.shorticant failings or weaknesses identi/f.shortied from that review. The RAC regularly reports to the Board to enable the Board to review our Risk Framework at least annually to con/f.shortirm that the Risk Framework continues to be sound and that BHP is operating with regard to the risk appetite set by the Board. A review was undertaken during FY2021, resulting in re/f.shortinements to BHP's Risk Framework. For more information, refer to section 1.9.\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nThe Internal Audit function is carried out by the Internal Audit and Advisory team (IAA). IAA provides assurance on whether risk management, internal control and governance processes are adequate and functioning. The Internal Audit function is independent of the External Auditor. The RAC evaluates and, if thought /f.shortit, approves the terms of reference of IAA, the sta/ff.shorting levels and its scope of work to ensure it is appropriate in light of the key risks we face. It also reviews and approves the annual internal audit plan and monitors and reviews the e/ffectiveness of the internal audit activities.\n\nThe RAC approves the appointment and dismissal of the Group Assurance O/ff.shorticer and assesses their performance, independence and objectivity. During FY2021, the Group Assurance O/ff.shorticer reported directly to the RAC, and functional oversight of IAA was provided by the Chief Legal, Governance/uni00A0and External A/ffairs O/ff.shorticer.\n\n## E/ffectiveness of systems of internal control and risk management (RAC and Board)\n\nIn delegating authority to the CEO, the Board has established CEO limits, outlined in the Board Governance Document . Limits on the CEO's authority require the CEO to ensure there is a system of control in place for identifying and managing risk in BHP. Through the RAC, the Directors regularly review these systems for their e/ffectiveness. These reviews include assessing whether processes continue to meet evolving external governance requirements.\n\nThe RAC oversees and reviews the internal controls and risk management systems (including procedures, processes and systems for, among other things, budgeting and forecasting, provisions, /f.shortinancial controls, /f.shortinancial reporting and reporting of reserves and resources, compliance, preventing fraud and serious breaches of business conduct and whistle-blowing procedures, protecting information and data systems, and operational e/ffectiveness of the Business RAC structures). Any material breaches of Our Code of Conduct , including breaches of our anti-bribery and corruption requirements, as well as any material incidents reported under our 'speaking up with con/f.shortidence' requirements are reported quarterly to the RAC by/uni00A0the/uni00A0Chief Compliance O/ff.shorticer. These reports are then communicated to the Board through the report-out process",

        "page_content": "## 2.1  Corporate Governance Statement continued\n\nDuring FY2021, management presented an assessment of the material risks facing BHP and the level of e/ffectiveness of risk management over the material business risks. The reviews were overseen by the RAC, with /f.shortindings and recommendations reported to the Board. In addition to considering key risks facing BHP, the Board assessed the e/ffectiveness of internal controls over key risks identi/f.shortied through the work of the Board Committees.\n\nHaving carried out a review during FY2021, the Board is satis/f.shortied with the e/ffectiveness of risk management and internal control systems.\n\n## Management's assessment of internal control over /f.shortinancial reporting\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over /f.shortinancial reporting (as de/f.shortined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act).\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over /f.shortinancial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and, even when determined to be e/ffective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to /f.shortinancial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of e/ffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, the e/ffectiveness of BHP's internal control over /f.short inancial reporting was evaluated based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Controls - Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of the Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that internal control over/uni00A0/f.shortinancial reporting was e/ffective as at 30 June 2021. There were no material weaknesses in BHP's internal controls over /f.shortinancial reporting identi/f.shortied/uni00A0by management as at 30 June 2021.\n\nBHP has engaged our independent registered public accounting /f.shortirm, EY, to issue an audit report on our internal control over /f.shortinancial reporting for inclusion in the Financial Statements section of the Annual Report and the Annual Report on Form 20/hyphen.ucF as /f.shortiled with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over /f.shortinancial reporting during FY2021 that materially a/ffected or were reasonably likely to materially a/ffect/uni00A0our internal control over /f.shortinancial reporting. This included COVID/hyphen.uc19, which only had a minor impact on internal controls over /f.shortinancial reporting in/uni00A0relation to the number and nature of controls that were impacted.\n\nDuring FY2021, the RAC reviewed our compliance with the obligations imposed by SOX, including evaluating and documenting internal controls as/uni00A0required by section 404 of SOX.\n\n## Management's assessment of disclosure controls and procedures\n\nManagement, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, performed an evaluation of the e/ffectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as at 30 June 2021. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the material /f.short inancial and non-/f.shortinancial information required to be disclosed by BHP, including in the reports it /f.shortiles or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarised and reported on a timely basis. This information is accumulated and communicated to BHP's management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation, management (including the CEO and CFO) concluded that, as at 30 June 2021, our disclosure controls and procedures are e/ffective in providing that reasonable assurance.\n\nThere are inherent limitations to the e/ffectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Even e/ffective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.\n\nIn the design and evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, management was required to apply its judgement in evaluating the cost-bene/f.shortit relationship of possible controls and procedures.",

All signi/f.shorticant Code of Conduct matters and key trends from investigations are reported to the RAC. These are then reported to the Board as part of its report-out as set out in section 2.1.5. The most serious breaches of Our Code are also reported to the Integrity Working Group, which is accountable for oversight of the operational e/ffectiveness of the Investigations Framework, including oversight of investigations completed by the Central Investigations team. The Integrity Working Group is chaired by/uni00A0the Chief Compliance O/ff.shorticer and comprises of a number of senior leaders across BHP.\n\n## Executive Leadership Team\n\n- -  Purpose is to provide leadership to BHP, determining its priorities and the way it is to operate, thereby assisting the CEO in pursuing the corporate purpose\n\n## Group Investment Review Committee\n\nPurpose is to assist the CEO in assessing investment decisions using a transparent and rigorous governance process, such that:\n\n- -   investments are aligned with BHP's purpose, strategy and Our Charter values as well as the Group's capital priorities and plans\n- -  key risks and opportunities are identi/f.shortied and managed\n- -  shareholder value is optimised, on a risk adjusted basis\n\n3\n\n4\n\n- -  CEO has delegated authority to management committees and individual members of management - but CEO remains accountable to the Board for all authority delegated to him\n- -  Is a forum to debate high-level matters important to BHP and ensure consistent developments of BHP's strategy\n\n## Disclosure Committee\n\nPurpose is to assist the CEO to overseeing BHP's compliance with securities dealing and continuous and periodic disclosure requirements, including:\n\n- -  reviewing information that may require disclosure to stock exchanges\n- -  overseeing disclosure processes to ensure information disclosed is timely, accurate and complete",

In addition, where an announcement is determined to be material by the Disclosure Committee, the Board receives a copy promptly after it has been made. Where BHP gives a new and substantive investor or analyst presentation, it/uni00A0releases a copy of the presentation materials on the ASX Market Announcements Platform ahead of the presentation.\n\nIn response to COVID/hyphen.uc19, we have introduced extra monitoring and disclosure controls. These have included: increasing the regularity and breadth of information gathered from management (including the Finance, Supply, Marketing, Legal, and Operational teams); more regular updates to the Disclosure Committee; and more regular discussions with UBS (our corporate broker in the UK), as well as our Investor Relations team. This enables BHP/uni00A0to assess the materiality of developments and stay across market expectations, dynamics and emerging best practice.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA copy of the market disclosure and communications document is available at\n\nbhp.com/governance\n\nCopies of announcements to the stock exchanges on which BHP is listed, investor brie/f.shortings, Financial Statements, the Annual Report and other relevant information can be found at bhp.com. To receive email alerts of news releases, subscribe at bhp.com.\n\n## 2.1.17  Conformance with corporate governance standards\n\nOur compliance with the governance standards in our home jurisdictions of Australia and the United Kingdom, and with the governance requirements that apply to us as a result of our New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing and our registration with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States is summarised in this Corporate Governance Statement, the Remuneration Report, the Directors' Report and the Financial Statements.\n\nThe UK Code (available at frc.org.uk) and the ASX Principles and Recommendations (available at asx.com.au) require the Board to consider the application of the relevant corporate governance principles, while recognising departures from those principles are appropriate in some circumstances. The Board considers that during FY2021 it applied the Principles and complied with the provisions set out in the 2018 edition of the UK Code and complied with the ASX Fourth Edition, with no exceptions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Appendix 4G, which summarises our compliance with the ASX Fourth Edition is available at bhp.com/governance\n\nBHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc are registrants with the SEC in the United States. Each company is classi/f.shortied as a foreign private issuer and each has American Depositary Shares listed on the NYSE.\n\nWe have reviewed the governance requirements applicable to foreign private issuers under SOX, including the rules promulgated by the SEC and the rules of the NYSE, and are satis/f.shortied that we comply with those requirements.\n\nUnder NYSE rules, foreign private issuers such as BHP are required to disclose any signi/f.shorticant ways our corporate governance practices di/ffer from those followed by US companies under the NYSE corporate governance standards. After a comparison of our corporate governance practices with the/uni00A0requirements of Section 303A of the NYSE/hyphen.ucListed Company Manual followed by US companies, a signi/f.shorticant di/fference was identi/f.shortied:\n\n- -  Rule 10A/hyphen.uc3 of the Exchange Act requires NYSE-listed companies to ensure their audit committees are directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of the External Auditor unless the company's governing law or documents or other home country legal requirements require or permit shareholders to ultimately vote on or approve these matters. While the RAC is directly responsible for remuneration and oversight of the External Auditor, the ultimate responsibility for appointment and retention of the External Auditor rests with our shareholders, in accordance with UK law and our constitutional documents. However, the RAC does make recommendations to the Board on/uni00A0these/uni00A0matters, which are reported to shareholders.",

This results in some complexity in our disclosures, as there are some key di/fferences in the requirements and the information that must be disclosed. For example, UK requirements give shareholders the right to a binding vote on the remuneration policy every three years and as a result, the remuneration policy needs to be described in a separate section in the Remuneration Report. Our remuneration policy is set out in section 2.2.2. In Australia, BHP is required to make certain disclosures for KMP as de/f.shortined by the Australian Corporations Act 2001, Australian Accounting Standards and IFRS.\n\nThe UK requirements focus on the remuneration of Executive and Non-executive Directors. At BHP, this is our Board, including the CEO, who is our sole Executive Director. In contrast, the Australian requirements focus on the remuneration of KMP, de/f.shortined as those who have authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group directly or indirectly. KMP includes the Board, as well as certain members of our senior executive team.\n\nAfter due consideration, the Committee has determined the KMP for FY2021 comprised the following roles: all Non-executive Directors, the CEO, the/uni00A0Chief Financial O/ff.shorticer, the President Minerals Australia, the President Minerals Americas, and the President Petroleum.\n\nThe following individuals have held their positions and were KMP for the whole of FY2021, unless stated otherwise:\n\n- -  Mike Henry, CEO and Executive Director\n- -  Edgar Basto, President Minerals Australia\n- -  Peter Beaven, Chief Financial O/ff.shorticer (to 30 November 2020)\n- -  David Lamont, Chief Financial O/ff.shorticer (from 1 December 2020)\n- -  Daniel Malchuk, President Minerals Americas (to 31 October 2020)\n- -  Geraldine Slattery, President Petroleum\n- -  Ragnar Udd, President Minerals Americas (from 1 November 2020)\n- -  Non-executive Directors - see 'Remuneration for Non-executive Directors' in section 2.2.3 for details of the Non-executive Directors, including dates of appointment or cessation (where relevant)\n\n| Abbreviation   | Item                                        | Abbreviation   | Item                             |\n|----------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|\n| AGM            | Annual General Meeting                      | KMP            | Key Management Personnel         |\n| CDP            | Cash and Deferred Plan                      | KPI            | Key Performance Indicator        |\n| CEO            | Chief Executive O/ff.shorticer              | LTIP           | Long-Term Incentive Plan         |\n| DEP            | Dividend Equivalent Payment                 | MAP            | Management Award Plan            |\n| DLC            | Dual Listed Company                         | MSR            | Minimum Shareholding Requirement |\n| ELT            | Executive Leadership Team                   | ROCE           | Return on Capital Employed       |\n| GHG            | Greenhouse Gas                              | STIP           | Short-Term Incentive Plan        |\n| HSEC           | Health, Safety, Environment and Community   | TSR            | Total Shareholder Return         |\n| IFRS           | International Financial Reporting Standards |                |                                  |",

During FY2021, the Committee continued its focus on achieving remuneration outcomes that fairly re/f.shortlect the performance of BHP and the contribution of our employees, and which are aligned to the interests of shareholders and other key stakeholders.\n\nDuring FY2021, COVID/hyphen.uc19 has remained a signi/f.shorticant source of uncertainty across the world. While the emergence and deployment of successful vaccines is reason for optimism, the pandemic continues to have widespread impacts on lives, society and the global economy. In the face of this, BHP employees have operated in line with our purpose and values, working e/ffectively to keep the business performing strongly, and keeping each other safe.\n\n## Our approach\n\nOur Charter sets out our values, placing health and safety /f.shortirst, upon which the Remuneration Committee places great weight in the determination of performance-based remuneration outcomes for BHP executives. Our Charter also sets out our purpose, our strategy and how we measure success. The Committee is guided by Our Charter and aims to support our executives in taking a long-term approach to decision-making in order to build a sustainable and value-adding business.\n\nThe Committee is focused on having and applying a remuneration policy and approach that supports the Group's strategy and enables us to attract, retain and motivate the executives in di/fferent geographies critical to delivering the best outcomes for all BHP stakeholders. In addition, as BHP is a global organisation, the Committee is cognisant of the need to navigate the priorities and expectations of multiple jurisdictions.\n\nOur policy and approach to remuneration remains unchanged; however, we continue to strive for simpli/f.shortication in our programs. We were pleased to again receive strong support for our remuneration policy at the 2020 AGMs, with over 95 per cent voting 'for' the Remuneration Report, and, on average, over 96 per cent support over the past /f.shortive years. The Committee and the Board continue to incorporate shareholder feedback into our deliberations on pay to ensure it supports BHP's strategy.\n\n## Remuneration policy\n\nFY2021 represents the second year of application of the revised remuneration policy, which was approved by shareholders at the 2019 AGMs with almost 94 per cent of votes in favour. We believe the policy is serving stakeholders well. The key changes approved in 2019 for the CEO, which took e/ffect from 1 July 2019, were:\n\n- -  a change in the balance of incentive arrangements comprising:\n- -  a signi/f.shorticantly reduced LTIP grant size of 200 per cent of base salary (on a face value basis), down from 400 per cent\n- -  a rebalancing to a CDP award with a longer term focus than the former STIP. The CDP outcome is delivered one-third as a cash award, with twothirds delivered in equity, as two-year and /f.shortive-year deferred share awards each of equivalent value to the cash award. This aligns participants' incentive remuneration with performance over the short, medium and long-term\n- -  this rebalancing from LTIP to CDP reduced the leverage in the overall pay arrangements resulting in a 12 per cent reduction in the maximum remuneration for a year\n- -  a signi/f.shorticant reduction in the pension contribution rate to 10 per cent of base salary, down from 25 per cent (noting the estimated workforce average is approximately 11.5 per cent of base salary). As a result of this change, /f.shortixed remuneration for the CEO role was reduced by 12 per cent and overall target remuneration reduced by 4 per cent\n- -  the introduction of a two-year post-retirement shareholding requirement for the CEO\n\nA consequence of the transition to the revised remuneration policy is that the FY2021 single total /f.shortigure of remuneration for the CEO under UK requirements requires disclosure of the total amount of the CDP award earned during FY2021 (i.e. irrespective that some elements of the CDP award are/uni00A0deferred and /f.shortive-year deferred shares were not a feature of the former STIP), together with the full amount of the pre-existing LTIP award vesting at/uni00A0the end of FY2021, which was granted in 2016 when the CEO was President Operations, Minerals Australia (i.e. when the LTIP award size was double the current grant size). This legacy consequence of remuneration policy transition will continue each year through to FY2024.\n\nThe Committee strives to implement the remuneration policy in a considered way. We test the CEO's remuneration against CEO roles in other global companies of similar complexity, size, reach and industry. The remuneration also re/f.shortlects the CEO's responsibilities, location, skills, performance, quali/f.shortications and experience. This detailed benchmarking ensures BHP's executive remuneration packages are competitive enough to attract and retain talented executives, without being excessive. External benchmarking shows the CEO's target remuneration package is below the average for similar global companies. Importantly, a signi/f.shorticant portion of the CEO's target remuneration package can only be realised as actual remuneration if/uni00A0performance targets are met.\n\nIn addition, the CEO's remuneration is deliberately tied to the performance of the business, with the majority of the remuneration package intended to/uni00A0be delivered in BHP equity, not cash. The CEO also has a minimum shareholding requirement of /f.shortive times pre-tax base salary, which continues for/uni00A0two years post-retirement. This aligns the CEO to the experience of BHP's shareholders.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2  Remuneration Report continued\n\n## Business performance\n\nGiven the strong link at BHP between executive remuneration and performance, I am pleased to be able to report BHP has performed strongly across a/uni00A0wide range of areas in FY2021.\n\nOur people have continued their focus on safety. Our global safety improvement programs are progressing well and our safety leading indicators have continued a strong positive trend underpinning the current safety performance. We have now had over two and a half years without a fatality at our operated assets and we continue to focus on fostering a culture of respect and ensuring our workplace is safe at all times.\n\nWe have delivered strong underlying operational performance during the year, with record volumes achieved at Western Australia Iron Ore, Goonyella and Olympic Dam, and Escondida maintained average concentrator throughput at record levels. We successfully achieved /f.shortirst production at four major development projects: South Flank, Spence Growth Option, Atlantis Phase 3 and Ruby, all of which were delivered on or ahead of schedule and on budget. We have also progressed signi/f.shorticant strategic initiatives during FY2021, including preparing for the investment in Jansen Stage 1, pursuing a/uni00A0merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside, and unifying our corporate structure.\n\nWe have made strong progress on actions required to meet our commitments to reduce operational GHG emissions. We have established signi/f.shorticant renewable power supply agreements for our Kwinana nickel re/f.shortinery, Queensland Coal operations, and Escondida and Spence copper mines. We have established emissions reduction partnerships with three major steelmakers in China and Japan whose combined output equates to around 10 per cent of global steel production. In shipping, we have also taken a number of actions to help reduce emissions in our value chain: awarded the world's /f.shortirst liqui/f.shortied natural gas fuelled bulk carriers contract and took part in a successful marine biofuel trial.\n\nWith respect to COVID/hyphen.uc19, we remain vigilant and will continue with social distancing and hygiene practices, and other additional protocols as appropriate to protect our workforce and communities. Our Australian operations have e/ffectively managed the rapidly changing environment relating to interstate travel and border access. In Chile, the operating environment is expected to continue to be challenging. The Remuneration Committee is/uni00A0proud of the way BHP's employees have continued to collaborate to solve problems and support each other and their communities.\n\nDespite the challenges the COVID/hyphen.uc19 pandemic has presented, in FY2021 BHP has again not needed to furlough any employees without pay, did not/uni00A0seek any government assistance, and did not raise additional equity. In addition, BHP's strong, safe operational performance through this year, together with strong pro/f.shortitability, enabled the Board to announce record dividends for FY2021. This continues the delivery of strong and consistent returns to shareholders.\n\n## Activities of the Committee\n\nI would like to thank all members of the Remuneration Committee for their contributions during the past year. In particular, I would like to express my appreciation to my predecessor as Chair, Susan Kilsby, who has provided strong leadership and guidance during her term, as BHP navigated one of the/uni00A0most tumultuous periods in our history.\n\nA key element of the Committee's work during the year was the remuneration implications of changes to the BHP ELT, with a number of appointments and departures taking place. David Lamont, Edgar Basto and Ragnar Udd join Mike Henry and Geraldine Slattery as Executive KMP for the purposes of this Remuneration Report, and Peter Beaven and Daniel Malchuk departed BHP having been Executive KMP during FY2021. Information on remuneration arrangements for David, Edgar and Ragnar and the departure arrangements for Peter and Daniel is set out in/uni00A0'Arrangements for KMP/uni00A0leaving and joining the Group' and 'Executive KMP remuneration table' in section 2.2.3.\n\nOther key decisions and activities of the Committee during FY2021 included:\n\n- -  considering remuneration for members of the ELT and the Group Company Secretary\n- -  setting targets for and reviewing outcomes against performance measures and conditions of relevant incentive plans, including the Committee considering its discretion over FY2021 plan outcomes\n- -  reviewing the fee for the BHP Chair, which remains unchanged\n- -  commencing early preparations for the re-approval of the remuneration policy at the 2022 AGMs\n- -  reviewing and adopting changes and improvements /f.shortlowing from regulatory requirements and guidance, which in turn helps us improve our processes and approaches\n- -  engaging with shareholders and other key stakeholders\n- -  undertaking regular reviews of workforce engagement, workforce remuneration and related policies, remuneration by gender and the annual Shareplus enrolment\n\n## FY2021 CDP\n\nThe scorecard against which Mike Henry's annual performance as BHP's CEO is assessed comprises stretching performance measures, including HSEC, /f.shortinancial and individual performance elements. For FY2021, the Remuneration Committee has assessed the CEO's performance and determined/uni00A0a CDP outcome of 115 per cent, against the target of 100 per cent (and the maximum of 150 per cent).\n\nThese outcomes took into account BHP's strong HSEC performance during the year, with no fatalities recorded, and good progress against our Fatality Elimination Program. We also saw positive progress against our climate change targets, which were expanded and strengthened for FY2021 from prior years, and our progress in the management of priority tailings storage facilities was pleasing.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Our Charter sets out our values, placing health and safety /f.shortirst, upon which the Remuneration Committee places great weight in determining performance-based remuneration outcomes for BHP executives. Good progress has been made at BHP through signi/f.shorticant e/fforts since 2018 to address sexual assault and sexual harassment in the workplace, and completion of work to implement controls has been incorporated into the FY2022 CDP HSEC scorecard. The Committee considers that the e/fforts to address the risk of sexual assault and sexual harassment could have been further accelerated through stronger coordination of work streams and integrated planning. Accordingly, the Committee has exercised its discretion to make a downwards adjustment to the HSEC outcome of the CDP scorecard by 10 per cent from an initial 33 per cent to a /f.shortinal outcome of/uni00A030 per cent out of a target of 25 per cent. This downwards adjustment was applied to the CEO and all other ELT members.\n\nFinancial and operating performance was strong, even after fully eliminating the very positive impacts of commodity prices during the year, particularly/uni00A0for iron ore. Accordingly, performance was better than the stretching targets set at the commencement of the year.",

        "page_content": "1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nWhile the COVID/hyphen.uc19 pandemic continued to impact BHP, society and the global economy, the Group maintained continuity of operations while keeping employees healthy and safe. Despite this, as occurred in FY2020, there were costs and other impacts of COVID/hyphen.uc19 to BHP's /f.shortinancial results for FY2021. The direct costs have been recorded as an exceptional item in the Financial Statements, as they were in FY2020. Nevertheless, the Committee concluded that, to the extent the COVID/hyphen.uc19 related costs were higher than those included in the approved budget, they should /f.shortlow through to the /f.short inancial measures for CDP scorecard purposes, thereby reducing the remuneration outcome for executives from what they would have otherwise been. The Committee considered this was appropriate in light of the global impacts of the COVID/hyphen.uc19 pandemic. The CDP outcome for the /f.shortinancial measure was 60 per cent out of a target of 50 per cent.\n\nThe Committee also considered Mike's performance against his individual objectives. These included projects and initiatives in respect of performance (material improvement in the system that supports exceptional performance), social value (long-term growth in value and returns for all stakeholders), people (right people, right skills, coming together in the right way to support exceptional performance) and portfolio (progress on our strategic objectives to create a winning portfolio and set BHP up for the next 20 years). The Committee considered Mike's performance against his individual objectives to be in line with the target of 25 per cent.\n\nWhile the CEO's CDP scorecard outcome was determined at 115 per cent of target, the CDP scorecard outcomes for other Executive KMP were also on average ahead of target. Likewise, the short-term incentive pool applicable to the majority of BHP employees below the ELT level was above target. These outcomes were considered appropriate and due recognition, given the excellent performance across BHP's whole workforce in the face of the continuing COVID/hyphen.uc19 pandemic, where strong safety performance and operational continuity were achieved during FY2021.\n\n## 2016 LTIP award\n\nThe vesting outcome for the 2016 LTIP award against the relative TSR performance conditions was 100 per cent. BHP outperformed both the sector peer group and the MSCI World Index signi/f.shorticantly. This 100 per cent level of vesting is aligned with the projected vesting outcome communicated to/uni00A0shareholders in the 2019 Remuneration Report at the time of the changes to our remuneration policy, which were approved by shareholders at the/uni00A02019 AGMs, and is set out in the chart below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs shareholders will recall, one of the key elements of our revised remuneration policy was to reduce the weighting of future LTIP grants as part of the overall CEO remuneration package; however, pre-existing grants would stay on foot and their vesting would be determined with existing service and performance conditions.\n\nThe Committee is conscious that the granting of the 2016 LTIP awards and the early part of the /f.shortive-year performance period coincided with a period of/uni00A0lower share prices, driven in part by the Samarco dam failure having occurred on 5 November 2015.\n\nAt the time of the grant of the 2016 LTIP award, the Committee sought to ensure the Samarco dam failure did not result in an inappropriate LTIP award size due to the lower share price, and reduced the number of awards by 26 per cent from that which would have resulted from the standard grant size calculation. The Committee has reviewed this approach and concluded it was appropriate. In reaching this conclusion, the Committee noted the/uni00A0positive feedback received from shareholders and other investor groups in 2016 on the approach adopted.\n\nHaving considered the LTIP grant size, the Committee undertook a further exercise to satisfy itself that the TSR performance, which formulaically would result in 100 per cent vesting, had not been inappropriately enhanced by the starting position of the performance period being lower as a consequence of a fall in share price following the Samarco dam failure. This analysis included estimating and removing the impact of the dam failure from the start of the performance period (i.e. removing the impact this would have otherwise had on the TSR outcome due to the lower starting position), reducing the TSR outcome for estimated payments in relation to the Samarco dam failure that may take place beyond the end of the performance period and examining the construct of the comparator group against which TSR performance is measured.\n\nWhile this analysis uses inputs and assumptions that are theoretical, the Committee concluded the analysis was su/ff.shorticiently robust to provide con/f.shortidence that the underlying TSR performance was su/ff.shorticient to support the formulaic vesting of the 2016 LTIP award at 100 per cent.\n\nThe Committee notes the value of the vested 2016 LTIP award is higher than the value of the award at the time it was granted. With the share price having risen appreciably during the /f.shortive-year period and strong dividends, 36 per cent of the value realised is the value at grant time and 64 per cent of/uni00A0the value realised is due to share price appreciation and dividends. This value increment due to share price appreciation and dividends is consistent with the experience of shareholders over the period.\n\nConsistent with prior practice, the Board and Committee has also conducted a holistic review of business performance over the /f.shortive years since grant to ensure this level of vesting was appropriate. More information on the 2016 LTIP vesting outcome, including the /f.shortive-year holistic business review covering HSEC performance, pro/f.shortitability, cash /f.shortlow, balance sheet health, returns to shareholders, corporate governance and conduct, is included in/uni00A0'LTIP performance outcomes' and 'Overarching discretion and vesting underpin' in section 2.2.3.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2  Remuneration Report continued\n\nMore information on the overall remuneration outcomes for the CEO for the year, and how the outcomes are aligned to performance during FY2021, is/uni00A0provided in 'Single total /f.shortigure of remuneration' in section 2.2.3. Having considered the overall remuneration outcomes for the CEO carefully, as set out/uni00A0above and in section 2.2.3, the Committee concluded it was a fair re/f.shortlection of performance and the experience of shareholders, and the application of any downwards discretion was not warranted. As at the date of this Report, the CEO's BHP shareholding is in excess of his minimum shareholding requirement of /f.shortive times pre-tax base salary.\n\n## FY2022 remuneration\n\nFor FY2022, the Committee determined that the CEO's base salary remains unchanged at US$1.700 million per annum, as it was at the time of his appointment at the beginning of 2020. In addition, the other components of his total target remuneration (pension contributions, bene/f.shortits, CDP and/uni00A0LTIP) also remain unchanged. A summary of the CEO's arrangements for FY2022 is set out below.\n\n| Fixed remuneration                                                | CDP                                                                                                                                                                                                            | LTIP                                                                                                |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| -  Base salary US$1.700 million  per annum                        | -  Target cash award of 80 per cent of base salary (maximum 120 per cent) -  Plus two awards of deferred shares each of equivalent value to the cash award,  vesting in two and /f.shortive years respectively | -  The normal LTIP grant is based  on a face value of 200 per cent  of base salary                  |\n| -  No change to base salary                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                     |\n| -  Pension contribution  10/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent of base salary | -  Three performance categories: -  HSEC - 25 per cent  -  Financial - 50 per cent                                                                                                                             | -  Our LTIP awards have rigorous  relative TSR performance  hurdles measured over /f.shortive years |\n\nThe Committee has also reviewed the base salaries and total target remuneration packages for other Executive KMP and determined there would be/uni00A0no/uni00A0changes to base salaries in September 2021, and other aspects of their remuneration arrangements would also remain unchanged.\n\n## Remuneration outcomes for the Chair and Non-executive Directors\n\nFees for the Chair and Non-executive Directors are reviewed annually and are benchmarked against peer companies. No changes to the Chair's fee/uni00A0will/uni00A0be made for FY2022. This follows a review in 2017, where a decision was made to reduce the Chair's annual fee by approximately 8 per cent from US$0.960 million to US$0.880 million with e/ffect from 1 July 2017, which followed an earlier reduction, e/ffective 1 July 2015, of approximately 13/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent/uni00A0from US$1.100 million to US$0.960 million.\n\nBase fee levels for Non-executive Directors will also remain unchanged, after they were also reduced e/ffective 1 July 2015 by approximately 6 per cent, from US$0.170 million to US$0.160 million per annum. Prior to the above reductions in fee levels for the Chair and Non-executive Directors, their fees had remained unchanged since 2011.\n\n## Summary\n\nIt is with much pleasure that I note the strong performance by BHP across a wide range of areas during FY2021. We deliberately align our executive remuneration outcomes to performance - in particular, in our incentive plans where executives' variable remuneration will re/f.shortlect circumstances where shareholders have been rewarded very well, as delivered this year and measured in share price and dividend performance. As such, the remuneration outcomes for our executives in FY2021 re/f.shortlect BHP's strong performance, even after favourable commodity price movements for the year are backed out in full under the CDP. Given our need to attract, retain and motivate the executives critical to delivering the best outcomes for all BHP stakeholders, this is an especially pleasing result this year for all concerned, after recent years where the variable pay outcomes have been at the lower end for our executive team.\n\nWith the COVID/hyphen.uc19 pandemic continuing to impact this year, not only for BHP, but also for many other companies, governments, employees, families and communities across the world, I note the ongoing challenges. On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I would like to recognise the hard work, dedication and sacri/f.shortices of our employees. Through their steadfast commitment, they have remained safe and healthy, continued to support their communities, and enabled BHP to generate strong results for all stakeholders.\n\nThe Committee believes the remuneration outcomes for FY2021 are aligned with BHP's performance and the experience of shareholders, and are also fair in terms of the wider context of global circumstances. We are con/f.shortident shareholders will recognise this as a continuation of our long-held approach. We look forward to ongoing dialogue with and the support of BHP's shareholders, and I very much look forward to meeting shareholders face-to-face when we are able to do so. As always, we welcome your feedback and comments on any aspect of this Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Christine O'Reilly\n\nChair, Remuneration Committee\n\n2 September 2021",

Under UK legislation, shareholders have the opportunity to vote on our remuneration policy every three years, with binding e/ffect in regard to the Directors (including the CEO). Under Australian legislation, shareholders also have the opportunity to vote on our remuneration policy in conjunction with the broader Remuneration Report each year at the AGMs as it applies to all KMP under a non-binding advisory vote. Our remuneration policy, which was approved by shareholders at the 2019/uni00A0AGMs, has not changed and is repeated below.\n\n## Remuneration policy for the Executive Director\n\nThis section only refers to the remuneration policy for our CEO, who is our sole Executive Director. If any other executive were to be appointed an/uni00A0Executive Director, this remuneration policy would apply to that new role.\n\n## Components of remuneration\n\nThe following table shows the components of total remuneration, the link to strategy, the applicable operation and performance frameworks, and/uni00A0the/uni00A0maximum opportunity for each component.\n\n| Remuneration component   and link to strategy                                                                                                                                                                          | Operation and performance framework                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Maximum (1)                                                                                                               |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Base salary A competitive base salary  is paid in order to attract  and retain a high-quality  and experienced CEO,  and to provide appropriate  remuneration for this                                                 | -  Base salary, denominated in US dollars, is broadly aligned with salaries for comparable roles in global  companies of similar global complexity, size, reach and industry, and re/f.shortlects the CEO's responsibilities,  location, skills, performance, quali/f.shortications and experience.  -  Base salary is reviewed annually with e/ffect from 1 September.

conclusion of the /f.shortinancial year, the CEO's achievement against each measure is assessed by the Remuneration Committee and the Board, with guidance provided by other relevant Board Committees in respect of HSEC and other measures, and a CDP award determined. If performance is below the threshold level for any measure, no CDP award will be provided in respect of that portion of the CDP award opportunity.\n\n## Assessment of performance\n\n- -  The Board believes this method of assessment is transparent, rigorous and balanced, and provides an/uni00A0appropriate, objective and comprehensive assessment of performance.\n- -  In the event that the Remuneration Committee does not consider the outcome that would otherwise apply to be a true re/f.shortlection of the performance of the Group or should it consider that individual performance or other circumstances makes this an inappropriate outcome, it retains the discretion to/uni00A0not provide all or a part of any CDP award. This is an important mitigation against the risk of unintended/uni00A0award outcomes.\n\nDelivery of two-thirds of CDP awards in deferred shares encourages a longerterm focus aligned to that of shareholders.",

It also believes overall remuneration should be fair to the individual, such that remuneration levels accurately re/f.shortlect the CEO's responsibilities and contributions, and align with the expectations of our shareholders, while considering the positioning and relativities of pay and employment conditions across the wider BHP workforce.\n\nThe amount of remuneration actually received each year depends on the achievement of superior business and individual performance generating sustained shareholder value. Before deciding on the /f.shortinal incentive outcomes for the CEO, the Committee /f.shortirst considers the achievement against the pre-determined performance conditions. The Committee then applies its overarching discretion on the basis of what it considers to be a fair and commensurate remuneration level to decide if the outcome should be reduced. When the CEO was appointed in January 2020 the Board advised him the Committee would exercise its discretion on the basis of what it considered to be a fair and commensurate remuneration level to decide if/uni00A0the/uni00A0outcome should be reduced.\n\nIn this way, the Committee believes it can set a remuneration level for the CEO that is su/ff.shorticient to incentivise him and is also fair to him and commensurate with shareholder expectations and prevailing market conditions.\n\nThe diagram below provides the scenario for the potential total remuneration of the CEO at di/fferent levels of performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMinimum: consists of /f.shortixed remuneration, which comprises base salary (US$1.700 million), pension contributions (10 per cent of base salary) and/uni00A0other/uni00A0bene/f.shortits (notional 10 per cent of base salary).\n\nTarget: consists of /f.shortixed remuneration, target CDP (a cash award of 80 per cent of base salary plus two awards of deferred shares each of equivalent value to the cash award, vesting in two and /f.shortive years respectively) and target LTIP. The LTIP target value is based on the fair value of the award, which is 41 per cent of the face value of 200 per cent of base salary. The potential impact of future share price movements is not included in the value of deferred CDP awards or LTIP awards.\n\nMaximum: consists of /f.shortixed remuneration, maximum CDP (a cash award of 120 per cent of base salary plus two awards of deferred shares each of equivalent value to the cash award, vesting in two and /f.shortive years respectively), and maximum LTIP (face value of 200 per cent of base salary). The potential impact of future share price movements is not included in the value of deferred CDP awards or LTIP awards. All other things being equal, if the share price at vesting of LTIP awards was 50 per cent higher than the share price at grant, then the total maximum value would be US$13.260 million.\n\nThe maximum opportunity represented above is the most that could potentially be paid of each remuneration component, as required by UK regulations. It does not re/f.shortlect any intention by the Group to award that amount. The Remuneration Committee reviews relevant benchmarking data/uni00A0and/uni00A0industry practices, and believes the maximum remuneration opportunity is appropriate.\n\n## Approach to recruitment and promotion remuneration\n\nThe remuneration policy as set out in 'Components of remuneration' in this section 2.2.2 will apply to the remuneration arrangements for a newly recruited or promoted CEO, or for another Executive Director should one be appointed. A market-competitive level of base salary will be provided. The pension contributions, bene/f.shortits and variable pay will be in accordance with the remuneration policy table in 'Components of remuneration' in/uni00A0this/uni00A0section 2.2.2.\n\nFor external appointments, the Remuneration Committee may determine that it is appropriate to provide additional cash and/or equity components to/uni00A0replace any remuneration forfeited or not received from a former employer. It is anticipated any foregone equity awards would be replaced by equity. The value of the replacement remuneration would not be any greater than the fair value of the awards foregone or not received (as determined by the Committee's independent adviser). The Committee would determine appropriate service conditions and performance conditions within BHP's framework, taking into account the conditions attached to the foregone awards. The Committee is mindful of limiting such payments and not providing any more compensation than is necessary. For any internal CEO (or another Executive Director) appointment, any entitlements provided under former arrangements will be honoured according to their existing terms.\n\n## Service contracts and policy on loss of o/ff.shortice\n\nThe terms of employment for the CEO are formalised in his employment contract. Key terms of the current contract and relevant payments on loss of o/ff.shortice are shown below. If a new CEO or another Executive Director was appointed, similar contractual terms would apply, other than where the Remuneration Committee determines that di/fferent terms should apply for reasons speci/f.shortic to the individual or circumstances.",

No variable remuneration (CDP and LTIP award arrangements) will be/uni00A0provided to newly recruited Non-executive Directors.\n\n## Letters of appointment and policy on loss of o/ff.shortice\n\nThe standard letter of appointment for Non-executive Directors is available on our website. The Board has adopted a policy consistent with the UK Corporate Governance Code, under which all Non-executive Directors must seek re-election by shareholders annually if they wish to remain on the Board. As such, no Non-executive Directors seeking re-election have an unexpired term in their letter of appointment. A Non-executive Director may resign on reasonable notice. No payments are made to Non-executive Directors on loss of o/ff.shortice.\n\n## How remuneration policy is set\n\nThe Remuneration Committee sets the remuneration policy for the CEO and other Executive KMP. The Committee is briefed on and considers prevailing market conditions, the competitive environment and the positioning and relativities of pay and employment conditions across the wider BHP workforce. The Committee takes into account the annual base salary increases for our employee population when determining any change in the CEO's base salary. Salary increases in Australia, where the CEO is located, are particularly relevant as they re/f.shortlect the local economic conditions.\n\nThe principles that underpin the remuneration policy for the CEO are the same as those that apply to other employees, although the CEO's arrangements have a greater emphasis on and a higher proportion of remuneration in the form of performance-related variable pay. Similarly, the performance measures used to determine variable pay outcomes for the CEO and all other employees are linked to the delivery of our strategy and behaviours that are aligned to the values in Our Charter .\n\nAlthough BHP does not consult directly with employees on CEO and other Executive KMP remuneration, the Group conducts regular employee engagement surveys that give employees an opportunity to provide feedback on a wide range of employee matters. Further, many employees are ordinary shareholders through our all-employee share purchase plan, Shareplus, and therefore have the opportunity to vote on AGM resolutions. In addition, in line with changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Remuneration Committee is considering additional means of engaging with the workforce to explain how executive remuneration aligns with wider Group pay policy.\n\nAs part of the Board's commitment to good governance, the Committee also considers shareholder views, together with those of the wider community, when setting the remuneration policy for the CEO and other Executive KMP. We are committed to engaging and communicating with shareholders regularly and, as our shareholders are spread across the globe, we are proactive with our engagement on remuneration and governance matters with institutional shareholders and investor representative organisations. Feedback from shareholders and investors is shared with and used as input into decision-making by the Board and Remuneration Committee in respect of our remuneration policy and its application. The Committee considers that this approach provides a robust mechanism to ensure Directors are aware of matters raised, have a good understanding of current shareholder views and can formulate policy and make decisions as appropriate. We encourage shareholders to always make their views known to us by directly contacting our Investor Relations team (contact details available at bhp.com).",

Having recorded strong safety, operational and /f.shortinancial performance in FY2021 (after fully eliminating the very positive impacts of commodity prices during the year, particularly for iron ore), when assessing performance against the targets set/uni00A0at the commencement of the year the Board and Committee determined the CDP outcome for the CEO for FY2021 at 115 per cent against the target/uni00A0of 100 per cent (which represents an outcome of 77 per cent against maximum). The Board and Committee believe this outcome is appropriately/uni00A0aligned with the shareholder experience and the interests of the Group's other stakeholders.\n\nThe CEO's CDP scorecard outcomes for FY2021 are summarised in the following tables, including a narrative description of each performance measure/uni00A0and the CEO's level of achievement, as determined by the Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board. The level of performance for/uni00A0each measure is determined based on a range of threshold (the minimum necessary to qualify for any reward outcome), target (where the performance requirements are met), and maximum (where the performance requirements are signi/f.shorticantly exceeded).",

As it has done for several years, the Remuneration Committee seeks guidance each year from the Sustainability Committee when assessing HSEC performance against scorecard targets. The Remuneration Committee has taken a holistic view of Group performance in critical areas, including any matters outside the scorecard targets that the Sustainability Committee considers relevant.\n\nThe performance commentary below is provided against the HSEC scorecard targets, which were updated in FY2021 as a consequence of our commitment to clarify and strengthen the links between climate change and executive remuneration. This resulted in a weighting for climate change of 10 per cent under the CDP, which compares to around 4 per cent allocated to climate change in the prior STIP. The targets were set on the basis of/uni00A0operated assets only.\n\n| HSEC measures                                                | Scorecard targets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Performance against scorecard/uni00A0targets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Measure outcome        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Signi/f.shorticant events                                    | No signi/f.shorticant (actual level 4)  health, safety (including fatalities),  environment or community events  during the year.                                                                                                                                      | -  There were no fatalities or other signi/f.shorticant HSEC events during  FY2021 at operated assets. -  In addition, for a maximum outcome to be awarded, strong progress  was required on the development and implementation of BHP's  Fatality Elimination Program in all regions, and this was largely  achieved for FY2021.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Close to maximum.      |\n| Climate change                                               | Steps in place to achieve reported  GHG emissions in FY2022 at  FY2017 level.

ROCE is the key /f.shortinancial KPI against which CDP outcomes for our senior executives are measured and is, in our view, a relevant measure to assess the /f.shortinancial performance of the Group for this purpose. While ROCE excludes exceptional items, the Remuneration Committee reviews each exceptional item to/uni00A0assess if it should be included in the result for the purposes of deriving the ROCE CDP outcome.\n\nWhen we are assessing management's performance, we make adjustments to the ROCE result to allow for changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange movements and other material items to ensure the assessment appropriately measures outcomes that are within the control and in/f.shortluence of/uni00A0the Group and its executives.

The CEO's 2016 LTIP award comprised 192,360 awards (granted as/uni00A0President Operations, Minerals Australia prior to his appointment as CEO). Vesting is subject to achievement of the relative TSR performance conditions/uni00A0and any discretion applied by the Remuneration Committee (see 'Overarching discretion and vesting underpin' in this section 2.2.3).\n\n## Testing the performance condition\n\nFor the award to vest in full, TSR must exceed the Peer Group TSR (for 67 per cent of the award) and the Index TSR (for 33 per cent of the award) by an average of 5.5 per cent per year for /f.shortive years, being 30.7 per cent in total compounded over the performance period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2021. TSR includes returns to BHP shareholders in the form of share price movements along with dividends paid and reinvested in BHP (including cash and in-specie dividends).\n\nBHP's TSR performance was positive 266.5 per cent over the /f.shortive-year period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2021. This is above the weighted median Peer Group TSR of positive 213.9 per cent and above the Index TSR of positive 99.8 per cent over the same period. This level of performance results in 100 per cent vesting for the 2016 LTIP award. The value of the CEO's vested 2016 LTIP award has been reported in 'Single total /f.shortigure of remuneration' in this section 2.2.3.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4",

Using a 12-month average share price of A$20.3326 and a 12-month average US$/A$ exchange rate of 0.728415 (each up to and including 30 June 2016), the number of LTIP awards derived for Mike Henry was 259,982. However, to ensure Mike (and other Executive KMP) did not receive a larger number of awards as a result of the lower BHP share price since the Samarco dam failure in Brazil on 5 November 2015, as the Committee was conscious of shareholder expectations in this respect, the Committee instead granted 192,360 LTIP awards to Mike in December 2016, a reduction of 26 per cent. This was the same number that was granted to Mike in the prior year in December 2015, which in itself had been reduced from the formulaically derived amount to ensure the Samarco dam failure did not in/f.shortlate the 2015 LTIP award grant size. The Committee has reviewed this approach and concluded it was appropriate.\n\nHaving considered the LTIP grant size, the Committee undertook a further exercise to satisfy itself that the TSR performance, which formulaically would result in 100 per cent vesting, had not been inappropriately enhanced by the starting position of the performance period being lower as a consequence of a fall in share price following the Samarco dam failure. This analysis included estimating and removing the impact of the dam failure from the start of the performance period (i.e. removing the impact this would have otherwise had on the TSR outcome due to the lower starting position), reducing the TSR outcome for estimated payments in relation to the Samarco dam failure that may take place beyond the end of the performance period and examining the construct of the comparator group against which TSR performance is measured.\n\nWhile this analysis uses inputs and assumptions that are theoretical, the Committee concluded the analysis was su/ff.shorticiently robust to provide con/f.shortidence that the underlying TSR performance was su/ff.shorticient to support the formulaic vesting of the 2016 LTIP award at 100 per cent.\n\nThe value of the vested 2016 LTIP award is higher than the value of the award at the time it was granted. With the share price having risen appreciably during the /f.shortive-year period and strong dividends, 36 per cent of the value realised is the value at grant time and 64 per cent of the value realised is due to share price appreciation and dividends. This value increment due to share price appreciation and dividends is consistent with the experience of shareholders over the period.\n\nThe following chart shows the cumulative outcomes of the decisions above, with the original notional grant size as if it had vested in full, the grant size reduction due to the Samarco dam failure, and the /f.shortinal vested value of US$7.939 million, split between the original grant value and share price appreciation and dividends.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(64% of vested value)\n\n## LTIP allocated during FY2021\n\nFollowing shareholder approval at the 2020 AGMs, LTIP awards (in the form of performance rights) were granted to Mike Henry on 20 October 2020.\n\nThe face value and fair value of the awards granted on 20 October 2020 are shown in the table below. The face value of Mike's award was 200 per cent of his base salary of US$1.700 million at the time of grant.\n\nThe fair value of the awards is ordinarily calculated by multiplying the face value of the award by the fair value factor of 41 per cent (for the current plan design, as determined by the independent adviser to the Committee). The number of LTIP awards for Mike as detailed below was determined based on the US$ face value of the LTIP awards and calculated using the average share price and US$/A$ exchange rate over the 12 months up to and including 30 June 2020.",

The maximum weighting for any one company  is 25% and the minimum is set at 0.4% to reduce sensitivity to any single peer company. -  For the whole of either portion of the award to vest, BHP's TSR must be at or exceed the weighted 80th percentile  of the Peer Group TSR or the Index TSR (as applicable). Threshold vesting (25% of each portion of the award) occurs  where BHP's TSR equals the weighted 50th percentile (i.e. the median) of the Peer Group TSR or the Index TSR  (as/uni00A0applicable). Vesting occurs on a sliding scale between the weighted 50th and 80th percentiles. |\n| Sector peer   group companies (1)(2)(3) | -  Resources (85%): Anglo American, Fortescue Metals, Freeport-McMoRan, Glencore, Rio Tinto, Southern Copper,  Teck/uni00A0Resources, Vale. -  Oil and gas (15%): Apache, BP, Canadian Natural Res., Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, EOG Resources,  ExxonMobil, Occidental Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell, Woodside Petroleum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n\n- (3)  From November 2018, CONSOL Energy was removed from the comparator group, as due to its internal restructuring it had become a less comparable peer.\n\n## Overarching discretion and vesting underpin\n\nThe rules of the CDP, STIP and LTIP and the terms and conditions of the awards give the Committee an overarching discretion to reduce the number of awards that will vest, notwithstanding the fact that the performance condition for partial or full vesting, as tested following the end of the performance period, or the relevant service conditions, have been met. This holistic, qualitative judgement, which is applied as an underpin test before /f.shortinal vesting is/uni00A0con/f.shortirmed, is an important risk management tool to ensure vesting is not simply driven by a formula or the passage of time that may give unexpected or unintended remuneration outcomes.\n\nThe Committee considers its discretion carefully each year ahead of the scheduled vesting of equity awards in August. It considers performance holistically over the /f.shortive-year period, including a /f.shortive-year 'look back' on HSEC performance, pro/f.shortitability, cash /f.shortlow, balance sheet health, returns to shareholders, corporate governance and conduct. For the /f.shortive years from FY2017 to FY2021, the Committee noted BHP's continued improvement in HSEC outcomes, strong operational performance with improving production and cost performance, and signi/f.shorticant returns to shareholders, together with no governance or conduct issues of note.\n\nAccordingly, in respect of the STIP two-year deferred shares (granted in November 2019 in respect of performance in FY2019), the Committee chose not to exercise its discretion and allowed the STIP awards to vest in full. In addition, in respect of the LTIP /f.shortive-year performance shares (granted in December 2016), the formulaic outcome of the 2016 LTIP was a 100 per cent vesting. Having undertaken the 'look back' review described above and the assessment of the estimated impact on TSR performance of the Samarco dam failure, the Committee concluded the vesting outcome was appropriate given Group and individual performance, and chose not to exercise its discretion and allowed 100 per cent of the LTIP awards to vest. There is no upwards discretion available to the Remuneration Committee in respect of the LTIP, as the overarching discretion may only reduce the number of awards that may vest.\n\n## CEO remuneration and returns to shareholders\n\n## 10-year CEO remuneration\n\nThe table below shows the single total /f.shortigure of remuneration for Mike Henry, Andrew Mackenzie and Marius Kloppers over the last 10 years along with the proportion of maximum opportunity earned for each type of incentive.\n\n| Executive Director   | Financial year   | Single total /f.shortigure of remuneration, US$('000)   |   CDP/STIP (% of maximum) |   LTIP (% of maximum) |\n|----------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Mike Henry           | FY2021           | 14,521                                                  |                        77 |                   100 |\n|                      | FY2020 (1)       | 6,069                                                   |                        64 |                    48 |\n| Andrew Mackenzie     | FY2020 (1)       | 2,424                                                   |                        64 |                    48 |\n|                      | FY2019           | 3,531                                                   |                        32 |                     0 |\n|                      | FY2018           | 4,657                                                   |                        60 |                     0 |\n|                      | FY2017           | 4,554                                                   |                        57 |                     0 |\n|                      | FY2016           | 2,241                                                   |                         0 |                     0 |\n|                      | FY2015           | 4,582                                                   |                        57 |                     0 |\n|                      | FY2014           | 7,988                                                   |                        77 |                    58 |\n|                      | FY2013 (2)       | 9,740                                                   |                        47 |                    65 |\n| Marius Kloppers      | FY2013 (2)       | 5,624                                                   |                        47 |                    65 |\n|                      | FY2012           | 16,092                                                  |                         0 |                   100 |",

The CEOs' and Non-executive Directors' remuneration described in the table align to what is disclosed in 'Single total /f.shortigure of remuneration' (Executive Directors and Non-executive Directors) in this section 2.2.3.\n\n|                      |                        | FY2019 to FY2020           | FY2019 to FY2020         | FY2019 to FY2020   | FY2020 to FY2021           | FY2020 to FY2021             | FY2020 to FY2021   |\n|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|\n|                      |                        | Base salary/ fees % change | Bene/f.shortits % change | CDP/STI % change   | Base salary/ fees % change | Bene/f.shortits % change (4) | CDP/STI % change   |\n| CEOs (1)             | Mike Henry             | 0                          | 0                        | 0                  | 0                          | 67                           | 20                 |\n|                      | Andrew Mackenzie       | 0                          | 10                       | 100                | -                          | -                            | -                  |\n| Non-executive        | Terry Bowen            | 2                          | 33                       | -                  | 17                         | (90)                         | -                  |\n| Directors            | Malcolm Broomhead      | (5)                        | (53)                     | -                  | (3)                        | (84)                         | -                  |\n|                      | Xiaoqun Clever (2)     | 0                          | 0                        | -                  | 0                          | 0                            | -                  |\n|                      | Ian Cockerill (2)      | 0                          | 0                        | -                  | 0                          | (100)                        | -                  |\n|                      | Anita Frew             | 0                          | (2)                      | -                  | 0                          | (96)                         | -                  |\n|                      | Gary Goldberg (2)      | 0                          | 0                        | -                  | 14                         | (87)                         | -                  |\n|                      | Carolyn Hewson (3)     | 0                          | 0                        | -                  | -                          | -                            | -                  |\n|                      | Susan Kilsby (2)       | 0                          | 0                        | -                  | 7                          | (99)                         | -                  |\n|                      | Ken MacKenzie          | 0                          | 25                       | -                  | 0                          | (90)                         | -                  |\n|                      | Lindsay Maxsted (3)    | (2)                        | (44)                     | -                  | 0                          | 0                            | -                  |\n|                      | John Mogford           | 6                          | 13                       | -                  | 8                          | (97)                         | -                  |\n|                      | Christine O'Reilly (2) | 0                          | 0                        | -                  | 0                          | 0                            | -                  |\n|                      | Shriti Vadera (3)      | 0                          | 0                        | -                  | 0                          | 0                            | -                  |\n|                      | Dion Weisler (2)       | 0                          | 0                        | -                  | 0                          | 0                            | -                  |\n| Australian employees |                        | 2                          | (7)                      | 43                 | 3                          | (36)                         | 3                  |\n\n- (1)  The per cent changes for Mike Henry from FY2019 to FY2020 are zero due to his appointment as CEO on 1 January 2020.

The per cent changes for Andrew Mackenzie from FY2019 to FY2020 are based on annualised FY2020 /f.shortigures.\n- (2)  The per cent changes in remuneration from FY2019 to FY2020 are zero as there were no changes made to the remuneration of Non-executive Directors who joined the Board during FY2019 (Ian/uni00A0Cockerill and Susan Kilsby both joined on 1 April 2019). The per cent changes in remuneration from FY2020 to FY2021 are zero as there were no changes made to the remuneration of Non-executive Directors who joined the Board in FY2021 (Xiaoqun Clever and Christine O'Reilly joined on 1 October 2020 and 12 October 2020 respectively). The per cent changes for Gary Goldberg/uni00A0and Dion Weisler from FY2020 to FY2021 are based on annualised FY2020 /f.shortigures as they joined the Board on 1 February 2020 and 1 June 2020 respectively.\n- (3)  The per cent changes in remuneration from FY2019 to FY2020 for Carolyn Hewson are zero as there were no changes made to her remuneration up to the date of her retirement from the Board on 7 November 2019.

The FY2021 CEO remuneration used in the calculation is the reported single total /f.short igure of remuneration data for Mike Henry. The remuneration calculation for all employees is based on actual earnings for the 12 months to 31 March",

Pension contributions are calculated as the total cost of contributions made by the Group over the 12-month period. Employees on international assignments have been excluded from the analysis as their remuneration structures are generally not consistent with the single total /f.shortigure of remuneration for the CEO. The FY2020 CEO remuneration used in the calculation is a combination of reported single total /f.shortigure of remuneration data/uni00A0for Mike Henry and Andrew Mackenzie, recognising the transition in CEO leadership during FY2020.\n\nThe FY2021 ratio of 129:1 at the median compared to the FY2020 ratio of 81:1 re/f.shortlects the proportion of the CEO's pay being more heavily weighted to variable pay, including share-based long-term incentives, than for other employees. Speci/f.shortically, the change from FY2020 to FY2021 is driven by a higher FY2021 CDP outcome of 115 per cent against a target of 100 per cent compared to the CDP outcome of 96 per cent in FY2020, together with the/uni00A0100 per cent LTIP vesting for FY2021 at a BHP Group Limited share price of A$47.70 per share, whereas there was 48 per cent LTIP vesting for/uni00A0FY2020/uni00A0at a BHP Group Limited share price of A$39.06 per share.\n\nThe Group believes the median pay ratio re/f.shortlects the diversity of our global business footprint and employee population. BHP's remuneration policies and practices are based on a high degree of alignment and consistency, with total remuneration at all levels providing a competitive package that enables the attraction and retention of talent while also providing at-risk remuneration based on performance.\n\n## Remuneration for the CEO in FY2022\n\nThe remuneration for the CEO in FY2022 will be in accordance with the remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the AGMs in 2019.\n\n## Base salary review\n\nBase salary is reviewed annually and increases are applicable from 1 September. The CEO commenced in the role on 1 January 2020 and did not receive a base salary increase in September 2021 and it will remain unchanged at US$1.700 million per annum for FY2022. The CEO's base salary will be kept under review in future years to ensure it remains competitive, especially in light of recent movement in exchange rates against the US dollar.\n\n## FY2022 CDP performance measures\n\nFor FY2022, the Remuneration Committee has set the following CDP scorecard performance measures:\n\n| Performance  categories   | Weighting   | Target measures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|---------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| HSEC                      | 25%         | The following HSEC performance measures are designed to incentivise achievement of the Group's public /f.shortive-year HSEC targets.

These include projects and initiatives in respect  of social value (long term growth in value and returns for all stakeholders), people (right people, right skills, coming together in the right way  to support exceptional performance), performance (material improvement in the system that supports exceptional performance) and  portfolio (material progress on our strategic objectives to create a winning portfolio and set BHP up for the next 20 years).  These performance measures are aligned with medium and long-term strategy aspirations that are intended to drive long-term value  for shareholders and other stakeholders. |\n\n## FY2022 LTIP award\n\nThe maximum face value of the CEO's LTIP award under the remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the 2019 AGMs is US$3.400 million, being 200 per cent of the CEO's base salary. The number of LTIP awards in FY2022 has been determined using the share price and US$/A$ exchange rate over the 12 months up to and including 30 June 2021. Based on this, a FY2022 grant of 107,183 LTIP awards is proposed and approval for this LTIP grant will be sought from shareholders at the 2021 AGMs. If approved, the award will be granted following the AGMs (i.e. in or around November/December 2021 subject to securities dealing considerations). The FY2022 LTIP award will use the same performance and service conditions and comparator groups/uni00A0as/uni00A0the FY2021 LTIP award.\n\n## Remuneration for other Executive KMP (excluding the CEO)\n\nThe information in this section contains details of the remuneration policy that guided the Remuneration Committee's decisions and resulted in the remuneration outcomes for other Executive KMP (excluding the CEO). The remuneration policy and structures for other Executive KMP are essentially the same as those already described for the CEO in previous sections of the Remuneration Report, including the treatment of remuneration on loss of/uni00A0o/ff.shortice as detailed in 'Service contracts and policy on loss of o/ff.shortice' in section 2.2.2.\n\n## Components of remuneration\n\nThe components of remuneration for other Executive KMP are the same as for the CEO, with any di/fferences described below.\n\n## CDP\n\nThe CDP performance measures for other Executive KMP for FY2021 are similar to those of the CEO, which are outlined in 'FY2021 CDP performance outcomes' in this section 2.2.3; however, the weighting of each performance measure will vary to re/f.shortlect the focus required from each Executive KMP role.\n\nIndividual performance measures are determined at the start of the /f.shortinancial year. These include the other Executive KMP's contribution to the delivery of projects and initiatives within the scope of their role and the overall performance of the Group. Individual performance of other Executive KMP was reviewed against these measures by the Committee and, on average, was considered slightly above target.",

Awards for other Executive KMP will have a maximum face value of 175 per cent of base salary, which is a fair value of 72 per cent of base salary under the current plan design (with a fair value of 41 per cent, taking into account the performance condition: 175 per cent x 41 per cent = 72 per cent).\n\nOther Executive KMP who were promoted from executive roles within BHP may hold MAP awards that were granted to them in respect of their service in/uni00A0non-KMP roles.\n\n## Shareplus\n\nOther Executive KMP are eligible to participate in Shareplus. For administrative simplicity, Executive KMP, including the CEO, do not currently participate in Shareplus. No Executive KMP, including the CEO, had any holdings under the Shareplus program during FY2021.\n\n## Remuneration mix\n\nA signi/f.shorticant portion of other Executive KMP remuneration is at-risk, in order to provide strong alignment between remuneration outcomes and the interests of BHP shareholders.\n\nThe diagram below sets out the relative mix of each remuneration component for the other Executive KMP for FY2021. Each component is determined as a percentage of base salary (at the minimum, target and maximum levels of performance-based remuneration).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1)  Base salary earned by each Executive KMP is set out in 'Executive KMP remuneration table' in this section 2.2.3.\n- (2)  Retirement bene/f.shortits are 10 per cent of base salary for other Executive KMP, with the exception of Geraldine Slattery. From FY2021, contribution rates for Geraldine reduced to 20 per cent of base salary in accordance with the remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the 2019 AGMs (progressive reduction to 10 per cent of base salary as follows: 15 per cent of base salary from 1 July 2021; and 10 per cent of base salary from 1 July 2022 onwards). For any new Executive KMP appointments, the pension contribution rate will be 10 per cent of base salary immediately.\n- (3)  Other bene/f.shortits are based on a notional 10 per cent of base salary.\n- (4)  As for the CEO, the minimum CDP award is zero, with a cash award of 80 per cent of base salary plus two awards of deferred shares each of equivalent value to the cash award, vesting in two and /f.shortive years respectively, for target performance on all measures, and a maximum cash award of 120 per cent base salary plus two awards of deferred shares each of equivalent value to the cash award, vesting in two and /f.shortive years respectively.\n- (5)  Other Executive KMP have a maximum LTIP award with a face value of 175 per cent of base salary.\n\n## Employment contracts\n\nThe terms of employment for other Executive KMP are formalised in employment contracts, which have no /f.shortixed term. They typically outline the components of remuneration paid to the individual, but do not prescribe how remuneration levels are to be modi/f.shortied from year to year. Other Executive KMP's employment contracts may be terminated by BHP on up to 12 months' notice or can be terminated immediately by BHP making a payment of up to 12 months' base salary plus pension contributions for the relevant period. Other Executive KMP must give up to 12 months' notice for voluntary resignation.\n\n## Arrangements for KMP leaving and joining the Group KMP leaving the Group\n\nThe arrangements for Executive KMP leaving the Group are within the approval provided by shareholders at the 2020 AGMs in regard to Australian termination bene/f.shortits legislation, including the provision of performance-based remuneration in accordance with the rules of the relevant incentive plans.\n\nPeter Beaven stepped down from his role as Chief Financial O/ff.shorticer on 30 November 2020 and exited BHP on 28 February 2021. Daniel Malchuk stepped down from his role as President Minerals Americas on 31 October 2020 and exited BHP on 31 December 2020. Peter and Daniel received base salary, pension/uni00A0contributions, prorated CDP, statutory leave entitlements and applicable bene/f.shortits up to the dates of their exit from BHP.\n\nPeter and Daniel received a part payment in lieu of notice upon exit and have been paid or will receive in the future the value of pension funds that they have accumulated during their service with the Group. When determining the Executive KMP CDP awards for FY2021, the Remuneration Committee resolved that Peter and Daniel would each receive a prorated FY2021 CDP award in the form of cash based on their performance (covering the cash and two-year deferred share components, but not the /f.shortive-year deferred share component). No deferral period will apply in respect of these CDP awards.\n\nAll unvested FY2019 STIP and FY2020 CDP two-year deferred share awards allocated to Peter and Daniel remained on foot on termination. FY2019 STIP deferred share awards vested in August 2021 and FY2020 CDP two-year deferred share awards will not vest until August 2022. Peter's and Daniel's unvested LTIP awards and CDP /f.shortive-year deferred shares were prorated to re/f.shortlect the percentage of the performance period to 28 February 2021 for Peter and 31 December 2020 for Daniel. The vesting of the retained prorated LTIP awards will be determined by the Committee at the relevant time in future years and/uni00A0will only vest to the extent the performance conditions are met at the end of each /f.shortive-year performance period. The vesting of LTIP awards and CDP/uni00A0/f.shortive-year deferred share awards are subject to the Committee's ability to reduce vesting through its discretion under the plan rules.",

        "page_content": "## KMP joining the Group\n\nDavid Lamont joined BHP as Chief Financial O/ff.shorticer on 1 December 2020. David left his former employer, CSL Limited, a major Australian company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, on 30 October 2020. As a consequence of his resignation certain CSL incentive awards, which were expected to have been paid or vested in 2021 and beyond, were foregone.\n\nReplacement BHP awards have been provided in accordance with BHP's remuneration policy (approved by shareholders in 2019 with almost 94 per cent support) under which a new senior executive appointed from outside BHP can be provided cash and/or BHP equity awards to replace any remuneration forfeited or not received from the former employer. In accordance with that policy, remuneration that David forfeited or did not receive as a consequence of leaving CSL to join BHP has been partly replaced as set out in the table below.\n\nThe value of the BHP awards is less than the fair value of the awards foregone (as con/f.shortirmed by the Committee's independent adviser), and the duration of the BHP awards is longer, on average, than those they replace. The Committee has determined appropriate service and performance conditions within BHP's framework, considering the vesting status of the conditions attached to the foregone awards. As always, the Committee has been mindful of limiting such payments and not providing any more compensation than is necessary and, under BHP's incentive plans, retains the right to adjust vesting outcomes where an inappropriate bene/f.shortit would be received.\n\nThe BHP awards provided are set out in the table below.\n\n| Award                | Amount/number Payable/vesting   |                    | Release            | Conditions                                                                                                                                                                                   | Replaces                                                                                                   |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Cash                 | US$300,000                      | September 2021 (1) | September 2022 (1) | Nil                                                                                                                                                                                          | Replaces a cash bonus payment  foregone that would have been  payable in September 2021                    |\n| Performance   shares | 77,000                          | August 2022 (2)    | August 2023 (2)    | Service and performance conditions, being  subject to a holistic assessment of underlying  /f.short inancial performance of BHP and personal  performance of David during the vesting period | Partly replaces equity awards  foregone that would have been  paid and vested to David in 2021  and beyond |\n\n- (1)  Should David voluntarily resign or retire during the holding lock period, or be terminated for cause, the cash payment would become repayable on a pro-rata basis.\n- (2)  Upon performance shares vesting in August 2022, a holding lock will apply to the vested shares until August 2023, at which time they will be released to David. Should David voluntarily resign or retire during the holding lock period, or be terminated for cause, the shares subject to the holding lock will be forfeited.\n\n## Remuneration for Non-executive Directors\n\nThe remuneration outcomes described below have been provided in accordance with the remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the 2019 AGMs. The maximum aggregate fees payable to Non-executive Directors (including the Chair) were approved by shareholders at the 2008 AGMs at US$3.800 million per annum. This sum includes base fees, Committee fees and pension contributions. Travel allowances and non-monetary bene/f.shortits are not included in this limit.\n\n## Single total /f.shortigure of remuneration\n\nThis section shows a single total /f.shortigure of remuneration as prescribed under UK requirements. It is a measure of actual remuneration. Fees include the annual base fee, plus additional fees as applicable for the Senior Independent Director, Committee Chair and Committee memberships. Non-executive Directors do/uni00A0not have any performance-based at-risk remuneration or receive any equity awards as part of their remuneration, therefore the totals shown below are total remuneration and total /f.shortixed fees.

Fee levels for the Nonexecutive Directors and the Chair are reviewed annually. The review includes benchmarking against peer companies, with the assistance of external advisers.\n\nFrom 1 July 2017, the Chair's annual fee was reduced by approximately 8 per cent from US$0.960 million to US$0.880 million and will remain at that level for FY2022. This fee reduction was in addition to the reduction of approximately 13 per cent from US$1.100 million to US$0.960 million e/ffective 1 July 2015. Base fee levels for Non-executive Directors will remain at the reduced levels that took e/ffect from 1 July 2015, at which time they were reduced by/uni00A0approximately 6 per cent from US$0.170 million to US$0.160 million per annum.

In performing this function, it is critical the Board is independent of management when making decisions a/ffecting remuneration of the CEO, other Executive KMP and the Group's employees. The Board has therefore established a Remuneration Committee to assist it in making such decisions. The Committee is comprised solely of Non-executive Directors, all of whom are independent. To ensure it is fully informed, the Committee regularly invites members of management to attend meetings to provide reports and updates; however, members of management are not present when decisions are considered or/uni00A0taken/uni00A0concerning their/uni00A0own remuneration. The Committee can draw on services from a range of external sources, including remuneration advisers.\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nThe activities of the Remuneration Committee are governed by Terms of Reference (updated version approved by the Board in April 2021), which are available at bhp.com. The current members of the Remuneration Committee are: Christine O'Reilly (Remuneration Committee Chair), Anita Frew, Gary Goldberg, Susan Kilsby, and Dion Weisler. The role and focus of the Committee and details of meeting attendances can be found in section 2.1. Other Directors and employees who regularly attended meetings were: Ken MacKenzie (Chair), Mike Henry (CEO), Athalie Williams (Chief People O/ff.shorticer), Andrew Fitzgerald (Vice/uni00A0President Reward), Caroline Cox (Group Company Secretary to 31 October 2020), Stefanie Wilkinson (Group Company Secretary from 1 March 2021), Geof Stapledon (Vice President Governance to 31 March 2021), and Prakash Kakkad (Head of Group Governance from 1 June 2021). These individuals were not present when decisions regarding their own remuneration were considered or taken.\n\nWhen determining executive director remuneration practices, the Remuneration Committee considers any decisions in the context of the principles of/uni00A0the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, including:\n\n| Principle                      | How the Remuneration Committee has applied the principle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Clarity                        | BHP engages proactively with shareholders on remuneration matters. Feedback from shareholders is used by the Remuneration Committee  in its decision-making in respect of the remuneration policy and its application. The Group also conducts regular employee engagement  surveys which give employees an opportunity to provide feedback on a wide range of employee matters. Many employees are also ordinary  shareholders through Shareplus and therefore have the opportunity to share their views as shareholders. |\n| Simplicity                     | The purpose, structure and strategic alignment of each element of remuneration is clearly set out in section 2.2.2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Risk                           | A signi/f.shorticant portion of variable remuneration is at-risk in order to provide strong alignment between remuneration outcomes and the  interests of BHP shareholders.

In addition, the Remuneration  Committee has discretion to adjust formulaic outcomes downwards to ensure that poor performance is not rewarded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Alignment  with/uni00A0culture | The FY2021 CDP performance measures for the CEO include a number of measures linked to culture including the delivery of social value  plans for assets, improving gender diversity and embedding a new Engagement and Perception Survey system.

Remuneration consultants are engaged by and report directly to the Committee. Potential con/f.shortlicts of interest are taken into account when remuneration consultants are selected and their terms of engagement regulate their level of access to, and require their independence from BHP's management.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers was appointed by the Committee in March 2016 to act as an independent remuneration adviser. The PricewaterhouseCoopers team that advises the Remuneration Committee does not provide any other services to the Group. Other PricewaterhouseCoopers teams provide services",

PricewaterhouseCoopers is currently the only remuneration adviser appointed by the Committee.

The amounts that vested and were lapsed for the awards during FY2021 are as follows: STIP - 100 per cent vested; LTIP - 48 per cent vested and 52 per cent lapsed; MAP - 100 per cent vested.\n- (5)  The opening balances of awards for Edgar Basto, David Lamont and Ragnar Udd re/f.shortlect their holdings on the date that each became KMP, being 1 July 2020, 1 December 2020 and 1 November 2020 respectively.\n\n## Estimated value range of equity awards\n\nThe current face value (and estimate of the maximum possible total value) of equity awards allocated during FY2021 and yet to vest are the awards as set/uni00A0out in the previous table multiplied by the current share price of BHP Group Limited or BHP Group Plc as applicable. The minimum possible total value of the awards is nil.\n\nThe actual value that may be received by participants in the future cannot be determined as it is dependent on and therefore /f.shortluctuates with the share prices of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc at the date that any particular award vests or is exercised.

The MSR is tested at the time that shares are to be sold. Shares may be sold to satisfy tax obligations arising from the granting, holding, vesting, exercise/uni00A0or sale of the employee awards or the underlying shares whether the MSR is satis/f.shortied at that time or not.\n\n## For FY2021:\n\n- -  The MSR for the CEO was /f.shortive times annual pre-tax base salary. At the end of FY2021, the CEO met the MSR.\n- -  The MSR for other Executive KMP was three times annual pre-tax base salary. At the end of FY2021, the other Executive KMP met the MSR, except for/uni00A0David Lamont, as he was appointed as Executive KMP on 1 December 2020.\n- -  No other Executive KMP sold or purchased shares during FY2021, other than sales to satisfy taxation obligations and a net immaterial purchase for/uni00A0Edgar Basto.\n\nE/ffective 1 July 2020, a two-year post-retirement shareholding requirement for the CEO applies from the date of retirement, which will be the lower of/uni00A0the CEO's MSR or the CEO's actual shareholding at the date of retirement.\n\nSubject to securities dealing constraints, Non-executive Directors have agreed to apply at least 25 per cent of their remuneration (base fees plus Committee fees) to the purchase of BHP shares until they achieve an MSR equivalent in value to one year of remuneration (base fees plus Committee fees). Thereafter, they must maintain at least that level of shareholding throughout their tenure. At the end of FY2021, each Non-executive Director met the MSR with the exception of Susan Kilsby, Dion Weisler and Christine O'Reilly as they only recently joined the Board on 1 April 2019, 1 June 2020 and 12 October 2020, respectively. As at the date of this Report, Susan, Dion and Christine each met the MSR.",

In addition, for the purposes of UK law, the Strategic Report in section 1 and the Remuneration Report in section 2.2 form separate reports and have been separately approved by the Board for that purpose.\n\nFor the purpose of the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) Listing Rule 9.8.4C R, the applicable information required to be disclosed in accordance with/uni00A0FCA Listing Rule 9.8.4 R is set out in the sections below.\n\n| Applicable information required by FCA Listing Rule 9.8.4 R   | Section in this Annual Report                 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| (1) Interest capitalised by the Group                         | Section 3, note 22 'Net /f.shortinance costs' |\n\nParagraphs (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13) and (14) of Listing Rule 9.8.4 R are not applicable.\n\nThe Directors con/f.shortirm, on the advice of the Risk and Audit Committee (RAC), that they consider the Annual Report (including the Financial Statements), taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess BHP's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\n## 2.3.1  Review of operations, principal activities and state of a/ffairs\n\nA review of the operations of BHP during FY2021, the results of those operations during FY2021 and the expected results of those operations in future /f.short inancial years are set out in section 1, in particular in 1.2 to 1.15, 1.17 and 1.18 and in other material in this Annual Report. Information on the development of/uni00A0BHP and likely developments in future years also appears in those sections. We have excluded certain information from the Strategic Report in section 1 (which forms part of this Directors' Report), to the extent permitted by UK and Australian law, on the basis that such information relates to impending developments or matters in the course of negotiation and disclosure would be seriously prejudicial to the interests of BHP. This is because such disclosure could be misleading due to the fact it is premature or preliminary in nature, relates to commercially sensitive contracts, would undermine con/f.shortidentiality between BHP and our suppliers and clients, or would otherwise unreasonably damage BHP. The categories of information omitted include forward looking estimates and projections prepared for internal management purposes, information regarding BHP's assets and projects, which/uni00A0is developing and susceptible to change, and information relating to commercial contracts and pricing modules.\n\nOur principal activities during FY2021 are disclosed in section 1. We are among the world's top producers of major commodities, including iron ore, metallurgical coal and copper. We also have substantial interests in oil, gas and energy coal. No signi/f.shorticant changes in the nature of BHP's principal activities occurred during FY2021 other than as disclosed in section 1. There were no signi/f.shorticant changes in BHP's state of a/ffairs that occurred during FY2021 and no signi/f.shorticant post balance date events other than as disclosed in section 1 and note 35 'Subsequent events' in section 3. No other matter or circumstance has arisen since the end of FY2021 that has signi/f.shorticantly a/ffected or is expected to signi/f.shorticantly a/ffect the operations, the results of operations or state of a/ffairs of BHP in future years.\n\n## 2.3.2  Share capital and buy-back programs\n\nAt the Annual General Meetings held in 2019 and 2020, shareholders authorised BHP Group Plc to make on-market purchases of up to 211,207,180 of its ordinary shares, representing 10 per cent of BHP Group Plc's issued share capital at that time. During FY2021, we did not make any on-market or o/ffmarket purchases of BHP Group Limited or BHP Group Plc shares under any share buy-back program. As at the date of this Directors' Report, there were no current on-market buy-backs. Shareholders will be asked at the 2021 Annual General Meetings to renew this authority. As at the date of this Directors' Report, there is no intention to exercise this authority.\n\nSome of our executives receive rights over BHP shares as part of their remuneration arrangements. Entitlements may be satis/f.shortied by the transfer of existing shares, which are acquired on-market by the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trusts or, in respect of some entitlements, by the issue of shares.\n\nThe number of shares referred to in column A below were purchased to satisfy awards made under the various BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc employee share schemes during FY2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                           | A Total number  of shares purchased  and transferred to  employees to satisfy  employee awards   | B Average price paid  per share (1)   | C Total number of shares  purchased as part of  publicly announced  plans or programs   | Maximum number of shares that may yet be  purchased under the plans or programs   | Maximum number of shares that may yet be  purchased under the plans or programs   |    |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|\n| Period                    |                                                                                                  | US$                                   |                                                                                         | BHP Group Limited (2)                                                             | BHP Group Plc                                                                     |    |\n| 1 Jul 2020 to 31 Jul 2020 | -

For details of her quali/f.shortications and experience, refer to section 2.1.2. The following people also acted during FY2021 as Company Secretaries of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc: Caroline Cox BA (Hons), MA, LLB, BCL until 1 March 2021, Rachel Agnew, BComm (Economics), LLB (Hons), GAICD, until 1 September 2020 and Geof Stapledon, BEc, LLB (Hons), DPhil, FCIS.\n\nGeof Stapledon resigned as Company Secretary of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc with e/ffect from 7 July 2021. Prakash Kakkad, LLB, LPC was/uni00A0appointed as a Company Secretary of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc and John-Paul Santamaria, BEng (Civil) (Hons), LLB was appointed as/uni00A0a Company Secretary of BHP Group Limited, in each case with e/ffect from 7 July 2021.\n\nEach individual has experience in a company secretariat role or other relevant /f.shortields arising from time spent in roles within BHP, other large listed companies or other relevant entities.\n\n## 2.3.7  Indemnities and insurance\n\nRule 146 of the BHP Group Limited Constitution and Article 146 of the BHP Group Plc Articles of Association require each company to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each O/ff.shorticer of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc, respectively, against liability incurred in, or arising out of, the conduct of the business of BHP or the discharge of the duties of the O/ff.shorticer. The Directors named in section 2.1.2, the Company Secretaries and other O/ff.shorticers of/uni00A0BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc have the bene/f.shortit of this requirement, as do individuals who formerly held one of those positions.\n\nIn accordance with this requirement, BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc have entered into Deeds of Indemnity, Access and Insurance (Deeds of Indemnity) with each of their respective Directors. The Deeds of Indemnity are qualifying third party indemnity provisions for the purposes of the UK Companies Act 2006 and each of these qualifying third party indemnities was in force as at the date of this Directors' Report.\n\nWe have a policy that BHP will, as a general rule, support and hold harmless an employee, including an employee appointed as a Director of a subsidiary who, while acting in good faith, incurs personal liability to others as a result of working for BHP.\n\nIn addition, as part of the arrangements to e/ffect the demerger of South32, we agreed to indemnify certain former O/ff.shorticers of BHP who transitioned to/uni00A0South32 from certain claims and liabilities incurred in their capacity as Directors or O/ff.shorticers of South32.\n\nFrom time to time, we engage our External Auditor, Ernst & Young (EY), to conduct non-statutory audit work and provide other services in accordance with our policy on the provision of other services by the External Auditor. The terms of engagement in the United Kingdom include that we must compensate and reimburse EY LLP for, and protect EY LLP against, any loss, damage, expense, or liability incurred by EY LLP in respect of third party claims arising from a breach by BHP of any obligation under the engagement terms. In Australia, the terms of engagement for certain services include that we must compensate and reimburse EY for, and protect EY against, any loss, damage, expense, or liability incurred by EY in respect of third party claims arising from a breach by BHP of any obligation under the engagement terms.\n\nWe have insured against amounts that we may be liable to pay to Directors, Company Secretaries or certain employees (including former O/ff.shorticers) pursuant to Rule 146 of the Constitution of BHP Group Limited and Article 146 of the Articles of Association of BHP Group Plc or that we otherwise agree to pay by way of indemnity. The insurance policy also insures Directors, Company Secretaries and some employees (including former O/ff.shorticers) against certain liabilities (including legal costs) they may incur in carrying out their duties. For this Directors' and O/ff.shorticers' insurance, we paid premiums of US$24,114,600 excluding taxes during FY2021.\n\nDuring FY2021, BHP paid legal defence costs for certain current and former employees of BHP or BHP Brasil in relation to the criminal charges /f.shortiled by the Federal Prosecutors' O/ff.shortice in Brazil. In addition, BHP paid legal defence costs for Roger Gilbertson, a former BHP Bolivia country manager, in/uni00A0connection with the Bolivian authorities' decision to criminally prosecute two former presidents of Bolivia and a number of former international oil/uni00A0company executives in relation to exploration and production contracts entered into between 1994 and 1997.\n\nOther than as set out above, no indemnity in favour of a current or former o/ff.shorticer of BHP Group Limited or BHP Group Plc, or in favour of the External Auditor, was called on during FY2021.\n\n## 2.3.8  Employee policies\n\nOur people are fundamental to our success. We are committed to shaping a culture where our employees are provided with opportunities to develop, are valued and encouraged to contribute towards making work safer, simpler and more productive. We strongly believe that having employees who are/uni00A0engaged and connected to BHP reinforces our shared purpose aligned to Our Charter and will result in a more productive workplace.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on employee engagement and employee policies, including communications and regarding disabilities\n\nrefer to section 1.14, 1.12 and in 'Workforce engagement' in section 2.1.6",

BHP has an existing practice of issuing a corporate governance statement as part of our Annual Report that is incorporated into the Directors' Report by reference. The information required by the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the FCA's Listing Rules (LR 9.8.6) is located in section 2, with the exception of the information referred to in LR 9.8.6 (1), (3) and (4) and DTR 7.2.6, which is located in sections 2.3.2, 2.3.3, 'Directors' in section 2.3.5 and 2.3.18.\n\n## 2.3.10  Dividends\n\nA /f.shortinal dividend of 200 US cents per share will be paid on 21 September 2021, resulting in total dividends determined in respect of FY2021 of 301 US/uni00A0cents per share. For information on the dividends paid, refer to notes 16 'Share capital' and 18 'Dividends' in section 3.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For information on the Group's dividend policy refer to section 4.10.7\n\n## 2.3.11  Auditors\n\nA copy of the declaration given by our External Auditor to the Directors in relation to the auditors' compliance with the independence requirements of/uni00A0the Australian Corporations Act 2001 and the Professional Code of Conduct for External Auditors is set out in section 3.5.\n\nNo current o/ff.shorticer of BHP has held the role of director or partner of the Group's current external auditor. During FY2021, Lindsay Maxsted was the only o/ff.shorticer of BHP who, prior to his appointment as an o/ff.shorticer of BHP, previously held the role of director or partner of the Group's former external auditor, at/uni00A0a time when the Group's former external auditor conducted an audit of BHP. KPMG resigned as BHP's external auditor on 7 November 2019 following the conclusion of the 2019 AGMs, in order to comply with UK and EU requirements on auditor tenure. Lindsay Maxsted was not part of the KPMG audit practice after 1980 and, while at KPMG, was not in any way involved in, or able to in/f.shortluence, any audit activity associated with BHP. Lindsay Maxsted retired as a Non-executive Director of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc on 4 September 2020.\n\nEach person who held the o/ff.shortice of Director at the date the Board approved this Directors' Report made the following statements:\n\n- -  so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which BHP's External Auditor is unaware\n- -  the Director has taken all steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director to make him or herself aware of any relevant audit information and/uni00A0to/uni00A0establish that BHP's External Auditor is aware of that information\n\nThis con/f.shortirmation is given pursuant to section 418 of the UK Companies Act 2006 and should be interpreted in accordance with, and subject to, those provisions.\n\nConsistent with the then applicable UK and EU requirements in regard to audit /f.shortirm tender and rotation, BHP conducted an audit tender during FY2017.\n\nAfter a comprehensive tender process, at a meeting held on 16 August 2017, the Board selected EY as its independent registered public accounting /f.short irm/uni00A0from the /f.shortinancial year beginning 1 July 2019, and our shareholders approved EY's appointment at the Annual General Meetings in 2019.\n\n## 2.3.12  Non-audit services\n\nInformation on the non-audit services undertaken by BHP's External Auditor, including the amounts paid for non-audit services, refer to note 36 'Auditor's remuneration' in section 3. All non-audit services were approved in accordance with the process set out in the Policy on Provision of Audit and Other Services by the External Auditor. No non-audit services were carried out that were speci/f.shortically excluded by the Policy on Provision of Audit and Other Services by the External Auditor. Based on advice provided by the RAC, the Directors have formed the view that the provision of non-audit services is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors, and that the nature of non-audit services means that auditor independence was not compromised. For a statement of the reasons for this view and for more information about our policy in relation to/uni00A0the/uni00A0provision/uni00A0of non-audit services by the auditor, refer to section 2.1.10.\n\n## 2.3.13  Political donations\n\nWe maintain a position of impartiality with respect to party politics and do not make political contributions or expenditure/donations for political purposes to any political party, politician, elected o/ff.shorticial or candidate for public o/ff.shortice. We do, however, contribute to the public debate of policy issues/uni00A0that may a/ffect BHP in the countries in which we operate.\n\nNo political contributions/donations for political purposes were made by BHP to any political party, politician, elected o/ff.shorticial or candidate for public o/ff.shortice during FY2021.

Details are provided in/uni00A0sections/uni00A01.10 to 1.17 and 4.6.\n\n## 2.3.15  ASIC Instrument 2016/191\n\nBHP Group Limited is an entity to which Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191 dated 24 March 2016 applies. Amounts in this Directors' Report and the Financial Statements, except estimates of future/uni00A0expenditure or where otherwise indicated, have been rounded to the nearest million dollars in accordance with ASIC Instrument 2016/191.\n\n## 2.3.16  Proceedings on behalf of BHP Group Limited\n\nNo proceedings have been brought on behalf of BHP Group Limited, nor has any application been made, under section 237 of the Australian Corporations Act 2001.",

One /f.shortine was received in South America, at the Spence Mine for incorrect waste storage (US$4,593).\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption\n\nRegulations made under the UK Companies Act 2006 require BHP, to the extent practicable, to obtain relevant information on the Group's annual quantity of greenhouse gas emissions, which is reported in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, and the Group's energy consumption. In accordance with those UK requirements, information on BHP's total FY2021 greenhouse gas emissions and intensity and energy consumption has been included in/uni00A0sections 1.13.7 and 4.8.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on environmental performance, including environmental regulation, refer to section 1.13\n\n## 2.3.18  Share capital, restrictions on transfer of shares and other additional/uni00A0information\n\nInformation relating to BHP Group Plc's share capital structure, restrictions on the holding or transfer of its securities or on the exercise of voting rights attaching to such securities, certain agreements triggered on a change of control and the existence of branches of BHP outside of the United Kingdom, is set out in the following sections:\n\n- -  section 1.10.1 (Locations)\n- -  section 2.3.2 (Share capital and buy-back programs)\n- -  section 4.10.3 (Organisational structure)\n- -  section 4.10.4 (Material contracts)\n- -  section 4.10.5 (Constitution)\n- -  section 4.10.6 (Share ownership)\n- -  section 4.10.9 (Government regulations)\n- -  note 16 'Share capital' and note 25 'Employee share ownership plans' in section 3\n\nAs at the date of this Directors' Report, there were 13,607,440 unvested equity awards outstanding in relation to BHP Group Limited ordinary shares held by 18,942 holders and 324,504 unvested equity awards outstanding in relation to BHP Group Plc ordinary shares held by 1,015 holders.

Financial Statements of the BHP Group Plc parent entity are presented in section 3.2 'BHP Group Plc'\n- -  apply a presentation currency of US dollars, consistent with the predominant functional currency of the Group's operations. Amounts are rounded to the nearest million dollars, unless otherwise stated, in accordance with ASIC (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191\n- -  present reclassi/f.shortied comparative information where required for consistency with the current year's presentation\n- -  adopt all new and amended standards and interpretations under IFRS issued by the relevant bodies (listed above), that are mandatory for application in periods beginning on 1 July 2020. Those new and amended standards and interpretations did not require restatement of/uni00A0prior period /f.shortinancial information\n- -  early adopt amendments to IFRS 9/AASB 9 'Financial Instruments' (IFRS 9), IAS 39/AASB 139 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement' (IAS 39); IFRS 7/AASB 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' (IFRS 7); IFRS 4/AASB 4 'Insurance Contracts' (IFRS 4) and IFRS 16/AASB 16 'Leases' (IFRS 16) in relation to Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n- -  apply accounting policies consistently in all prior years presented including retrospective application of the Group's accounting policy change relating to Income Taxes. Refer to note 39 'New and amended accounting standards and interpretations and changes to accounting policies' for the impact on the Financial Statements\n- -  have not early adopted any other standards and interpretations that/uni00A0have been issued or amended but are not yet e/ffective\n\nThe accounting policies are consistently applied by all entities included in/uni00A0the Financial Statements.\n\n## Principles of consolidation\n\nIn preparing the Financial Statements the e/ffects of all intragroup balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nA list of signi/f.shorticant entities in the Group, including subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates at year-end is contained in note 30 'Subsidiaries', note 31 'Investments accounted for using the equity method' and note 32 'Interests in joint operations'.\n\nSubsidiaries: The Financial Statements of the Group include the consolidation of BHP Group Limited, BHP Group Plc and their respective subsidiaries, being the entities controlled by the parent entities during the/uni00A0year. Control exists where the Group:\n\n- -  is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with/uni00A0the entity\n- -  has the ability to a/ffect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity\n\nThe ability to approve the operating and capital budget of a subsidiary and the ability to appoint key management personnel are decisions that demonstrate that the Group has the existing rights to direct the relevant activities of a subsidiary. Where the Group's interest is less than 100 per cent, the interest attributable to outside shareholders is re/f.shortlected in noncontrolling interests. The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the Group's business combinations.\n\nJoint arrangements: The Group undertakes a number of business activities through joint arrangements, which exist when two or more parties have joint control. Joint arrangements are classi/f.shortied as either joint operations\n\nor/uni00A0joint ventures, based on the contractual rights and obligations between the parties to the arrangement:\n\n- -Joint operations: A joint operation is an arrangement in which the Group shares joint control, primarily via contractual arrangements with other parties. In a joint operation, the Group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. This includes situations where the parties bene/f.shortit from the joint activity through a share of the output, rather than by receiving a share of the results of trading. In relation to the Group's interest in a joint operation, the Group recognises: its assets and liabilities, including its share of any assets and liabilities held or incurred jointly; revenue from the sale of its share of the output and its share of any revenue generated from the sale of the output by the joint operation; and its expenses including its share of expenses incurred jointly. All such amounts are measured in accordance with the terms of the arrangement, which is usually in proportion to the Group's interest in the joint operation.\n- -Joint ventures: A joint venture is a joint arrangement in which the parties that share joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. A separate vehicle, not the parties, will have the rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. More than an insigni/f.shorticant share of output from a joint venture is sold to third parties, which indicates the joint venture is not dependent on the parties to the arrangement for funding, nor do the parties have an obligation for the liabilities of the arrangement. Joint ventures are accounted for using the/uni00A0equity accounting method.\n\nAssociates: The Group accounts for investments in associates using the equity accounting method. An entity is considered an associate where the Group is deemed to have signi/f.shorticant in/f.shortluence but not control or joint control. Signi/f.shorticant in/f.shortluence is presumed to exist where the Group:\n\n- -  has over 20 per cent but less than 50 per cent of the voting rights of an entity, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this is not the case or\n- -  holds less than 20 per cent of the voting rights of an entity; however, has the power to participate in the /f.shortinancial and operating policy decisions a/ffecting the entity\n\nThe Group uses the term 'equity accounted investments' to refer to joint ventures and associates collectively.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nTransactions related to the Group's worldwide operations are conducted in a number of foreign currencies. The majority of the subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates within each of the operations have assessed US dollars as the functional currency, however, some subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates have functional currencies/uni00A0other than US dollars.\n\nTransactions and monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into US dollars as follows:\n\n| Foreign currency item           | Applicable exchange rate       |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Transactions                    | Date of underlying transaction |\n| Monetary assets and liabilities | Period-end rate                |\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses resulting from translation are recognised in the income statement, except for qualifying cash /f.shortlow hedges (which are deferred to equity) and foreign exchange gains or losses on foreign currency provisions for site closure and rehabilitation costs (which are capitalised in property, plant and equipment for operating sites).\n\nOn consolidation, the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of non-US dollar denominated functional currency entities are translated into US dollars using the following applicable exchange rates:\n\n| Foreign currency amount   | Applicable exchange rate       |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Income and expenses       | Date of underlying transaction |\n| Assets and liabilities    | Period-end rate                |\n| Equity                    | Historical rate                |\n| Reserves                  | Historical rate                |\n\nForeign exchange di/fferences resulting from translation are initially recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve and subsequently transferred to the income statement on disposal of a foreign operation.",

        "page_content": "## Signi/f.shorticant accounting policies, judgements and/uni00A0estimates\n\nThe Group has identi/f.shortied a number of accounting policies under which signi/f.shorticant judgements, estimates and assumptions are made. All judgements, estimates and assumptions are based on the most current facts and circumstances and are reassessed on an ongoing basis. Actual results in future reporting periods may di/ffer for these estimates under di/fferent assumptions and conditions.\n\nSigni/f.shorticant judgements and key estimates and assumptions made in applying these accounting policies are embedded within the following notes:\n\n|   Note |                                                 |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------|\n|      4 | Signi/f.shorticant events - Samarco dam failure |\n|      6 | Taxation                                        |\n|     10 | Inventories                                     |\n|     11 | Exploration and evaluation                      |\n|     11 | Development expenditure                         |\n|     11 | Overburden removal costs                        |\n|     11 | Depreciation of property, plant and equipment   |\n|     13 | Impairments of non-current assets               |\n|     15 | Closure and rehabilitation provisions           |\n|     21 | Leases                                          |\n\nThe Samarco dam failure, impairment assessments and closure and rehabilitation provisions have been identi/f.shortied as areas involving signi/f.shorticant judgement and where changes to key estimates and assumptions may materially a/ffect /f.shortinancial results and the carrying amount of assets and liabilities to be reported in the next reporting period. Additional information including sensitivity analysis, where appropriate, has been provided in the relevant notes to enhance an understanding of the impact of key estimates and assumptions on the/uni00A0Group's /f.shortinancial position and performance.\n\n## Reserve estimates\n\nReserves are estimates of the amount of product that can be demonstrated to be able to be economically and legally extracted from/uni00A0the Group's properties. In order to estimate reserves, assumptions are required about a range of technical and economic factors, including\n\n## Impact of COVID/hyphen.uc19 pandemic\n\nThe Group continues to actively monitor the impact of the COVID/hyphen.uc19 pandemic, including the impact on economic activity and /f.shortinancial reporting. During the period the Group continued to experience lower volumes at certain of our operated assets and to incur incremental directly attributable costs including those associated with the increased provision of health and hygiene services, the impacts of maintaining social distancing requirements and demurrage and other standby charges related to delays caused by COVID/hyphen.uc19. These incremental costs have been classi/f.shortied as an exceptional item, as outlined in note 3 'Exceptional items'.\n\nAs the pandemic continues to evolve, with the extent and timing of impacts varying across the Group's key operating locations, it remains di/ff.shorticult to predict the full extent and duration of resulting operational and economic impacts for the Group. This uncertainty impacts judgements made by the Group, including those relating to assessing collectability of receivables and determining the recoverable values of the Group's non-current assets as outlined in notes 8 'Trade and other receivables' and 13 'Impairment of non-current assets', respectively. Given the uncertainty associated with the pandemic, management assesses the appropriate /f.shortinancial treatment and disclosure of COVID/hyphen.uc19 impacts each/uni00A0reporting period.\n\nThe ongoing uncertainty has also been considered in the Group's assessment of the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. In assessing the appropriateness of the going concern assumption over the going concern period, management have stress tested BHP's most recent /f.short inancial projections to incorporate a range of potential future outcomes by considering BHP's principal risks. The Group's /f.shortinancial forecasts, including downside commodity price and production scenarios, demonstrate that the Group believes that it has su/ff.shorticient /f.shortinancial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due throughout the going concern period. As such, the Consolidated Financial Statements continue/uni00A0to be prepared on the going concern basis.\n\n2\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nquantities, qualities, production techniques, recovery e/ff.shorticiency, production and transport costs, commodity supply and demand, commodity prices and exchange rates.\n\nEstimating the quantity and/or quality of reserves requires the size, shape and depth of ore bodies or oil and gas reservoirs to be determined by analysing geological data, such as drilling samples and geophysical survey interpretations. Economic assumptions used to estimate reserves change from period-to-period as additional technical and operational data is generated. This process may require complex and di/ff.shorticult geological judgements to interpret the data.\n\nAdditional information on the Group's mineral and oil and gas reserves and resources can be viewed within section 4.6.\n\nSection 4.6 is unaudited and does not form part of these Financial Statements.\n\n## Reserve impact on /f.shortinancial reporting\n\nEstimates of reserves may change from period-to-period as the economic assumptions used to estimate reserves change and additional geological data is generated during the course of operations. Changes in reserves may a/ffect the Group's /f.shortinancial results and /f.short inancial position in a number of ways, including:\n\n- -  asset carrying values may be a/ffected due to changes in estimated future production levels\n- -  depreciation, depletion and amortisation charged in the income statement may change where such charges are determined on the units of production basis, or where the useful economic lives of/uni00A0assets change\n- -  overburden removal costs recorded on the balance sheet or charged to the income statement may change due to changes in stripping ratios or the units of production basis of depreciation\n- -  closure and rehabilitation provisions may change where changes in/uni00A0estimated reserves a/ffect expectations about the timing or cost of/uni00A0these activities\n- -  the carrying amount of deferred tax assets may change due to changes in estimates of the likely recovery of the tax bene/f.shortits\n\n## Climate change\n\nThe Group continues to develop its assessment of the potential impacts of/uni00A0climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy. The Group's current climate change strategy focuses on reducing operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, investing in low emissions technologies, supporting emissions reductions in our value chain and promoting product stewardship, managing climate-related risk and opportunity, and working with others to enhance the global policy and market response. Future changes to the Group's climate change strategy or global decarbonisation signposts may impact the Group's signi/f.shorticant judgements and key estimates and result in material changes to /f.shortinancial results and the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities in future reporting periods.\n\nThe Group's current climate change strategy is re/f.shortlected in the Group's signi/f.shorticant judgements and key estimates, and therefore the Financial Statements, as follows:\n\n## Transition risks\n\n## The Group's targets and goals\n\nAs part of its response to the Paris Agreement goals, the Group has set a target to reduce its operational GHG emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 from our operated assets) by at least 30 per cent from FY2020 levels by FY2030 and a goal to achieve net zero operational GHG emissions by 2050. For the FY2030 target, the FY2020 baseline will be adjusted for any material acquisitions and divestments based on GHG emissions at the time of the transaction, and carbon o/ffsets will be used as required. Emissions reduction projects aimed at contributing to the achievement of the Group's operational GHG emissions target and goal have been incorporated into the forecast cash /f.shortlows of the Group's assets.",

        "page_content": "The Group's o/ffset strategy is currently being managed at a consolidated/uni00A0Group level and therefore is not currently incorporated into/uni00A0the forecast cash /f.shortlows of individual assets. Any change to the Group's climate change strategy could impact these forecasts and the/uni00A0Group's signi/f.shorticant judgements and key estimates.\n\nThe Group continues to invest, including in partnership with others, in emissions reduction projects and technology innovation and development in its value chain to support reductions to its total reported Scope 3 GHG emissions inventory. However, while we seek to in/f.shortluence, Scope 3 emissions occur outside of our direct control. Reduction pathways are dependent on the development and upstream or downstream deployment of solutions and/or supportive policy. It is therefore currently not possible to reliably estimate or measure the full/uni00A0potential /f.shortinancial statement impacts of the Group's pursuit of/uni00A0its/uni00A0Scope 3 goals and targets.\n\nExpenditure under the Climate Investment Program (CIP) which, as announced by the Group in July 2019, aims to invest at least US$400 million over the CIP's /f.shortive-year life in emissions reduction projects across the Group's operated assets and value chain, is recognised in the relevant year/uni00A0of expenditure.\n\n## Global transition signposts and commodity impacts\n\nIn addition to the Group's targets and goals, signi/f.shorticant judgements and key estimates are also impacted by the Group's current assessment of the range of economic and climate related conditions that could exist in transitioning to a low carbon economy, considering the current trajectory of society and the global economy as a whole. Despite recent progress, all 1.5\u00b0C pathways to 2050 represent a major departure from today's global trajectory and the Group does not believe the technological, regulatory, or economic foundations for a rapid transition to net zero emissions are currently in place. Acknowledging these signposts, the Group's current best estimate of the potential impacts of climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy are re/f.shortlected in the following two scenarios, which consider existing policies, trends and commitments and the Group's view of the most likely range of futures for the global economy and associated sub-systems:\n\n- -Central Energy View: re/f.shortlects, and is periodically updated to respond to, existing policy trends and commitments and currently tracks to approximately 3\u00b0C temperature increase above pre-industrial levels by 2100\n- -Lower Carbon View: currently tracks to approximately 2.5\u00b0C temperature increase by 2100, and accelerates decarbonisation trends/uni00A0and policies, particularly in easier-to-abate sectors such as/uni00A0power generation and light duty vehicles\n\nThese two scenarios are reviewed periodically to re/f.shortlect new information.\n\nThese scenarios are currently being used as inputs to the Group's planning cases, informing updates to the Group's supply, demand and price forecasts, capital allocation and portfolio decisions. As such, these scenarios impact certain signi/f.shorticant judgements and key estimates, including the determination of the valuation of assets and potential impairment charges (notes 11 'Property, plant and equipment' and 13 'Impairment of non-current assets'), the estimation of the remaining useful/uni00A0economic life of assets for depreciation purposes (note 11 'Property, plant and equipment'), the timing of closure and rehabilitation activities (note 15 'Closure and rehabilitation provisions') and the recoverability of/uni00A0certain deferred tax assets (note 14 'Deferred tax balances').\n\nThe Group continues to monitor global decarbonisation signposts and update its planning cases accordingly. Where such signposts indicate the appropriate measures are in place for achievement of a 1.5\u00baC Parisaligned scenario, this will be re/f.shortlected in the Group's planning cases.\n\n## Sensitivity to demand for fossil fuels\n\nThe Group acknowledges that there are a range of possible energy transition scenarios, including those that are aligned with the Paris Agreement goals, that may indicate di/fferent outcomes for individual commodities. While not currently an input to the Group's planning cases, the resilience of the Group's portfolio to a 1.5\u00b0C Paris-aligned scenario (the/uni00A0Group's 1.5\u00b0C Paris-aligned scenario) has been considered, including/uni00A0the impact of Paris-aligned commodity price outlooks under that scenario on the Group's latest asset plans.\n\nAlthough all potential /f.shortinancial reporting consequences under the Group's 1.5\u00b0C Paris-aligned scenario are currently impracticable to fully assess, the long-term commodity price outlooks under this scenario are either largely consistent with or favourable to the price outlooks in the Group's current planning cases, with the exception of energy coal, oil and natural gas.\n\nThere are inherent limitations with scenario analysis and it is di/ff.shorticult to predict which, if any, of the scenarios might eventuate and none of the scenarios considered constitutes a de/f.shortinitive outcome for the Group.\n\nThe long-term commodity price outlooks under the Group's 1.5\u00b0C Parisaligned scenario, excluding energy coal, oil and natural gas, re/f.shortlect:\n\n- -  Copper and nickel bene/f.shortiting from the dramatic pace of electri/f.shortication over and above the Group's current planning cases\n- -  Iron ore growth underpinned by the bene/f.shortit to steel demand from the/uni00A0construction of renewables, particularly wind power\n- -  Potash growth re/f.shortlecting the potential for greater penetration of biofuels\n- -  Metallurgical coal supported by the limited alternatives in steelmaking over the scenario timeframe\n\nGiven the positive long-term price outlooks for these commodities, the Group currently considers that a material adverse change is not expected to the valuation, and remaining useful life, of assets and discounting of closure and rehabilitation provisions for assets relating to these commodities under its 1.5\u00b0C Paris-aligned scenario.\n\nFor energy coal, oil and natural gas, long-term commodity price outlooks under the Group's 1.5\u00b0C Paris-aligned scenario are unfavourable to the price outlooks in the Group's current planning cases. However, recent portfolio announcements and impairments recognised in FY2021 limit the exposure of the carrying value of the Group's assets to long-term commodity prices for energy coal, oil and natural gas, as:\n\n- -  the Group has announced a merger proposal to combine the Group's petroleum business with Woodside\n- -  the Group has announced the signing of a Sale and Purchase Agreement to divest the Group's 33.3 per cent interest in Cerrej\u00f3n\n- -  following impairments recognised in FY2021, the carrying value of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Group's NSWEC assets is no longer material\n\nFurther, as management would alter its operating and investment plans in such a pricing environment for these assets to mitigate cash /f.shortlow and valuation impacts, it is currently impracticable to fully assess the potential impacts on the signi/f.shorticant judgements and key estimates used in the preparation of the Group's Financial Statements. However, given the factors outlined above, NSWEC closure provisions are considered the liabilities most susceptible to the long-term impacts of the Group's 1.5\u00b0C Paris-aligned scenario as reserves and resources may become incapable of extraction in an economically viable fashion prior to the current best estimate of remaining useful life. In such a scenario, closure activity may be performed earlier than the Group's current best estimate, impacting the closure provision.\n\n## Physical risks\n\nThe Group is progressing work to assess the potential impact of physical risks of climate change in line with the Group's Risk Management Framework. Given the ongoing nature of the Group's physical risk assessment process, inclusion of adaptation risk in the Group's operating plans, and associated asset valuations, is currently limited. As the Group progresses its adaptation strategy, the identi/f.shortication of additional risks or the detailed development of the Group's response may result in material changes to /f.shortinancial results and the carrying values of assets and liabilities in future reporting periods.",

Revenue is recognised when or as control of the promised goods or services passes to the customer. In most instances, control passes when the goods are delivered to a destination speci/f.shortied by the customer, typically on board the customer's appointed vessel. Revenue from the provision of services is recognised over time, but does not represent a signi/f.shorticant proportion of total revenue and is aggregated with the respective asset and product revenue for disclosure purposes. The amount of revenue recognised re/f.shortlects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for the goods or services.\n\nWhere the Group's sales are provisionally priced, the /f.shortinal price depends on future index prices. The amount of revenue initially recognised is based on the relevant forward market price. Adjustments between the provisional and /f.shortinal price are accounted for under IFRS 9/AASB 9 'Financial Instruments' (IFRS 9) and separately recorded as other revenue. The period between provisional pricing and /f.shortinal invoicing is typically between 60 and 120 days.\n\nRevenue from concentrate is net of treatment costs and re/f.shortining charges.\n\nRevenue from the sale of signi/f.shorticant by-products is included within revenue. Where a by-product is not signi/f.shorticant, revenue is credited against costs.\n\nThe Group applies the practical expedient to not adjust the expected consideration for the e/ffects of the time value of money if the period between the/uni00A0delivery and when the customer pays for the promised good or service is one year or less.\n\nFor commodity sales contracts, each individual metric unit is a separate performance obligation. Where the Group has contracts with unful/f.shortilled performance obligations at period-end, it is required to disclose the transaction price allocated to these performance obligations. The Group applies the practical expedient to not disclose this information for contracts with an expected duration of one year or less. The Group has a number of longterm contracts which are primarily priced on variable terms, based on quoted index prices near the time of delivery, and at times include /f.shortixed pricing components. Fixed pricing components, such as premiums and other charges, do not represent a signi/f.shorticant proportion of the total price. Any estimate of the future transaction price would exclude estimated amounts of variable consideration. The amount of future consideration from /f.shortixed pricing components has not been disclosed, as the Group does not consider this relevant or useful information.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

(Samarco) iron ore operation in Minas Gerais, Brazil, experienced a tailings dam failure that resulted in a release of mine tailings, /f.shortlooding the communities of Bento Rodrigues, Gesteira and Paracatu and impacting other communities downstream (the/uni00A0Samarco dam failure). Refer to section 1.15 'Samarco'.\n\nSamarco is jointly owned by BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda (BHP Brasil) and Vale S.A. (Vale). BHP Brasil's 50 per cent interest is accounted for as an equity accounted joint venture investment. BHP Brasil does not separately recognise its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of Samarco, but instead records the investment as one line on the balance sheet. Each period, BHP Brasil recognises its 50 per cent share of Samarco's pro/f.shortit or loss and adjusts the carrying value of the investment in Samarco accordingly. Such adjustment continues until the investment carrying value is reduced to US$ nil, with any additional share of Samarco losses only recognised to the extent that BHP Brasil has an obligation to fund the losses. After applying equity accounting, any remaining carrying value of the investment is tested for impairment.\n\nAny charges relating to the Samarco dam failure incurred directly by BHP Brasil or other BHP entities are recognised 100 per cent in the Group's results.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

Key Programs include those for /f.shortinancial assistance and compensation of impacted persons, including /f.shortisherfolk impacted by the dam failure, and those for remediation of impacted areas and resettlement of impacted communities. A committee (Interfederative Committee) comprising representatives from the Brazilian Federal and State Governments, local municipalities, environmental agencies, impacted communities and Public Defence O/ff.shortice oversees the activities of the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova in order to monitor, guide and assess the progress of actions agreed in the Framework Agreement. In addition, the 12th Federal Court is supervising the work of the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova and the Court's decisions have been considered in the Samarco dam failure provision change in estimate. Any future decisions will be analysed for impacts on the provision at the time of any decision.\n\nThe term of the Framework Agreement is 15 years, renewable for periods of one year successively until all obligations under the Framework Agreement have been performed. Under the Framework Agreement, Samarco has primary responsibility for funding Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's annual calendar year budget for the duration of the Framework Agreement. The funding amounts for each calendar year will be dependent on the remediation and compensation projects to be undertaken in a particular year. Annual contributions may be reviewed under the Framework Agreement. To the extent that/uni00A0Samarco does not meet its funding obligations, each of BHP Brasil and Vale have secondary funding obligations under the Framework Agreement in proportion to its 50 per cent shareholding in Samarco.\n\nSamarco began to gradually recommence operations in December 2020, however, there remains signi/f.shorticant uncertainty regarding Samarco's longterm cash /f.shortlow generation. In light of these uncertainties and based on currently available information, BHP Brasil's provision for its obligations under the/uni00A0Framework Agreement Programs is US$2.6 billion before tax and after discounting at 30 June 2021 (30 June 2020: US$1.8 billion).\n\nUnder a Governance Agreement rati/f.shortied on 8 August 2018, BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale were to establish a process to renegotiate the Programs over two years to progress settlement of the R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) Federal Public Prosecution O/ff.shortice claim (described below). Pre-requisites established in the Governance Agreement, for re-negotiation of the Framework Agreement were not implemented during the two year period and on 30 September 2020, Brazilian Federal and State prosecutors and public defenders /f.shortiled a request for the immediate resumption of the R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) claim, which has been suspended from the date of rati/f.shortication of the Governance Agreement. The claim remains suspended after the parties to the claim agreed to continue the suspension on 19 March 2021. BHP Brasil, Samarco, Vale and Federal and State prosecutors have been engaging in negotiations to seek a de/f.shortinitive and substantive settlement of the obligations under the Framework Agreement and the R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) Federal Public Prosecution O/ff.shortice claim. It is not possible to provide a range of outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential settlement outcomes and there is a risk that a negotiated outcome may be materially higher than amounts currently re/f.shortlected in the Samarco dam failure provision. Until any revisions to the Programs are agreed, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova will continue to implement the Programs in accordance with the terms of the Framework Agreement and the Governance Agreement.\n\nBHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale are required to maintain security of an amount equal to the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's annual budget up to a limit of R$2.2 billion (approximately US$440 million). The security currently comprises R$1.3 billion (approximately US$260 million) in insurance bonds and a charge of R$800 million (approximately US$160 million) over Samarco's assets. A further R$100 million (approximately US$20 million) in liquid assets previously maintained as security was released for COVID/hyphen.uc19 related response e/fforts in Brazil.\n\n## Samarco Germano dam decommissioning\n\nSamarco is currently progressing plans for the accelerated decommissioning of its upstream tailings dams (the Germano dam complex). Given the signi/f.shorticant uncertainties surrounding Samarco's long-term cash /f.shortlow generation, BHP Brasil's provision for a 50 per cent share of the expected Germano decommissioning costs is US$232 million (30 June 2020: US$227 million). The decommissioning is at an early stage and as a result, further engineering work and required validation by Brazilian authorities could lead to changes to estimates in future reporting periods.\n\n2\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 4  Signi/f.shorticant events - Samarco dam failure continued\n\n## Key judgements and estimates\n\nJudgements: The outcomes of litigation are inherently di/ff.shorticult to predict and signi/f.shorticant judgement has been applied in assessing the likely outcome of legal claims and determining which legal claims require recognition of a provision or disclosure of a contingent liability. The facts and circumstances relating to these cases are regularly evaluated in determining whether a provision for any speci/f.shortic claim is required.\n\nManagement has determined that a provision can only be recognised for obligations under the Framework Agreement and Samarco Germano dam decommissioning as at 30 June 2021. It is not yet possible to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential future exposures to BHP in connection to the contingent liabilities noted below, given their status.\n\nEstimates: The provisions for Samarco dam failure and Samarco Germano dam decommissioning currently re/f.shortlect the estimated remaining costs to complete Programs under the Framework Agreement and estimated costs to complete the Germano dam decommissioning and require the use of signi/f.shorticant judgements, estimates and assumptions. Based on current estimates, it is expected that approximately 85 per cent of remaining costs for Programs under the Framework Agreement will be incurred by December 2023.\n\nWhile the provisions have been measured based on latest information available, likely changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods may lead to material revisions to these estimates. However, it is currently not possible to determine what facts and circumstances may change, therefore revisions in future reporting periods due to the key estimates and factors outlined below cannot be reliably measured.\n\nThe key estimates that may have a material impact upon the provisions/uni00A0in the next and future reporting periods include:\n\n- -  number of people eligible for /f.shortinancial assistance and compensation and the corresponding amount of expected compensation\n- -  costs to complete key infrastructure programs, including resettlement of the Bento Rodrigues, Gesteira and Paracatu communities\n\nThe provisions may also be a/ffected by factors including but not limited to:\n\n- -  resolution of existing and potential legal claims in Brazil and other jurisdictions, including the impact of ongoing settlement negotiations and outcome of the United Kingdom group action complaint\n- -  potential changes in scope of work and funding amounts required under the Framework Agreement including the impact of the decisions of the Interfederative Committee along with further technical analysis, community participation required under the Governance Agreement and rulings made by the 12th Federal Court\n- -  the outcome of ongoing negotiations with State and Federal Prosecutors, including review of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's Programs as/uni00A0provided in the Governance Agreement\n- -  actual costs incurred\n- -  resolution of uncertainty in respect of the nature and extent of/uni00A0Samarco's long-term cash generation\n- -  costs to complete the Germano dam decommissioning\n- -  updates to discount and foreign exchange rates\n- -  the outcomes of Samarco's judicial reorganisation (de/f.shortined below)\n\nGiven these factors, future actual expenditures may di/ffer from the amounts currently provided and changes to key assumptions and estimates could result in a material impact to the provision in the next/uni00A0and future reporting periods.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nThe following matters are disclosed as contingent liabilities and given the status of proceedings it is not possible to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential future exposures for BHP, unless otherwise stated. Ultimately, all the legal matters disclosed as contingent liabilities could have a material adverse impact on BHP's business, competitive position, cash /f.shortlows, prospects, liquidity and shareholder returns.\n\n## Federal Public Prosecution O/ff.shortice claim\n\nBHP Brasil is among the defendants named in a claim brought by the Federal Public Prosecution O/ff.shortice on 3 May 2016, seeking R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) for reparation, compensation and moral damages in relation to the Samarco dam failure.\n\nThe 12th Federal Court previously suspended the Federal Public Prosecution O/ff.shortice claim, including a R$7.7 billion (approximately US$1.5 billion) injunction request. On 30 September 2020, Brazilian Federal and State prosecutors and public defenders /f.shortiled a request for the immediate resumption of the R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) claim, which has been suspended since the date of rati/f.shortication of the Governance Agreement. The claim remains suspended after the parties to the claim agreed to continue the suspension on 19 March 2021.\n\nBHP Brasil, Samarco, Vale and Federal and State prosecutors have been engaging in negotiations to seek a de/f.shortinitive and substantive settlement of the obligations under the Framework Agreement and the R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) Federal Public Prosecution O/ff.shortice claim. It is not possible to provide a range of outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential settlement outcomes and there is a risk that a negotiated outcome may be materially higher than amounts currently re/f.shortlected in/uni00A0the/uni00A0Samarco dam failure provision.\n\n## United States class action complaint - Samarco bond holders\n\nOn 14 November 2016, a putative class action complaint (Bondholder Complaint) was /f.shortiled in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of purchasers of Samarco's ten-year bond notes due 2022/hyphen.uc2024 between 31 October 2012 and 30 November 2015. The Bondholder Complaint was initially /f.shortiled against Samarco and the/uni00A0former chief executive o/ff.shorticer of Samarco.\n\nThe Bondholder Complaint was subsequently amended to include BHP Group Ltd, BHP Group Plc, BHP Brasil, Vale and o/ff.shorticers of Samarco, including four of Vale and BHP Brasil's nominees to the Samarco Board. On 5 April 2017, the plainti/ff discontinued its claims against the/uni00A0individual defendants.\n\nThe complaint, along with a second amended complaint, had previously been dismissed by the court. The plainti/ff /f.shortiled a motion for reconsideration, or leave to /f.shortile a third amended complaint, which was denied by the court on 30 October 2019. The plainti/ff appealed this decision, which was a/ff.shortirmed by the court of appeals in March 2021.\n\n## Australian class action complaint\n\nBHP Group Ltd is named as a defendant in a shareholder class action /f.short iled in the Federal Court of Australia on behalf of persons who acquired shares in BHP Group Ltd on the Australian Securities Exchange or shares in BHP Group Plc on the London Stock Exchange and Johannesburg Stock Exchange in periods prior to the Samarco dam failure. The amount of damages sought is unspeci/f.shortied.\n\n## United Kingdom group action complaint\n\nBHP Group Plc and BHP Group Ltd were named as defendants in group action claims for damages /f.shortiled in the courts of England. These claims were /f.shortiled on behalf of certain individuals, governments, businesses and communities in Brazil allegedly impacted by the Samarco dam failure. The amount of damages sought in these claims is unspeci/f.shortied. The complaint and a subsequent application for permission to appeal have been dismissed by the court, however an application by the claimants to reopen the proceedings was granted in July 2021, allowing/uni00A0the claimants to appeal previous dismissals of the claim.\n\n## Criminal charges\n\nThe Federal Prosecutors' O/ff.shortice has /f.shortiled criminal charges against BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale and certain employees and former employees of/uni00A0BHP Brasil (A/ffected Individuals) in the Federal Court of Ponte Nova, Minas Gerais. On 3 March 2017, BHP Brasil /f.shortiled its preliminary defences.",

        "page_content": "## 4  Signi/f.shorticant events - Samarco dam failure continued\n\nThe Federal Court terminated the charges against eight of the A/ffected Individuals. The Federal Prosecutors' O/ff.shortice has appealed seven of those decisions with hearings of the appeals still pending. BHP Brasil rejects outright the charges against the company and the A/ffected Individuals and will defend the charges and fully support each of the A/ffected Individuals in their defence of the charges.\n\n## Other claims\n\nCivil public actions /f.shortiled by State Prosecutors in Minas Gerais (claiming damages of approximately R$7.5 billion, US$1.5 billion), State Prosecutors in Esp\u00edrito Santo (claiming damages of approximately R$2 billion, US$400 million), and public defenders in Minas Gerais (claiming damages of approximately R$10 billion, US$2 billion), have been consolidated before the 12th Federal Court and suspended. The Governance Agreement provides for a process to review whether these civil public claims should be terminated or suspended.\n\nBHP Brasil is among the companies named as defendants in a number of legal proceedings initiated by individuals, non-governmental organisations, corporations and governmental entities in Brazilian Federal and State courts following the Samarco dam failure. The other defendants include Vale, Samarco and Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova. The lawsuits include claims for compensation, environmental rehabilitation and violations of Brazilian environmental and other laws, among other matters. The lawsuits seek various remedies including rehabilitation costs, compensation to injured individuals and families of the deceased, recovery of personal and property losses, moral damages and injunctive relief. In addition, government inquiries and investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure have been commenced by numerous agencies of the Brazilian government and are ongoing.\n\nAdditional lawsuits and government investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure could be brought against BHP Brasil and possibly other BHP entities in Brazil or other jurisdictions.\n\n## BHP insurance\n\nBHP has various third party general liability and directors and o/ff.shorticers insurances for claims related to the Samarco dam failure made directly against BHP Brasil or other BHP entities, their directors and o/ff.shorticers, including class actions. External insurers have been noti/f.shortied of the Samarco dam failure along with the third party claims and class actions referred to above. In the period since the dam failure to 30 June 2021, the Group has recognised US$573 million other income from general liability insurance proceeds relating to the dam failure. Recoveries related to general liability insurance are now considered complete.\n\nAs at 30 June 2021, an insurance receivable has not been recognised for/uni00A0any potential recoveries in respect of ongoing matters.\n\n## Commitments\n\nUnder the terms of the Samarco joint venture agreement, BHP Brasil does/uni00A0not have an existing obligation to fund Samarco.\n\nBHP has agreed to fund a total of up to US$765 million for the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova programs and Samarco's working capital during calendar year 2021. This comprises up to US$725 million relating to Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova programs until 31 December 2021, which will be o/ffset against the Group's provision for the Samarco dam failure, and a short-term working capital facility of up to US$40 million to be made available to Samarco until 31 December 2021. Amounts related to Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova and Samarco working capital incurred in the six months to 30 June 2021 have been re/f.shortlected in the utilisation of the provision and impairment expense respectively disclosed above. Any additional requests for funding or future investment provided would be subject to a future decision by BHP, accounted for at that time.\n\n## Samarco judicial reorganisation\n\nSamarco /f.shortiled for judicial reorganisation (JR) in April 2021, with the Commercial Courts of Belo Horizonte, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil (JR Court), after multiple enforcement actions taken by certain creditors of Samarco. Samarco's JR /f.shortiling followed unsuccessful attempts to negotiate a debt restructure with certain /f.shortinancial creditors and multiple legal actions /f.shortiled by those creditors which threatened Samarco's operations. The JR is an insolvency proceeding with a means for Samarco to seek to restructure its /f.shortinancial debts and establish a sustainable /f.shortinancial position that allows Samarco to continue to rebuild its operations and strengthen its ability to meet its Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova funding obligations. Samarco's\n\n2\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\noperations are expected to continue during the JR and restructure process. The JR is not expected to a/ffect Samarco's obligation or commitment to make full redress for the 2015 Fund\u00e3o dam failure, and is not expected to impact Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's ability to undertake that remediation and compensation. It is not possible to determine the outcomes of the JR or estimate any impact that the reorganisation may have for BHP Brasil, including its share of the Samarco dam failure provisions.\n\nThe following section includes disclosure required by IFRS of Samarco's provisions, contingencies and other matters arising from the dam failure for matters in addition to the above-mentioned claims to which Samarco is a party.\n\n## Samarco\n\n## Dam failure related provisions and contingencies\n\nIn addition to its obligations under the Framework Agreement as at 30 June 2021, Samarco has recognised provisions of US$0.2 billion (30 June 2020: US$0.2 billion), based on currently available information. The magnitude, scope and timing of these additional costs are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and Samarco has indicated that it anticipates that it will incur future costs beyond those provided. These uncertainties are likely to continue for a signi/f.shorticant period and changes to key assumptions could result in a material change to the amount of the provision in future reporting periods. Any such unrecognised obligations are therefore contingent liabilities and, at present, it is not practicable to estimate their magnitude or possible timing of payment. Accordingly, it is also not possible to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of total potential future exposures at this time.\n\nSamarco is also named as a defendant in a number of other legal proceedings initiated by individuals, non-governmental organisations, corporations and governmental entities in Brazilian Federal and State courts following the Samarco dam failure. The lawsuits include claims for compensation, environmental rehabilitation and violations of Brazilian environmental and other laws, among other matters. The lawsuits seek various remedies including rehabilitation costs, compensation to injured individuals and families of the deceased, recovery of personal and property losses, moral damages and injunctive relief. In addition, government inquiries and investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure have been commenced by numerous agencies of the Brazilian government and are ongoing. Given the status of proceedings it is not possible to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of total potential future exposures to Samarco.\n\nAdditional lawsuits and government investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure could be brought against Samarco.\n\n## Samarco insurance\n\nSamarco has standalone insurance policies in place with Brazilian and global insurers. Insurers' loss adjusters or claims representatives continue to investigate and assist with the claims process for matters not yet settled. As at 30 June 2021, an insurance receivable has not been recognised by Samarco in respect of ongoing matters.\n\n## Samarco commitments\n\nAt 30 June 2021, Samarco has commitments of US$0.7 billion (30 June 2020: US$0.4 billion). Following the dam failure Samarco invoked force majeure clauses in a number of long-term contracts with suppliers and service providers to suspend contractual obligations.\n\n## Samarco non-dam failure related contingent/uni00A0liabilities\n\nThe following non-dam failure related contingent liabilities pre-date and are unrelated to the Samarco dam failure. Samarco is currently contesting both of these matters in the Brazilian courts. Given the status of these tax matters, the timing of resolution and potential economic out/f.shortlow for Samarco is uncertain.\n\n## Brazilian Social Contribution Levy\n\nSamarco has received tax assessments for the alleged non-payment of Brazilian Social Contribution Levy for the calendar years 2007/hyphen.uc2014 totalling approximately R$5.9 billion (approximately US$1.2 billion).\n\n## Brazilian corporate income tax rate\n\nSamarco has received tax assessments for alleged incorrect calculation of Corporate Income Tax (IRPJ) in respect of the 2000/hyphen.uc2003 and 2007/hyphen.uc2014 income years totalling approximately R$4.6 billion (approximately US$0.9 billion).",

Application of tax law can be complex and requires judgement to assess risk and estimate outcomes, particularly in relation to the Group's cross-border operations and transactions. The evaluation of tax risks considers both amended assessments received and potential sources of challenge from tax authorities. The status of proceedings for these matters will impact the ability to determine the potential exposure and in some cases, it may not be possible to determine a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of the potential exposure.\n\nThe Group has unresolved tax and royalty matters for which the timing of resolution and potential economic out/f.shortlow are uncertain. Tax and royalty matters with uncertain outcomes arise in the normal course of business and occur due to changes in tax law, changes in interpretation of tax law, periodic challenges and disagreements with tax authorities and legal proceedings.\n\nTax and royalty obligations assessed as having probable future economic out/f.shortlows capable of reliable measurement are provided for as at 30 June 2021. Matters with a possible economic out/f.shortlow and/or presently incapable of being measured reliably are contingent liabilities and disclosed in note 34 'Contingent liabilities'. Details of uncertain tax and royalty matters relating to Samarco are disclosed in note 4 'Signi/f.shorticant events - Samarco dam failure'.",

Judgement is applied in recognising deferred tax liabilities arising from temporary di/fferences in investments. These deferred tax liabilities caused principally by retained earnings held in foreign tax jurisdictions are recognised unless repatriation of retained earnings can be controlled and is not expected to occur in the/uni00A0foreseeable future.\n\nEstimates: The Group assesses the recoverability of recognised and unrecognised deferred taxes, including losses in Australia, the United States and Canada on a consistent basis. Estimates and assumptions relating to projected earnings and cash /f.shortlows as applied in the Group impairment process are used for operating assets.\n\n2\n\n4\n\n1\n\n## Uncertain tax matters\n\nJudgements: Management applies judgements about the application of income tax legislation and its interaction with income tax accounting principles. These judgements are subject to risk and uncertainty, hence there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter expectations, which may impact the amount of tax assets and tax liabilities, including deferred tax, recognised on the balance sheet and the amount of other tax losses and temporary di/fferences not yet recognised.\n\nWhere the /f.shortinal tax outcomes are di/fferent from the amounts that were initially recorded, these di/fferences impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which the determination is made.\n\nMeasurement of uncertain tax and royalty matters considers a range of possible outcomes, including assessments received from tax authorities. Where management is of the view that potential liabilities have a low probability of crystallising, or it is not possible to quantify them reliably, they are disclosed as contingent liabilities (refer to note/uni00A034/uni00A0'Contingent liabilities').\n\n## 7  Earnings per share\n\n|                                                  | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Earnings attributable to BHP shareholders (US$M) |        |        |        |\n| - Continuing operations                          | 11,304 | 7,956  | 8,648  |\n| - Total                                          | 11,304 | 7,956  | 8,306  |\n| Weighted average number of shares (Million)      |        |        |        |\n| - Basic                                          | 5,057  | 5,057  | 5,180  |\n| - Diluted                                        | 5,068  | 5,069  | 5,193  |\n| Basic earnings per ordinary share (US cents)     |        |        |        |\n| - Continuing operations                          | 223.5  | 157.3  | 166.9  |\n| - Total                                          | 223.5  | 157.3  | 160.3  |\n| Diluted earnings per ordinary share (US cents)   |        |        |        |\n| - Continuing operations                          | 223.0  | 157.0  | 166.5  |\n| - Total                                          | 223.0  | 157.0  | 159.9  |\n| Headline earnings per ordinary share (US cents)  |        |        |        |\n| - Basic                                          | 284.8  | 171.1  | 164.9  |\n| - Diluted                                        | 284.2  | 170.7  | 164.5  |\n\nRefer to note 29 'Discontinued operations' for basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for Discontinued operations.\n\nEarnings on American Depositary Shares represent twice the earnings for BHP Group Limited or BHP Group Plc ordinary shares.\n\nHeadline earnings is a Johannesburg Stock Exchange de/f.shortined performance measure and is reconciled from earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders as follows:\n\n|                                                                                       | 2021  US$M   | 2020  US$M   | 2019  US$M   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Earnings attributable to BHP shareholders                                             | 11,304       | 7,956        | 8,306        |\n| Adjusted for:                                                                         |              |              |              |\n| (Gain)/loss on sales of property, plant and equipment, Investments and Operations (1) | (50)         | 4            | (52)         |\n| Impairments of property, plant and equipment, /f.shortinancial assets and intangibles | 2,633        | 494          | 264          |\n| Samarco impairment expense                                                            | 111          | 95           | 96           |\n| Cerrej\u00f3n impairment expense                                                           | 466          | -            | -            |\n| Other (2)                                                                             | -            | 48           | -            |\n| Recycling of re-measurements from equity to the income statement                      | -            | -            | (6)          |\n| Tax e/ffect of above adjustments                                                      | (60)         | 54           | (64)         |\n| Subtotal of adjustments                                                               | 3,100        | 695          | 238          |\n| Headline earnings                                                                     | 14,404       | 8,651        | 8,544        |\n| Diluted headline earnings                                                             | 14,404       | 8,651        | 8,544        |\n\n- (1) Included in other income.\n- (2)  Mainly represent BHP share of impairment embedded in the statutory income statement of the Group's equity accounted investments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group's only potential dilutive ordinary shares are share awards granted under the employee share ownership plans for which terms and conditions are described in note 25 'Employee share ownership plans'. Diluted earnings per share calculation excludes instruments which are considered antidilutive.\n\nAt 30 June 2021, there are no instruments which are considered antidilutive (2020: nil; 2019: nil).\n\n## Working capital\n\n## 8  Trade and other receivables\n\n|                                       | 2021  US$M   | 2020  US$M   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Trade receivables                     | 4,450        | 1,974        |\n| Loans to equity accounted investments | -            | 40           |\n| Other receivables                     | 1,946        | 1,617        |\n| Total                                 | 6,396        | 3,631        |\n| Comprising:                           |              |              |\n| Current                               | 6,059        | 3,364        |\n| Non-current                           | 337          | 267          |\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nTrade receivables are recognised initially at their transaction price or, for those receivables containing a signi/f.shorticant /f.shortinancing component, at fair value. Trade receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest method, less an allowance for impairment, except for provisionally priced receivables which are subsequently measured at fair value through the income statement under IFRS 9.\n\nThe collectability of trade receivables is assessed continuously. At the reporting date, speci/f.shortic allowances are made for any expected credit losses based on a review of all outstanding amounts at reporting period-end. Individual receivables are written o/ff when management deems them unrecoverable. The net carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair values.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nTrade receivables generally have terms of less than 30 days. The Group has no material concentration of credit risk with any single counterparty and/uni00A0is/uni00A0not dominantly exposed to any individual industry.\n\nCredit risk can arise from the non-performance by counterparties of their contractual /f.shortinancial obligations towards the Group. To manage credit risk, the Group maintains Group-wide procedures covering the application for credit approvals, granting and renewal of counterparty limits, proactive monitoring of exposures against these limits and requirements triggering secured payment terms. As part of these processes, the credit exposures with/uni00A0all counterparties are regularly monitored and assessed on a timely basis. The credit quality of the Group's customers is reviewed and the solvency/uni00A0of each debtor and their ability to pay the receivable is considered in assessing receivables for impairment.\n\nThe 10 largest customers represented 31 per cent (2020: 32 per cent) of total credit risk exposures managed by the Group.\n\nReceivables are deemed to be past due or impaired in accordance with the Group's terms and conditions. These terms and conditions are determined/uni00A0on a case-by-case basis with reference to the customer's credit quality, payment performance and prevailing market conditions. As at/uni00A030 June 2021, trade receivables of US$68 million (2020: US$23 million) were past due but not impaired. The majority of these receivables were/uni00A0less/uni00A0than 30/uni00A0days overdue.\n\nThe assessment of recoverability of trade receivables at 30 June 2021 has considered the impacts of COVID/hyphen.uc19 and no material recoverability issues have been identi/f.shortied. As COVID/hyphen.uc19 continues to impact key markets in Asia, Europe and the United States, the Group continues to perform enhanced credit monitoring of commercial counterparties.\n\nAt 30 June 2021, trade receivables are stated net of provisions for expected credit losses of US$3 million (2020: US$2 million).\n\nThe Group may accelerate trade receivables through Letters of Credit programs to collect receipts from debtors earlier than contractual sales terms but/uni00A0elected not to do so as at 30 June 2021.\n\n## 9  Trade and other payables\n\n|                | 2021  US$M   | 2020  US$M   |\n|----------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Trade payables | 5,079        | 4,396        |\n| Other payables | 1,948        | 1,372        |\n| Total          | 7,027        | 5,768        |\n| Comprising:    |              |              |\n| Current        | 7,027        | 5,767        |\n| Non-current    | -            | 1            |",

Cost is determined primarily on the basis of average costs. For processed inventories, cost is derived on an absorption costing basis. Cost comprises costs of purchasing raw materials and costs of production, including attributable mining and manufacturing overheads taking into consideration normal operating capacity.\n\nMinerals inventory quantities are assessed primarily through surveys and assays, while petroleum inventory quantities are derived through /f.shortlow rate or/uni00A0tank volume measurement and the composition is derived via sample analysis.\n\n## Key estimates\n\nAccounting for inventory involves the use of estimates, particularly related to the measurement and valuation of inventory on hand within the production process. Key estimates, including expected metal recoveries and work in progress volumes, are calculated by engineers using available industry, engineering and scienti/f.shortic data. Estimates used are periodically reassessed by the Group taking into account technical analysis and historical performance. Changes in estimates are adjusted for on a prospective basis.\n\n## Resource assets\n\n## 11  Property, plant and equipment\n\n|                                                            | Land and  buildings  US$M   | Plant and  equipment  US$M   | Other mineral  assets  US$M   | Assets under  construction  US$M   | Exploration  and evaluation  US$M   | Total  US$M   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Net book value -

        "page_content": "## 11  Property, plant and equipment continued\n\n## Recognition and measurement Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. Cost is the fair value of consideration given to acquire the asset at the time of its acquisition or construction and includes the direct costs of bringing the asset to the location and the condition necessary for operation and the estimated future costs of closure and rehabilitation of the facility.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. Refer to note 21 'Leases' for details.\n\n## Exploration and evaluation\n\nExploration costs are incurred to discover mineral and petroleum resources. Evaluation costs are incurred to assess the technical feasibility and commercial viability of resources found.\n\nExploration and evaluation expenditure is charged to the income statement as incurred, except in the following circumstances in which case the expenditure may be capitalised:\n\nIn respect of minerals activities:\n\n- -  the exploration and evaluation activity is within an area of interest that was previously acquired as an asset acquisition or in a business combination and measured at fair value on acquisition or\n- -  the existence of a commercially viable mineral deposit has been established\n\nIn respect of petroleum activities:\n\n- -  the exploration and evaluation activity is within an area of interest for which it is expected that the expenditure will be recouped by future exploitation or sale or\n- -  exploration and evaluation activity has not reached a stage that permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of commercially recoverable reserves\n\nA regular review of each area of interest is undertaken to determine the appropriateness of continuing to carry forward costs in relation to that area. Capitalised costs are only carried forward to the extent that they are expected to be recovered through the successful exploitation of the area of interest or alternatively by its sale. To the extent that capitalised expenditure is no longer expected to be recovered, it is charged to the income statement.\n\n## Key judgements and estimates\n\nJudgements: Exploration and evaluation expenditure results in certain items of expenditure being capitalised for an area of interest where a judgement is made that it is likely to be recoverable by future exploitation or sale, or where the activities are judged not to have reached a stage that permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of reserves.\n\nEstimates: Management makes certain estimates and assumptions as to future events and circumstances, in particular when making quantitative assessment of whether an economically viable extraction operation can be established. These estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available. If, after having capitalised the expenditure under the policy, new information suggests that recovery of the expenditure is unlikely, the/uni00A0relevant capitalised amount is charged to the income statement.\n\n## Development expenditure\n\nWhen proven mineral reserves are determined and development is sanctioned, capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is reclassi/f.shortied as assets under construction within property, plant and equipment. All subsequent development expenditure is capitalised and/uni00A0classi/f.shortied as assets under construction, provided commercial viability/uni00A0conditions continue to be satis/f.shortied.\n\nThe Group may use funds sourced from external parties to /f.shortinance the acquisition and development of assets and operations. Finance costs are expensed as incurred, except where they relate to the /f.shortinancing of construction or development of qualifying assets. Borrowing costs directly attributable to acquiring or constructing a qualifying asset are capitalised during the development phase. Development expenditure is net of proceeds from the saleable material extracted during the development phase. On completion of development, all assets included in assets under construction are reclassi/f.shortied as either plant and/uni00A0equipment or other mineral assets and depreciation commences.\n\n## Key judgements and estimates\n\nJudgements: Development activities commence after project sanctioning by the appropriate level of management. Judgement is applied by management in determining when a project is economically viable.\n\nEstimates: In determining whether a project is economically viable, management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions as to future events and circumstances, including reserve estimates, existence of an accessible market and forecast prices and cash /f.shortlows. Estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available. If, after having commenced the development activity, new information suggests that a development asset is impaired, the/uni00A0appropriate amount is charged to the income statement.\n\n## Other mineral assets\n\nOther mineral assets comprise:\n\n- -  capitalised exploration, evaluation and development expenditure for/uni00A0assets in production\n- -  mineral rights and petroleum interests acquired\n- -  capitalised development and production stripping costs\n\n## Overburden removal costs\n\nThe process of removing overburden and other waste materials to access mineral deposits is referred to as stripping. Stripping is necessary to obtain access to mineral deposits and occurs throughout the life of an open-pit mine. Development and production stripping costs are classi/f.shortied as other mineral assets in property, plant and equipment.\n\nStripping costs are accounted for separately for individual components of an ore body. The determination of components is dependent on the mine plan and other factors, including the size, shape and geotechnical aspects of an ore body. The Group accounts for stripping activities as follows:\n\n## Development stripping costs\n\nThese are initial overburden removal costs incurred to obtain access to mineral deposits that will be commercially produced. These costs are capitalised when it is probable that future economic bene/f.shortits (access to mineral ores) will /f.shortlow to the Group and costs can be measured reliably.\n\nOnce the production phase begins, capitalised development stripping costs are depreciated using the units of production method based on the/uni00A0proven and probable reserves of the relevant identi/f.shortied component of/uni00A0the ore body which the initial stripping activity bene/f.shortits.",

Production stripping costs can give rise to two bene/f.shortits, the accounting for which is outlined below:\n\n|                                          | Production stripping activity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Production stripping activity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Bene/f.shortits of stripping activity    | Extraction of ore (inventory) in current period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Improved access to future ore extraction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Period bene/f.shortited                  | Current period                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Future period(s)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Recognition and measurement criteria     | When the bene/f.shortits of stripping activities are  realised in the form of inventory produced; the  associated costs are recorded in accordance  with/uni00A0the Group's inventory accounting policy. be realised                                               | When the bene/f.shortits of stripping activities are improved  access to future ore; production costs/uni00A0are capitalised  when all the following criteria are met: -  the production stripping activity improves access  to a speci/f.shortic component of the ore body and it  is probable that economic bene/f.shortits arising from  the improved access to/uni00A0future ore production will |\n| Allocation of costs                      | Production stripping costs are allocated between the inventory produced and the production stripping  production stripping asset.                                                                                                                                  | -  costs associated with that component can  be/uni00A0measured reliably                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Asset recognised from stripping activity | asset using a life-of-component waste-to-ore (or mineral contained) strip ratio.

Changes to estimates related to lifeof-component waste-to-ore (or mineral contained) strip ratios and the expected ore production from identi/f.shortied components are accounted for prospectively and may a/ffect depreciation rates and asset carrying values.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nDepreciation of assets, other than land, assets under construction and capitalised exploration and evaluation that are not depreciated, is calculated using either the straight-line (SL) method or units of production (UoP) method, net of residual values, over the estimated useful lives of speci/f.shortic assets. The depreciation method and rates applied to speci/f.shortic assets re/f.shortlect the pattern in which the asset's bene/f.shortits are expected to be used by the Group. The Group's proved reserves for petroleum assets and proved and probable reserves for minerals assets are used to determine UoP depreciation unless doing so results in depreciation charges that do not re/f.shortlect the asset's useful life. Where this occurs, alternative approaches to determining reserves are applied, such as using management's expectations of future oil and gas prices rather than yearly average prices, to provide a phasing of periodic depreciation charges that better re/f.shortlects the asset's expected useful life.\n\nWhere assets are dedicated to a mine or petroleum lease, the useful lives below are subject to the lesser of the asset category's useful life and the life of/uni00A0the mine or petroleum lease, unless those assets are readily transferable to another productive mine or lease.\n\n## Key estimates\n\nThe determination of useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods involves estimates and assumptions and is reviewed annually. Any changes to useful lives or any other estimates or assumptions may a/ffect prospective depreciation rates and asset carrying values. The table below summarises the principal depreciation methods and rates applied to major asset categories by the Group.\n\n| Category                         | Buildings            | Plant and   equipment   | Mineral rights and   petroleum interests     | Capitalised exploration, evaluation and  development expenditure   |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Typical depreciation methodology | SL                   | SL                      | UoP                                          | UoP                                                                |\n| Depreciation rate                | 25/hyphen.uc50 years | 3/hyphen.uc30 years     | Based on the rate of   depletion of reserves | Based on the rate of   depletion of reserves                       |\n\n## Commitments\n\nThe Group's commitments for capital expenditure were US$2,469 million as at 30 June 2021 (2020: US$2,585 million).

Where consideration is less than the fair value of acquired net assets, the di/fference is recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill is not amortised and is measured at cost less any impairment losses.\n\n## Other intangibles\n\nThe Group capitalises amounts paid for the acquisition of identi/f.shortiable intangible assets, such as software, licences and initial payments for the acquisition of mineral lease assets, where it is considered that they will contribute to future periods through revenue generation or reductions in cost. These assets, classi/f.shortied as /f.shortinite life intangible assets, are carried in the balance sheet at the fair value of consideration paid less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges. Intangible assets with /f.shortinite useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. The estimated useful lives are generally no greater than eight years.\n\nInitial payments for the acquisition of intangible mineral lease assets are capitalised and amortised over the term of the permit. A regular review is undertaken of each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of continuing to carry forward costs in relation to that area. Capitalised costs are only carried forward to the extent that they are expected to be recovered through the successful exploitation of the area of interest or alternatively by its/uni00A0sale. To the extent that capitalised expenditure is no longer expected to be recovered, it is charged to the income statement.\n\n## 13  Impairment of non-current assets\n\n|                                        |         | 2021                                 | 2021                                  | 2021                               | 2021       |\n|----------------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------|\n| Cash generating unit                   | Segment | Property,  plant and  equipment US$M | Goodwill  and other  intangibles US$M | Equity- accounted  investment US$M | Total US$M |\n| New South Wales Energy Coal            | Coal    | 1,025                                | 32                                    | -                                  | 1,057      |\n| Cerrej\u00f3n                               | Coal    | -                                    | -                                     | 466                                | 466        |\n| Potash                                 | G&U     | 1,314                                | -                                     | -                                  | 1,314      |\n| Other                                  | Various | 244                                  | 20                                    | -                                  | 264        |\n| Total impairment of non-current assets |         | 2,583                                | 52                                    | 466                                | 3,101      |\n| Reversal of impairment                 |         | -                                    | -                                     | -                                  | -          |\n| Net impairment of non-current assets   |         | 2,583                                | 52                                    | 466                                | 3,101      |\n\n|                                        |         | 2020                                 | 2020                                  | 2020                               | 2020       |\n|----------------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------|\n| Cash generating unit                   | Segment | Property,  plant and  equipment US$M | Goodwill  and other  intangibles US$M | Equity- accounted  investment US$M | Total US$M |\n| Cerro Colorado                         | Copper  | 409                                  | -                                     | -                                  | 409        |\n| Other                                  | Various | 85                                   | -                                     | -                                  | 85         |\n| Total impairment of non-current assets |         | 494                                  | -                                     | -                                  | 494        |\n| Reversal of impairment                 |         | -                                    | -                                     | -                                  | -          |\n| Net impairment of non-current assets   |         | 494                                  | -                                     | -                                  | 494        |",

If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and an impairment loss is charged to the income statement so as to reduce the carrying amount in the balance sheet to its recoverable amount.\n\nPreviously impaired assets (excluding goodwill) are reviewed for possible reversal of previous impairment at each reporting date. Impairment reversal cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or/uni00A0cash generating units (CGUs). There were no reversals of impairment in the current or prior year.\n\n## How recoverable amount is calculated\n\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or CGU's fair value less cost of disposal (FVLCD) and its value in use (VIU). For the purposes of/uni00A0assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identi/f.shortiable cash /f.shortlows.\n\n## Valuation methods\n\n## Fair value less cost of disposal\n\nFVLCD is an estimate of the amount that a market participant would pay for an asset or CGU, less the cost of disposal. FVLCD for mineral and petroleum assets is generally determined using independent market assumptions to calculate the present value of the estimated future post-tax cash /f.shortlows expected to arise from the continued use of the asset, including the anticipated cash /f.shortlow e/ffects of any capital expenditure to enhance production or/uni00A0reduce cost, and its eventual disposal where a market participant may take a consistent view. Cash /f.shortlows are discounted using an appropriate posttax market discount rate to arrive at a net present value of the asset, which is compared against the asset's carrying value. FVLCD may also take into consideration other market-based indicators of fair value.\n\n## Value in use\n\nVIU is determined as the present value of the estimated future cash /f.shortlows expected to arise from the continued use of the asset in its present form and its eventual disposal or closure. VIU is determined by applying assumptions speci/f.shortic to the Group's continued use and cannot take into account future development. These assumptions are di/fferent to those used in calculating FVLCD and consequently the VIU calculation is likely to give a di/fferent result (usually lower) to a FVLCD calculation.\n\n## Impairment

As outlined in the Basis of Preparation, where su/ff.shorticiently developed, the potential /f.shortinancial impacts on the Group of climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy have been considered in the assessment of indicators of impairment, including:\n\n- -  the Group's current assumptions relating to demand for commodities and carbon pricing, including their impact on the Group's long-term price forecasts\n- -  the Group's operational emissions reduction strategy\n\n## COVID/hyphen.uc19\n\nThe macro economic disruptions relating to COVID/hyphen.uc19 and mitigating actions enforced by health authorities create uncertainty in the Group's operating and economic assumptions, including commodity prices, demand and supply volumes, operating costs, and discount rates. However, given the long-lived nature of the majority of the Group's assets, COVID/hyphen.uc19 did not, in isolation, result in the identi/f.shortication of indicators of impairment for the Group's asset values at 30 June 2021. Due to ongoing uncertainty as to the extent and duration of COVID/hyphen.uc19 restrictions and the overall impact on economic activity, actual experience may materially di/ffer from internal forecasts and may result in the reassessment of indicators of impairment for the Group's assets in/uni00A0future reporting periods.\n\nEstimates: The Group performs a recoverable amount determination for an asset or CGU when there is an indication of impairment or impairment reversal.\n\nWhen the recoverable amount is measured by reference to FVLCD, in the absence of quoted market prices or binding sale agreement, estimates are made regarding the present value of future post-tax cash /f.short lows. These estimates are made from the perspective of a market participant and include prices, future production volumes, operating\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncosts, capital expenditure, closure and rehabilitation costs, tax attributes, risking factors applied to cash /f.shortlows and discount rates. The cash /f.shortlow forecasts may include net cash /f.shortlows expected from the extraction, processing and sale of material that does not currently qualify for inclusion in ore reserves. Reserves and resources are included in the assessment of FVLCD to the extent that it is considered probable that a/uni00A0market participant would attribute value to them.\n\nWhen recoverable amount is measured using VIU, estimates are made regarding the present value of future cash /f.shortlows based on internal budgets and forecasts and life of asset plans. Key estimates are similar to those identi/f.shortied for FVLCD, although some assumptions and values may di/ffer as they re/f.shortlect the perspective of management rather than a/uni00A0market participant.\n\nAll estimates require management judgements and assumptions and are subject to risk and uncertainty that may be beyond the control of the Group; hence, there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will materially alter projections, which may impact the recoverable amount of assets/CGUs at each reporting date.\n\nThe most signi/f.shorticant estimates impacting the Group's recoverable amount determinations:\n\n## Commodity prices\n\nCommodity prices were based on latest internal forecasts which assume short-term market prices will revert to the Group's assessment of long-term price. These price forecasts re/f.shortlect management's longterm views of global supply and demand, built upon past experience of the commodity markets and are benchmarked with external sources of information such as analyst forecasts. Prices are adjusted based upon premiums or discounts applied to global price markers based on the location, nature and quality produced, or to take into account contracted prices.\n\n## Future production volumes\n\nEstimated production volumes were based on detailed data and took into account development plans established by management as part of the Group's long-term planning process. When estimating FVLCD, assumptions re/f.shortlect all reserves and resources that a market participant would consider when valuing the respective CGU, which in some cases are broader in scope than the reserves that would be used in a VIU test. In determining FVLCD, risk factors may be applied to reserves and/uni00A0resources which do not meet the criteria to be treated as proved.\n\n## Operating costs and capital expenditure\n\nOperating costs and capital expenditure were based on internal budgets and forecasts and life of asset plans. Cost assumptions re/f.shortlect management experience and expectations. In the case of FVLCD, cash /f.short low projections include the anticipated cash /f.shortlow e/ffects of any capital expenditure to enhance production or reduce cost where a market participant may take a consistent view. VIU does not take into account future development.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nThe Group uses real post-tax discount rates applied to real post-tax cash /f.short lows. The discount rates are derived using the weighted average cost of capital methodology. Adjustments to the rates are made for any risks that are not re/f.shortlected in the underlying cash /f.shortlows, including country risk.",

        "page_content": "## 15  Closure and rehabilitation provisions continued\n\n## Initial recognition\n\n## Subsequent remeasurement\n\nClosure and rehabilitation provisions are initially recognised when an environmental disturbance /f.shortirst occurs. The individual site provisions are an estimate of the expected value of future cash /f.shortlows required to rehabilitate the relevant site using current restoration standards and techniques and taking into account risks and uncertainties. Individual site provisions are discounted to their present value using currency speci/f.shortic discount rates aligned to the estimated timing of cash out/f.shortlows.\n\nWhen provisions for closure and rehabilitation are initially recognised, the corresponding cost is capitalised as an asset, representing part of the cost of acquiring the future economic bene/f.shortits of/uni00A0the operation.\n\n## Closed sites\n\nWhere future economic bene/f.shortits are no longer expected to be derived through operation, changes to the associated closure and remediation costs are charged to the income statement in the period identi/f.shortied. This amounted to US$483 million in the year ended 30 June 2021 (2020: US$669 million; 2019: US$251 million).\n\n## Key estimates\n\nThe recognition and measurement of closure and rehabilitation provisions requires the use of signi/f.shorticant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to:\n\n- -  the extent (due to legal or constructive obligations) of potential activities required for the removal of infrastructure and rehabilitation activities\n- -  costs associated with future rehabilitation activities\n- -  applicable discount rates\n- -  the timing of cash /f.shortlows and ultimate closure of operations\n\nThe extent and cost of future rehabilitation activities may also be impacted by the potential physical impacts of climate change. In estimating the potential cost of closure activities, the Group considers factors such as long-term weather outlooks, for example forecast changes in rainfall patterns, and the impact of the Group's energy transition strategy on the/uni00A0costs of performing rehabilitation activities.\n\nWhile progressive closure is performed across a number of operations, signi/f.shorticant rehabilitation activities are generally undertaken at the end of the production life at the individual sites, the estimated timing of which is informed by the Group's current assumptions relating to demand for commodities and carbon pricing, and their impact on the Group's longterm price forecasts. Remaining production lives range from 3/hyphen.uc91 years with an average for all sites, weighted by current closure provision, of approximately 27 years. The discount rates applied to the Group's closure and rehabilitation provisions are determined by reference to the currency of the closure cash /f.shortlows, the period over which the cash /f.shortlows will be incurred and prevailing market interest rates (where available). The rates were revised during the year to re/f.shortlect decreases in market interest rates. The e/ffect of changes to discount rates was an increase of approximatively US$1,085 million in the closure and rehabilitation provision of which\n\nThe closure and rehabilitation asset, recognised within property, plant and equipment, is depreciated over the life of the operations. The value of the provision is progressively increased over time as the e/ffect/uni00A0of discounting unwinds, resulting in an expense recognised in net /f.shortinance costs.\n\nThe closure and rehabilitation provision is reviewed at each reporting date to assess if the estimate continues to re/f.shortlect the best estimate of the obligation. If necessary, the provision is remeasured to/uni00A0account for factors, including:\n\n- -  revisions to estimated reserves, resources and lives of operations\n- -  developments in technology\n- -  regulatory requirements and environmental management strategies\n- -  changes in the estimated extent and costs of anticipated activities, including the e/ffects of in/f.shortlation and movements in foreign exchange rates\n- -  movements in interest rates a/ffecting the discount rate applied\n\nChanges to the closure and rehabilitation estimate for operating sites are added to, or deducted from, the/uni00A0related asset and amortised on a prospective basis accordingly over the remaining life of the operation, generally applying the units of production method.\n\nCosts arising from unforeseen circumstances, such as the contamination caused by unplanned discharges, are recognised as an expense and liability when the event gives rise to an obligation that is/uni00A0probable and capable of reliable estimation.\n\napproximately US$210 million in respect of closed sites was recognised in the income statement.\n\nWhile the closure and rehabilitation provisions re/f.shortlect management's best estimates based on current knowledge and information, further studies and detailed analysis of the closure activities for individual assets will be performed as the assets near the end of their operational life and/or detailed closure plans are required to be submitted to relevant regulatory authorities. Such studies and analysis can impact the estimated costs of closure activities. Estimates can also be impacted by the emergence of new restoration techniques, changes in regulatory requirements for rehabilitation, risks relating to climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy, and experience at other operations. These uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure di/ffering from the amounts currently provided for in the balance sheet.\n\n## Sensitivity\n\nA further 0.5 per cent decrease in the discount rates applied at 30 June 2021 would result in an increase to the closure and rehabilitation provision of approximately US$1,075 million, an increase in property, plant and equipment of approximately US$820 million in relation to operating sites and an income statement charge of approximately US$255 million in respect of closed sites. In addition, the change would result in an increase of approximately US$115 million to depreciation expense and a US$25 million reduction in net /f.shortinance costs for the year ending 30 June 2022.\n\nGiven the long-lived nature of the majority of the Group's assets, closure activities are generally not expected to occur for a signi/f.shorticant period of time. A one-year acceleration in forecast cash /f.shortlows of the Group's closure and rehabilitation provisions, in isolation, would result in an increase to the provision of approximately US$230 million, an increase in property, plant and equipment of US$180 million in relation to operating sites and an income statement charge of US$50 million in respect of closed sites.",

This share enables e/ff.shorticient and /f.shortlexible capital management across the DLC and was issued on 23 February 2016 at par value of US$10. On 16 September 2020 and on 17 March 2021, BHP Group Limited paid dividends of US$1,915 million and US$1,610 million respectively to BHP (AUS) DDS Pty Ltd under the DLC dividend share arrangements. These dividends are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nTreasury shares are shares of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc and are held by the ESOP Trusts for the purpose of issuing shares to employees under the Group's Employee Share Plans. Treasury shares are recognised at cost and deducted from equity, net of any income tax e/ffects. When the treasury shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable costs and income tax e/ffects, is recognised as an increase in equity. Any di/fference between the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in retained earnings.\n\nEach of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc issued one Special Voting share to facilitate joint voting by shareholders of BHP Group Limited and/uni00A0BHP Group Plc on Joint Electorate Actions. There has been no movement in these shares.\n\nPreference shares have the right to repayment of the amount paid up on the nominal value and any unpaid dividends in priority to the holders of any other class of shares in BHP Group Plc on a return of capital or winding up. The holders of preference shares have limited voting rights if payment of the preference dividends are six months or more in arrears or a resolution is passed changing the rights of the preference shareholders. There has been no/uni00A0movement in these shares, all of which are held by/uni00A0JP/uni00A0Morgan Limited.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, the freight index has historically been volatile which creates signi/f.shorticant short-term /f.short luctuation in these liabilities.\n\n|                                                                      | 2021    | 2021        | 2020  Restated   | 2020  Restated   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------|------------------|------------------|\n| US$M                                                                 | Current | Non-current | Current          | Non-current      |\n| Interest bearing liabilities                                         |         |             |                  |                  |\n| Bank loans                                                           | 437     | 1,823       | 737              | 1,755            |\n| Notes and debentures                                                 | 1,244   | 13,525      | 3,354            | 17,691           |\n| Lease liabilities                                                    | 889     | 3,007       | 853              | 2,590            |\n| Bank overdraft and short-term borrowings                             | -       | -           | -                | -                |\n| Other                                                                | 58      | -           | 68               | -                |\n| Total interest bearing liabilities                                   | 2,628   | 18,355      | 5,012            | 22,036           |\n| Less: Lease liability associated with index-linked freight contracts | 346     | 679         | 379              | 781              |\n| Less: Cash and cash equivalents                                      |         |             |                  |                  |\n| Cash                                                                 | 4,408   | -           | 3,493            | -                |\n| Short-term deposits                                                  | 10,838  | -           | 9,933            | -                |\n| Less: Total cash and cash equivalents                                | 15,246  | -           | 13,426           | -                |\n| Less: Derivatives included in net debt                               |         |             |                  |                  |\n| Net debt management related instruments (1)                          | 20      | 537         | (162)            | 595              |\n| Net cash management related instruments (2)                          | 34      | -           | (15)             | -                |\n| Less: Total derivatives included in net debt                         | 54      | 537         | (177)            | 595              |\n| Net debt                                                             |         | 4,121       |                  | 12,044           |\n| Net assets (3)                                                       |         | 55,605      |                  | 52,175           |\n| Gearing                                                              |         | 6.9%        |                  | 18.8%            |\n\n- (1) Represents the net cross currency and interest rate swaps designated as e/ffective hedging instruments included within current and non-current other /f.shortinancial assets and liabilities.\n\nCash and short-term deposits are disclosed in the cash /f.shortlow statement net of bank overdrafts and interest bearing liabilities at call.\n\n|                                                    | 2021  US$M   | 2020  US$M   | 2019  US$M   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Total cash and cash equivalents                    | 15,246       | 13,426       | 15,613       |\n| Bank overdrafts and short-term borrowings          | -            | -            | (20)         |\n| Total cash and cash equivalents, net of overdrafts | 15,246       | 13,426       | 15,593       |\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nCash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and on hand and highly liquid cash deposits with short-term maturities that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insigni/f.shorticant risk of change in value.

Moody's a/ff.shortirmed its credit rating on 31 May 2021. The Group's Standard & Poor's rating changed from A/A/hyphen.uc1 outlook stable (long-term/short-term) to A/A/hyphen.uc1 CreditWatch negative (long-term/ short-term) on 23 August 2021.\n\nThere were no defaults on the Group's liabilities during the period.\n\n## Counterparty risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to credit risk from its /f.shortinancing activities, including short-term cash investments such as deposits with banks and derivative contracts. This risk is managed by Group Treasury in line with the counterparty risk framework, which aims to minimise the exposure to a counterparty and mitigate the risk of /f.shortinancial loss through counterparty failure.\n\nExposure to counterparties is monitored at a Group level across all products and includes exposure with derivatives and cash investments.\n\nInvestments and derivatives are only transacted with approved counterparties who have been assigned speci/f.shortic limits based on a quantitative credit risk model. These limits are updated at least bi-annually. Additionally, derivatives are subject to tenor limits and investments are subject to concentration limits by rating.\n\nDerivative fair values are inclusive of valuation adjustments that take into account both the counterparty and the Group's risk of default.\n\n## Standby arrangements and unused credit facilities\n\nThe Group's committed revolving credit facility operates as a back-stop to the Group's uncommitted commercial paper program. The combined amount drawn under the facility or as commercial paper will not exceed US$5.5 billion. As at 30 June 2021, US$ nil commercial paper was drawn (2020: US$ nil). During the year, the Group completed a one-year extension to the facility which is now due to mature on 10 October 2025. A commitment fee is payable on/uni00A0the undrawn balance and an interest rate comprising an interbank rate plus a margin applies to any drawn balance. The agreed margins are typical for a/uni00A0credit facility extended to a company with the Group's credit rating.\n\n## Maturity pro/f.shortile of /f.shortinancial liabilities\n\nThe maturity pro/f.shortile of the Group's /f.shortinancial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual amounts, taking into account the derivatives related to debt, is/uni00A0as follows:\n\n| 2021  US$M                                                        | Bank loans,  debentures and   other loans   | Expected  future interest  payments   | Derivatives  related to  debentures   | Other  derivatives   | Obligations  under lease  liabilities   | Trade   and other  payables (1)   | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------|\n| Due for payment:                                                  |                                             |                                       |                                       |                      |                                         |                                   |         |\n| In one year or less or on demand                                  | 1,722                                       | 729                                   | 61                                    | 149                  | 980                                     | 6,851                             | 10,492  |\n| In more than one year but not more than/uni00A0two years          | 2,278                                       | 661                                   | 267                                   | 80                   | 680                                     | -

Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments from the lease commencement date and are subsequently adjusted to re/f.shortlect the interest on lease liabilities, lease payments and any remeasurements due to, for example, lease modi/f.shortications or a change to future lease payments linked to an index or rate. Lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, where this is readily determinable. Where the implicit interest rate is not readily determinable, the interest payments are discounted at the Group's incremental borrowing rate, adjusted to re/f.shortlect factors speci/f.shortic to the lease, including where relevant the currency, tenor and location of/uni00A0the lease.\n\nIn addition to containing a lease, the Group's contractual arrangements may include non-lease components. For example, certain mining services arrangements involve the provision of additional services, including maintenance, drilling activities and the supply of personnel. The Group has elected/uni00A0to separate these non-lease components from the lease components in measuring lease liabilities.",

Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate are excluded from lease liabilities, and expensed to the income statement.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost will initially correspond to the lease liability, adjusted for initial direct costs, lease payments made prior to lease commencement, capitalised provisions for closure and rehabilitation and any lease incentives.\n\nThe lease asset and liability associated with all index-linked freight contracts, including continuous voyage charters (CVCs), are measured at each reporting date based on the prevailing freight index (generally the Baltic C5 index).\n\nLease costs are recognised in the income statement over the lease term in the form of depreciation on the right-of-use asset and /f.shortinance charges representing the unwind of the discount on the lease liability. Lease costs for the year ended 30 June 2019 represent operating lease expenses previously reported under IAS 17.\n\nWhere the Group is the operator of an unincorporated joint operation and all investors are parties to a lease, the Group recognises its proportionate share of the lease liability and associated right-of-use asset. In the event the Group is the sole signatory to a lease, and therefore has the sole legal obligation to make lease payments, the lease liability is recognised in full. Where the associated right-of-use asset is sub-leased (under a /f.shortinance sublease) to a joint operation, for instance where it is dedicated to a single operation and the joint operation has the right to direct the use of the asset, the Group recognises its proportionate share of the right-of-use asset and a net investment in the lease, representing amounts to be recovered from the other parties to the joint operation. If the Group is not party to the lease contract but sub-leases the associated right-of-use asset, it recognises its/uni00A0proportionate share of the right-of-use asset and a lease liability which is payable to the operator.\n\n## Key judgements and estimates\n\nJudgements: Certain contractual arrangements not in the form of a lease require the Group to apply signi/f.shorticant judgement in evaluating whether the Group controls the right to direct the use of assets and therefore whether the contract contains a lease. Management considers all facts and circumstances in determining whether the Group or the supplier has the rights to direct how, and for what purpose, the underlying assets are used in certain mining contracts and other arrangements, including outsourcing arrangements, shipping arrangements and power purchase agreements. Judgement is used to/uni00A0assess which decision-making rights mostly a/ffect the bene/f.shortits of use/uni00A0of the assets for each arrangement.\n\nWhere a contract includes the provision of non-lease services, judgement is required to identify the lease and non-lease components.\n\nEstimates: Where the Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, estimation is involved in the determination\n\nof/uni00A0the weighted average incremental borrowing rate to measure lease liabilities. The incremental borrowing rate re/f.shortlects the rates of interest a lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, with similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. Under the Group's portfolio approach to debt management, the Group does not speci/f.shortically borrow for asset purchases. Therefore, the incremental borrowing rate is estimated with reference to the Group's corporate borrowing portfolio, adjusted to re/f.shortlect the terms and conditions of the lease (including the impact of currency, credit rating of subsidiary entering into the lease and the term of the lease), at the inception of the/uni00A0lease arrangement or the time of lease modi/f.shortication.\n\nThe Group estimates stand-alone prices, where such prices are not readily observable, in order to allocate the contractual payments between lease and non-lease components.\n\n## 22  Net /f.shortinance costs\n\n|                                                              | 2021   US$M   | 2020   US$M   | 2019   US$M   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Financial expenses                                           |               |               |               |\n| Interest expense using the e/ffective interest rate method:  |               |               |               |\n| Interest on bank loans, overdrafts and all other borrowings  | 610           | 1,099         | 1,296         |\n| Interest capitalised at 2.83% (2020: 4.14%; 2019: 4.96%) (1) | (248)         | (308)         | (248)         |\n| Interest on lease liabilities                                | 109           | 90            | 47            |\n| Discounting on provisions and other liabilities              | 467           | 452           | 470           |\n| Other gains and losses:                                      |               |               |               |\n| Fair value change on hedged loans                            | (779)         | 721           | 729           |\n| Fair value change on hedging derivatives                     | 704           | (788)         | (809)         |\n| Loss on bond repurchase (2)                                  | 395           | -             | -             |\n| Exchange variations on net debt                              | 99            | (18)          | 6             |\n| Other                                                        | 21            | 14            | 19            |\n| Total /f.shortinancial expenses                              | 1,378         | 1,262         | 1,510         |\n| Financial income                                             |               |               |               |\n| Interest income                                              | (73)          | (351)         | (446)         |\n| Net /f.shortinance costs                                     | 1,305         | 911           | 1,064         |\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nInterest income is accrued using the e/ffective interest rate method.

These risks arise in the normal course of business and the Group manages its exposure to them in accordance with the Group's portfolio risk management strategy. The objective of the strategy is to support the delivery of the Group's /f.shortinancial targets, while protecting its future /f.shortinancial security and /f.shortlexibility by taking advantage of the natural diversi/f.shortication provided by the scale, diversity and /f.shortlexibility of the Group's operations and activities.\n\nAs part of the risk management strategy, the Group monitors target gearing levels and credit rating metrics under a range of di/fferent stress test scenarios incorporating operational and macroeconomic factors (refer to 1.16 'Robust risk assessment and viability statement').\n\n## Market risk management\n\nThe Group's activities expose it to market risks associated with movements in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices. Under the strategy outlined above, the Group seeks to achieve /f.shortinancing costs, currency impacts, input costs and commodity prices on a /f.shortloating or index basis. This strategy gives rise to a risk of variability in earnings, which is measured under the Cash Flow at Risk (CFaR) framework.\n\nIn executing the strategy, /f.shortinancial instruments are potentially employed in three distinct but related activities. The following table summarises these activities and the key risk management processes:\n\n| Activity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Key risk management processes                                                                       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 Risk mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                     |\n| On an exception basis, hedging for the purposes of mitigating risk related to speci/f.shortic and signi/f.shorticant  expenditure on investments or capital projects, will be executed if necessary to support the Group's  strategic objectives.                                                                | Execution of transactions within  approved mandates.                                                |\n| 2 Economic hedging of commodity sales, operating costs, short-term cash deposits, other monetary  items and debt instruments                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                     |\n| Where Group commodity production is sold to customers on pricing terms that deviate from the relevant  index target and where a relevant derivatives market exists, /f.shortinancial instruments may be executed as an  economic hedge to align the revenue price exposure with the index target and US dollars. | Measuring and reporting the exposure  in customer commodity contracts and  issued debt instruments. |\n| Where debt is issued in a currency other than the US dollar and/or at a /f.shortixed interest rate, fair value and  cash /f.shortlow hedges may be executed to align the debt exposure with the Group's functional currency of  US/uni00A0dollars and/or to swap to a /f.shortloating interest rate.             | Executing hedging derivatives to align the  total group exposure to the index target.               |\n| Where short-term cash deposits and other monetary items are denominated in a currency other than  US/uni00A0dollars, derivative /f.shortinancial instruments may be executed to align the foreign exchange exposure  to/uni00A0the/uni00A0Group's functional currency of US dollars.                             | Execution of transactions within  approved mandates.                                                |\n| 3 Strategic /f.shortinancial transactions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                     |\n| Opportunistic transactions may be executed with /f.shortinancial instruments to capture value from perceived  market over/under valuations.                                                                                                                                                                      | Execution of transactions within  approved mandates.                                                |\n\nPrimary responsibility for the identi/f.shortication and control of /f.shortinancial risks, including authorising and monitoring the use of /f.shortinancial instruments for the above activities and stipulating policy thereon, rests with the Financial Risk Management Committee under authority delegated by the Chief Executive O/ff.shorticer.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding borrowings and short-term cash deposits from the possibility that changes in interest rates will a/ffect future cash /f.shortlows or the fair value of /f.shortixed interest rate /f.shortinancial instruments. Interest rate risk is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.\n\nThe majority of the Group's debt is issued at /f.shortixed interest rates. The Group has entered into interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps to convert most of its /f.shortixed interest rate exposure to /f.shortloating US dollar interest rate exposure. As at 30 June 2021, 82 per cent of the Group's borrowings were exposed to /f.shortloating interest rates inclusive of the e/ffect of swaps (2020: 87 per cent).\n\nThe fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps in hedge relationships used to hedge both interest rate and foreign currency risks are shown in the valuation hierarchy of this note.\n\nBased on the net debt position as at 30 June 2021, taking into account interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps, it is estimated that a one percentage point increase in the US LIBOR interest rate will increase the Group's equity and pro/f.shortit after taxation by US$7 million (2020: decrease of/uni00A0US$47 million). This assumes the change in interest rates is e/ffective from the beginning of the /f.shortinancial year and the /f.shortixed//f.shortloating mix and balances are constant over the year.\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nThe London Interbank O/ffered Rate (LIBOR) and other benchmark interest rates are expected to be replaced by alternative risk-free rates (ARR) by the end of CY2021 as part of inter-bank o/ffer rate (IBOR) reform. The Group has established a project to assess the implications of IBOR reform across the Group, and to manage and execute the transition from current discontinuing IBORs rates to ARR, including updating policies, systems and processes. A detailed due diligence review has identi/f.shortied a range of contracts that reference IBORs, including derivative instruments, money market deposits, lease agreements, supply contracts and joint venture agreements. The Group is in the process of developing action plans for each of these arrangements to/uni00A0ensure a smooth transition to ARR.\n\nThe Group has early adopted amendments to IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' and IFRS 16 'Leases' in relation to IBOR reform (refer to note 39 'New and amended accounting standards and interpretations and changes to accounting policies'). In particular, the IBOR reform impacts the Group's interest rate swaps, which reference US LIBOR, and the associated hedge accounting. Refer to section 23.4 'Derivatives and hedge accounting' for further information.",

        "page_content": "## 23  Financial risk management continued\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe US dollar is the predominant functional currency within the Group and as a result, currency exposures arise from transactions and balances in/uni00A0currencies other than the US dollar. The Group's potential currency exposures comprise:\n\n- -  translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items\n- -  transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues\n\nThe Group's foreign currency risk is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.\n\n## Translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items\n\nMonetary items, including /f.shortinancial assets and liabilities, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of an operation are periodically restated to US dollar equivalents and the associated gain or loss is taken to the income statement. The exception is foreign exchange gains or losses on/uni00A0foreign currency denominated provisions for closure and rehabilitation at operating sites, which are capitalised in property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe Group has entered into cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forwards to convert its signi/f.shorticant foreign currency exposures in/uni00A0respect of monetary items into US dollars. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates are therefore not expected to have a signi/f.shorticant impact on equity and pro/f.shortit after tax.\n\nThe following table shows the foreign currency risk arising from /f.shortinancial assets and liabilities, which are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar:\n\n| Net /f.shortinancial (liabilities)/assets - by currency of denomination   | 2021  US$M   | 2020  US$M   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Australian dollars                                                        | (4,421)      | (3,788)      |\n| Chilean peso                                                              | (649)        | (369)        |\n| British pound sterling                                                    | 535          | 587          |\n| Euro                                                                      | 366          | 619          |\n| Other                                                                     | 128          | (17)         |\n| Total                                                                     | (4,041)      | (2,968)      |\n\nThe principal non-functional currencies to which the Group is exposed are the Australian dollar, the Chilean peso, the Pound sterling and the Euro. Based on the Group's net /f.shortinancial assets and liabilities as at 30 June 2021, a weakening of the US dollar against these currencies (one cent strengthening in Australian dollar, 10 pesos strengthening in Chilean peso, one penny strengthening in Pound sterling and one cent strengthening in Euro), with all other variables held constant, would decrease the Group's equity and pro/f.shortit after taxation by US$21 million (2020: decrease of US$12 million).\n\n## Transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues\n\nCertain operating and capital expenditure is incurred in currencies other than an operation's functional currency. To a lesser extent, certain sales revenue is earned in currencies other than the functional currency of operations and certain exchange control restrictions may require that funds be maintained in currencies other than the functional currency of the operation. These currency risks are managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy. The Group may enter into forward exchange contracts when required under this strategy.\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nThe risk associated with commodity prices is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy. Substantially all of the Group's commodity production is sold on market-based index pricing terms, with derivatives used from time to time to achieve a speci/f.shortic outcome.\n\nFinancial instruments with commodity price risk comprise forward commodity and other derivative contracts with a net assets fair value of US$138 million (2020: US$159 million). Signi/f.shorticant commodity price risk instruments within other derivative balances include derivatives embedded in physical commodity purchase and sales contracts of gas in Trinidad and Tobago with a net assets fair value of US$121 million (2020: US$180 million). These are included within other derivatives and fair value measurement related to these resulted in an expense of US$59 million (2020: expense of US$22 million).\n\nThe potential e/ffect on these derivatives' fair values of using reasonably possible alternative assumptions in the valuation models, based on a change in the most signi/f.shorticant input, such as commodity prices, by 10 per cent with all other factors held constant (including the pricing on underlying physical exposures), would increase or decrease pro/f.shortit after taxation by US$26 million (2020: US$8 million).\n\n## Provisionally priced commodity sales and purchases contracts\n\nProvisionally priced sales or purchases volumes are those for which price /f.shortinalisation, referenced to the relevant index, is outstanding at the reporting date. Provisional pricing mechanisms within these sales and purchases arrangements have the character of a commodity derivative. Trade receivables or payables under these contracts are carried at fair value through pro/f.shortit and loss using a method categorised as Level 2 based on forecast selling prices in the quotation period. The Group's exposure at 30 June 2021 to the impact of movements in commodity prices upon provisionally invoiced sales and purchases volumes was predominately around copper.\n\nThe Group had 254 thousand tonnes of copper exposure as at 30 June 2021 (2020: 301 thousand tonnes) that was provisionally priced. The /f.shortinal price of these sales and purchases volumes will be determined during the /f.shortirst half of FY2022. A 10 per cent change in the price of copper realised on the provisionally priced sales, with all other factors held constant, would increase or decrease pro/f.shortit after taxation by US$166 million (2020: US$134 million).\n\nThe relationship between commodity prices and foreign currencies is complex and movements in foreign exchange rates can impact commodity prices.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nRefer to note 20 'Net debt' for details on the Group's liquidity risk.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a /f.shortinancial instrument or customer contract, leading to a /f.shortinancial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily from customer receivables) and from its /f.shortinancing activities, including deposits with banks and /f.shortinancial institutions, other short-term investments, interest rate and currency derivative contracts and other /f.shortinancial instruments.\n\nRefer to note 8 'Trade and other receivables' and note 20 'Net debt' for details on the Group credit risk.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

Financial assets are initially recognised on their trade date.\n\nFinancial assets are subsequently carried at fair value or amortised cost based on:\n\n- -  the Group's purpose, or business model, for holding the /f.shortinancial asset\n- -  whether the /f.shortinancial asset's contractual terms give rise to cash /f.shortlows that are solely payments of principal and interest\n\nThe resulting Financial Statements classi/f.shortications of /f.shortinancial assets can be summarised as follows:\n\n| Contractual cash /f.shortlows   | Business model                                                         | Category                                      |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Solely principal and interest   | Hold in order to collect contractual cash /f.shortlows                 | Amortised cost                                |\n| Solely principal and interest   | Hold in order to collect contractual cash /f.shortlows and/uni00A0sell | Fair value through other comprehensive income |\n| Solely principal and interest   | Hold in order to sell                                                  | Fair value through pro/f.shortit or loss      |\n| Other                           | Any of those mentioned above                                           | Fair value through pro/f.shortit or loss      |\n\nSolely principal and interest refers to the Group receiving returns only for the time value of money and the credit risk of the counterparty for /f.shortinancial assets held. The main exceptions for the Group are provisionally priced receivables and derivatives which are measured at fair value through the income/uni00A0statement under IFRS 9.\n\nThe Group has the intention of collecting payment directly from its customers in most cases, however the Group also participates in receivables /f.short inancing programs in respect of selected customers. Receivables in these portfolios which are classi/f.shortied as 'hold in order to sell', are provisionally priced/uni00A0receivables and are therefore held at fair value through pro/f.shortit or loss prior to sale to the /f.shortinancial institution.\n\nWith the exception of derivative contracts and provisionally priced trade payables, the Group's /f.shortinancial liabilities are classi/f.shortied as subsequently measured at amortised cost.\n\nThe Group may in addition elect to designate certain /f.shortinancial assets or liabilities at fair value through pro/f.shortit or loss or to apply hedge accounting where/uni00A0they are not mandatorily held at fair value through pro/f.shortit or loss.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.\n\n## Fair value measurement\n\nThe carrying amount of /f.shortinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value is principally calculated based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for these /f.shortinancial assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as unquoted prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Where no price information is available from a quoted market source, alternative market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions, fair value is estimated based on the Group's views on relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit in such estimates.\n\nThe inputs used in fair value calculations are determined by the relevant segment or function. The functions support the assets and operate under a de/f.shortined set of accountabilities authorised by the Executive Leadership Team. Movements in the fair value of /f.shortinancial assets and liabilities may be recognised through the income statement or in other comprehensive income.\n\nFor /f.shortinancial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, the Group uses the following to categorise the method used based on the lowest level input that is/uni00A0signi/f.shorticant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n\n| IFRS 13 Fair value hierarchy   | Level 1                                                                                                               | Level 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Level 3                                                                                                                               |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Valuation method               | Based on quoted prices (unadjusted)  in active markets for identical /f.shortinancial  assets and/uni00A0liabilities. | Based on inputs other than quoted  prices included within Level 1 that  are/uni00A0observable for the /f.shortinancial  asset/uni00A0or/uni00A0liability, either directly   (i.e. as unquoted prices) or indirectly   (i.e. derived from prices). | Based on inputs not observable in the  market using appropriate valuation  models, including discounted   cash /f.shortlow modelling. |",

In the case of US$3,018 million (2020: US$3,019 million) of /f.shortixed rate debt not swapped to /f.shortloating rate, the fair value at 30 June 2021 was US$4,052 million (2020: US$4,114 million). The fair value is determined using a method that can be categorised as Level 2 and uses inputs based on benchmark interest rates, alternative market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions.\n\nFor /f.shortinancial instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the/uni00A0hierarchy by reassessing categorisation at the end of each reporting period. There were no transfers between categories during the period.\n\n## O/ffsetting /f.shortinancial assets and liabilities\n\nThe Group enters into money market deposits and derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association master netting agreements that do not meet the criteria for o/ffsetting, but allow for the related amounts to be set-o/ff in certain circumstances. The amounts set out as/uni00A0cross currency and interest rate swaps in the table above represent the derivative /f.shortinancial assets and liabilities of the Group that may be subject to/uni00A0the above arrangements and are presented on a gross basis.\n\n## 23.4  Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group uses derivatives to hedge its exposure to certain market risks and may elect to apply hedge accounting.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nDerivatives are included within /f.shortinancial assets or liabilities at fair value through pro/f.shortit or loss unless they are designated as e/ffective hedging instruments. Financial instruments in this category are classi/f.shortied as current if they are expected to be settled within 12 months otherwise they are/uni00A0classi/f.shortied as non-current.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 23  Financial risk management continued\n\nWhere hedge accounting is applied, at the start of the transaction, the Group documents the type of hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged items and its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The documentation also demonstrates that the hedge is expected to be e/ffective.\n\nThe Group applies the following types of hedge accounting to its derivatives hedging the interest rate and currency risks in its notes and debentures:\n\n- -  Fair value hedges - the fair value gain or loss on interest rate and cross currency swaps relating to interest rate risk, together with the change in the fair value of the hedged /f.shortixed rate borrowings attributable to interest rate risk are recognised immediately in the income statement. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the fair value adjustment on the note or debenture is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity using a recalculated e/ffective interest rate.\n- -  Cash /f.shortlow hedges - changes in the fair value of cross currency interest rate swaps which hedge foreign currency cash /f.shortlows on the notes and debentures are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cash /f.shortlow hedging reserve. To the extent a hedge is/uni00A0ine/ffective, changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.\n- When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is amortised to the income statement over the period to the hedged item's maturity.\n\nWhen hedged, the Group hedges the full notional value of notes or debentures. However, certain components of the fair value of derivatives are not permitted under IFRS 9 to be included in the hedge accounting above. Certain costs of hedging are permitted to be recognised in other comprehensive income. Any change in the fair value of a derivative that does not qualify for hedge accounting, or is ine/ffective in hedging the designated risk due to contractual di/fferences between the hedged item and hedging instrument, is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nThe table below shows the carrying amounts of the Group's notes and debentures by currency and the derivatives which hedge them:\n\n- -  The carrying amount of the notes and debentures includes foreign exchange remeasurement to period-end rates and fair value adjustments when included in a fair value hedge.\n- -  The breakdown of the hedging derivatives includes remeasurement of foreign currency notional values at period-end rates, fair value movements due to interest rate risk, foreign currency cash /f.shortlows designated into cash /f.shortlow hedges, costs of hedging recognised in other comprehensive income, ine/ffectiveness recognised in the income statement and accruals or prepayments.\n- -  The hedged value of notes and debentures includes their carrying amounts adjusted for the o/ffsetting derivative fair value movements due to foreign/uni00A0currency and interest rate risk remeasurement.\n\n|            |                                            | Fair value of derivatives                   | Fair value of derivatives   | Fair value of derivatives                         | Fair value of derivatives                 | Fair value of derivatives                | Fair value of derivatives   | Fair value of derivatives   |                                            |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| 2021  US$M | Carrying  amount of  notes and  debentures | Foreign  exchange  notional at   spot rates | Interest   rate risk        | Recognised  in cash /f.shortlow  hedging  reserve | Recognised   in cost of  hedging  reserve | Recognised in  the income  statement (1) | Accrued   cash /f.shortlows | Total                       | Hedged value  of notes and  debentures (2) |\n|            | A                                          | B                                           | C                           | D                                                 | E                                         | F                                        | G                           | B to G                      | A + B + C                                  |\n| USD        | 6,270                                      | -

Refer to note 22 'Net /f.shortinance costs' for details of net /f.shortinance costs for the year.\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nIBOR reform impacts the Group's interest rate swaps, which reference 3-month US LIBOR, and the associated hedge accounting. At 30 June 2021, the notional value of hedging instruments that reference 3-month US LIBOR is US$16.8 billion. It is anticipated that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) benchmark rate will be widely adopted by market participants and e/ffectively replace US LIBOR in new contracts during FY2022. However, a number of US LIBOR settings, including 3-month US LIBOR, will continue to be published until 30 June 2023. Accordingly, absent of any agreement with counterparties to transition to an alternative risk-free rate before this date, the Group's existing interest rate swaps with maturity dates beyond 30 June 2023 will only transition to ARR once US LIBOR publication ceases. As at 30 June 2021, the Group has not transitioned any of its existing interest rate swaps to alternative risk-free rates.",

These include USD bank loans of US$2.3 billion and an undrawn revolving credit facility (refer to note 20 'Net debt').\n\nThe Group has early adopted amendments to IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' and IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' in relation to IBOR Reform (refer to note 39 'New and amended accounting standards and interpretations and changes to accounting policies'). These amendments provide reliefs from applying speci/f.shortic hedge accounting requirements to hedging arrangements directly impacted by these reforms. In particular, where changes to/uni00A0the Group's instruments arise solely as a result of IBOR reform and do not change the economic substance of the Group's arrangements, the Group is able to maintain its existing hedge relationships and accounting. The Group has applied these reliefs resulting in no impact on the Group's hedge accounting.

The DEP is provided to the participants once the underlying shares are allocated or transferred to them. Awards under the plans do not confer any rights to participate in a share issue; however, there is/uni00A0discretion under each of the plans to adjust the awards in response to a variation in the share capital of BHP Group Limited or BHP/uni00A0Group Plc.",

On the third  anniversary of the  start of a plan year,  the Group will match  the number of  acquired shares. |\n| Vesting  period               | CDP - 2 and 5 years  STIP - 2 years                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | LTIP - 5 years                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 2 years                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 3 years                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Dividend  Equivalent  Payment | CDP - Yes  STIP - Yes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | MAP - 1 to 5 years LTIP - Yes MAP - Varies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Yes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | No                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(1)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

The fair values of awards granted were estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation methodology and Black-Scholes option pricing technique and consider the following factors:\n\n- -  exercise price\n- -  expected life of the award\n- -  current market price of the underlying shares\n- -  expected volatility using an analysis of historic volatility over di/fferent rolling periods. For the LTIP, it is calculated for all sector comparators and the published MSCI World index\n- -  expected dividends\n- -  risk-free interest rate, which is an applicable government bond rate\n- -  market-based performance hurdles\n- -  non-vesting conditions\n\nWhere awards are forfeited because non-market-based vesting conditions are not satis/f.shortied, the expense previously recognised is proportionately reversed.\n\nThe tax e/ffect of awards granted is recognised in income tax expense, except to the extent that the total tax deductions are expected to exceed the cumulative remuneration expense. In this situation, the excess of the associated current or deferred tax is recognised in equity and forms part of the employee share awards reserve. The fair value of awards as presented in the tables above represents the fair value at grant date.\n\nIn respect of employee share awards, the Group utilises the Billiton Employee Share Ownership Trust and the BHP Billiton Limited Employee Equity Trust. The trustees of these trusts are independent companies, resident in Jersey. The trusts use funds provided by the Group to acquire ordinary shares to enable awards to be made or satis/f.shortied. The ordinary shares may be acquired by purchase in the market or by subscription at not less than nominal value.",

Remeasurement gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. An asset or liability is consequently  recognised in the balance sheet based on the present value of de/f.shortined bene/f.shortit obligations less the fair value of plan assets, except  that any such asset cannot exceed the present value of expected refunds from and reductions in future contributions to the plan.  De/f.shortined bene/f.shortit obligations are estimated by discounting expected future payments using market yields at the reporting date on  high-quality corporate bonds in countries that have developed corporate bond markets. However, where developed corporate  bond markets do not exist, the discount rates are selected by reference to national government bonds. In both instances, the  bonds are selected with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as/uni00A0possible, the estimated future cash /f.shortlows. |\n| De/f.shortined bene/f.shortit   post-retirement  medical/uni00A0schemes                   | The Group operates a number of post-retirement medical schemes in the United States, Canada and Europe and certain Group  companies provide post-retirement medical bene/f.shortits to qualifying retirees.

The majority of Group-sponsored de/f.shortined bene/f.shortit pension schemes have been closed to new entrants for many years. Existing bene/f.shortit schemes and the terms of employee participation in these schemes are reviewed on a regular basis.\n\n## Fund assets\n\nThe Group follows a coordinated strategy for the funding and investment of its de/f.shortined bene/f.shortit pension schemes (subject to meeting all local requirements). The Group's aim is for the value of de/f.shortined bene/f.shortit pension scheme assets to be maintained at close to the value of the corresponding bene/f.shortit obligations, allowing for some short-term volatility. Scheme assets are invested in a diversi/f.shortied range of asset classes, predominantly comprising bonds and equities.\n\nThe Group's aim is to progressively shift de/f.shortined bene/f.shortit pension scheme assets towards investments that match the anticipated pro/f.shortile of the bene/f.shortit obligations, as funding levels improve and bene/f.shortit obligations mature. Over time, this is expected to result in a further reduction in the total exposure of pension scheme assets to equity markets. For pension schemes that pay lifetime bene/f.shortits, the Group may consider and support the purchase of annuities to back these bene/f.shortit obligations if it is commercially sensible to do so.\n\n## Net liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet\n\nThe net liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is as follows:\n\n|                                                                    | De/f.shortined bene/f.shortit   pension schemes/  post-employment obligations   | De/f.shortined bene/f.shortit   pension schemes/  post-employment obligations   | Post-retirement   medical schemes   | Post-retirement   medical schemes   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                                                                    | 2021  US$M                                                                      | 2020  US$M                                                                      | 2021  US$M                          | 2020  US$M                          |\n| Present value of funded de/f.shortined bene/f.shortit obligation   | 377                                                                             | 613                                                                             | -                                   | -                                   |\n| Present value of unfunded de/f.shortined bene/f.shortit obligation | 358                                                                             | 354                                                                             | 197                                 | 214                                 |\n| Fair value of de/f.shortined bene/f.shortit scheme assets          | (398)                                                                           | (634)                                                                           | -                                   | -                                   |\n| Scheme de/f.shorticit                                              | 337                                                                             | 333                                                                             | 197                                 | 214                                 |\n| Unrecognised surplus                                               | -                                                                               | -                                                                               | -                                   | -                                   |\n| Unrecognised past service credits                                  | -                                                                               | -                                                                               | -                                   | -                                   |\n| Adjustment for employer contributions tax                          | -                                                                               | -                                                                               | -                                   | -                                   |\n| Net liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet         | 337                                                                             | 333                                                                             | 197                                 | 214                                 |\n\nThe Group has no legal obligation to settle these liabilities with any immediate contributions or additional one-o/ff contributions.

As such the Group continued to recognise its share of revenue, expenses, net /f.short inance costs and associated income tax expense related to the operation until the completion date. In addition, the Group provided transitional services to the buyer, which ceased in July 2019.\n\nThe completion adjustments included a reduction in sale proceeds, based on the operating cash generated and retained by the Group in the period prior to completion, in order to transfer the economic pro/f.shortits from 1 July 2018 to completion date to the buyers. Therefore, the pre-tax pro/f.shortit from operating the assets is largely o/ffset by a pre-tax loss on disposal. Accordingly, the net loss from Discontinued operations predominantly relates to incremental costs arising as a consequence of the divestment, including restructuring costs and provisions for surplus o/ff.shortice accommodation, and/uni00A0tax/uni00A0expenses largely triggered by the completion of the transactions.\n\nThere was no contribution of Discontinued operations for the year ended 30 June 2021 and the year ended 30 June 2020. The contribution of/uni00A0Discontinued operations included within the Group's pro/f.shortit and cash /f.shortlows for the year ended 30 June 2019 are detailed below:\n\n## Income statement - Discontinued operations\n\n|                                                        | 2019  US$M   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Pro/f.shortit after taxation from operating activities | 175          |\n| Net loss on disposal                                   | (510)        |\n| Loss after taxation                                    | (335)        |\n| Attributable to non-controlling interests              | 7            |\n| Attributable to BHP shareholders                       | (342)        |\n| Basic loss per ordinary share (cents)                  | (6.6)        |\n| Diluted loss per ordinary share (cents)                | (6.6)        |\n\nThe total comprehensive income attributable to BHP shareholders from Discontinued operations was a loss of US$342 million in FY2019.\n\nThe conversion of options and share rights would decrease the loss per share for the year ended 30 June 2019 and therefore its impact has been excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation.\n\n## Cash /f.shortlows from Discontinued operations\n\n|                                                                        | 2019  US$M   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Net operating cash /f.shortlows                                        | 474          |\n| Net investing cash /f.shortlows (1)                                    | (443)        |\n| Net /f.shortinancing cash /f.shortlows (2)                             | (13)         |\n| Net increase in cash and cash equivalents from Discontinued operations | 18           |\n| Net proceeds received from the sale of Onshore US                      | 10,531       |\n| Less Cash and cash equivalents                                         | (104)        |\n| Proceeds from divestment of Onshore US, net of its cash                | 10,427       |\n| Total cash impact                                                      | 10,445       |\n\n- (1) Includes purchases of property, plant and equipment of US$443 million.\n- (2)  Includes net repayment of interest bearing liabilities of US$6 million and dividends paid to non-controlling interests of US$7 million.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

On completion of the proposed transaction, BHP's oil and gas business would merge with Woodside, and Woodside would issue new shares to be distributed to BHP shareholders, at which time it is expected that Woodside would be owned 52 per cent and 48 per cent by existing Woodside and BHP shareholders, respectively. The merger, which has a proposed e/ffective date of 1 July 2021, is subject to con/f.shortirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of full form transaction documents, and satisfaction of conditions precedent including shareholder, regulatory and other approvals. The Group continues to assess the full /f.shortinancial reporting impacts of the proposed merger. However, the preliminary terms of the merger did not provide an indicator of impairment for our Petroleum assets at 30 June 2021. The merger is expected to be completed during the /f.shortirst half of CY2022, at which time, we would derecognise the carrying value of our Petroleum assets, which at 30 June 2021 included, but was not limited to, property plant and equipment and closure and rehabilitation provisions of approximately US$11.9 billion and US$3.9 billion, respectively.\n\nOn 17 August 2021, the Group announced its intention to realise simpli/f.shortication and enhanced strategic /f.shortlexibility bene/f.shortits through unifying its corporate structure under its existing Australian parent company.\n\nOther than the matters outlined above, no matters or circumstances have arisen since the end of the /f.shortinancial year that have signi/f.shorticantly a/ffected, or/uni00A0may signi/f.shorticantly a/ffect, the operations, results of operations or state of a/ffairs of the Group in subsequent accounting periods.\n\n## Other items\n\n## 36  Auditor's remuneration\n\n|                                                                                          | 2021  US$M   | 2020  US$M   | 2019  US$M   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Fees payable to the Group's auditors for assurance services                              |              |              |              |\n| Audit of the Group's Annual Report                                                       | 10.642       | 11.196       | 6.764        |\n| Audit of the accounts of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates                     | 1.234        | 1.262        | 5.127        |\n| Audit-related assurance services required by legislation to be provided by the auditor   | 1.770        | 1.815        | 1.358        |\n| Other assurance and agreed-upon procedures under legislation or contractual arrangements | 1.867        | 2.003        | 1.266        |\n| Total assurance services                                                                 | 15.513       | 16.276       | 14.515       |\n| Fees payable to the Group's auditors for non-assurance services                          |              |              |              |\n| Other services                                                                           | -            | 0.400        | 0.013        |\n| Total other services                                                                     | -            | 0.400        | 0.013        |\n| Total fees                                                                               | 15.513       | 16.676       | 14.528       |\n\nIn each of FY2021 and FY2020, all amounts were paid to EY or EY a/ff.shortiliated /f.shortirms.

These amendments address the /f.shortinancial reporting impacts from IBOR reform and supplement the IBOR Reform Phase 1 amendments to IFRS 7 and IFRS 9 which were early adopted by the Group in the /f.shortinancial year ended 30 June 2020. Refer to note 23 'Financial risk management' for information on IBOR reform.\n\n## Issued not yet e/ffective\n\nA number of other accounting standards and interpretations, have been issued and will be applicable in future periods. While these remain subject to ongoing assessment, no signi/f.shorticant impacts have been identi/f.shortied to date. These standards have not been applied in the preparation of these Financial Statements.\n\n## Changes in accounting policies\n\nOn 29 April 2020, the IFRS Interpretations Committee issued a decision on the application of IAS 12 'Income Taxes' when the recovery of the carrying amount of an asset gives rise to multiple tax consequences, concluding that an entity must account for distinct tax consequences separately. As a result, the Group has changed its accounting policy for assets that have no deductible or depreciable amount for income tax purposes, but do have a deductible amount for capital gains tax (CGT) when determining deferred tax. The Group's policy had been to use only the amount deductible for CGT purposes whereas the Group will now account for the distinct income tax and CGT consequences arising from the expected manner of recovery. The assets impacted by the change predominately relate to mineral rights.\n\nRetrospective application of the accounting policy change has resulted in the following adjustments:\n\n## Consolidated Balance Sheet\n\nThe consolidated balance sheet as at 1 July 2019 has been updated for the following:\n\n|                                                          | US$M   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Increase in Deferred tax liabilities                     | 1,021  |\n| Increase in Goodwill (included within Intangible assets) | 950    |\n| Decrease in Retained earnings                            | (71)   |\n\nThe goodwill recognised as a result of the change in accounting policy relates to Olympic Dam and has been tested for impairment in the period, with no impairment charge being required. Refer to note 13 'Impairment of non-current assets' for information on impairments. The comparative balance sheet as at 30 June 2020 has been restated to re/f.shortlect these amounts.\n\n## Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity\n\nThe consolidated statement of changes in equity as at 1 July 2018 and 1 July 2019 has been updated to re/f.shortlect the reduction in retained earnings of/uni00A0US$71 million.\n\n## Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\n\nThe impact of the accounting policy change on the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income is de/uni00A0minimus and therefore the comparative information has not been restated.\n\n## Consolidated Cash Flow Statement\n\nThe change in accounting policy has no impact on the consolidated cash /f.shortlow statement.",

Amounts are rounded to the nearest million dollars, unless otherwise stated\n- -  early adopting the 2020 amendments to FRS 101 re/f.shortlecting the changes in UK company law following the UK exit from the European Union which are applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021. The adoption of these amendments did not have a signi/f.shorticant impact on the Parent Company Financial Statements\n\nThe principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these Parent company Financial Statements are set out below. These have been applied consistently to all periods presented. The following disclosure exemptions have been applied under FRS 101:\n\n- -  paragraphs 45(b) and 46/hyphen.uc52 of IFRS 2 'Share-based Payment' (details of number and weighted average exercise price of share options, and how the/uni00A0fair value of goods or services received was determined)\n- -  the requirements of IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures'\n- -  paragraphs 91/endash.uc99 of IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement' (disclosure of valuation techniques and inputs used for fair value measurement of assets and liabilities)\n- -  paragraph 38 of IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements' (comparative /f.shortinancial information in respect of paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1)\n- -  disclosure of the following requirements of IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements':\n- -  10(d) - A statement of cash /f.shortlows for the period\n- -  16 - A statement that the Financial Statements are in compliance with all IFRSs\n- -  38A - Requirement for a minimum of two primary statements including cash /f.shortlow statements\n- -  38 B/hyphen.ucD - Comparative information\n- -  111 - Cash /f.shortlow statement information\n- -  134/hyphen.uc136 - Capital management disclosures\n- -  IAS 7 'Statement of Cash Flows'\n- -  paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 'Accounting Policies and Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors' (disclosure of information when an entity has/uni00A0not applied a new IFRS that has been issued and is not yet e/ffective)\n- -  paragraphs 17 and 18A of IAS 24 'Related Party Disclosures' (key management compensation)\n- -  the requirements of IAS 24 'Related Party Disclosures' (disclosure of related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group)\n\n## Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainties\n\nThe preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires the use of critical accounting estimates, and requires the application of/uni00A0judgement in applying BHP Group Plc's accounting policies. Signi/f.shorticant judgements and estimates applied in the preparation of these Parent company Financial Statements have been identi/f.shortied and disclosed throughout.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nThe accounting policy is consistent with the Group's policy on 'Foreign currencies' as set out in section 3.1.\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries (Group undertakings)\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provisions for impairments. Investments in subsidiaries are reviewed for impairment where events or/uni00A0changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.\n\nIf any such indication exists, BHP Group Plc makes an assessment of the recoverable amount. If the asset is determined to be impaired, an impairment loss will be recorded and the asset written down based on the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds the higher of fair value less cost of/uni00A0disposal and value in use. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\n## Key judgements and estimates\n\nJudgements: Assessment of indicators of impairment of investments requires signi/f.shorticant management judgement.\n\nEstimates: Assumptions in relation to the underlying cash /f.shortlow forecasts used in determining the recoverable value of investments are consistent with those used to assess the recoverable amount of individual cash generating units in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nRefer to note 13 'Impairment of non-current assets' in Section 3.1 for/uni00A0further details on the Group's impairment assessments, including key/uni00A0judgements and estimates.\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, the cost of rights and options granted is recovered from subsidiaries of the Group where the participants are employed.\n\nBHP Group Plc is the Billiton Employee Share Ownership Trust's sponsoring company and therefore the Parent company's Financial Statements of BHP Group Plc represent the combined Financial Statements of BHP Group Plc and the Trust.\n\nDisclosures related to the share-based payment plans are disclosed in note 25 'Employee share ownership plans' in section 3.1, including a description of the schemes.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nInterest income is recognised on an accruals basis using the e/ffective interest method. Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established, typically on declaration by subsidiaries.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nThe consideration paid for the repurchase of BHP Group Plc shares that are held as treasury shares is recognised as a reduction in shareholders' funds and represents a reduction in distributable reserves.\n\n## Pension costs and other post-retirement bene/f.shortits\n\nThe accounting policy is consistent with the Group's policy set out in note 27 'Pension and other post-retirement obligations' in section 3.1.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nFinancial guarantees issued by BHP Group Plc are contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the speci/f.shortied debtor fails to comply with the terms of the debt instrument. Financial guarantees are recognised initially as a liability at fair value less transaction costs as appropriate. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of expected credit losses (ECL) and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation.\n\n## 2  Trade and other receivables - Amounts owed by Group undertakings\n\n|                                    | 2021  US$M   | 2020  US$M   |\n|------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Group relief receivable            | 10           | -            |\n| Amounts owed by Group undertakings | 6,398        | 6,283        |\n| Total trade and other receivables  | 6,408        | 6,283        |\n| Comprising:                        |              |              |\n| Current                            | 6,408        | 6,283        |\n| Non-current                        | -            | -            |\n\nThe amounts due from Group undertakings primarily relate to unsecured receivable balances that are at call.\n\n## 3  Investments in subsidiaries\n\n|                                                   | 2021  US$M   | 2020  US$M   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Investments in subsidiaries (Group undertakings): |              |              |\n| At the beginning of the /f.shortinancial year     | 3,131        | 3,131        |\n| Impairment losses                                 | (1,510)      | -            |\n| At the end of the /f.shortinancial year           | 1,621        | 3,131        |\n\nBHP Group Plc had the following principal subsidiary undertakings as at 30 June 2021:\n\n| Company                    | Principal activity     | Country of incorporation   | Percentage shareholding   | Carrying value of investment  US$M   |\n|----------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| BHP Billiton Group Limited | Holding company        | UK                         | 100%                      | 1,621                                |\n| BHP Billiton Finance Plc   | Finance company        | UK                         | 99%                       | 0.1                                  |\n| BHP (AUS) DDS Pty Ltd      | General /f.shortinance | Australia                  | 100%                      | -                                    |\n\nBHP Billiton Group Limited, BHP Billiton Finance Plc and BHP (AUS) DDS Pty Ltd are included in the consolidation of the Group.\n\nAt 30 June 2021, BHP Group Plc recognised an impairment charge of US$1,510 million (after tax) in relation to its investment in BHP Billiton Group Limited, a holding company that has ownership interests in the Group's energy coal assets including New South Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC), Cerrej\u00f3n, and copper assets including Spence, Cerro Colorado and Antamina. The impairment charge is based on an equity valuation of BHP Billiton Group Limited and primarily re/f.shortlects the deterioration in value of NSWEC and Cerrej\u00f3n during the year. Refer to note 13 'Impairment of non-current assets' in/uni00A0Section 3.1 for further details on the impairment assessment of these assets.\n\nThe impairment charge re/f.shortlects recoverable amount based on fair value less costs of disposal, applying discounted cash /f.shortlow techniques (predominantly at a post-tax real discount rate of 6.5 per cent) and using Level 3 inputs. The valuation is most sensitive to changes in commodity prices, estimated future production volumes and discount rates.\n\nDuring the year, BHP Group Plc received dividends of US$ nil (2020: US$1,000 million) from BHP Billiton Group Limited and dividends of US$3,525 million (2020: US$ nil) were received from BHP (AUS) DDS Pty Ltd.\n\nIn accordance with section 409 of the UK Companies Act 2006, a full list of related undertakings is disclosed in note 13 'Related undertakings of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Group' in this section.",

These measures included an increase in the UK's main corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%, which is due to take e/ffect from 1 April 2023. The increase in rate was substantively enacted on 24 May 2021 and therefore has been re/f.shortlected in the measurement of the unrecognised deferred tax asset below.\n\nAs at 30 June 2021, BHP Group Plc had unused income tax losses of US$744 million (2020: US$658 million), with an associated income tax bene/f.shortit of US$186 million (2020: US$125 million), and other deductible temporary di/fferences of US$17 million (2020: US$14 million) with an associated income tax bene/f.shortit of US$4 million (2020: US$3 million). A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in relation to these losses and other deductible temporary di/fferences, as it is not probable that future tax pro/f.shortits will be available against which they can be utilised.\n\n## 5  Trade and other payables - Amounts owed to Group undertakings\n\n|                                    | 2021  US$M   | 2020  US$M   |\n|------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Group relief payable               | -            | 17           |\n| Amounts owed to Group undertakings | 12           | 15           |\n| Total trade and other payables     | 12           | 32           |\n| Comprising:                        |              |              |\n| Current                            | 12           | 32           |\n| Non-current                        | -            | -            |\n\nThe amounts owed to Group undertakings are unsecured and repayable on demand.\n\n## 6  Provisions\n\n|                     | 2021  US$M   | 2020  US$M   |\n|---------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Pension liabilities | 10           | 8            |\n| Total provisions    | 10           | 8            |\n| Comprising:         |              |              |\n| Current             | -            | -            |\n| Non-current         | 10           | 8            |\n\n| 2021                                          | Pension  liabilities  US$M   | Total  US$M   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------|\n| At the beginning of the /f.shortinancial year | 8                            | 8             |\n| Actuarial loss on pension scheme              | 1                            | 1             |\n| Charge for the year                           | 1                            | 1             |\n| Utilisation                                   | -                            | -             |\n| At the end of the /f.shortinancial year       | 10                           | 10            |\n\n## 7  Pension liabilities\n\nThe Group operates the UK Executive fund in the United Kingdom.

Our assessment of key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most signi/f.shorticance in our audit of the /f.shortinancial statements of the current year and include the most signi/f.shorticant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identi/f.shortied. These matters included those which had the greatest e/ffect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit, and directing the e/fforts of the engagement team.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit on the /f.shortinancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinions thereon, and we do not provide separate opinions on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have ful/f.shortilled the responsibilities described in Section 12 titled Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the /f.shortinancial report. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying /f.shortinancial report.\n\n## Assessment of the carrying value of non-current assets\n\nProperty, plant and equipment: US$73.8 billion (2020: US$72.4 billion)\n\nIntangible assets: US$1.4 billion (2020: US$1.6 billion)\n\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method: US$1.7 billion (2020: US$2.6 billion)\n\nImpairment of property, plant and equipment: US$2.6 billion (2020: US$0.5 billion)\n\nImpairment of equity accounted associates US$0.5 billion (2020: US$nil)\n\nBHP Group plc\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries US$1.6 billion (2020: US$3.1 billion)\n\nImpairment of investments in subsidiaries: US$1.5 billion (2020: US$nil)\n\n## Why signi/f.shorticant\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nRefer to Note 3 'Exceptional items', Note 11 'Property, plant and equipment', Note 12 'Intangible assets', Note 13 'Impairment of non-current assets', Note 31 'Investments accounted for using the equity method' and Note 3 of section 3.2 'Investments in subsidiaries'.\n\nAccounting standards require an assessment of indicators of impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, for each cash generating unit (CGU), including BHP Group Plc's investments in subsidiaries.\n\nThe Group's assessment of impairment indicators included an evaluation of the ongoing impact of the COVID/hyphen.uc19 pandemic, macro-economic disruptions, commodity price/uni00A0forecasts and asset operating performance.\n\nDuring the year, the Group determined that indicators of impairment existed for the Potash, New South Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC), Olympic Dam and Cerrej\u00f3n CGUs, requiring an impairment test to determine the recoverable amount of these CGU's, as disclosed in Note 13 to the /f.shortinancial statements.\n\nThe Group assessed the recoverable amount of the Potash, Olympic Dam and Cerrejon CGU's using a Fair Value Less Cost to Dispose methodology (FVLCD). The recoverable amount of NSWEC was assessed using the Value in Use (VIU) methodology, as disclosed in Note 13 to the /f.shortinancial statements.\n\nAn impairment charge of US$4,239 million (including related tax impacts) was recorded for Potash (US$2,065 million), NSWEC (US$1,704 million) and Cerrej\u00f3n (US$470 million).\n\nNo impairment charge was required following the assessment of the recoverable amount for Olympic Dam.\n\nThe principal driver of the recoverable amount of investment in subsidiaries is the estimated value of underlying operating assets held by the Group's subsidiaries. BHP Group Plc's investment in subsidiaries was impaired by US$1,510 million primarily as a result of/uni00A0the/uni00A0NSWEC and Cerrej\u00f3n impairment charges.\n\nThe primary audit procedures we performed, amongst others, included the following:\n\n- -  We evaluated the design of, and tested the operating e/ffectiveness of the internal controls over the Group's processes of assessment for indicators of impairment, and the assessment of the recoverable amount of the CGU's for which an indicator of impairment was identi/f.shortied.\n- -  We performed an independent analysis for indicators of impairment, which included considering the performance of the assets and external market conditions. Our procedures involved assessing the key inputs such as commodity price forecasts, discount rates and reserve estimation.\n- -  We considered the impact of COVID/hyphen.uc19, macro-economic disruptions through evaluation of operating performance of the CGU's.\n- -  We assessed commodity price forecasts assumed by the Group against comparable market data.\n- -  We involved our valuation specialists to assist in evaluating, amongst other things, the discount rates applied and commodity price forecasts.\n\nOur procedures to address the recoverable amounts of the Potash, NSWEC, Cerrej\u00f3n and Olympic Dam CGU's included:\n\n- -  Evaluation of whether the methodology applied complied with the requirements of the relevant accounting standards;\n- -  Assessment of the commodity price forecasts adopted with reference to broker and analyst data and publicly available peer company information;\n- -  Assessment of the discount rate adopted, with reference to external market data including government bond rates and other relevant companies data;\n- -  Determination of whether the cash /f.shortlow projections agreed to approved plans, capital allocations, budgets and forecasts and assessment of the reasonableness of the forecast cash/f.shortlows against the past performance of the CGUs;\n- -  Evaluation of the historical accuracy of prior year's forecasted cash/f.shortlows by comparing to current year's actual cash /f.shortlows;\n- -  For those CGU's assessed under a FVLCD methodology, in assessing how a market participant would attribute value, we evaluated comparable transaction data and related market participant information;\n- -  Performance of sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions such as commodity price forecasts, discount rates, production, operating costs and capital expenditure; and\n- -  Testing the mathematical accuracy of the impairment models.",

Our assessment of key audit matters continued\n\n## Assessment of the carrying value of non-current assets continued\n\n## Why signi/f.shorticant\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nThe assessment of the recoverable amount of these CGUs and consequently, BHP Group Plc's investments in subsidiaries were considered to be a key audit matter as it involves signi/f.shorticant judgement. Auditing the recoverable amount of CGU's is complex and subjective due to the use of forward-looking estimates, which are inherently di/ff.shorticult to determine with precision. There is also a level of/uni00A0judgement applied by the/uni00A0Group in determining the key/uni00A0inputs into these forward-looking estimates.\n\nThe key estimates in the Group's determination of the recoverable amount, which in/f.shortluence whether or not an impairment charge or reversal is recognised, were as follows:\n\n- -  Commodity prices: the Group's commodity price forecasts have a signi/f.shorticant impact on CGU impairment assessments, and these are inherently uncertain. There is a risk that these commodity price forecasts are not reasonable and may not appropriately re/f.shortlect changes in supply and demand, including the impact of climate change and energy transition, leading to a material misstatement.\n- -  Reserves: auditing the estimation of reserves is complex as there is signi/f.shorticant estimation uncertainty in assessing the quantities of reserves, and the amount that will be recovered based on future production estimates.\n- -  Discount rates: given the long life of the Group's assets, recoverable amounts are sensitive to the discount rate applied. Determining the appropriate discount rate to apply to a CGU is judgemental.\n- -  Estimating FVLCD: given that this approach uses relevant information generated by transactions involving comparable assets, determining the perspectives of relevant market participants is judgemental.\n\nThe Group's assessment of the potential /f.shortinancial impacts of climate change and transition to a low carbon economy are disclosed in Note 13 to the /f.shortinancial statements.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Risk and Audit Committee\n\n- -  We reported that the estimated recoverable amounts for Potash, NSWEC and Cerrej\u00f3n were reasonable and that the impairment charge was appropriately recorded in the /f.shortinancial year ended 30 June 2021.\n- -  We concluded that the recoverable amount of Olympic Dam was appropriately supported, and consequently no impairment was required.\n- -  We are satis/f.shortied that management has re/f.shortlected their best estimate of the impacts of climate change in the impairment indicator assessment and determination of the recoverable amounts for CGUs, including climate related commitments, such as planned transition to renewable energy arrangements and the assessment of climate considerations on commodity price forecasts.\n- -  We concluded that the impairment charge re/f.shortlected in the BHP Group Plc /f.shortinancial statements is appropriate.\n\nThe Group uses internal and external experts to provide geological, metallurgical, mine planning, commodity price forecasts and technological information to support key assumptions in the impairment models. With assistance from our mining and oil and gas reserves experts, we examined the information provided by the Group's experts, including assessment of the reserve estimation methodology against the relevant industry and regulatory guidance. We also assessed the quali/f.shortications, competence and the objectivity/uni00A0of the internal and external experts.\n\nWith the assistance of our climate change and valuation specialists we have also evaluated how the Group's response to climate change had been re/f.shortlected in the assessment of asset carrying values, by way of commodity price forecasts, climate related commitments and carbon prices.\n\nWe assessed the adequacy of the disclosures included in Notes 11, 12, 13 and 31 to/uni00A0the/uni00A0/f.shortinancial statements.\n\nOur procedures were performed by the Group engagement team as well as our local/uni00A0audit team in Australia.\n\nProcedures performed over the investment in subsidiaries of BHP Group Plc:\n\nWe assessed the impact of changes in the estimated future cash /f.shortlows on the recoverable amount of BHP Group Plc's investments in subsidiaries.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

The factors that we considered when assessing the scope of the audit, and the level of work to be performed at each  asset or group function that were in scope for Group reporting purposes, included the following: -  the /f.shortinancial signi/f.shorticance to BHP's earnings, total assets or total liabilities, including consideration of the /f.shortinancial                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | We are required to establish an overall audit strategy that sets the scope, timing and direction of our audit, and that  guides the development of our audit plan.

-  the signi/f.shorticance of speci/f.shortic risks relating to an asset or group function: history of unusual or complex transactions,  identi/f.shortication of signi/f.shorticant audit issues or the potential for, or a history of, material misstatements; and -  the e/ffectiveness of the control environment and monitoring activities, including entity-level controls. Of the 36 (2020: 36) assets and group functions ('locations'), we selected 9 (2020: 10) locations based on their size or risk  characteristics and performed full scope audits of the complete /f.shortinancial information at 4 (2020: 4) locations. Of the full  scope locations, 3 (2020: 3) are the most signi/f.shorticant assets within the Iron Ore, Copper and Coal segments. The additional  full scope location is the Group Treasury Function. For the other 5 (2020: 6) locations we performed speci/f.shortic scope audit  procedures on individual account balances within the location based on their size and risk pro/f.shortiles. The audit scope of  these components may not have included testing of all signi/f.shorticant accounts of the component but will have contributed  to the coverage of signi/f.shorticant accounts tested for the Group.  Speci/f.shortied In addition to the 9 full and speci/f.shortic scope locations above, we selected 15 (2020: 10) locations to perform procedures  speci/f.shortied by the group audit team in response to speci/f.shortic risk factors and in order to ensure that, at the overall Group level,  we reduced and appropriately covered the residual risk of error. Centralised group functions For full and speci/f.shortic scope locations, as well as speci/f.shortied procedures locations, we have performed procedures over  certain accounts by testing group functions which have centralised processes for revenue and accounts receivables,  purchase to pay, treasury, property, plant and equipment, employee bene/f.shortits, right of use assets and lease liabilities  and/uni00A0the elimination of intercompany balances.  Group wide procedures We performed centralised procedures across the entire Group, including IT general and IT application controls over  the 1SAP IT system and audit of manual and consolidation journal entries. As well as centralised revenue and accounts  receivable testing using data analytics techniques over the Group's amounts. For the remaining 12 (2020: 16) Other Procedures locations we performed supplementary audit procedures in relation to  BHP's centralised group accounting and reporting processes including, but not limited to, the completeness of litigation  and other claims. We also performed disaggregated analytical reviews on each /f.shortinancial statement line item. | 78 8

        "page_content": "## 4.  Our Scope of the Audit of BHP\n\n## continued\n\nIntegrated global primary team and their involvement with EY component teams\n\nEY Australia and EY UK operate as one integrated group audit team which was responsible for the direction and supervision of the group audit engagement in compliance with professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. This integrated group audit team established the overall group audit strategy, communicated with component teams, performed work on the consolidation process, and evaluated the conclusions drawn from the audit evidence as the basis for forming the opinions on the /f.shortinancial statements. Audit instructions outlined the signi/f.shorticant audit areas, performance materiality thresholds, which ranged from US$169 million to US$540 million, and speci/f.shortic reporting requirements.\n\nFor the purpose of the Group audit, the integrated group audit team was responsible for directing, supervising, evaluating and reviewing the work of EY global network /f.shortirms operating under their instruction (local EY teams) to assess whether:\n\n- -  the work was performed and documented to a su/ff.shorticiently high standard;\n- -  the local EY audit team demonstrated that they had challenged management su/ff.shorticiently and had executed their audit procedures with a su/ff.shorticient level of scepticism; and\n- -  there was su/ff.shorticient appropriate audit evidence to support the conclusions reached.\n\nEach in-scope location has a local EY audit team led by a partner. Our in-scope locations cover four geographical locations, being Australia, Chile, United States and Singapore. These local audit teams were supported by an audit team in Malaysia and the Philippines performing procedures over centralised group functions.\n\nThe Group audit team interacted regularly with the local EY teams during each stage of the audit, were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process and reviewed key working papers. This, together with the additional procedures performed at the group level, gave us su/ff.shorticient appropriate audit evidence for our opinion on BHP's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Impacts of COVID/hyphen.uc19 on Group audit team involvement with EY component teams\n\nDue to the global COVID/hyphen.uc19 pandemic and the international travel restrictions, the Group audit team visits were restricted.\n\nConsistent with our monitoring approach, since the global pandemic was announced in March 2020, we maintained continuous dialogue with our local EY teams. This included: meetings with our component teams and local BHP management via video conference and performing remote review of the key workpapers associated with the component teams' audit procedures.\n\nWe attended all meetings with our component teams and local BHP management to conclude the audit procedures at each location by phone or videoconference, to ensure that we were fully aware of their progress and results of their audit procedures.\n\nIn certain locations, the performance of the year end audit was also required to be conducted remotely due to COVID/hyphen.uc19 restrictions and social distancing requirements at both component and Group locations. This was supported through remote access to the Group's /f.shortinancial systems and the use of EY software collaboration platforms for the secure and timely delivery of requested audit evidence.\n\n## 5.  Our consideration of climate change related risks\n\nThe /f.shortinancial impacts on the Group of climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy ('climate change') were considered in our audit where they have the potential to directly or indirectly impact key judgements and estimates within the /f.shortinancial statements.\n\nThe Group continues to develop its assessment of the potential impacts of climate change which is currently premised upon two scenarios; the Central Energy View and the Lower Carbon view, as explained in the Climate change section within the Basis of preparation of the /f.shortinancial statements.\n\nClimate risks have the potential to materially impact the key judgements and estimates within the /f.shortinancial report. Our audit considered those risks that could be material to the key judgement and estimates in the assessment of the carrying value of non-current assets and closure and rehabilitation provisions.\n\nThe key judgements and estimates included in the /f.shortinancial statements incorporate actions and strategies, to the extent they have been approved and can be reliably estimated in accordance with the Group's accounting policies.\n\nAccordingly, our key audit matters address how we have assessed the Group's climate related assumptions to the extent they impact each key audit matter. Our audit procedures were performed with the involvement of our climate change and valuation specialists.\n\n## 6.  Our application of materiality\n\nWe apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the e/ffect of identi/f.shortied misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinions.\n\n## Materiality\n\n## What we mean\n\n## Basis of Materiality and determination\n\nThe magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to in/f.shortluence the economic decisions of the users of the /f.shortinancial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the/uni00A0nature and extent of our audit procedures.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Group to be US$900 million, which is approximately 5% of the three-year average Group pro/f.shortit before tax and exceptional items from continuing operations. In 2020, our /f.shortirst-year audit of the Group, we used a materiality threshold of US$700 million, which was approximately 5% of the Group's 30 June 2020 pro/f.shortit before tax and exceptional items from continuing operations. We believe that a three-year average of Group pro/f.shortit before tax and exceptional items from continuing operations provides the most relevant measure to the users to assess the /f.shortinancial performance of the Group due to the volatility in commodity prices impacting current levels of pro/f.shortitability. Had we based our assessment of materiality on the same basis as 2020, the 2021 materiality would have been in excess of US$900 million. Exceptional items are de/f.shortined in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Parent Company to be US$80 million (2020: US$95 million), which is 1% of total assets. Total assets is an appropriate basis to determine materiality for an investment holding company, and 1% is a typical percentage of total assets to use to determine materiality.\n\nDuring the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and considered it to still be appropriate based on the /f.short inal/uni00A0pro/f.shortit before tax and exceptional items from continuing operations.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our application of materiality continued\n\nPerformance Materiality\n\n## What we mean\n\n## Determination of Performance Materiality\n\n## Allocation of Performance Materiality to inscope locations\n\nThe level of materiality that we applied in undertaking our audit work at each location was determined by applying a percentage of our total performance materiality. This percentage is based on the signi/f.shorticance of the location relative to BHP as a whole and our assessment of the risk of material misstatement at that location. The locations selected, together with the ranges of materiality applied, were:\n\n| Location            | Commodity/Function   | Country       | Scope           |   Performance materiality  (US$M) |\n|---------------------|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|\n| WAIO                | Iron Ore             | Australia     | Full            |                               540 |\n| Escondida           | Copper               | Chile         | Full            |                               257 |\n| BMA                 | Coal                 | Australia     | Full            |                               169 |\n| Group Functions     | Treasury             | Australia     | Full            |                               506 |\n| Marketing (Freight) | Marketing            | Singapore     | Speci/f.shortic |                               506 |\n| Samarco             | Iron Ore             | Brazil        | Speci/f.shortic |                               338 |\n| Olympic Dam         | Copper               | Australia     | Speci/f.shortic |                               169 |\n| Australian JIU      | Petroleum            | Australia     | Speci/f.shortic |                               169 |\n| Gulf of Mexico      | Petroleum            | United States | Speci/f.shortic |                               169 |\n\n## Reporting Threshold\n\n## What we mean\n\nAn amount below which identi/f.shortied misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.\n\n## Level set\n\nWe agreed with the Risk and Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit di/fferences in excess of US$45 million (2020: US$35 million), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as di/fferences below that threshold that, in/uni00A0our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nWe evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of/uni00A0other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.\n\n## 7.  Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report set out in sections 1, 2 and 4 being the Strategic Report, Governance at BHP, Remuneration Report, the Directors' Report, Additional Information and Shareholder Information, other than the /f.shortinancial statements and our auditors' report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the Annual Report.\n\nOur opinions on the /f.shortinancial statements do not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we/uni00A0do/uni00A0not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the /f.short inancial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the /f.shortinancial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we/uni00A0are/uni00A0required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## 8.  Opinions on the Remuneration Report\n\n## 8.1  EY Australia's opinion on the Remuneration Report\n\nEY Australia has audited the Remuneration Report included in section 2.2 of the Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2021. The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Remuneration Report in accordance with section 300A of the Australian Corporations Act 2001. EY Australia's responsibility is to express an opinion on the Remuneration Report, based on our audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards.\n\nIn EY Australia's opinion, the Remuneration Report of BHP Group Limited for the year ended 30 June 2021, complies with section 300A of the Australian Corporations Act 2001.\n\n## 8.2  EY UK's opinion on the part of the Remuneration Report to/uni00A0be/uni00A0audited\n\nIn EY UK's opinion, the part of the Remuneration Report prescribed by the UK Companies Act 2006 to be audited, set out in section 2.2.3 of the Annual Report, has been properly prepared in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006. This covers the following:\n\n- -  the single total /f.shortigure for remuneration of each director, as set out in section 2.2.3 (separate disclosure for Chief Executive O/ff.shorticer and Non-Executive Directors)\n- -  details of the taxable bene/f.shortits, as set out in the notes to the single total /f.shortigure for remuneration of each director\n- -  Cash and Deferred Plan ('CDP') and Long-Term Incentive Plan ('LTIP') performance targets and FY2021 CDP performance outcomes and LTIP performance outcomes, respectively\n- -  details of the total pension entitlements, as set out in the notes to the single total /f.shortigure for remuneration of each director\n- -  details of scheme interests awarded during the /f.shortinancial year, as set out in the tables within the LTIP allocated during FY2021\n- -  details of payments to past directors and for loss of o/ff.shortice\n- -  statement of directors' shareholding and share interests, as set out in the tables within the ordinary share holdings and transactions and awards under the MAP.\n\nThe application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group's overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% (2020: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely US$675 million (2020: US$525 million). In assessing the appropriate level, we consider the nature, the number and impact of the audit di/fferences identi/f.shortied in the previous year's audit.",

EY UK's reporting on speci/f.shortic sections of the other information\n\nIn section 9 'we', 'us' and 'our' refer to EY UK only.\n\n## 9.1  EY UK's conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the /f.shortinancial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the Consolidated and Parent Company Financial Statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included the following:\n\n- -  we obtained an understanding of the process over management's going concern assessment. We then evaluated the design of the controls around the budgeting process, being the basis of the going concern assessment, and tested their operating e/ffectiveness.\n- -  we obtained management's going concern model and reconciled the output of such model to management's going concern and viability paper presented to the Board and Risk and Audit Committee. We con/f.shortirmed that the method used in management's model is appropriate and checked its clerical accuracy.\n- -  we assessed the information used in the going concern assessment for consistency with the information obtained through auditing other areas of the business and challenged the assumptions, including those relating to commodity prices, production, operating costs, debt/uni00A0repayments and climate risk.\n- -  given that management prepare forecasts for other business purposes that go beyond the going concern period, we have used such forecasts in our management challenge process and considered whether events and conditions beyond the period of/uni00A0management's assessment may cast signi/f.shorticant doubt over the/uni00A0Group's and Parent Company's ability to continue as going concern; and\n- -  we tested management's severe but plausible scenario to determine if under such conditions BHP could potentially experience a liquidity shortfall.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identi/f.shortied any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast signi/f.shorticant doubt on the Group's and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern over the period to 30 September 2022.\n\nIn relation to the Group and Parent Company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the /f.shortinancial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group's and Parent/uni00A0Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## 9.2  EY UK's opinion on other matters prescribed by the UK Companies Act 2006\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\n- -  the information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the /f.shortinancial year for which the /f.shortinancial statements are prepared is/uni00A0consistent with the /f.shortinancial statements; and\n- -  the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in/uni00A0accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n\n2\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 9.3  EY UK's Corporate Governance Statement\n\nThe Listing Rules require us to review the directors' statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group's and Parent Company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code speci/f.shortied for our review.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the /f.shortinancial statements or our/uni00A0knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- -  Directors' statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identi/f.shortied set out in section 2.3.3;\n- -  Directors' explanation as to its assessment of the company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is/uni00A0appropriate set out in section 2.1.10;\n- -  Directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out in/uni00A0section 2.1.10;\n- -  Board's con/f.shortirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the/uni00A0emerging and principal risks set out in sections 1.10, 2.1.5, 2.1.10 and 2.1.11;\n- -  The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of e/ffectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out in section 2.1.10; and\n- -  The section describing the work of the Risk and Audit Committee set/uni00A0out in section set out in section 2.1.10.\n\n## 10.  Other matters which EY UK is required to report by/uni00A0exception\n\nIn section 10 'we' and 'our' refer to EY UK only.\n\nIn light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, EY UK has not identi/f.shortied material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.\n\nEY UK has nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the UK Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in/uni00A0our opinion:\n\n- -  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- -  the Parent Company /f.shortinancial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n- -  certain disclosures of directors' remuneration speci/f.shortied by law are not/uni00A0made; or\n- -  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\n\n## 11.  Responsibilities of directors\n\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement set out in section 3.4, the directors of the Group are responsible for the preparation of the /f.shortinancial statements and for being satis/f.shortied that they give a true and fair view in accordance with the relevant /f.shortinancial reporting frameworks, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of /f.shortinancial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the /f.shortinancial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or/uni00A0to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.",

        "page_content": "## 12.  Auditors' responsibilities for the audits of the /f.shortinancial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the /f.short inancial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards and ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/f.shortluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these /f.shortinancial statements.\n\nA further description of EY Australia's responsibilities for the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements together with the Directors' Declaration is located at the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board website at https://www.auasb.gov.au/admin//f.shortile/content102/c3/ ar1\\_2020.pdf. This description forms part of EY Australia auditor's report.\n\nA further description of EY UK's responsibilities for the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Financial Statements is located on the UK FRC's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of EY UK auditor's report.\n\n## 13.  Other matters EY UK are required to address\n\nIn section 13 'we' and 'our' refer to EY UK only.\n\n## 13.1  Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.\n\nThe extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the company and management.\n\nOur approach was as follows:\n\n- -  We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most signi/f.shorticant are those that relate to the reporting framework (including IFRSs, Australian Accounting Standards, the Australian Corporations Act 2001 , International Accounting Standards adopted for use within the UK, UK Companies Act 2006, the UK Corporate Governance Code, the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority) and the relevant tax compliance regulations in the jurisdictions in which BHP operates. In addition, we concluded that there are certain signi/f.shorticant laws and regulations that may have an e/ffect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the /f.shortinancial statements, mainly relating to health and safety, employee matters, bribery and corruption practices, environmental and certain aspects of company legislation recognising the regulated nature of the Group's mining and oil and gas activities and its legal form.\n- -  We understood how BHP is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the Company Secretary. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of Board minutes, papers provided to the Group's Risk and Audit Committee and the Sustainability Committee and correspondence received from regulatory bodies and noted that there was no contradictory evidence.\n\n- -  We assessed the susceptibility of the Group's /f.shortinancial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur. Our forensic specialists reviewed the BHP Ethics and Compliance fraud analytics, which were undertaken to respond to the risk of potential fraudulent or corrupt payments made to third parties. We also considered the risk of fraud through management override and, in response, incorporated data analytics across manual journal entries into our audit approach.\n- -  Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved journal entry testing, with a focus on journals meeting our de/f.shortined risk criteria based on our understanding of the business; enquiries of the legal counsel, external legal advisers, group management, internal audit and all full and speci/f.shortic scope management; review of Board and Risk and Audit Committee reporting and review of the volume and nature of complaints received by the EthicsPoint anonymous reporting service during the year.\n- -  If any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations were identi/f.shortied, these were communicated to the relevant local EY teams who performed su/ff.shorticient and appropriate audit procedures, supplemented by audit procedures performed at the Group level.\n- -  We ensured our global audit team has deep industry experience through working for many years on relevant audits, including experience of mining and oil and gas. Our audit planning included considering external market factors, for example geopolitical risk, the potential impact of climate change, commodity price risk and major trends in the industry.\n\n## 13.2  Other matters\n\n- -  Following the recommendation from the Risk and Audit Committee we were appointed by the company on 7 November 2019 to audit the /f.shortinancial statements for the year ending 30 June 2020 and subsequent /f.shortinancial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is two years covering the years ended 30 June 2020 and 30 June 2021.\n- -  The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company and we remain independent of the Group and the Parent Company in conducting the audit.\n- -  Our audit opinion is consistent with our report to the Risk and Audit Committee explaining the results of our audit.\n\n## 14.  Use of EY's reports\n\nEY Australia's report is made solely to BHP Group Limited members, as a\n\nbody, in accordance with the Australian Corporations Act 2001 .

The reserve estimates on which the Standard measure is based are subject to revision as further technical information becomes available or economic conditions change.\n\nDiscounted future net cash /f.shortlows like those shown below are not intended to represent estimates of fair value. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves, anticipated future changes in commodity prices, exchange rates, development and production costs as well as alternative discount factors representing the time value of money and adjustments for risk inherent in producing oil and gas.",

Completion refers to the installation of permanent equipment for production of oil or gas, or, in the case of a dry well, to reporting to the appropriate authority that the well has been abandoned.\n\nAn exploratory well is a well drilled to /f.shortind oil or gas in a new /f.shortield or to /f.shortind a new reservoir in a /f.shortield previously found to be productive of oil or gas in/uni00A0another reservoir. A development well is a well drilled within the limits of a known oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to/uni00A0be productive.\n\nA productive well is an exploratory, development or extension well that is not a dry well. Productive wells include wells in which hydrocarbons were encountered and the drilling or completion of which, in the case of exploratory wells, has been suspended pending further drilling or evaluation. A dry/uni00A0well (hole) is an exploratory, development, or extension well that proves to be incapable of producing either oil or gas in su/ff.shorticient quantities to/uni00A0justify completion as an oil or gas well.",

We engage in third-party trading for the following reasons:\n- \u00b7 Production variability and occasional shortfalls from our assets means that we sometimes source third-party materials to ensure a steady supply of product to our customers.\n- \u00b7 To optimise our supply chain outcomes, we may buy physical product from third-parties.\n- \u00b7 To support the development of liquid markets, we will sometimes source third-party physical products and manage risk through both the physical and /f.shortinancial markets.\n- (2) Percentage contribution to Group Underlying EBITDA, excluding Group and unallocated items.\n- (3) Underlying EBITDA margin excludes third-party products.\n- (4) Group and unallocated items includes functions, other unallocated operations, including Potash, Nickel West, legacy assets, and consolidation adjustments. Revenue not attributable to/uni00A0reportable segments comprises the sale of freight and fuel to third parties. Exploration and technology activities are recognised within relevant segments.",

Depreciation, amortisation and impairments includes non-exceptional impairments of US$264 million (FY2020: US$85 million).\n- (2) Collectively, we refer to the change in operating cash costs and change in exploration and business development as Change in controllable cash costs. Operating cash costs by de/f.shortinition do not include non-cash costs. The change in operating cash costs also excludes the impact of exchange rates and in/f.shortlation, changes in fuel and energy costs, changes in exploration and business development costs and one-o/ff items. These items are excluded so as to provide a consistent measurement of changes in costs across all segments, based on the factors that are within the control and responsibility of the segment. Change in controllable cash costs and change in operating cash costs are not measures that are recognised by IFRS. They may di/ffer from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 4.6  Resources and Reserves\n\nResources are the estimated quantities of material that can potentially be commercially recovered from BHP's properties. Reserves are a subset of resources that can be demonstrated to be able to be economically and legally extracted. In order to estimate reserves, assumptions are required about a range of technical and economic factors, including quantities, qualities, production techniques, recovery e/ff.shorticiency, production and transport costs, commodity supply and demand, commodity prices and exchange rates.\n\nEstimating the quantity and/or quality of reserves requires the size, shape and depth of ore bodies or oil and gas reservoirs to be determined by analysing geological data, such as drilling samples and geophysical survey interpretations. Economic assumptions used to estimate reserves change from period to period as additional technical and operational data is generated.\n\n## 4.6.1  Petroleum reserves\n\nEstimates of oil and gas reserves involve some degree of uncertainty, are inherently imprecise, require the application of judgement and are subject to future revision. Accordingly, /f.shortinancial and accounting measures (such as the standardised measure of discounted cash /f.shortlows, depreciation, depletion and amortisation charges, the assessment of impairments and the assessment of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets) that are based on reserve estimates are also subject to change.\n\n## How we estimate and report reserves\n\nPetroleum's reserves are estimated as of 30 June each year. Reported reserves include both Conventional Petroleum reserves and Onshore US reserves for FY2018 and are included in the opening balances in the accompanying tables. Footnotes have been included with the tables to identify the contribution of the Discontinued operations (Onshore US) for this period. The sale of Petroleum's interests in Onshore US reserves was completed in FY2019. Remaining reserves at the end of FY2019, FY2020 and FY2021 re/f.shortlect the Continuing operations only.\n\nOur proved reserves are estimated and reported on a net interest basis according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations and have been determined in accordance with SEC Rule 4/hyphen.uc10(a) of Regulation S/hyphen.ucX.\n\n## Proved oil and gas reserves\n\nProved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) that, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, operating contracts and government regulations. Unless evidence indicates that renewal of existing operating contracts is reasonably certain, estimates of economically producible reserves re/f.shortlect only the period before the contracts expire. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence within a reasonable time. As speci/f.shortied in SEC Rule 4/hyphen.uc10(a) of Regulation S/hyphen.ucX, oil and gas prices are taken as the unweighted average of the corresponding /f.shortirst day of the month prices for the 12 months prior to the ending date of the period covered.\n\nProved reserves were estimated by reference to available well and reservoir information, including but not limited to well logs, well test data, core data, production and pressure data, geologic data, seismic data and in some cases, to similar data from analogous, producing reservoirs. A wide range of engineering and geoscience methods, including performance analysis, numerical simulation, well analogues and geologic studies were used to estimate high con/f.shortidence proved developed and undeveloped reserves in accordance with SEC regulations.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProved reserve estimates were attributed to future development projects only where there is a signi/f.shorticant commitment to project funding and execution and for which applicable government and regulatory approvals have been secured or are reasonably certain to be secured. Furthermore, estimates of proved reserves include only volumes for which access to market is assured with reasonable certainty. All proved reserve estimates are subject to revision (either upward or downward) based on new information, such as from development drilling and production activities or from changes in economic factors, including product prices, contract terms or development plans.\n\n## Developed oil and gas reserves\n\nProved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through:\n\n- -  existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods\n- -  installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserve estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well\n\nPerformance-derived reserve assessments for producing wells were primarily based on the following manner:\n\n- -  for our conventional operations, reserves were estimated using rate and pressure decline methods, including material balance, supplemented by reservoir simulation models where appropriate\n- -  for our Discontinued operations (Onshore US) reported for FY2018, reserves were estimated using rate-transient analysis and decline curve analysis methods\n- -  for wells that lacked su/ff.shorticient production history, reserves were estimated using performance-based type curves and o/ffset location analogues with similar geologic and reservoir characteristics\n\n## Proved undeveloped reserves\n\nProved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage where commitment has been made to commence development within /f.shortive years from /f.shortirst reporting or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nA combination of geologic and engineering data and where appropriate, statistical analysis was used to support the assignment of proved undeveloped reserves when assessing planned drilling locations. Performance data along with log and core data was used to delineate consistent, continuous reservoir characteristics in core areas of the development. Proved undeveloped locations were included in core areas between known data and adjacent to productive wells using performance-based type curves and o/ffset location analogues with similar geologic and reservoir characteristics. Locations where a high degree of certainty could not be demonstrated using the above technologies and techniques were not categorised as proved.\n\n## Methodology used to estimate reserves\n\nReserves have been estimated with deterministic methodology, with the exception of the North West Shelf gas operation in Australia, where probabilistic methodology has been used to estimate and aggregate reserves for the reservoirs dedicated to the gas project only. The probabilistic-based portion of these reserves totals 6 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe) in FY2021, 12 MMboe in FY2020 and 16 MMboe in FY2019. These amounts represent approximately 1 per cent of our total reported proved reserves in FY2021, and approximately 2 per cent in each of FY2020 and FY2019. Total boe conversion is based on the following: 6,000 standard cubic feet (scf) of natural gas equals 1 boe. Aggregation of proved reserves beyond the /f.shortield/project level has been performed by arithmetic summation. Due to portfolio e/ffects, aggregates of proved reserves may be conservative. The custody transfer point(s) or point(s) of sale applicable for each /f.shortield or project are the reference point for reserves. The reserves replacement ratio is the change in reserves during the year excluding production, divided by the production during the year and stated as a percentage.",

It is independent of the various operation teams directly responsible for development and production activities. The PRG is sta/ffed by individuals averaging more than 30 years' experience in the oil and gas industry. The manager of the PRG, Abhijit Gadgil, is a full-time employee of BHP and is responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserve estimates and compiling the information for inclusion in this Annual Report. He has an advanced degree in engineering and more than 40 years of diversi/f.shortied industry experience in reservoir engineering, reserves assessment, /f.shortield development and technical management. He is a 40-year member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE). He has also served on the Society of Petroleum Engineers Oil and Gas Reserves Committee. Mr/uni00A0Gadgil has the quali/f.shortications and experience required to act as a quali/f.shortied petroleum reserves evaluator under the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) Listing Rules. The estimates of petroleum reserves are based on and fairly represent information and supporting documentation prepared under the supervision of Mr Gadgil. He has reviewed and agrees with the information included in section 4.6.1 and has given his prior written consent for its publication. No part of the individual compensation for members of the PRG is dependent on reported reserves.\n\nReserve assessments for all Petroleum operations were conducted by technical sta/ff within the operating organisation. These individuals meet the professional quali/f.shortications outlined by the SPE, are trained in the fundamentals of SEC reserves reporting and the reserves processes and are endorsed by the PRG. Each reserve assessment is reviewed annually by the PRG to ensure technical quality, adherence to internally published Petroleum guidelines and compliance with SEC reporting requirements. Once endorsed by the PRG, all reserves receive /f.shortinal endorsement by senior management and the Risk and Audit Committee prior to public reporting. Our Internal Audit and Advisory function provides secondary assurance of the oil and gas reserve reporting processes through the testing of the e/ffectiveness of key controls that have been implemented as required by the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. For more information on our risk management governance, refer to section 2.1.10.\n\n## FY2021 proved reserves\n\nProduction for FY2021 totalled 103 MMboe in sales with an additional 5 MMboe in non-sales production, which was used primarily for fuel consumed in operations. Total production of 108 Mmboe was approximately 6 MMboe lower than in FY2020. The decrease was primarily due to natural declines in mature /f.shortields.\n\nNet additions to reserves totalled 25 MMboe, driven primarily by the acquisition of additional working interest in the Shenzi /f.shortield and partially o/ffset by a negative performance revision in the Atlantis /f.shortield in the US Gulf of Mexico. The net additions replaced 23 per cent of production. As of 30 June 2021, proved reserves totalled 665 MMboe.\n\nReserves have been calculated using the economic interest method and represent net revenue interest volumes after deduction of applicable royalties owned by others. Reserves of 61 MMboe were in production and risk-sharing arrangements where BHP has a revenue interest in production without transfer of ownership of the products. At 30 June 2021, approximately 9 per cent of the proved reserves were attributable to/uni00A0these arrangements.\n\n## Extensions and discoveries\n\nIn the Atlantis /f.shortield in the US Gulf of Mexico, Phase 3 development drilling in the South West region of the /f.shortield added approximately 1 MMboe by extending the previously recognised proved reservoir limit.\n\n## Revisions\n\nIn Australia, revisions increased proved reserves by 4 MMboe, primarily due to strong performance in the Macedon /f.shortield. Small increases in the Bass Strait and Pyrenees /f.shortields were o/ffset by negative performance revisions in the North West Shelf /f.shortields.\n\nIn the US Gulf of Mexico, revisions decreased reserves by 11 MMboe overall, primarily driven by reductions related to lower than expected well performance in the Atlantis and Mad Dog /f.shortields of 19 MMboe and 4 MMboe respectively. Approval of the Shenzi Subsea Multi Phase Pump Project added 6 MMboe, while strong performance in the Eastern area of the Shenzi /f.shortield increased reserves by a further 5 MMboe\n\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, continued strong performance in the Angostura /f.short ield added 6 MMboe to proved reserves. This addition was partially o/ffset by a price-related reduction of approximately 1 MMboe.\n\n## Improved recovery revisions\n\nThere were no improved recovery revisions during the year.\n\n## Purchases and sales\n\nIn November 2020, BHP acquired Hess Corporation's 28 per cent interest in the Shenzi /f.shortield located in the Gulf of Mexico. The acquisition resulted in the addition of approximately 27 MMboe to proved reserves. BHP also divested its 35 per cent interest in the Neptune /f.shortield in May 2021 which reduced reserves by approximately 1 MMboe. Overall, net additions from Purchases and Sales were 26 MMboe.\n\n## FY2020 proved reserves\n\nProduction for FY2020 totalled 109 MMboe in sales with an additional 5 MMboe in non-sales production, which was used primarily for fuel consumed in operations. Total production was approximately 13 MMboe lower than conventional production in FY2019. The decrease was due to a number of factors, including natural declines in mature /f.shortields, weather events that necessitated precautionary shut ins and lower demand as a consequence of the COVID/hyphen.uc19 pandemic, (refer to section 4.5.2 for more information). Discoveries, extensions and revisions to reserves added a total of 21 MMboe, which replaced 19 per cent of production. As of 30 June 2020, proved reserves totalled 748 MMboe.\n\nReserves have been calculated using the economic interest method and represent net interest volumes after deduction of applicable royalty. Reserves of 69 MMboe are in two production and risk-sharing arrangements where BHP has a revenue interest in production without transfer of ownership of the products. At 30 June 2020, approximately 9 per cent of the proved reserves were attributable to such arrangements.\n\n## Extensions and discoveries\n\nBoard approval of the North West Shelf Greater Western Flank Phase 3 project in Australia added 12 MMboe for development of the Goodwyn South and Lambert Deep /f.shortields. Board approval of the Ruby development project in Trinidad and Tobago during the September 2019 quarter also added 19 MMboe to proved reserves. The Ruby project is comprised of the Ruby oil /f.shortield and the Delaware gas /f.shortield.\n\n## Revisions\n\nIn Australia, reserves decreased by 35 MMboe overall due to downward revisions. This reduction was primarily in the Bass Strait due to poor reservoir performance in the Turrum /f.shortield and lower overall condensate and natural gas liquids (NGL) recovery from the Bass Strait gas /f.shortields totalling 40 MMboe. Included in this reduction was a decrease of 4 MMboe due to lower product prices. Improved reservoir performance in the Pyrenees operated /f.shortield added 5 MMboe partially o/ffsetting the Bass Strait reduction. In the North West Shelf /f.shortields, reserves increased 4 MMboe for better performance and other revisions, however, this increase was o/ffset by product price-related reductions of 4 MMboe. In the US Gulf of Mexico, strong reservoir performance and technical studies in the Atlantis, Shenzi and Mad Dog /f.shortields added a total of 25 MMboe to proved reserves.\n\nIn the Angostura /f.shortield in Trinidad and Tobago and the ROD integrated development in Algeria, increases of 1 MMboe were o/ffset by product price-related reductions of approximately 1 MMboe.\n\nDuring FY2020, net revisions reduced reserves by a total of 10 MMboe overall.",

        "page_content": "## Improved recovery revisions\n\nThere were no improved recovery revisions during the year.\n\n## Purchases and sales\n\nThere were no purchases or sales during the year.\n\n## FY2019 proved reserves\n\nProduction for FY2019 totalled 147 MMboe in sales, which was comprised of 121 MMboe for our conventional /f.shortields and 26 MMboe that was produced from our US Onshore /f.shortields prior to the closure of the divestment agreements. In comparison, our conventional /f.shortields produced approximately 1 MMboe more than in FY2018. This increase was due to a number of factors, including start-up of the Greater Western Flank Phase B project in the North West Shelf in Australia and higher uptime in several /f.shortields, which more than o/ffset natural production declines in more mature /f.shortields (refer to section 4.5.2 for more information). There was also an additional 5 MMboe in non-sales production, primarily for fuel consumed in our Petroleum operations. The combined sales and nonsales production totalled 152 MMboe for FY2019. For our conventional /f.short ields, additions and revisions to reserves added 57 MMboe, which replaced 45 per cent of the production in FY2019. As of 30 June 2019, our/uni00A0proved/uni00A0reserves totalled 841 MMboe.\n\nReserves have been calculated using the economic interest method and represent net interest volumes after deduction of applicable royalty. Reserves of 64 MMboe are in two production and risk-sharing arrangements where BHP has a revenue interest in production without transfer of ownership of the products. At 30 June 2019, approximately 8 per cent of the proved reserves were attributable to such arrangements.\n\n## Extensions and discoveries\n\nExtensions added a total of approximately 2 MMboe to proved reserves, of which 1 MMboe was added for the Atlantis /f.shortield in the US Gulf of Mexico with the balance being added in the Snapper /f.shortield in the Bass Strait in Australia.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Improved recovery revisions\n\nThere were no improved recovery revisions during the year.\n\n## Revisions\n\nRevisions for FY2019 added a total of 56 MMboe. The largest addition was in the Atlantis /f.shortield where 28 MMboe was added for performance and approval of Phase 3 in/f.shortill drilling. Other revisions, primarily in the Mad Dog /f.shortield, brought the total revisions for our US Gulf of Mexico assets to 29 MMboe. Additions through revisions in Australia totalled 22 MMboe, with the North West Shelf project adding 11 MMboe. The Goodwyn /f.shortield was the largest component of this change adding 10 MMboe for strong performance. In the Bass Strait, 11 MMboe was added with the largest changes occurring in the Snapper and Turrum /f.shortields, which added 5 MMboe and 2 MMboe, respectively. In Other (1) geographic areas, 4 MMboe was added for better performance in the O/ffshore Angostura project in Trinidad and Tobago, while 1 MMboe was added for improved performance in the ROD integrated development in Algeria.\n\n## Purchases and sales\n\nThe sale of Petroleum's interests in the US Onshore Permian, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Fayetteville /f.shortields accounted for reported sales of approximately 464 MMboe. There were no purchases during FY2019.\n\nThese results are summarised in the following tables, which detail estimated oil, condensate, NGL and natural gas reserves at 30 June 2021, 30 June 2020 and 30 June 2019, with a reconciliation of the changes in each year.",

        "page_content": "## 4.6  Resources and Reserves continued\n\n## FY2021 proved undeveloped reserves\n\nAt 30 June 2021, Petroleum had 200 MMboe of proved undeveloped reserves, which corresponds to 30 per cent of the reported proved reserves of 665 MMboe. This represents a decrease of 38 MMboe from the 238 MMboe at 30 June 2020.\n\nDuring FY2021, a total of 44 MMboe proved undeveloped reserves were converted to proved developed reserves through development activities. This was driven by the following four projects: the Barracouta West development in the Bass Strait in Australia (14 MMboe), a gas delivery pressure and compressor re-staging study in the Macedon /f.short ield in O/ffshore Western Australia (14 MMboe) and the Atlantis Phase 3 development in the US Gulf of Mexico (14 MMboe). Start-up of the Ruby development project in O/ffshore Trinidad and Tobago also converted 3 MMboe to proved developed with /f.shortirst oil production. Increases to proved undeveloped reserves included approval of the Shenzi Subsurface Multi-Phase Pump project which added 6 MMboe. The e/ffect of commodity prices relative to FY2020 resulted in the addition of 5 MMboe to proved undeveloped reserves while the acquisition of additional interest in the Shenzi /f.shortield in the US Gulf of Mexico increased proved undeveloped reserves by 3 MMboe. Technical studies, revisions to expected performance and other changes/uni00A0reduced proved undeveloped reserves by 2 Mmboe.\n\nOver the past three years, the conversion of proved undeveloped reserves to developed status has totalled 93 MMboe, averaging 31 MMboe per year. At 30 June 2021, a total of 114 MMboe proved undeveloped reserves have been reported for /f.shortive or more years. Approximately 101 MMboe of this amount is associated with the Mad Dog Phase 2 development which is anticipated to produce /f.shortirst oil in CY2022. The remaining 13 MMboe is in our currently producing /f.shortields and will be developed and brought on stream in a phased manner to best optimise the use of production facilities and to meet sales commitments.\n\nDuring FY2021, Petroleum spent US$1.1 billion on development activities worldwide. Of this amount:\n\n- -  US$0.9 billion was spent progressing the conversion of proved undeveloped reserves for projects where developed status was achieved in FY2021 or will be achieved when development is completed/uni00A0in the future\n- -  US$0.2 billion represented other development expenditures, including/uni00A0compliance and infrastructure improvement\n\n## FY2020 proved undeveloped reserves\n\nAt 30 June 2020, Petroleum had 238 MMboe of proved undeveloped reserves, which corresponds to 32 per cent of the reported proved reserves of 748 MMboe. This represents an increase of 19 MMboe from the 219 MMboe at 30 June 2019.\n\nThe most signi/f.shorticant drivers of this increase were the additions of 19 MMboe for the Ruby development project in O/ffshore Trinidad and Tobago and 12 MMboe for the Greater Western Flank Phase 3 development project in Australia as extensions and discoveries.\n\nReclassi/f.shortications from proved undeveloped to proved developed occurred in Australia in the Macedon /f.shortield (7 MMboe), the Cobia /f.shortield in Bass Strait (2 MMboe) and in the O/ffshore US Gulf of Mexico in the Mad Dog Spar A /f.shortield (3 MMboe). In the Shenzi /f.shortield, the need to perform\n\na producer redrill resulted in the reclassi/f.shortication of 4 MMboe proved developed into proved undeveloped.\n\nIn Australia, in the Bass Strait, 18 MMboe was moved into proved undeveloped for the Turrum /f.shortield as a result of the reservoir performance reassessment, while in the Kipper /f.shortield, a reduction of the gas delivery pressure requirements enabled more gas to be delivered prior to the installation of compression. This resulted in the movement of 16 MMboe from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves. Bass Strait proved undeveloped fuel was also increased by 3 MMboe as a result of a fuel utilisation study. Performance revisions in the Mad Dog Spar A and the Shenzi /f.shortields in the US Gulf of Mexico reduced proved undeveloped by 6 MMboe.\n\nLower commodity prices resulted in a 4 MMboe reduction to proved undeveloped reserves.\n\nOver the past three years, the conversion of proved undeveloped reserves to developed status has totalled 98 MMboe, averaging 33 MMboe per year. At 30 June 2020, a total of 30 MMboe proved undeveloped reserves have been reported for /f.shortive or more years. These reserves are in our currently producing /f.shortields and will be developed and brought on stream in a phased manner to best optimise the use of production facilities and to meet sales commitments. During FY2020, Petroleum spent US$1.0 billion on development activities worldwide. Of this amount:\n\n- -  US$0.8 billion was spent progressing the conversion of proved undeveloped reserves for conventional projects where developed status was achieved in FY2020 or will be achieved when development is completed in the future\n- -  US$0.2 billion represented other development expenditures, including compliance and infrastructure improvements\n\n## FY2019 proved undeveloped reserves\n\nAt 30 June 2019, Petroleum had 219 MMboe of proved undeveloped reserves, which corresponds to 26 per cent of the reported proved reserves of 841 MMboe. This represents a reduction in proved undeveloped reserves of 202 MMboe from the 421 MMboe at 30 June 2018. The largest element of this reduction was 185 MMboe, which occurred with the divestment of unconventional Onshore US assets. A reclassi/f.shortication from proved undeveloped to proved developed status of approximately 40 MMboe that occurred in the North West Shelf, Australia, with the completion of development and the start of production from the Greater Western Flank Phase B project, also contributed to the reduction. An additional 1 MMboe was also reclassi/f.shortied from proved undeveloped to proved developed status with the completion of an in/f.shortill well in the ROD integrated development in Algeria. Partially o/ffsetting these reductions were revisions for technical studies of 10 MMboe for the Kipper /f.shortield in the Bass Strait, Australia. Additions following the approval of the Atlantis Phase 3 project in the O/ffshore US Gulf of Mexico added 8 MMboe for development plan changes, 7 MMboe for performance and 1 MMboe as an extension. A performance reduction of 2 MMboe in the Mad Dog /f.shortield partially o/ffset/uni00A0the Atlantis performance addition.\n\nThe changes in proved undeveloped reserves in FY2021, FY2020 and FY2019 are summarised by change category in the table below. Additional information detailing the e/ffect of price, performance, changes/uni00A0in capital development plans and technical studies are also/uni00A0provided for revisions.\n\n|                                                              | Year Ended 30 June   | Year Ended 30 June   | Year Ended 30 June   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Proved Undeveloped Reserves (PUD) Reconciliation (MMboe) (a) | 2021                 | 2020                 | 2019                 |\n| PUD Opening Balance                                          | 238                  | 219                  | 421                  |\n| Revisions of Previous Estimates                              | (41)                 | (12)                 | (18)                 |\n| Reclassi/f.shortications to developed                        | (44)                 | (8)                  | (42)                 |\n| Performance, Technical Studies and Other                     | (2)                  | (1)                  | 16                   |\n| Development Plan Changes                                     | -                    | (0)                  | 8                    |\n| Price                                                        | 5                    | (4)                  | -                    |\n| Extensions/Discoveries                                       | -                    | 31                   | 1                    |\n| Acquisitions/Sales                                           | 3                    | -                    | (185)                |\n| Total Change                                                 | (38)                 | 19                   | (202)                |\n| PUD Closing Balance                                          | 200                  | 238                  | 219                  |",

        "page_content": "## 4.6.2  Mineral Resources and Ore/uni00A0Reserves\n\nThe statement of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves presented in this/uni00A0Annual Report has been produced in accordance with the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) Listing Rules Chapter 5, December 2019 and the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, December 2012 (JORC Code).\n\nPredicted sales prices, based on supply and demand forecast and current and long-term historical average price trends, have been used. The Ore Reserves tabulated are held within existing, permitted mining tenements. Mineral leases are of su/ff.shorticient duration (or convey a legal right to renew for su/ff.shorticient duration) to enable all reserves on the leased properties to be mined in accordance with current production schedules. Ore Reserves may include areas where some additional approvals remain outstanding, however it is anticipated such approvals will be obtained within the time frame required by the current life-of-mine schedule.\n\n## Declaration tables\n\n- -  All Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves presented are reported in 100 per cent terms (unless otherwise stated) and represent estimates at 30 June 2021.\n- -  Tonnes are reported as dry metric tonnes (unless otherwise stated). All tonnes and grade/quality information have been rounded, so small di/fferences may be present in the totals.\n- -  The Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources are inclusive of those Mineral Resources modi/f.shortied to produce the Ore Reserves.\n\n## Competent Persons\n\nThis statement is based on and fairly represents information and supporting documentation compiled by Competent Persons (as de/f.shortined in the JORC Code). All Competent Persons have, at the time of reporting, su/ff.shorticient experience relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity they are undertaking to qualify as/uni00A0a/uni00A0Competent Person.\n\nEach Competent Person listed is an employee of BHP or a company in which BHP has a controlling interest (unless otherwise stated) and declares they have no issues that could be perceived by investors as a material con/f.shortlict of interest in preparing the reported information. All Competent Persons are a Member or Fellow of the AusIMM or AIG or a Recognised Professional Organisation. Each Competent Person consents to the inclusion in this Annual Report of the matters based on his or her information in the form and/uni00A0context in which it appears.\n\n## Other reporting jurisdictions\n\nThe information contained in this document may di/ffer from that reported to/uni00A0the SEC. Reserve reporting requirements for SEC /f.shortilings in the United States are speci/f.shortied in Industry Guide 7, with economic assumptions based on current economic conditions that may di/ffer to the JORC Code's reasonable investment assumptions. Accordingly, a SEC pricing assumptions test is performed with reserve estimates derived under the JORC Code compared to those derived assuming 'current economic conditions'. Reserves disclosed in the United States will di/ffer if the SEC pricing assumption test indicates reserves lower than those reported under/uni00A0the JORC Code in Australia and the United Kingdom and/or Inferred/uni00A0Mineral Resources are included in the mine plan.\n\n## Assurance and veri/f.shortication\n\nAssurance programs are undertaken to verify the estimates and estimation processes for Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. The Resource Centre of Excellence manages assurance and functional leadership for the reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves supported by the following controls:\n\n- -  standard BHP procedures for public reporting aligned with current regulatory requirements\n- -  independent audits or reviews of new and materially changed estimates\n- -  annual reconciliation performance metrics to validate reserves estimates for operating mines\n- -  internal technical assessments of resource and reserve estimates conducted on a frequency that is informed by asset materiality and annual risk reviews\n\n2\n\n3\n\n## Competent Persons\n\n## Copper\n\nMineral Resources\n\nEscondida, Pampa Escondida, Pinta Verde and Chimborazo: R Maureira (MAusIMM) employed by Minera Escondida Limitada Cerro Colorado: H Matias (MAusIMM) Spence: R Ferrer (MAusIMM) Olympic Dam: K Ehrig (FAusIMM), D Clarke (MAusIMM) Antamina: L Canchis (FAusIMM) employed by Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera Antamina/uni00A0S.A.\n\n## Ore Reserves\n\nEscondida: J Quiroz (MAusIMM) employed by Minera Escondida Limitada Cerro Colorado: H Martinez (MAusIMM)\n\nSpence: C Araya (MAusIMM)\n\nOlympic Dam: D Tucker (MAusIMM)\n\nAntamina: F Angeles (PEGBC) employed by Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera Antamina/uni00A0S.A.\n\n## Iron ore\n\nMineral Resources\n\nWAIO: F Muller (MAusIMM)\n\nSamarco: L Bon/f.shortioli (MAusIMM) employed by Samarco Minera\u00e7\u00e3o S.A.\n\n## Ore Reserves\n\nWAIO: P K Chhajer (MAusIMM), A Greaves (MAusIMM), A McLean (MAusIMM), C Burke (MAusIMM)\n\n## Coal\n\n## Coal Resources\n\nGoonyella Riverside, Broadmeadow, Red Hill and Bee Creek: R Macpherson (MAIG)\n\nPeak Downs, Norwich Park, Nebo West and Wards Well: C Williams (MAusIMM)\n\nCaval Ridge, Blackwater and Togara South: M Godfrey (MAIG) Saraji, South Walker Creek and Saraji East: R Saha (MAusIMM)\n\nDaunia: B Wesley (MAusIMM)\n\nPoitrel: S Cutler (MAusIMM)\n\nMt Arthur Coal: J James (MAusIMM)\n\nCerrej\u00f3n: G Hernandez (MGSSA) employed by Carbones del Cerrej\u00f3n LLC, D/uni00A0Lawrence (MAusIMM) employed by DJL Geological Consulting Limited\n\n## Coal Reserves\n\nGoonyella Riverside: V Grajdan (MAusIMM) Broadmeadow: C McGahan (MAusIMM) Peak Downs: P Gupta (MAusIMM) Caval Ridge : H Mirabediny (MAusIMM) Saraji and Norwich Park: N Mohtaj (MAusIMM) Blackwater: A Hardy (MAusIMM) Daunia: I Ferdowsi (MAusIMM) Poitrel: K Nott (MAusIMM) South Walker Creek: G Bustos (MAusIMM) Mt Arthur Coal: D Perkins (MAusIMM) Cerrej\u00f3n: S Chaudari (MAusIMM) employed by Carbones del Cerrej\u00f3n LLC, D/uni00A0Lawrence (MAusIMM) employed by DJL Geological\n\nConsulting Limited\n\n## Potash\n\nMineral Resources\n\nJansen: B N\u00e9meth (MAusIMM), O Turkekul (APEGS)\n\n## Nickel\n\nMineral Resources\n\nLeinster and Honeymoon Well: R Finch (MAusIMM), M Hope (MAusIMM) Mt Keith, Cli/ffs, Yakabindie, Venus and Jericho: R Finch (MAusIMM) West Jordan: M Hope (MAusIMM)\n\n## Ore Reserves\n\nLeinster, Cli/ffs and Venus: C Barclay (MAusIMM)\n\nMt Keith and Yakabindie: C Barclay (MAusIMM), D Brosztl (MAusIMM)\n\n## Annual Report compilation\n\nS Broun (MAusIMM)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Oxide and Sulphide Leach ore types contribute 13 years and 27 years respectively to the reported reserve life.\n- (11)  Cerro Colorado - The decrease in Ore Reserves was mainly due to depletion and a reduction in the nominated production rate with reserve life constrained by mining permit expiry in 2023.\n- (12)  Spence - The decrease in Oxide and Transitional Sulphide ore types was mainly due to depletion. The increase in Supergene Sulphide and Hypogene Sulphide ore types was mainly due to an update in the resource estimate supported by additional drilling and updated mine design, resulting with an increase in reserve life.\n- (13)  Olympic Dam - The decrease in UG Sulphide ore type and reduction in reserve life was due to updated mine stope designs and depletion partially o/ffset by an updated resource estimate supported by additional drilling.\n- (14)  Antamina - The decrease in Ore Reserves and reduction in reserve life was mainly due to depletion.",

Wet tonnes are reported for WAIO deposits and Samarco, including moisture contents for WAIO: BKM - Brockman 3%, BKM Bene - Brockman Bene/f.shorticiation 3%, CID - Channel Iron Deposits 8%, DID - Detrital Iron Deposits 4%, MM - Marra Mamba 4%, NIM - Nimingarra 3.5% and Samarco: ROM - 6.5%.\n- (2) A single cut-o/ff grade was applied in WAIO per deposit ranging from 50/hyphen.uc58%Fe with an additional threshold of <6%Al 2 0 3 applied to the DID ore type. For Samarco the cut-o/ff grade was 22%Fe.\n- (3) WAIO - Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves are reported on a Pilbara basis by ore type to align with our production of blended lump products which comprises BKM, BKM Bene and MM ore types and blended /f.shortines products including CID. This also re/f.shortlects our single logistics chain and associated management system.\n- (4) WAIO - BHP interest is reported as Pilbara Ore Reserves tonnes weighted average across all joint ventures which can vary from year to year. BHP ownership varies between 85%/uni00A0and 100%.\n- (5) WAIO - First time reporting of DID ore type.\n- (6) WAIO - The increase in Mineral Resources was due to updated resource estimates supported by additional drilling partially o/ffset by depletion.\n- (7) WAIO - Mineral Resources are restricted to areas which have been identi/f.shortied for inclusion based on a risk assessment, including heritage sites.\n- (8) Samarco - The decrease in Mineral Resources was due to changes in geotechnical parameters and increased stand-o/ff distances from natural drainage. Operations have recommenced and/uni00A0an Ore Reserves estimate is in progress.\n- (9) Approximate drill hole spacings used to classify the reserves were:\n\n| Deposit   | Proved Reserves   | Probable Reserves   |\n|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| WAIO      | 50m \u00d7 50m         | 150m \u00d7 50m          |\n\n- (10)  WAIO - Recovery was 100%, except for BKM Bene where Whaleback bene/f.shorticiation plant recovery was 88% (tonnage basis).\n- (11)  WAIO - Iron ore is marketed for WAIO as Lump (direct blast furnace feed) and Fines (sinter plant feed).\n- (12)  WAIO - Cut-o/ff grades used to estimate Ore Reserves range from 50/endash.uc62%Fe for all material types. Ore delivered to process facility.\n- (13)  WAIO - Ore Reserves are all located on State Agreement mining leases that guarantee the right to mine. Across WAIO, State Government approvals (including environmental and heritage clearances) are required before commencing mining operations in a particular area. Included in the Ore Reserves are select areas where one or more approvals remain outstanding, but where, based on the technical investigations carried out as part of the mine planning process and company knowledge and experience of the approvals process, it is expected that such approvals will be obtained as part of the normal course of business and within the time frame required by the current mine schedule.\n- (14)  WAIO - The decrease in CID ore type was due to depletion.",

This included maintenance (1) expenditure of US$2.3 billion and/uni00A0exploration expenditure of US$514 million.\n\nCapital and exploration expenditure of approximately US$6.7 billion for minerals and US$2.3 billion for petroleum is expected in FY2022. In total, this is US$0.5 billion higher than previous guidance predominantly due to unfavourable impacts of a stronger Australian dollar. Guidance is subject to exchange rate movements.\n\nThis guidance includes a US$800 million exploration program in FY2022, with approximately US$260 million for our minerals exploration program and/uni00A0approximately US$540 million for our petroleum exploration and appraisal program.\n\nIn August 2021, the BHP Board approved two major projects:\n\n- -  an investment of US$5.7 billion (C$7.5 billion) for the Jansen Stage 1 Potash Project in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada; and\n- -  an investment of US$544 million for the Shenzi North development in the US Gulf of Mexico, following the successful acquisition of an additional 28/uni00A0per cent working interest in Shenzi in November 2020. The capital expenditure approved represents a 100 per cent share interest. BHP is operator and holds a 72 per cent share in Shenzi North. Repsol holds the remaining 28 per cent working interest and is expected to make a Final Investment Decision later this calendar year\n\nAt the end of the 2021 /f.shortinancial year, BHP had two major projects under development, which were Mad Dog Phase 2 in petroleum and Jansen mine shafts in potash. Both of these projects are tracking to plan.\n\n## Projects in execution at the end of FY2021\n\n| Commodity                                                                       | Project and ownership                                                           | Project scope/capacity (2)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Date of initial  production Target   | Capital expenditure (US$M) (1) Budget   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Projects achieved /f.shortirst production during the 2021 /f.shortinancial year | Projects achieved /f.shortirst production during the 2021 /f.shortinancial year | Projects achieved /f.shortirst production during the 2021 /f.shortinancial year                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                      |                                         |\n| Petroleum                                                                       | Atlantis Phase 3 (US Gulf of Mexico)  44% (non-operator)                        | New subsea production system that will tie back  to the existing Atlantis facility, with capacity  to produce up to 38,000 gross barrels of oil  equivalent per day.

These metrics are commonly used by many of our stakeholders and most are industry standard.\n\nManagement also uses the SPMs to evaluate our sustainability performance against the positive and negative impacts of our operational activities.\n\nWe align our SPMs with credible international standards, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) sustainability reporting standards, to ensure our performance is relevant and assessed against a range of reporting.\n\nThe SPMs listed in the tables below relate to each SPM for the year ended 30 June 2021. We have obtained external limited assurance over our disclosures in this section as well as in section 1.12 People and culture and 1.13 Sustainability. A copy of the EY assurance statement is available in section 1.13.16.\n\nA de/f.shortinition and explanation that outlines why we believe the SPMs are useful to the Board, management, investors and other stakeholders, and the methodology behind our most material SPMs is provided in our methodology tables disclosed in our online ESG Standards and Databook.\n\n## 4.8.1  People - performance data

Analysis was undertaken utilising ArcGIS by identifying all tenure that overlaps with or occurs within 500 metres of a DPA or HBVA. For the purposes of this table, operated assets were de/f.shortined as sites for which current, future or historic activities have been undertaken and where revenue has been received by BHP for these activities. Exploration activities are not included unless future operations have/uni00A0been announced, i.e. permits have been received from mining operations.

Analysis was undertaken utilising ArcGIS by identifying all species that occur within the area of in/f.shortluence of BHP's operated assets, or areas where disturbance activities associated with exploration have been undertaken in the previous 12 months. Lists of species protected under national legislation were identi/f.shortied from relevant national databases where available. Where national databases were not available, species lists were compiled from in-house impact assessment reports and/or management plans. Where information or in-house expertise was available, a screening assessment was undertaken to remove any species that occur in biomes or habitats not impacted by the operated asset, or where the operation occurs outside of the known distribution for the species, or where surveys/monitoring has determined the species or its habitat does not occur. Where national classi/f.shortications di/ffer to that utilised by the IUCN, species have been attributed to the category that most closely aligns to their national ranking. In Canada, species may occur under more than one category. In these instances, the higher ranking has been reported. This information is correct as of 30 June 2021 and is subject to change as more information is obtained about species ranges, habitats and impacts from operated assets.\n\nIn FY2021, 0.074 km 2 of disturbance was associated with exploration activities in Chile, Ecuador, Peru and USA. As per BHP's Our Requirements for Environment and Climate Change standard baseline biodiversity studies were undertaken prior to exploration activities to identify key species and habitats. The mitigation hierarchy was implemented to avoid, minimise and rehabilitate impacts from the activities. Due to the small amount of disturbance over/uni00A0a/uni00A0short time period, species potentially impacted by these activities are not included.\n\n| Location

This has resulted in the restatement of operational consumption from renewable energy sources /f.shortigures. Previously reported numbers for FY2020 and FY2019 for this data were 0.01 TWh for both years.\n- (4) For this purpose, copper equivalent production has been calculated based on FY2021 average realised product prices for FY2021 production, FY2020 average realised product prices for FY2020 production and FY2019 average realised product prices for FY2019 production. Production /f.shortigures used are consistent with energy and GHG emissions reporting boundaries (i.e. BHP operational control) and are taken on 100 per cent basis.\n- (5) BHP currently uses Global Warming Potentials (GWP) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report 5 (AR5) based on a 100-year timeframe for Minerals Australia and Petroleum. Minerals Americas currently use IPCC Assessment Report 4 (AR4) and will be transitioning to AR5 GWP in FY2022.\n- (6) Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions have been calculated based on an operational control approach (unless otherwise stated) in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. For more information, see BHP Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG Emissions Calculation Methodology, available at bhp.com/climate. Data has been rounded to the nearest 10 ktCO2-e or 0.1 MtCO2-e to be consistent with asset/regional GHG emissions information in this Annual Report. In some instances, the sum of totals for sources, commodities and assets may di/ffer due to rounding.\n- (7) Scope 1 refers to direct GHG emissions from operated assets.\n- (8) Scope 2 refers to indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heat or cooling that is consumed by operated assets. Our Scope 2 GHG emissions have been calculated using the market-based method using supplier speci/f.shortic emission factors, in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance unless otherwise speci/f.shortied. A residual mix emission factor is currently unavailable to account for grid electricity emissions remaining after removal of quantities directly contracted between parties; this may result in double counting of low emissions or renewable electricity contributions across grid-supplied consumers.\n- (9) Scope 1 GHG emissions from BHP's facilities covered by the Safeguard Mechanism administered by the Clean Energy Regulator in Australia and the distillate and gasoline GHG emissions from turbine boilers at the cathode plant at Escondida covered by the Green Tax legislation in Chile.\n- (10)  In the absence of a residual mix default emission factor for Queensland, the default grid factor has been applied for volumes supplied under contracts without generation mix speci/f.shortications. This may result in some double-counting between electricity consumers in the region. We are continuing to evaluate options to improve the accuracy of our Scope 2 GHG emissions reporting and may re/f.shortine this approach in future years.\n- (11)  Although we prioritise our internal GHG emission reduction projects, we acknowledge a role for high-quality o/ffsets in a temporary or transitional capacity while abatement options are being studied, as well as for 'hard to abate' emissions with limited or no current technological solutions. In this context, we retired a quantity of high-quality carbon o/ffsets in FY2021 equivalent to the net increase in our total Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions from FY2020 to FY2021. Further detail on our approach to carbon o/ffset use is provided in this Annual Report including information on the projects from which retired carbon o/ffsets were sourced.\n- (12)  In FY2021, we have calculated an additional operational GHG emissions total for the reporting year including contributions from the retirement of a quantity of carbon o/ffsets. This /f.shortigure has been calculated by subtracting the number of carbon o/ffsets retired (each equivalent to a single tonne of CO2-e reduced or 'removed' from the atmosphere) from the total GHG emissions reported under our operational control boundary for the year. We do not intend to establish a consistent or ongoing approach to the use of carbon o/ffsets towards delivery of our operational GHG emissions targets and as such this carbon o/ffset retirement is not integrated into the FY2021 Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions totals used to assess performance against these targets. Instead, we may retire o/ffsets as a viable low-cost abatement option during some reporting periods in the short term while we pursue material decarbonisation opportunities with medium to long-term implementation timeframes. Further detail on our approach to carbon o/ffset use, and the speci/f.shortics of the carbon o/ffsets retired in FY2021, is provided at bhp.com/ o/ffsets-2021.\n\n- (14)  Based on FY2021, FY2020 and FY2019 production /f.shortigures. Production /f.shortigures used are consistent with the GHG emissions reporting boundary (i.e. BHP operational control and are taken on a 100 per cent basis). Production data for Copper assets does not include gold, silver or uranium in the calculation. Saleable production data is used for Nickel West.\n\n- (17)  For the operational control organisational boundary, excludes Onshore US assets, which were divested in FY2019. For the equity share and /f.shortinancial control organisational boundaries, FY2021 Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions (on equity basis) from Cerrej\u00f3n are only accounted for H1FY2021 due to the e/ffective economic date of 31 December 2020 for sale of BHP's interest in Cerrej\u00f3n. Non-material acquisitions and divestments have not been included in Discontinued operations and are included in the Total.\n- (18)  The equity share approach to calculate GHG emissions re/f.shortlects BHP's equity share in the operations as de/f.shortined under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. As BHP does not control or have access to the data from all operations in which it holds equity, certain assumptions have been made to estimate equity share GHG emissions from operations not under BHP's operational control. Details on assumptions and operations included are provided in note (20). Comparison of year-on-year equity share GHG emissions may not be possible due to the assumptions made.",

This approach does not report GHG emissions from operations which are accounted for using the equity method in the company's /f.shortinancial statements. As BHP does not control or have access to the data from all operations in which it holds equity, certain assumptions have been made to estimate equity share GHG emissions from operations not under BHP's operational control. Details are provided in note (20). Comparison of year on year /f.shortinancial control GHG emissions may not be possible due to the assumptions made.\n- (20) Non-operated assets include Antamina, Cerrej\u00f3n, the Kelar Power Station and the Petroleum assets in Australia, USA and Algeria. Samarco is excluded as operations re-commenced in FY2021 and Samarco has not published their latest data and prior year data will not re/f.shortlect Samarco becoming operational in FY2021. GHG emissions data was sourced directly from the operator in the /f.shortirst instance and, where not readily available for the current reporting year, FY2020 or CY2020 data was extrapolated to re/f.shortlect FY2021 production levels. This allowed recalculation of prior year GHG emissions for some assets which were previously estimated using GHG emissions intensities based on analogous BHP operations. For equity share reporting of GHG emissions from non-operated assets, FY2020 originally reported data that is restated on this basis is 3,800 ktCO2-e for Scope 1 GHG emissions, 130 ktCO2-e for Scope 2 GHG emissions and 3,930 ktCO2-e for total GHG emissions. For /f.shortinancial control based GHG emissions reported from non-operated assets, FY2020 originally reported data that is restated is 3,430 ktCO2-e for Scope 1 GHG emissions, 10 ktCO2-e for Scope 2 GHG emissions and 3,440 ktCO2-e for total GHG emissions. Non-operated assets' GHG emissions are based on third party (operators') estimates and are therefore not subject to the same level of review and assurance by BHP as GHG emissions within BHP's operational control boundary.\n- (21)  Scope 3 GHG emissions have been calculated using methodologies consistent with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (Scope 3 Standard). Scope 3 GHG emissions reporting necessarily requires a degree of overlap in reporting boundaries due to our involvement at multiple points in the life cycle of the commodities we produce and consume. More information on the calculation methodologies, assumptions and key references used in the preparation of our Scope 3 GHG emissions data can be found in the associated BHP Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG Emissions Calculation Methodology, available at bhp.com/climate.\n- (22) In FY2021, we have made improvements in how we calculate Scope 3 GHG emissions associated with the purchased goods and services category by assigning more accurate emission factors to some procurement categories and improving the accuracy of spend data. Previously reported GHG emissions for the 'Purchased goods and services (including capital goods)' category are 16.9 MtCO2-e in FY2020 and 17.3 MtCO2-e in FY2019. Previously reported emissions for FY2019 are 0.1 MtCO2-e in the 'Business travel' category and <0.1 MtCO2-e for the 'Employee commuting' category. GHG emissions in FY2020 did not materially change as a result of the improved methodology.\n- (23) In FY2021, we have made improvements in how we calculate Scope 3 GHG emissions associated with the 'Fuel and Energy related activities' category by removing the Scope 3 GHG emissions associated with natural gas consumption at our Petroleum operations as the majority of those emissions would be captured in our Scope 1 GHG emissions. Previously reported GHG emissions for the 'Fuel and Energy related activities' category are 1.3 MtCO2-e in FY2020 and also in FY2019.\n- (24) Includes product transport where freight costs are covered by BHP, for example under Cost and Freight (CFR) or similar terms, as well as purchased transport services for process inputs to our operations.\n- (25) Product transport where freight costs are not covered by BHP, for example under Free on Board (FOB) or similar terms.\n- (26) For BHP, this category covers the Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions (on an equity basis) from our assets that are owned as a joint venture but not operated by BHP. In FY2021, GHG emissions estimates from non-operated assets were developed from data provided directly by operators. GHG emissions from our non-operated Kelar Power Station asset are reported as Scope 2 GHG emissions at the Minerals Americas operated assets supplied by the facility and therefore excluded from our Scope 3 GHG emissions totals. The previous FY2020 value of 3.9 MtCO2-e has been restated to remove GHG emissions from the Kelar Power Station and include updated Scope 3 GHG emissions estimates for non-operated assets for which data was previously unavailable from operators. FY2021 Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions (on an equity basis) from Cerrej\u00f3n are only accounted for H1FY2021 due to the e/ffective economic date of 31 December 2020 for sale of BHP's interest in Cerrej\u00f3n. Details on assumptions and operations included are provided in note (20).\n- (27) All iron ore production and metallurgical coal is assumed to be processed into steel and all copper metal production is assumed to be processed into copper wire for end use. Processing of nickel, zinc, gold, silver, ethane and uranium oxide is not currently included, as production volumes are much lower than iron ore and copper and a large range of possible end uses apply or downstream GHG emissions are estimated to be immaterial. Processing/re/f.shortining of petroleum products is also excluded as these GHG emissions are considered immaterial compared to the end-use product combustion reported in the 'Use of sold products' category.\n- (28) In FY2021, we have addressed some key limitations associated with estimating Scope 3 GHG emissions. We have worked to eliminate double counting in our reported inventory in relation to GHG emissions from the processing of iron ore and metallurgical coal in steelmaking, by allocating GHG emissions between the two and reporting a single total Scope 3 GHG emissions /f.short i gure for GHG emissions from steelmaking. Allocation of steelmaking GHG emissions to BHP's metallurgical coal is based on the global average input mass ration of metallurgical vs iron ore to the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF/hyphen.ucBOF) steelmaking route. This approach to improving accuracy is consistent with the Scope 3 Standard. We have also improved the accuracy of the emission factor used to estimate Scope 3 GHG emissions by re/f.shortlecting the blast furnace integrated steelmaking route into which the majority of BHP's steelmaking raw materials portfolio is sold. The improved estimation also considers BHP iron ore product quality and its impact on the amount of ore required to produce steel. As our product evolves in its quality and /f.shortlow through to other pathways (such as direct reduced iron electric arc furnace (DRI/hyphen.ucEAF)), we will adjust the balance of intensity factors to re/f.shortlect these changes. Previously reported numbers for iron ore processing are 205.6/hyphen.uc322.6 MtCO2-e for FY2020 and 197.2/hyphen.uc299.6 MtCO2-e for FY2019. Previously reported numbers for metallurgical coal are 33.7/hyphen.uc108.2 MtCO2-e for FY2020 and/uni00A034.7/endash.uc111.4 MtCO2-e for FY2019.\n- (29) All crude oil and condensates are conservatively assumed to be re/f.shortined and combusted as diesel. Energy coal, natural gas and natural gas liquids are assumed to be combusted. FY2021 Scope 3 GHG emissions associated with energy coal products from Cerrej\u00f3n are only accounted for H1FY2021 due to the e/ffective economic date of 31 December 2020 for sale/uni00A0of/uni00A0BHP's interest in Cerrej\u00f3n.\n- (30) We reported a total /f.shortigure for the Scope 3 GHG emissions inventory this year as major double counting of GHG emissions from the processing of iron ore and metallurgical coal in steelmaking was removed, however a degree of overlap in reporting boundaries still occurs due to our involvement at multiple points in the life cycle of the commodities we produce and consume.",

        "page_content": "## 4.8  Sustainability - performance data continued\n\n## 4.8.6  Water - performance data\n\nThis section provides detailed disclosure of our various water metrics in line with the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Guidelines. All water performance data presented in this Report are from operated assets during FY2021 and exclude Discontinued operations (Onshore US assets).\n\nDe/f.shortinitions of water metrics, sources and types are provided in our online ESG Standards and Databook and in section 4.11.4.\n\nBHP has continued to classify water quality into three categories in line with the Minerals Council of Australia's Water Accounting Framework (WAF) as this provides more granularity. Type 1 and Type 2 equate to high-quality water, while Type 3 equates to low-quality water under the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Guidelines.\n\nIn FY2021, BHP commenced use of the WWF Water Risk Filter (1) for our disclosures of basin risk for our operated assets. Using the WWF Water Risk Filter, it was found that two of our operated assets (approximately 18 per cent), as of the end of FY2021, are classi/f.shortied as being under high or very high water stress due to location. These are shown in the Asset Summary Table.\n\n## Water withdrawals\n\nWater withdrawals represent the volume of water, in megalitres (ML) received and intended for use by the operated asset from the water environment and/or a third-party supplier. (2)(3) Third-party water withdrawals were reported by source in prior years however from FY2021/uni00A0we have reported as a distinct category to align with reporting frameworks such as ICMM guidelines and GRI.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) https://waterrisk/f.shortilter.panda.org/\n- (2) These withdrawal volumes include rainfall and runo/ff volumes captured and used during the reporting year but exclude rainfall and runo/ff volumes that have been captured and stored, and will be reported in the future year of use.\n- (3) Volumes of withdrawal by source have been updated for FY2019, FY2018 and FY2017 for the Nickel West operated asset at Kwinana. Previously, the total volumes of water suppled to the site by a third party, Water Corporation, was proportionately to source in alignment with the public information (48 per cent from seawater, 42 per cent from groundwater and 10 per cent from surface water). In FY2020, Water Corporation supplied BHP site-speci/f.shortic proportions of water sources for our Kwinana operations for the FY2017 to FY2020 period and will continue to do so.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWater withdrawals for FY2021 across our operations increased by 15 per cent from FY2020 (from 380,330 ML to 438,660 ML) due primarily to increased withdrawal of seawater at Escondida and our Petroleum operated assets. The large increase (33,500 ML) in Petroleum seawater withdrawals results from a decision to include the water withdrawals resulting from our well and seismic operations from FY2021. BHP deemed it has operational control while well and seismic activities are undertaken by us. Minor increases at other assets (e.g. Olympic Dam and WAIO) were o/ffset by a minor decrease in withdrawal at our BMA and BMC operated assets and at our Nickel West operations. Despite the 15 per cent increase in water withdrawal, our withdrawal of high-quality water (Type 1 and Type 2) increased by less than 5 per cent from 87,280 ML in FY2020 to 91,280 ML in FY2021. Total water withdrawals from operated assets located in high or very high water-stressed areas (as determined by WWF water risk /f.shortilter) was 233,190 ML.\n\nThe majority of our water withdrawals (65 per cent) come from seawater. Escondida stopped drawing groundwater from the Monturaqui bore/f.shortield in the second half of FY2020. Currently, the majority of Escondida's operational water consumption is met by desalinated water. (4) The/uni00A0proportion of withdrawals relating to groundwater across BHP reduced from 33 per cent of withdrawals in FY2020 to 23 per cent of withdrawals in FY2021, in part due to the reporting of third-party withdrawals as a distinct category. WAIO, BMA and BMC account for more than half of terrestrial water withdrawal across our business.\n\n(4)   Small quantities of groundwater are extracted for pit dewatering to allow safe mining.",

The withdrawals, and the material contributors to these, were within expectations for FY2021 and in line with our ambition to minimise our withdrawal of high-quality fresh water and replace these with seawater/ low-quality withdrawals where feasible. As the results are within expectations, there are no implications for current commitments, strategy and costs for the business with respect to water withdrawals. For more information on freshwater withdrawal, refer to section 1.13.13.\n\n## Water discharges\n\nWater discharges includes water that has been removed from the operated asset and returned to the environment or distributed to a third party. This includes seepage from tailings dams to groundwater, discharges from operations to surface waters (which are also a/ffected by periods of higher rainfall) and discharges to seawater.

Freshwater withdrawal also excludes entrained water that would not be available for other uses. These exclusions have been made to align with the target's intent to reduce the use of freshwater sources of potential value to other users or the environment.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTotal water discharges for FY2021 were 203,450 ML, an increase from 147,850 in FY2020 as expected due to the increased throughput of the desalination facility at our Escondida asset and inclusion of well and seismic operations for our Petroleum operated asset. Total water discharges in high or very high water-stressed areas was 123,200 ML. The majority of water discharges are to seawater at over 93 per cent, with Escondida (which accounts for approximately 60 per cent of our discharges) and Petroleum being the largest contributors. The secondlargest discharge volume is to groundwater, the majority of which is Type 3 water that is withdrawn as a by-product during the recovery of hydrocarbons from below the seabed (and therefore classed as groundwater in the ICMM, GRI and WAF guidance) and which is returned by re-injection to below the/uni00A0seabed or to the ocean.\n\nDischarges to surface water (usually riverine systems) are in/f.shortluenced by climatic conditions such as rainfall and occurrence of extreme weather events, therefore are subject to higher variability and less predictable. Our water management practices at the operated assets where this may occur are designed to accommodate this variability and therefore the occurrence of such events does not a/ffect our current management activities and strategy or result in elevated risks.\n\nApproximately 45 per cent of our assets do not have any water discharges due to water being either consumed in operational activities or reused/ recycled. This is similar to previous years, but note that prior to FY2019, the de/f.shortinition of water discharges included water that was evaporated or entrained. This is now reported as consumption, in line with ICMM Guidelines. The extent of this change is shown in the data tables in section 4.8.4.\n\n## Water recycled/reused\n\nThe ICMM Guidance de/f.shortines reused water as water that has previously been used at the operated asset that is used again without further treatment and recycled water is water that is reused but is treated before it is used again.\n\nDuring FY2021, the total volume of water recycled/reused was 262,430 ML.\n\nThe ability of our operated assets to reuse and recycle water varies depending on the recovery processes used and the water quality requirements. The accuracy of the recycled/reused metric currently varies depending on the complexity of the process and how closely water movements are measured and understood. As our data collection and analysis improves, we can more robustly assess opportunities to recycle or reuse water.",

        "page_content": "## 4.8  Sustainability - performance data continued\n\n## Water diversions\n\nDiverted water is water that is actively managed by an operated asset but not used for any operational purposes. For example, we withdraw water and treat it for use as drinking water by local communities, such as in the town of Roxby Downs in South Australia. In FY2021, 103,220 ML of water was withdrawn without any intention to be used at BHP operated assets with 1,130 ML diverted in high or very high water-stressed areas. Diversions predominantly relate to water that is treated by our legacy assets in North America, and by dewatering for WAIO, and described further in the our sustainability case studies.\n\nAs the withdrawal of diverted water may occur in a di/fferent annual reporting period to its discharge, in any given annual period there may be a di/fferential between withdrawal and discharge volumes for/uni00A0diverted water.\n\nUnder ICMM Water Reporting: Good practice guide (2nd Edition), diversions need to be reported as 'Other managed water'. From FY2022, we will update our reporting and/uni00A0data in line with this proposed change in terminology.\n\n## Water consumption\n\nIn FY2021, evaporation and entrainment remained the most signi/f.shorticant contributors to consumption. Evaporation occurs during a number of operational activities including dust suppression, storage of tailings and/uni00A0storage of water.\n\nEvaporation consumption is inherently linked with climatic conditions during the reporting period. Evaporation data is estimated or simulated using average climatic conditions and therefore consumption due to evaporation should remain relatively stable. Due to the link with climatic conditions, the volumes consumed via evaporation are predominately outside of BHP's direct control.\n\nEntrained water includes water incorporated into product and/ or waste streams, such as tailings, that cannot be easily recovered. Entrainment may show variability due to the type and location of ore during any given reporting period. The use of water in our processing facilities, or for reducing dust release during storage of product, can result/uni00A0in entrainment of water.\n\nThe category of 'other' for consumption includes several uses, the most signi/f.shorticant being water used by people for drinking or ablutions at/uni00A0operated assets.\n\nThe collation and disclosure of consumption will assist in identifying areas/uni00A0for improvements in data accuracy for entrainment and evaporation, and assist with identifying opportunities to reduce, where/uni00A0possible, loss of water.\n\nTotal consumption in FY2021 was 267,130 ML and 106,950 ML in high or very high water-stressed locations respectively. The operated assets in FY2021 that consumed the most water were Escondida, WAIO and BMA. Entrainment of water in tailings is the largest contributor to consumption at Escondida, whereas evaporation is the key driver of consumption at WAIO. Entrainment in ore during processing, as well as evaporation from dust suppression and tailings and water storage all contribute to consumption at BMA. It should be noted that in any given reporting period, consumption and discharge volumes might be higher than withdrawals as evaporation can occur from water that has been captured/uni00A0and stored during previous periods.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Changes in water storage\n\nBHP has a commitment to contribute to improved mining sector water reporting through strengthened ICMM guidance, aligned with GRI requirements. In FY2021 we collated information on change in water storage as described in the revised ICMM Water Reporting Guidance and used it to support further assessment of the validity of assumptions underpinning asset water models and water balances. Water modelling contains a degree of uncertainty due to inclusion of estimates and assumptions. The collation of information to inform reporting of change in water storage has identi/f.shortied areas for improvement in the estimated and simulated data within the water models as currently used at our coal assets. We intend to undertake work during FY2022 to assess underlying assumptions in an e/ffort to improve the water modelling at our coal assets, as well as further maturing the measurement of changes in water storage across the Group. For this reason, we have not included change in/uni00A0water storage data in our reporting for FY2021.\n\n## Water-related legal performance\n\nDuring FY2021 we had three incidents of water-related non-compliance that resulted in a formal enforcement action. These all occurred in our Minerals Australia assets with two at BMA and one at BMC. None of these were associated with non-compliance with discharge limits set/uni00A0by/uni00A0regulatory permits.",

In some instances the sum of totals for quality, source and destination may di/ffer due to rounding.\n- (2) Petroleum assets have been grouped due to their relatively lower volumes of water withdrawals, discharges and consumption compared to the mining assets.\n- (3) Based on the physical risk rating from the WWF Water Risk /f.shortilter and is based on the de/f.shortinition of water stress in the CEO Water Mandate's 'Corporate Water Disclosure Guidelines (2014)'. Those assets with a high or very high physical risk rating are de/f.shortined as being located in a 'water-stressed area'.\n- (4) Includes rainfall and run-o/ff volumes captured and used during the reporting year. Rainfall and run-o/ff volumes that have been captured and stored are excluded and will be reported in the future year of use.\n- (5) Third-party water withdrawals were reported by source in prior years however have been reported as a distinct category in FY2021 for transparency.\n- (6) This third-party water is sourced from a combination of seawater (desalination), groundwater and surface water sources in varying proportions across the reporting period.\n- (7) This volume was discharged as water supply to a neighbouring organisation.\n- (8) This volume was discharged from BMA and supplied to BMC and is therefore not considered as water supplied to another organisation.",

Insurance or other indemni/f.shortication protection may o/ffset the /f.shortinancial impact on the Group of a successful claim.\n\nThis section summarises the signi/f.shorticant legal proceedings and investigations and associated matters in which the Group is currently involved or has /f.short inalised since our last Annual Report. The timing of many of the legal proceedings and investigations continue to be delayed or uncertain as a result of court closures or delays in response to the COVID/hyphen.uc19 pandemic.\n\n## Legal proceedings relating to the failure of the Fund\u00e3o tailings dam at the Samarco iron ore operations in Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo (Samarco dam failure)\n\nThe Group is engaged in numerous legal proceedings relating to the Samarco dam failure. While there has been progress in priority areas, such as individual compensation and indemni/f.shortication for the damage caused by the dam failure, it is not possible at this time to provide a range of possible outcomes for all proceedings or a reliable estimate of potential future exposures. There are numerous additional lawsuits against Samarco relating to the dam failure to which the Group is not party. Currently, there are approximately 50 ongoing public civil claims and 20 that are suspended. The most signi/f.shorticant of these proceedings are summarised below.\n\n## R$20 billion public civil claim commenced by the Federal Government of Brazil, states of Esp\u00edrito Santo and Minas Gerais and other authorities (R$20 billion Public Civil Claim)\n\nOn 30 November 2015, the Federal Government of Brazil, states of Esp\u00edrito Santo and Minas Gerais and other public authorities collectively /f.shortiled a public civil claim before the 12th Federal Court of Belo Horizonte against Samarco and its shareholders, BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda. (BHP Brasil) and Vale, seeking the establishment of a fund of up to R$20 billion (approximately US$4 billion) in aggregate for clean-up costs and damages.\n\nOn 2 March 2016, BHP Brasil, together with Vale and Samarco, entered into a Framework Agreement with the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo and Minas Gerais and other public authorities to establish a foundation (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova) to develop and execute environmental and socioeconomic programs (Programs) to remediate and provide compensation for damage caused by/uni00A0the Samarco dam failure.\n\nThe term of the Framework Agreement is 15 years, renewable for periods of one year successively until all obligations under the Framework Agreement have been performed. Under the Framework Agreement, Samarco is responsible, as a primary obligor, for funding Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's annual calendar year budget for the duration of the Framework Agreement. The amount of funding for each calendar year will be dependent on the remediation and compensation projects to be undertaken in a particular year. To the extent that Samarco does not meet its funding obligations under the Framework Agreement, each of Vale and BHP Brasil has funding obligations under the Framework Agreement, as secondary obligors, in proportion to its 50 per cent shareholding in Samarco.\n\n## R$155 billion public civil claim commenced by the Federal Public Prosecutors' O/ff.shortice (R$155 billion Federal Public Prosecutors' O/ff.shortice/uni00A0claim)\n\nOn 3 May 2016, the Brazilian Federal Public Prosecutors' O/ff.shortice /f.shortiled a public civil claim before the 12th Federal Court of Belo Horizonte against BHP Brasil, Vale and Samarco - as well as 18 other public entities (which has since been reduced to /f.shortive defendants (1) by the 12th Federal Court) - seeking R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) for reparation, compensation and/uni00A0collective moral damages in relation to the Samarco dam failure.\n\nThis public civil claim and the R$20 billion Public Civil Claim are broad claims that encompass the majority of the public civil claims /f.shortiled against BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale. For this reason, the 12th Federal Court has suspended other public civil claims while negotiations continue in relation to the settlement of the R$155 billion Federal Public Prosecutors' O/ff.shortice claim.\n\nDespite suspension of this public civil claim being for a period of two years from the date of rati/f.shortication of the Governance Agreement (described below) on 8 August 2018 the claim has not been resumed. On 19 March\n\n2\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2021, the parties to the case agreed to extend the suspension of this case until 27 April 2021. Although the stay period has formally elapsed, neither party has made any /f.shortilings to date, and the parties are engaged in/uni00A0negotiations to seek a de/f.shortinitive settlement (summarised below).\n\n## Governance Agreement\n\nOn 25 June 2018, BHP Brasil, Vale, Samarco, the other parties to the Framework Agreement, the Public Prosecutors' O/ff.shortice (2) and the Public Defense O/ff.shortice (3) entered into a Governance Agreement, which settled the R$20 billion Public Civil Claim and established a process to renegotiate the Programs over two years to progress settlement of the R$155 billion Federal Public Prosecutors' O/ff.shortice claim.\n\nUnder the Governance Agreement, renegotiation of the Programs will be based on certain agreed principles, including full reparation consistent with Brazilian law, the requirement for a technical basis for any proposed changes, consideration of /f.shortindings from experts appointed by BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale, consideration of /f.shortindings from experts appointed by prosecutors and consideration of feedback from impacted communities.\n\nSince early CY2021, the parties have been engaging in negotiations, to seek a de/f.shortinitive and substantive settlement of claims relating to the dam failure. The mediation is ongoing as at the date of this Report. It is not possible to provide a range of outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential settlement outcomes and there is a risk that a negotiated outcome may be materially higher than amounts currently re/f.shortlected in the Samarco dam failure provision. Until revisions to the Programs are agreed, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova will continue to implement the Programs in accordance with the terms of the Framework Agreement and the Governance Agreement.\n\n## Enforcement Proceedings\n\nSince 7 January 2020, the 12th Federal Court of Belo Horizonte has issued several decisions creating 13 enforcement proceedings (Enforcement Proceedings) linked to the R$20 billion Public Civil Claim and R$155 billion Federal Public Prosecutors' O/ff.shortice claim described above. The 13 Enforcement Proceedings seek to expedite the remediation process related to the Samarco dam failure. No substantive new claims were made/uni00A0under these proceedings.\n\nIssues covered by these Enforcement Proceedings include environmental recovery, human health risk and ecological risk, resettlement of a/ffected communities, infrastructure and development, registration of certain impacted individuals under the Programs and indemnities for people impacted by the dam failure, resumption of economic activities, water supply for human consumption and hiring of technical advisers to impacted people, and restructuring Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's management system, among other key delivery areas.\n\nIn the context of these Enforcement Proceedings, BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale are seeking determinations, including the repealing of /f.short ishing bans ordered by the courts or administration entities, set-o/ff of compensation paid against future damages that may need to be paid, and determination regarding the hiring and supervision of technical assistants to impacted people.\n\n## Samarco's judicial reorganisation\n\nOn 9 April 2021, Samarco /f.shortiled for judicial reorganisation (JR) with the Second Business State Court for the Belo Horizonte District of Minas Gerais (JR Court). The JR proceeding seeks to enable Samarco to negotiate and implement an orderly restructuring of its /f.shortinancial indebtedness in order to establish a sustainable /f.shortinancial position for Samarco, among other things, to continue to rebuild its operations and meet its Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova obligations. Samarco /f.shortiled for JR following multiple enforcement actions /f.short iled by Samarco's creditors that threatened its operations. The JR Court granted Samarco's JR petition on 12 April 2021 and granted a stay of the enforcement actions.\n\nOn 10 June 2021, Samarco submitted its /f.shortirst proposed Plan of Reorganisation (Plan) to the JR Court. Certain of Samarco's creditors have submitted formal objections to the Plan. It is expected that a general meeting of creditors will be convened for creditors to vote on whether to/uni00A0approve, reject or modify the Plan.\n\nAccording to the list of creditors /f.shortiled with the JR Court by the Judicial Administrators (who are in charge of a /f.shortirst review of the list of creditors\n\n- (1) Currently, solely BHP Brasil, Vale and Samarco, the Federal Government and the state of Minas Gerais are defendants.\n- (2)   The Public Prosecutors' O/ff.shortice includes the Federal, State of Minas Gerais and State of Esp\u00edrito Santo public prosecutors' o/ff.shortices.\n- (3) The Public Defense O/ff.shortice includes the Federal, State of Minas Gerais and State of Esp\u00edrito Santo public defense o/ff.shortices.",

        "page_content": "## 4.9  Legal proceedings continued\n\n/f.short iled by Samarco), Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's funding obligations undertaken by Samarco are not subject to the JR, although some /f.shortinancial creditors of Samarco have objected to this position. It is expected that such creditors will challenge the list of creditors /f.shortiled by the Judicial Administrators, in order to, among other things, prevent Samarco from funding Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova. It is also expected that such creditors will litigate against Samarco and its shareholders over the course of the JR proceeding, particularly with respect to the treatment of Samarco's Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova obligations. Such lenders have objected to the /f.shortinancing that BHP Brasil and Vale have o/ffered to Samarco on a super-priority basis, known as debtor-in-possession funding.\n\nNo BHP entity is a debtor in Samarco's judicial reorganisation case. BHP Brasil is participating in Samarco's JR proceeding in its capacities as a shareholder and creditor.\n\n## United States Chapter 15 Case\n\nOn 19 April 2021, Samarco /f.shortiled a petition with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York seeking recognition of the JR proceeding under Chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On 13 May 2021, the U.S. bankruptcy court granted recognition of the JR proceeding as a 'foreign main proceeding' and accordingly stayed enforcement actions against Samarco in the U.S. territory. No BHP entity is a debtor in Samarco's Chapter 15 case. BHP Brasil is participating in Samarco's Chapter 15 proceeding in its capacities as a shareholder and creditor of Samarco.\n\n## Civil public actions commenced by the State Prosecutors' O/ff.shortice in/uni00A0the state of Minas Gerais (Mariana CPA cases)\n\nThe State Prosecutors of Mariana have commenced several civil public actions (CPA) against BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale.\n\nOn 10 December 2015, the State Prosecutors' O/ff.shortice in the state of Minas Gerais /f.shortiled a CPA against Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale before the State Court in Mariana claiming indemni/f.shortication (amount not speci/f.shortied) for moral and material damages to an unspeci/f.shortied group of individuals a/ffected by the Samarco dam failure, including the payment of costs for/uni00A0housing and social and economic assistance (CPA Mariana I).\n\nOn 2 October 2018, the parties reached a settlement dismissing the claim, which was rati/f.shortied by the Court. Under this settlement, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova has reached more than 85 individual agreements with impacted families in Mariana for the payment of damages.\n\nIn connection with CPA Mariana I, the State Prosecutors (Minas Gerais) started four enforcement proceedings against Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale seeking to set a deadline for completion of resettlement and for /f.shortines to be imposed for delays to resettlement and for payment of compensation to a/ffected individuals for delivery of houses below standard.\n\nIn addition to CPA Mariana I, the State Prosecutors (Minas Gerais) commenced eight other CPAs in Mariana against Samarco, BHP Brasil, Vale and, in some cases, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova. The claims presented in those/uni00A0CPAs are related to damages that, according to the State Prosecutors, are not covered by CPA Mariana I.\n\nThe remaining CPAs have either been settled by the parties, including BHP, or the claims to which the CPAs relate have been dismissed (though the decisions are not yet /f.shortinal). Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova is responsible for any pending obligations set forth in the settlement agreements relating to the CPAs.\n\n## Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova dissolution lawsuit\n\nOn 24 February 2021, the Minas Gerais State Prosecutor /f.shortiled a CPA against Samarco, BHP Brasil, Vale and Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova seeking the dissolution of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova. The plainti/ffs are seeking R$10 billion (approximately US$2 billion) for moral damages and an injunction for the immediate intervention of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova was also made, alleging the need to preserve information and documents produced by Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova to evaluate criminal and civil responsibilities. On 25 May 2021, the Superior Court of Justice granted urgent relief to suspend the lawsuit. As at the date of this Report, the Court's decision regarding the merits remains pending.\n\n## Civil public action commenced by the State Prosecutors' O/ff.shortice in/uni00A0the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo and Minas Gerais (CPA Advertising)\n\nOn 11 May 2021, Federal and State Prosecutors (Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo) /f.shortiled a CPA against Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova, Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale, challenging Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's advertising\n\nexpenditures. The plainti/ffs requested injunctive relief for Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova to cease advertisements and stop incurring new expenses on advertising. The plainti/ffs requested payment of approximately R$56 million (approximately US$11 million) to be paid as compensation to the communities and approximately R$28 million (approximately US$6 million) to be spent on execution of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's socioeconomic and socio-environmental programs. A ruling is still pending.\n\n## Public civil claims currently suspended\n\nApproximately 20 of the proceedings to which BHP Brasil is a party are currently suspended due to their connection with R$20 billion Public Civil/uni00A0Claim and R$155 billion Federal Public Prosecutors' O/ff.shortice claim. There has not yet been a ruling in these cases.\n\nThe suspended proceedings include proceedings commenced by the State Prosecutors (Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo), Public Defenders (Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo), and the states of Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo against Samarco, BHP Brasil, Vale and Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova. The claims relate to environmental remediation measures, compensation for the impacts of the dam failure, including moral damages, reconstruction of properties and populations, including historical, religious, cultural, social, environmental and intangible heritages a/ffected by the dam failure, and suspension of public water supply, among others.\n\n## Other civil proceedings in Brazil\n\nAs noted above, BHP Brasil has been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits relating to the Samarco dam failure. In addition, government inquiries and investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure have been commenced by numerous agencies of the Brazilian Government and are ongoing, including criminal investigations by the federal and state police, and by federal prosecutors.\n\nBHP Brasil's potential liabilities, if any, resulting from other pending and future claims, lawsuits and enforcement actions relating to the Samarco dam failure, together with the potential cost of implementing remedies sought in the various proceedings, cannot be reliably estimated at this time and therefore a provision has not been recognised and nor has any contingent liability been quanti/f.shortied for these matters. Ultimately, these could have a material adverse impact on BHP's business, competitive position, cash /f.shortlows, prospects, liquidity and shareholder returns. For more information on the Samarco dam failure, refer to section 1.15.\n\nAs at June 2021, Samarco had been named as a defendant in more than 80,000 small claims for moral damages in which people argue their public water service was interrupted for between /f.shortive and 10 days. BHP Brasil is a co-defendant in more than 24,000 of these cases. More than 270,000 people have received moral damages related to the temporary suspension of public water supply through settlements reached with Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova.\n\nThe Brazilian Code of Civil Procedure provides that repetitive claims can be settled through a system known as Incident of Resolution of Repetitive Demands (IRDR). Under the IRDR, a court will hear a 'pilot case' representative of a recurring claim and the judgment in that decision will set a precedent for the resolution of similar cases in that jurisdiction. An IRDR has been established in Minas Gerais and the court in the pilot case has ruled that the mandatory parameter for resolution of claims will be the payment of R$2,000 per individual claim for moral damages due to the suspension and quality of public water supply. That decision is pending an appeal before higher courts. Meanwhile, Samarco has reached settlement in more than 5,300 individual cases.\n\n## Criminal charges\n\nOn 20 October 2016, the Federal Prosecutors' O/ff.shortice in Brazil /f.shortiled criminal charges against Samarco, BHP Brasil, Vale and certain employees and former employees of BHP Brasil (A/ffected Individuals) in the Federal Court of Ponte Nova, Minas Gerais. On 3 March 2017, BHP Brasil and the A/ffected Individuals /f.shortiled their preliminary defences. The Federal Court granted Habeas Corpus petitions in favour of eight of the A/ffected Individuals terminating the charges against those individuals. The Federal Prosecutors' O/ff.shortice appealed seven of the decisions with hearings of the appeals still pending. BHP Brasil rejects outright the charges against BHP Brasil and the A/ffected Individuals and will defend the charges and fully support each of the A/ffected Individuals in their defences of the charges.",

        "page_content": "## United States class action complaint - bondholders\n\nOn 14 November 2016, a putative class action complaint (Bondholder Complaint) was /f.shortiled in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of purchasers of Samarco's 10-year bond notes due 2022/endash.uc2024 between 31 October 2012 and 30 November 2015. The Bondholder Complaint was initially /f.shortiled against Samarco and the former Chief Executive O/ff.shorticer of Samarco. The Bondholder Complaint asserted claims under the U.S. federal securities laws and indicated that the plainti/ff would seek certi/f.shortication to proceed as a class action.\n\nThe Bondholder Complaint was subsequently amended to include BHP Group Limited, BHP Group Plc, BHP Brasil, Vale and o/ff.shorticers of Samarco, including four of Vale and BHP Brasil's nominees to the Samarco Board. On 5 April 2017, the plainti/ff discontinued its claims against the individual defendants. The amount of damages sought by the putative class was unspeci/f.shortied.\n\nOn 7 March 2018, the District Court granted a joint motion from the remaining corporate defendants to dismiss the Bondholder Complaint. A second amended Bondholder Complaint was also dismissed by the Court on 18 June 2019. On 9 July 2019, the plainti/ff /f.shortiled a motion for reconsideration of that decision or for leave to /f.shortile a third amended complaint. On 30 October 2019, the District Court denied the plainti/ff's motion for reconsideration and for leave to amend its complaint. On 4 March 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit a/ff.shortirmed the dismissal with prejudice and the plainti/ff did not seek any/uni00A0further review of that decision.\n\n## Australian class action complaint\n\nBHP Group Limited is named as a defendant in a shareholder class action in the Federal Court of Australia on behalf of persons who acquired shares in BHP Group Limited on the Australian Securities Exchange or shares in BHP Group Plc on the London Stock Exchange and Johannesburg Stock Exchange in periods prior to the Samarco dam failure. The amount of damages sought in the class action is unspeci/f.shortied.\n\nOn 12 May 2020, BHP Group Limited /f.shortiled an application seeking declaratory relief which, if successful, would narrow the group of claimants in the class action. BHP Group Limited was unsuccessful at /f.shortirst instance and on appeal to the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia. BHP Group Limited has now sought leave to appeal the decision of the Full Court to the High Court of Australia.\n\n## United Kingdom group action complaint\n\nBHP Group Plc and BHP Group Limited are named as defendants in group action claims for damages that have been /f.shortiled in the courts of England. These claims have been /f.shortiled on behalf of certain individuals, governments, businesses and communities in Brazil allegedly impacted by the Samarco dam failure.\n\nOn 7 August 2019, the BHP parties /f.shortiled a preliminary application to strike out or stay this action on jurisdictional and other procedural grounds. That application was successful and the action was dismissed. The claimants sought and were denied permission to appeal the dismissal decision.\n\nOn 29 April 2021, the claimants applied to reopen the action. The Court of Appeal heard this application on 22 June 2021 and gave judgment on 27 July 2021, allowing the claimants to reopen the action and granting them permission to appeal the dismissal decision. A date for this appeal/uni00A0has not yet been set.\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFinancial\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.10  Shareholder information\n\n## 4.10.1  History and development\n\nBHP Group Limited (formerly BHP Billiton Limited, then BHP Limited and, before that, The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited) was incorporated in 1885 and is registered in Australia with ABN 49 004 028 077. BHP Group Plc (formerly BHP Billiton Plc, and before that Billiton Plc) was incorporated in 1996 and is registered in England and Wales with registration number 3196209. Successive predecessor entities to BHP Group Plc have operated since 1860.\n\nWe have operated under a Dual Listed Company (DLC) structure since 29 June 2001. Under the DLC structure, the two parent companies, BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc, operate as a single economic entity, run by a uni/f.shortied Board and senior executive management team. For more/uni00A0information on the DLC structure, refer to section 4.10.3.\n\n## 4.10.2  Markets\n\nAs at the date of this Annual Report, BHP Group Limited has a primary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) (ticker BHP) in Australia and BHP Group Plc has a premium listing on the UK FCA's O/ff.shorticial List and its ordinary shares are admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) (ticker BHP). BHP Group Plc also has a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) (ticker BHP) in South Africa.\n\nIn addition, BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the United States. Trading on the NYSE is via American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) evidencing American Depositary Shares (ADSs), with each ADS representing two ordinary shares of BHP Group Limited or BHP Group Plc. Citibank N.A. (Citibank) is the Depositary for both ADS programs. BHP Group Limited's ADSs have been listed for trading on the NYSE (ticker BHP) since 28 May 1987 and BHP Group Plc's since 25 June 2003 (ticker BBL).\n\n## 4.10.3  Organisational structure\n\n## General\n\nBHP consists of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc, operating as a single uni/f.shortied economic entity, following the completion of the DLC merger in June 2001 (the DLC merger). For a full list of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc subsidiaries, refer to note 13 'Related undertakings of/uni00A0the Group' in section 3.2.\n\nOn 17 August 2021, BHP announced its intention to unify its current DLC structure. For further details of the uni/f.shortication proposal, see section 1.5.\n\n## DLC structure\n\nBHP shareholders approved the DLC merger in 2001, which was designed to place ordinary shareholders of both companies in a position where they have economic and voting interests in a single group.\n\nThe principles of the BHP DLC structure are re/f.shortlected in the DLC Structure Sharing Agreement and include the following:\n\n- -  The two companies must operate as if they are a single uni/f.shortied economic entity, through Boards of Directors that comprise the same individuals and a uni/f.shortied senior executive management team.\n- -  The Directors of both companies will, in addition to their duties to the company concerned, have regard to the interests of the ordinary shareholders in the two companies as if the two companies were a single uni/f.shortied economic entity and, for that purpose, the Directors of each company take into account in the exercise of their powers the interests of the shareholders of the other.\n- -  Certain DLC equalisation principles must be observed. These are designed to ensure that for so long as the Equalisation Ratio between a/uni00A0BHP Group Limited ordinary share and a BHP Group Plc ordinary share is 1:1, the economic and voting interests resulting from holding one BHP Group Limited ordinary share and one BHP Group Plc ordinary share are, so far as practicable, equivalent.

        "page_content": "## 4.10  Shareholder information continued\n\n## Australian Foreign Investment Review Board conditions\n\nThe Treasurer of Australia approved the DLC merger subject to certain conditions, the e/ffect of which was to require that, among other things, BHP Group Limited continues to:\n\n- -  be an Australian company, which is headquartered in Australia\n- -  ultimately manage and control the companies that conducted the businesses that were conducted by its subsidiaries at the time of the/uni00A0DLC merger for as long as those businesses form part of BHP\n\nThe conditions also require the global headquarters of BHP to be in Australia.\n\nThe conditions have e/ffect inde/f.shortinitely, subject to amendment of the Australian Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (FATA) or any revocation or amendment by the Treasurer of Australia. If BHP Group Limited no longer wishes to comply with these conditions, it must obtain the prior approval of the Treasurer. Failure to comply with the conditions results in substantial penalties under the FATA.\n\n## Equalisation of economic and voting rights\n\nThe economic and voting interests attached to each BHP Group Limited ordinary share relative to each BHP Group Plc ordinary share are/uni00A0determined by a ratio known as the Equalisation Ratio.\n\nThe Equalisation Ratio is currently 1:1, meaning one BHP Group Limited ordinary share currently has the same economic and voting interests as/uni00A0one BHP Group Plc ordinary share.\n\nThe Equalisation Ratio governs the proportions in which dividends and capital distributions are paid on the ordinary shares in each company relative to the other. Given the current Equalisation Ratio of 1:1, the amount of any cash dividend paid by BHP Group Limited on each BHP Group Limited ordinary share must be matched by an equivalent cash dividend by BHP Group Plc on each BHP Group Plc ordinary share, and vice versa. If one company is prohibited by applicable law or is otherwise unable to pay a matching dividend, the DLC Structure Sharing Agreement requires that BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc will, as far as practicable, enter into such transactions with each other as their Boards agree to be necessary or desirable to enable both companies to pay matching dividends at the same time. These transactions may include BHP Group Limited or BHP Group Plc making a payment to the other company or paying a dividend on the DLC Dividend Share held by the other company (or a subsidiary of it). The DLC Dividend Share may be used to ensure that the need to trigger the matching dividend mechanism does not arise. BHP Group Limited issued a DLC Dividend Share on 23 February 2016. No DLC Dividend Share has been issued by BHP Group Plc.\n\nFor more information on the DLC Dividend Share, refer to 'DLC Dividend/uni00A0Share' sub-section below and section 4.10.5.\n\nThe Equalisation Ratio may be adjusted to maintain economic equivalence between an ordinary share in each of the two companies where, broadly speaking (and subject to certain exceptions):\n\n- -  a distribution or action a/ffecting the amount or nature of issued share capital is proposed by one of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc and that distribution or action would result in the ratio of economic returns on, or voting rights in relation to Joint Electorate Actions (see below) of, a BHP Group Limited ordinary share to a BHP Group Plc ordinary share not being the same, or would bene/f.shortit the holders of ordinary shares in one company relative to the holders of ordinary shares in the other company\n- -  no 'matching action' is taken by the other company. A matching action is a distribution or action a/ffecting the amount or nature of issued share capital in relation to the holders of ordinary shares in the other company, which ensures that the economic and voting rights of a BHP Group Limited ordinary share and BHP Group Plc ordinary share are maintained in proportion to the Equalisation Ratio\n\nFor example, an adjustment would be required if there were to be a capital issue or distribution by one company to its ordinary shareholders that does not give equivalent value (before tax) on a per share basis to the ordinary shareholders of the other company and no matching action was/uni00A0undertaken. Since the establishment of the DLC structure in 2001, no/uni00A0adjustment to the Equalisation Ratio has ever been made.\n\n## DLC Dividend Share\n\nEach of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc is authorised to issue a DLC Dividend Share to the other company or a wholly owned subsidiary of it. In e/ffect, only that other company or a wholly owned subsidiary of it may be the holder of the share. The share is redeemable.\n\nThe holder of the share is entitled to be paid such dividends as the Board may decide to pay on that DLC Dividend Share provided that:\n\n- -  the amount of the dividend does not exceed the cap mentioned below\n- -  the Board of the issuing company in good faith considers paying the dividend to be in furtherance of any of the DLC principles, including the principle of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc operating as a single uni/f.shortied economic entity\n\nThe amounts that may be paid as dividends on a DLC Dividend Share are capped. Broadly speaking, the cap is the total amount of the preceding ordinary cash dividend (whether interim or /f.shortinal) paid on BHP Group Limited ordinary shares or BHP Group Plc ordinary shares, whichever is greater. The cap will not apply to any dividend paid on a DLC Dividend Share if the proceeds of that dividend are to be used to pay a special cash/uni00A0dividend on ordinary shares.\n\nA DLC Dividend Share otherwise has limited rights and does not carry a right to vote. DLC Dividend Shares cannot be used to transfer funds outside of BHP as the terms of issue contain structural safeguards to ensure that a DLC Dividend Share may only be used to pay dividends within the Group. For more information on the rights attaching to and terms of DLC Dividend Shares, refer to section 4.10.5, the Constitution of/uni00A0BHP Group Limited and the Articles of Association of BHP Group Plc.\n\n## Joint Electorate Actions\n\nUnder the terms of the DLC agreements, BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc have implemented special voting arrangements so that the ordinary shareholders of both companies vote together as a single decision-making body on matters that a/ffect the ordinary shareholders of each company in similar ways. These are referred to as Joint Electorate Actions. For so long as the Equalisation Ratio remains 1:1, each BHP Group Limited ordinary share will e/ffectively have the same voting rights as each BHP Group Plc ordinary share on Joint Electorate Actions.\n\nA Joint Electorate Action requires approval by ordinary resolution (or special resolution if required by statute, regulation, applicable listing rules or other applicable requirements) of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc. In the case of BHP Group Limited, both the BHP Group Limited ordinary shareholders and the holder of the BHP Group Limited Special Voting Share vote as a single class and, in the case of BHP Group Plc, the BHP Group Plc ordinary shareholders and the holder of the BHP Group Plc Special Voting Share vote as a single class.\n\n## Class Rights Actions\n\nMatters on which ordinary shareholders of BHP Group Limited may have divergent interests from the ordinary shareholders of BHP Group Plc are referred to as Class Rights Actions. The company wishing to carry out the Class Rights Action requires the prior approval of the ordinary shareholders in the other company voting separately and, where appropriate, the approval of its own ordinary shareholders voting separately. Depending on the type of Class Rights Action undertaken, the approval required is either an ordinary or special resolution of the relevant company.\n\nThe Joint Electorate Action and Class Rights Action voting arrangements are secured through the constitutional documents of the two companies, the DLC Structure Sharing Agreement, the BHP Special Voting Shares Deed and rights attaching to a specially created Special Voting Share issued by each company and held in each case by a special voting company. The shares in the special voting companies are held legally and/uni00A0bene/f.shorticially by Law Debenture Trust Corporation Plc.\n\n## Cross guarantees\n\nBHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc have each executed a Deed Poll Guarantee in favour of the creditors of the other company. Under the Deed Poll Guarantees, each company has guaranteed certain contractual obligations of the other company. This means that creditors entitled to the bene/f.shortit of the BHP Group Limited Deed Poll Guarantee and the BHP Group Plc Deed Poll Guarantee will, to the extent possible, be placed in the same position as if the relevant debts were owed by both BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc on a combined basis.",

        "page_content": "## Restrictions on takeovers of one company only\n\nThe BHP Group Limited Constitution and the BHP Group Plc Articles of Association have been drafted to ensure that, except with the consent of the Board, a person cannot gain control of one company without having made an equivalent o/ffer to the ordinary shareholders of both companies on equivalent terms. Sanctions for breach of these provisions would include withholding of dividends, voting restrictions and the compulsory divestment of shares to the extent a shareholder and its associates exceed the relevant threshold.\n\n## 4.10.4  Material contracts\n\n## DLC structure agreements\n\nBHP Group Limited (then known as BHP Limited) and BHP Group Plc (then known as Billiton Plc) merged by way of a DLC structure on 29 June 2001. To e/ffect the DLC structure, BHP Limited and Billiton Plc (as they were then known) entered into the following contractual agreements:\n\n- -  BHP Billiton DLC Structure Sharing Agreement\n- -  BHP Billiton Special Voting Shares Deed\n- -  BHP Billiton Limited Deed Poll Guarantee\n- -  BHP Billiton Plc Deed Poll Guarantee\n\nFor information on the e/ffect of each of these agreements, refer to section/uni00A04.10.3.\n\n## Framework Agreement\n\nOn 2 March 2016, BHP Brasil together with Vale and Samarco, entered into a Framework Agreement with the Federal Government of Brazil, states of Esp\u00edrito Santo and Minas Gerais and certain other authorities to establish a foundation (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova) that will develop and execute environmental and socio-economic programs to remediate and provide compensation for damage caused by the Samarco dam failure. For a description of the terms of the Framework Agreement, refer to section/uni00A04.9.\n\n## 4.10.5  Constitution\n\nThis section sets out a summary of the Constitution of BHP Group Limited and the Articles of Association of BHP Group Plc. Where the term 'BHP' is used in this section, it can mean either BHP Group Limited or BHP Group Plc.\n\nProvisions of the Constitution of BHP Group Limited and the Articles of Association of BHP Group Plc can be amended only where such amendment is approved by special resolution either:\n\n- -  by approval as a Class Rights Action, where the amendment results in/uni00A0a/uni00A0change to an 'Entrenched Provision', or\n- -  otherwise, as a Joint Electorate Action\n\nIn 2015, shareholders approved a number of amendments to our constitutional documents to amend the terms of the Equalisation Shares (which were renamed as DLC Dividend Shares) and to facilitate the more streamlined conduct of simultaneous general meetings.\n\nFor a description of Joint Electorate Actions and Class Rights Actions, refer/uni00A0to 'DLC structure' in section 4.10.3.\n\n## Directors\n\nThe Board may exercise all powers of BHP, other than those that are reserved for BHP shareholders to exercise in a general meeting.\n\n## Power to issue securities\n\nUnder the Constitution and Articles of Association, the Board of Directors has the power to issue any BHP shares or other securities (including redeemable shares) with preferred, deferred or other special rights, obligations or restrictions. The Board may issue shares on any terms it/uni00A0considers appropriate, provided that:\n\n- -  the issue does not a/ffect any special rights of shareholders\n- -  if required, the issue is approved by shareholders\n- -  if the issue is of a class other than ordinary shares, the rights attaching/uni00A0to the class are expressed at the date of issue\n\n## Restrictions on voting by Directors\n\nA Director may not vote in respect of any contract or arrangement or any other proposal in which they have a material personal interest except in\n\n2\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncertain prescribed circumstances, including (subject to applicable laws) where the material personal interest:\n\n- -  arises because the Director is a shareholder of BHP and is held in common with the other shareholders of BHP\n- -  arises in relation to the Director's remuneration as a Director of BHP\n- -  relates to a contract BHP is proposing to enter into that is subject to approval by the shareholders and will not impose any obligation on BHP/uni00A0if it is not approved by the shareholders\n- -  arises merely because the Director is a guarantor or has given an indemnity or security for all or part of a loan, or proposed loan, to BHP\n- -  arises merely because the Director has a right of subrogation in relation to a guarantee or indemnity referred to above\n- -  relates to a contract that insures, or would insure, the Director against liabilities the Director incurs as an o/ff.shorticer of BHP, but only if the contract does not make BHP or a related body corporate the insurer\n- -  relates to any payment by BHP or a related body corporate in respect of an indemnity permitted by law, or any contract relating to such an indemnity, or\n- -  is in a contract, or proposed contract with, or for the bene/f.shortit of, or on/uni00A0behalf of, a related body corporate and arises merely because the/uni00A0Director is a director of a related body corporate\n\nIf a Director has a material personal interest and is not entitled to vote on a proposal, they will not be counted in the quorum for any vote on a/uni00A0resolution concerning the material personal interest.\n\nIn addition, under the UK Companies Act 2006, a Director has a duty to avoid con/f.shortlicts of interest between their interests and the interests of the company. The duty is not breached if, among other things, the con/f.shortlict of interest is authorised by non-interested Directors. The Articles of Association of BHP Group Plc enable the Board to authorise a matter that might otherwise involve a Director breaching their duty to avoid con/f.shortlicts of interest. An interested Director may not vote or be counted towards a quorum for a resolution authorising a con/f.shortlict of interest. Where the Board authorises a con/f.shortlict of interest, the Board may prohibit the relevant Director from voting on any matter relating to the con/f.shortlict. The Board has adopted procedures to/uni00A0manage these voting restrictions.\n\n## Loans by Directors\n\nAny Director may lend money to BHP at interest with or without security or may, for a commission or pro/f.shortit, guarantee the repayment of any money borrowed by BHP and underwrite or guarantee the subscription of shares or securities of BHP or of any corporation in which BHP may be interested without being disquali/f.shortied as a Director and without being liable to account to BHP for any commission or pro/f.shortit.\n\n## Appointment and retirement of Directors\n\n## Appointment of Directors\n\nThe Constitution and Articles of Association provide that a person may be appointed as a Director of BHP by the existing Directors of BHP or may be elected by the shareholders in a general meeting.\n\nAny person appointed as a Director of BHP by the existing Directors will hold o/ff.shortice only until the next general meeting that includes an election of Directors.\n\nA person may be nominated by shareholders as a Director of BHP if:\n\n- -  a shareholder provides a valid written notice of the nomination\n- -  the person nominated by the shareholder satis/f.shorties candidature for the o/ff.shortice and consents in writing to his or her nomination as a Director\n\nin each case, at least 40 business days before the earlier of the date of the general meeting of BHP Group Plc and the corresponding general meeting of BHP Group Limited. The person nominated as a Director may be elected to the Board by ordinary resolution passed in a general meeting.\n\nUnder the Articles of Association, if a person is validly nominated for election as a Director at a general meeting of BHP Group Limited, the Directors of BHP Group Plc must nominate that person as a Director at the corresponding general meeting of BHP Group Plc. An equivalent requirement is included in the Constitution, which requires any person validly nominated for election as a Director of BHP Group Plc to be nominated as a Director of BHP Group Limited.",

        "page_content": "## 4.10  Shareholder information continued\n\n## Retirement of Directors\n\nThe Board has a policy consistent with the UK Corporate Governance Code under which all Directors must, if they wish to remain on the Board, seek re-election by shareholders annually. This policy took e/ffect from the 2011 Annual General Meetings (AGMs) and replaced the previous system that required Directors to submit themselves to shareholders for re-election at least every three years.\n\nA Director may be removed by BHP in accordance with applicable law and must vacate his or her o/ff.shortice as a Director in certain circumstances set out in the Constitution and Articles of Association. There is no requirement for a Director to retire on reaching a certain age.\n\n## Rights attaching to shares Dividend rights\n\nUnder English law, dividends on shares may only be paid out of pro/f.shortits available for distribution. Under Australian law, dividends on shares may be paid only if the company's assets exceed its liabilities immediately before the dividend is determined and the excess is su/ff.shorticient for payment of the dividend, the payment of the dividend is fair and reasonable to the company's shareholders as a whole and the payment of the dividend does not materially prejudice the company's ability to pay its creditors.\n\nThe Constitution and Articles of Association provide that payment of any dividend may be made in any manner, by any means and in any currency determined by the Board.\n\nAll unclaimed dividends may be invested or otherwise used by the Board for the bene/f.shortit of whichever of BHP Group Limited or BHP Group Plc determined that dividend, until claimed or, in the case of BHP Group Limited, otherwise disposed of according to law. BHP Group Limited is governed by the Victorian unclaimed monies legislation, which requires BHP Group Limited to pay to the State Revenue O/ff.shortice any unclaimed dividend payments of A$20 or more that have remained unclaimed for over 12 months.\n\nIn the case of BHP Group Plc, any dividend unclaimed after a period of 12 years from the date the dividend was determined or became due for payment will be forfeited and returned to BHP Group Plc.\n\n## Voting rights\n\nGenerally, matters considered by shareholders at an AGM of BHP Group Limited or BHP Group Plc constitute Joint Electorate Actions or Class Rights Actions and must be decided on a poll and in the manner described under the headings 'Joint Electorate Actions' and 'Class Rights Actions' in 'DLC structure' in section 4.10.3.\n\nThis means that, in practice, most items of business at AGMs are decided by way of a poll even though the Constitution and Articles of Association generally permit voting to be conducted by a show of hands in the /f.shortirst instance.\n\nIn addition, at any general meeting, a resolution, other than a procedural resolution, put to the vote of the meeting on which the holder of the relevant BHP Special Voting Share is entitled to vote must be decided on a poll.\n\nFor the purposes of determining which shareholders are entitled to attend or vote at a meeting of BHP Group Plc or BHP Group Limited, and how many votes such shareholder may cast, the Notice of Meeting will specify when a shareholder must be entered on the Register of Shareholders in order to have the right to attend or vote at the meeting. The speci/f.shortied time must be not more than 48 hours before the time of the meeting.\n\nShareholders who wish to appoint a proxy to attend, vote or speak at a meeting of BHP Group Plc or BHP Group Limited (as appropriate) on their behalf must deposit the relevant form appointing a proxy so that it is received by that company not less than 48 hours before the time of the meeting.\n\n## Rights to share in BHP Group Limited's pro/f.shortits\n\nThe rights attached to the ordinary shares of BHP Group Limited, as regards the participation in the pro/f.shortits available for distribution that the Board determines to distribute, are as follows:\n\n- -  The holders of any preference shares will be entitled, in priority to any payment of dividend to the holders of any other class of shares, to a preferred right to participate as regards dividends up to but not beyond a speci/f.shortied amount in distribution.\n\n- -  Subject to the special rights attaching to any preference shares, but in priority to any payment of dividends on all other classes of shares, the holder of the DLC Dividend Share (if any) will be entitled to be paid such non-cumulative dividends as the Board may, subject to the cap referred to in 'DLC structure' in section 4.10.3 and the DLC Dividend Share being held by BHP Group Plc or a wholly owned member of its group, decide to pay on that DLC Dividend Share.\n- -  Any surplus remaining after payment of the distributions above will be payable to the holders of BHP Group Limited ordinary shares and the BHP Group Limited Special Voting Share in equal amounts per share.\n\n## Rights to share in BHP Group Plc's pro/f.shortits\n\nThe rights attached to the ordinary shares of BHP Group Plc, in relation to the participation in the pro/f.shortits available for distribution that the Board determines to distribute, are as follows:\n\n- -  The holders of the cumulative preference shares will be entitled, in priority to any payment of dividend to the holders of any other class of shares, to be paid a /f.shortixed cumulative preferential dividend (Preferential Dividend) at a rate of 5.5 per cent per annum, to be paid annually in arrears on 31 July in each year or, if any such date will be a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday in England, on the /f.shortirst business day following such date in each year. Payments of Preferential Dividends will be made to holders on the register at any date selected by the Directors up to 42 days prior to the relevant /f.short ixed dividend date.\n- -  Subject to the rights attaching to the cumulative preference shares, but in priority to any payment of dividends on all other classes of shares, the holder of the BHP Group Plc Special Voting Share will be entitled to be paid a /f.shortixed dividend of US$0.01 per annum, payable annually in arrears on 31 July.\n- -  Subject to the rights attaching to the cumulative preference shares and the BHP Group Plc Special Voting Share, but in priority to any payment of dividends on all other classes of shares, the holder of the DLC Dividend Share will be entitled to be paid such non-cumulative dividends as the Board may, subject to the cap referred to in 'DLC structure' in section 4.10.3 and the DLC Dividend Share being held by BHP Group Limited or a wholly owned member of its group, decide to pay on that DLC Dividend Share.\n- -  Any surplus remaining after payment of the distributions above will be payable to the holders of the BHP Group Plc ordinary shares in equal amounts per BHP Group Plc ordinary share.\n\n## DLC Dividend Share\n\nAs set out in 'DLC structure' in section 4.10.3, each of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc is authorised to issue a DLC Dividend Share to the other company or a wholly owned subsidiary of it.\n\nThe dividend rights attaching to a DLC Dividend Share are described above and in 'DLC structure' in section 4.10.3. The DLC Dividend Share issued by BHP Group Limited (BHP Group Limited DLC Dividend Share) and the DLC Dividend Share that may be issued by BHP Group Plc (BHP Group Plc DLC Dividend Share) have no voting rights and, as set out in 'Rights on return of assets on liquidation' below, very limited rights to a return of capital on a winding-up. A DLC Dividend Share may be redeemed at any time, and must be redeemed if a person other than:\n\n- -  in the case of the BHP Group Limited DLC Dividend Share, BHP Group Plc or a wholly owned member of its group\n- -  in the case of the BHP Group Plc DLC Dividend Share, BHP Group Limited or a wholly owned member of its group\n\nbecomes the bene/f.shorticial owner of the DLC Dividend Share.\n\n## Rights on return of assets on liquidation\n\nUnder the DLC structure, there are special provisions designed to ensure that, as far as practicable, the holders of ordinary shares in BHP Group Limited and holders of ordinary shares in BHP Group Plc are treated equitably having regard to the Equalisation Ratio. These special provisions would apply in the event of an insolvency of either or both companies.\n\nOn a return of assets on liquidation of BHP Group Limited, the assets of BHP Group Limited remaining available for distribution among shareholders after the payment of all prior ranking amounts owed to all creditors and holders of preference shares, and to all prior ranking statutory entitlements, are to be applied subject to the special provisions",

BHP has a lien on every partly paid share for all amounts payable in respect of that share. Each shareholder is liable to pay the amount of each call in the manner, at the time and at the place speci/f.shortied by the Board (subject to receiving at least 14 days' notice specifying the time and place for payment). A call is considered to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Board authorising the call was passed.\n\n## Borrowing powers\n\nSubject to relevant law, the Directors may exercise all powers of BHP to borrow money, and to mortgage or charge its undertaking, property, assets (both present and future) and all uncalled capital or any part or parts thereof and to issue debentures and other securities, whether outright or as collateral security for any debt, liability or obligation of BHP or of any third party.\n\nRights attached to any class of shares issued by either BHP Group Limited or BHP Group Plc can only be varied (whether as a Joint Electorate Action or a Class Rights Action) where such variation is approved by:\n\n- -  the company that issued the relevant shares, as a special resolution\n- -  the holders of the issued shares of the a/ffected class, either by a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the issued shares of the class a/ffected, or with the written consent of members with at least 75 per cent of the votes of that class\n\n2\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Annual General Meetings\n\nThe AGMs provide a forum to facilitate the sharing of shareholder views and are important events in the BHP calendar. These meetings provide an update for shareholders on our performance and o/ffer an opportunity for shareholders to ask questions and vote. To vote at an AGM, a shareholder must be a registered holder of BHP Group Limited shares (in the case of the AGM of BHP Group Limited) or a registered holder of BHP Group Plc shares (in the case of the AGM of BHP Group Plc) at a designated time before the relevant AGM.\n\nKey members of management, including the CEO and CFO, are present and available to answer questions. The External Auditor will also be available to answer questions.\n\nProceedings at shareholder meetings are webcast live from our website. Copies of the speeches delivered by the Chair and CEO to the AGMs are released to the relevant stock exchanges and posted on our website. The outcome of voting on the items of business are released to the relevant stock exchanges and posted on our website as soon as they are available following completion of the BHP Group Limited AGM and /f.short inalisation of the polls.\n\nMore information on our AGMs is available at bhp.com/meetings.\n\n## Conditions governing general meetings\n\nThe Board may, and must on requisition in accordance with applicable laws, call a general meeting of the shareholders at the time and place or places and in the manner determined by the Board. No shareholder may convene a general meeting of BHP except where entitled under law to do so. Any Director may convene a general meeting whenever the Director thinks /f.short it. General meetings can also be cancelled, postponed or adjourned, where permitted by law or the Constitution or Articles of Association. Notice of a general meeting must be given to each shareholder entitled to vote at the meeting and such notice of meeting must be given in the form and manner in which the Board thinks /f.shortit subject to any applicable law. Five shareholders of the relevant company present in person or by proxy constitute a quorum for a meeting. A shareholder who is entitled to attend and cast a vote at a general meeting of BHP may appoint a person as a proxy to attend and vote for the shareholder in accordance with applicable law. All provisions relating to general meetings apply with any necessary modi/f.shortications to any special meeting of any class of shareholders that may be held.\n\n## Limitations of rights to own securities\n\nThere are no limitations under the Constitution or the Articles of Association restricting the right to own BHP shares or other securities other than restrictions that re/f.shortlect the takeovers codes under relevant Australian and English law. In addition, the Australian Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 imposes a number of conditions that restrict foreign ownership of Australian-based companies.\n\nFor information on share control limits imposed by the Constitution and the Articles of Association, as well as relevant laws, refer to sections 4.10.9 and 'DLC structure' in section 4.10.3.\n\n## Documents on display\n\nDocuments /f.shortiled by BHP Group Limited on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) are available at asx.com.au and documents /f.shortiled on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) by BHP Group Plc are available at https://data. fca.org.uk/#/nsm/nationalstoragemechanism.

For information on Underlying attributable pro/f.shortit for FY2021, refer to section 1.8.1.\n\nThe Board will assess, at every reporting period, the ability to pay amounts additional to the minimum payment, in accordance with the Capital Allocation Framework, as described in section 1.6.\n\nIn FY2021, we determined our dividends and other distributions in US dollars as it is our main functional currency. BHP Group Limited paid its dividends in Australian dollars, UK pounds sterling, New Zealand dollars and US dollars. BHP Group Plc paid its dividends in UK pounds sterling (or US dollars, if elected) to shareholders registered on its principal register in the United Kingdom and in South African rand to shareholders registered on its branch register in South Africa.\n\nCurrency conversions are based on foreign currency exchange rates on a single day or an average for a period of days ending on or before the dividend record date. Di/fferent periods are used for each currency, based on the size of the dividend and each currency's liquidity and market dynamics.\n\nSetting currency conversion rates based on a single day or over a range of days helps to reduce the Group's exposure to movements in exchange rates, while optimising currency market liquidity to accommodate potential larger dividend currency requirements.\n\n## Payments\n\nBHP Group Limited shareholders may currently have their cash dividends paid directly into their bank account in Australian dollars, UK pounds sterling, New Zealand dollars or US dollars, provided they have submitted direct credit details and if required, a valid currency election nominating a /f.short inancial institution to the BHP Share Registrar in Australia no later than close of business on the dividend reinvestment plan election date. BHP Group Limited shareholders who do not provide their direct credit details will receive dividend payments by way of a cheque in Australian dollars.\n\nBHP Group Plc shareholders on the UK register who wish to receive their dividends in US dollars must complete the appropriate election form and return it to the BHP Share Registrar in the United Kingdom no later than close of business on the dividend reinvestment plan election date. BHP Group Plc shareholders may have their cash dividends paid directly into a bank or building society by completing a dividend mandate form, which is available from the BHP Share Registrar in the United Kingdom or South Africa.\n\n## Dividend reinvestment plan\n\nBHP o/ffers a dividend reinvestment plan to registered shareholders, which provides the opportunity to use cash dividends to purchase BHP shares in the market.\n\n## 4.10.8  American Depositary Receipts fees and charges\n\nWe have American Depositary Receipts (ADR) programs for BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc. Both of the ADR programs have a 2:1 ordinary shares to American Depositary Share (ADS) ratio.\n\n## Depositary fees\n\nCitibank serves as the depositary bank for both of our ADR programs. ADR holders agree to the terms in the deposit agreement /f.shortiled with the SEC for depositing ADSs or surrendering the ADSs for cancellation and for certain services as provided by Citibank. Holders are required to pay all fees for general depositary services provided by Citibank in each of our ADR programs, as set forth in the tables below.\n\n## Standard depositary fees:\n\n| Depositary service                                          | Fee payable by the ADR holders                                       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Issuance of ADSs upon deposit of/uni00A0shares              | Up to US$5.00 per 100 ADSs  (or/uni00A0fraction thereof) issued      |\n| Delivery of Deposited Securities against  surrender of ADSs | Up to US$5.00 per 100 ADSs  (or/uni00A0fraction thereof) surrendered |\n| Distribution of Cash Distributions                          | No fee                                                               |\n\n## Corporate actions depositary fees:\n\n| Depositary service                                                                                                           | Fee payable by the ADR holders                                |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Cash Distributions (i.e. sale of/uni00A0rights,  other/uni00A0entitlements, return/uni00A0of capital)                        | Up to US$2.00 per 100 ADSs  (or/uni00A0fraction thereof) held |\n| Distribution of ADSs pursuant to exercise  of rights to purchase additional ADSs.

        "page_content": "## 4.10.9  Government regulations\n\nOur assets are subject to a broad range of laws and regulations imposed by governments and regulatory bodies. These regulations touch all aspects of our assets, including how we extract, process and explore for minerals, oil and natural gas and how we conduct our business, including regulations governing matters such as environmental protection, land rehabilitation, occupational health and safety, human rights, the rights and interests of Indigenous peoples, competition, foreign investment, export, marketing of/uni00A0minerals, oil and natural gas and taxes.\n\nThe ability to extract and process minerals, oil and natural gas is fundamental to BHP. In most jurisdictions, the rights to extract mineral or petroleum deposits are owned by the government. We obtain the right to access the land and extract the product by entering into licences or leases with the government that owns the mineral, oil or natural gas deposit. We also rely on governments to grant the rights necessary to transport and treat the extracted material to prepare it for sale. The terms of the lease or licence, including the time period of the lease or licence, vary depending on the laws of the relevant government or terms negotiated with the relevant government. Generally, we own the product we extract and we are required to pay royalties or other taxes to the government.\n\nThe rights to explore for minerals, oil and natural gas are granted to us by the government that owns the natural resources we wish to explore. Usually, the right to explore carries with it the obligation to spend a de/f.shortined amount of money on the exploration, or to undertake particular exploration activities.\n\nIn certain jurisdictions where we have assets, such as Trinidad and Tobago, a production sharing contract (PSC) governs the relationship between the government and companies concerning how much of the oil and gas extracted from the country each party will receive. In PSCs, the government awards rights for the execution of exploration, development and production activities to the company. The company bears the /f.shortinancial risk of the initiative and explores, develops and ultimately produces the /f.shortield as required. When successful, the company is permitted to use the money from a certain set percentage of produced oil and gas to recover its capital and operational expenditures, known as 'cost oil'. The remaining production is known as 'pro/f.shortit oil' and is split between the government and the company at a rate determined by the government and set out in the PSC.\n\nEnvironmental protection, mine closure and land rehabilitation, and occupational health and safety are principally regulated by governments and to a lesser degree, if applicable, by leases. These obligations often require us to make substantial expenditures to minimise or remediate the environmental impact of our assets and to ensure the safety of our employees and contractors and the communities where we operate. Regulations setting emissions standards for fuels used to power vehicles and equipment at our assets and the modes of transport used in our supply\n\n2\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nchains can also have a substantial impact, both directly and indirectly, on the markets for these products, with /f.shortlow-on impacts on our costs. For more information on these types of obligations, refer to section 1.13.\n\nThe Western Australia Government is currently progressing the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Bill 2020 (ACH Bill), which, if passed into law, is expected to strengthen the government's authority to regulate land use including mining activities, and the consultation process in relation to Aboriginal cultural heritage sites in Western Australia. For more information, refer to section 1.13.10.\n\nFrom time to time, certain trade sanctions are adopted by the United Nations (UN) Security Council and/or various governments, including in the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union (EU), China and Australia against certain countries, entities or individuals, that may restrict our ability to sell extracted minerals, oil or natural gas to, and/or our ability to purchase goods or services from, these countries, entities or individuals.\n\n## Disclosure of Iran-related activities pursuant to/uni00A0section/uni00A013(r) of the US Securities Exchange Act of/uni00A01934\n\nSection 13(r) of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual reports whether it or any of its a/ff.shortiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran. If applicable, disclosure is required/uni00A0even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted/uni00A0outside the United States by non-U.S. persons in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law. Provided in this section is certain information concerning activities of certain a/ff.shortiliates of BHP that took place in FY2021. BHP believes/uni00A0that these activities are not sanctionable either as being outside the scope of U.S. sanctions, or within the scope of a speci/f.shortic licence issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's O/ff.shortice of Foreign/uni00A0Assets Control (OFAC).\n\nOn 30 November 2018, BHP Billiton Petroleum Great Britain Ltd (BHP GB), a wholly owned subsidiary of BHP, and its co-venturers in the Bruce and Keith gas and oil /f.shortields o/ffshore United Kingdom (BP Exploration Operating Company (BP), Marubeni Oil & Gas (UK) Limited (Marubeni) and/uni00A0Total E&P UK Limited (Total)) completed the sale of their interests in the Bruce and Keith gas and oil /f.shortields to Serica Energy (UK) Limited (Serica)/uni00A0(the Bruce and Keith Transaction). BHP divested its entire licence interests in Bruce and Keith but retained the obligation to fund decommissioning in accordance with its previous licence interest.\n\nThe transfer of licence interests and retention of decommissioning liabilities for the Bruce and Keith co-venturers in the respective gas and/uni00A0oil/uni00A0/f.shortields is described below:\n\n|          | Bruce                | Bruce                           | Bruce                         | Keith                 | Keith                          | Keith                          |\n|----------|----------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|          | Pre-sale interest  % | Post-sale licence  interest   % | Post-sale  decom. interest  % | Pre-sale interest   % | Post-sale licence  interest  % | Post-sale  decom. interest   % |\n| BP       | 37                   | 1                               | 37                            | 34.83                 | 0                              | 34.83                          |\n| Total    | 43.25                | 1                               | 43.25                         | 25                    | 0                              | 25                             |\n| BHP GB   | 16                   | 0                               | 16                            | 31.83                 | 0                              | 31.83                          |\n| Marubeni | 3.65                 | 0                               | 0                             | 8.33                  | 0                              | 0                              |\n| Serica   | 0                    | 98                              | 3.75                          | 0                     | 100                            | 8.33                           |",

        "page_content": "## 4.10  Shareholder information continued\n\nWhile the sale closed on 30 November 2018, it was e/ffective in economic terms as of 1 January 2018. In addition to initial cash consideration received from Serica at completion, BHP subsequently received, and will continue to receive:\n\n- -  a share of pre-tax net cash /f.shortlow attributable to its historic interest in the Bruce and Keith gas and oil /f.shortields of 60 per cent during December 2018, 50 per cent in CY2019 and 40 per cent in each of CY2020 and CY2021 under a Net Cash Flow Sharing Deed; and\n- -  a share of projected decommissioning costs up to a speci/f.shortied cap\n\nThe Bruce platform provides transportation and processing services to the nearby Rhum gas /f.shortield pursuant to a contract between the Bruce owners and Rhum owners (the Bruce-Rhum Agreement). At the same time as the Bruce and Keith Transaction, Serica acquired from BP its 50 per cent interest and operatorship of the Rhum gas /f.shortield. The Rhum gas /f.shortield is now owned by a 50:50 unincorporated joint venture arrangement between Serica and Iranian Oil Company (UK) Limited (IOC). IOC is an indirect subsidiary of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), which is a corporation owned by the Government of Iran.\n\nOFAC issued licence No. IA/hyphen.uc2018/hyphen.uc352294/hyphen.uc2 (the OFAC Licence) authorising BP, Serica and all U.S. persons and U.S.-owned or controlled foreign entities identi/f.shortied in the licence application to provide goods, services and support for the operation, maintenance and production of the Rhum gas /f.shortield, and goods, services and support to the Bruce platform for a period from 2 November 2018 through 31 October 2019. On 22 October 2019, OFAC renewed this licence through to 28 February 2021, and on 19 January 2021, OFAC renewed the license through to 31 January 2023. OFAC also provided an assurance that non-U.S. persons would not be exposed to U.S. secondary sanctions for engaging in these activities and transactions involving Rhum or the Bruce platform, namely providing goods, services, and support to the Rhum /f.shortield.\n\nBHP continues to monitor developments concerning U.S. sanctions with respect to Iran to maintain compliance with applicable sanctions laws and requirements. Although BHP has no ongoing direct dealings with any Iranian party, because BHP will receive ongoing consideration from Serica related to the/uni00A0sale of its interest in the Bruce-Rhum Agreement, BHP has included this disclosure.\n\nBHP recognised the following transactions in FY2021 related to the BruceRhum Agreement. For the period 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021, BHP received US$2.2 million from Serica under the Net Cash Flow Sharing Deed.\n\n## Uranium production in Australia\n\nTo mine, process, transport and sell uranium from within Australia, we are required to hold possession and export permissions, which are also subject to regulation by the Australian Government or bodies that report to the Australian Government.\n\nTo possess nuclear material, such as uranium, in Australia, a Permit to Possess Nuclear Materials (Possession Permit) must be held pursuant to the Australian Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 (Non-Proliferation Act). A Possession Permit is issued by the Australian Minister for Foreign A/ffairs. Compliance with the Non-Proliferation Act is monitored by the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation O/ff.shortice, an o/ff.shortice established under the Non-Proliferation Act, which administers Australia's domestic nuclear safeguards requirements and reports to the Australian Government.\n\nTo export uranium from Australia, a Permit to Export Natural Uranium (Export Permit) must be held pursuant to the Australian Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958. The Export Permit is issued by the/uni00A0Minister with responsibility for Resources and Energy.\n\nA special permit to transport nuclear material is required under the Non-Proliferation Act by a party that transports nuclear material from one speci/f.shortied location to another speci/f.shortied location. Each of the service providers we engage to transport uranium is required to hold a permit to transport nuclear material issued by the Australian Safeguards and NonProliferation O/ff.shortice.\n\n## Shareholding limits\n\n## BHP Group Plc\n\nThere are no laws or regulations currently in force in the United Kingdom that restrict the export or import of capital or the payment of dividends to non-resident holders of BHP Group Plc's shares, although the Group does operate in some other jurisdictions where the payment of dividends could be a/ffected by exchange control approvals.\n\nFrom time to time, certain sanctions are adopted by the UN Security Council and/or various governments, including in the United Kingdom, the United States, the EU and Australia against certain countries, entities or individuals that may restrict the export or import of capital or the remittance of dividends to certain non-resident holders of BHP Group Plc's shares.\n\nThere are no restrictions under BHP Group Plc's Articles of Association or (subject to the e/ffect of any sanctions) under English law that limit the right of non-resident or foreign owners to hold or vote BHP Group Plc's shares.\n\nThere are certain restrictions on shareholding levels under BHP Group Plc's Articles of Association described below.\n\n## BHP Group Limited\n\nUnder current Australian legislation, the payment of any dividends, interest or other payments by BHP Group Limited to non-resident holders of BHP Group Limited's shares is not restricted by exchange controls or other limitations, except that, in certain circumstances, BHP Group Limited may be required to withhold Australian taxes.\n\nFrom time to time, certain sanctions are adopted by the UN Security Council and/or various governments, including in the United Kingdom, the United States, the EU and Australia. Those sanctions prohibit or, in some cases, impose certain approval and reporting requirements on transactions involving sanctioned countries, entities and individuals and/or assets controlled or owned by them. Certain transfers into or out of Australia of amounts greater than A$10,000 in any currency may also be subject to reporting requirements.\n\nThe Australian Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (the FATA) restricts certain acquisitions of interests in securities in Australian companies, including BHP Group Limited. Generally, under the FATA, the prior approval of the Australian Treasurer must be obtained for proposals by a foreign person (either alone or together with its associates) to acquire 20 per cent or more of the voting power or issued securities in an Australian company. Lower approval thresholds apply in certain circumstances, including for acquisitions by a foreign government investor of voting power or issued securities in an Australian company.\n\nThe FATA also empowers the Treasurer to make certain orders prohibiting acquisitions by foreign persons in Australian companies, including BHP Group Limited (and requiring divestiture if the acquisition has occurred) where the Treasurer considers the acquisition to be contrary to national security or the national interest. Such orders may also be made in respect of acquisitions by foreign persons where two or more foreign persons (and their associates) in aggregate already control 40 per cent or more of the issued securities or voting power in an Australian company, including BHP Group Limited.\n\nThe restrictions in the FATA on acquisitions of securities in BHP Group Limited described above apply equally to acquisitions of securities in BHP Group Plc because BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc are dual listed entities.\n\nExcept for the restrictions under the FATA, there are no limitations, either under Australian law or under the Constitution of BHP Group Limited, on the right of non-residents to hold or vote BHP Group Limited ordinary shares.",

A Proved Ore Reserve implies a high degree of con/f.shortidence in the Modifying Factors. A Proved Ore Reserve represents the highest con/f.shortidence category of reserve estimate and implies a high degree of con/f.shortidence in geological and grade continuity, and the consideration of the Modifying Factors. The style of mineralisation or other factors could mean that Proved Ore Reserves are not achievable in some deposits (JORC Code, 2012 Edition).\n\n## Quali/f.shortied petroleum reserves and resources/uni00A0evaluator\n\nA quali/f.shortied petroleum reserves and resources evaluator, as de/f.shortined in Chapter 19 of the ASX Listing Rules.\n\n## Reserve Life\n\nCurrent stated Ore Reserves estimate divided by the current approved nominated production rate as at the end of the /f.shortinancial year.\n\n## ROM (run of mine)\n\nRun of mine product mined in the course of regular mining activities.
