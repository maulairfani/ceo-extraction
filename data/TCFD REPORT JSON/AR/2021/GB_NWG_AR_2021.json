        "page_content": "## Financial performance\n\n## Financial strength enables our purpose\n\nWe have delivered a strong operating performance in 2021. Group RoTE was 9.4%, benefiting from a \u00a31.3 billion net impairment release. We achieved our Group cost reduction target of 4.0% and lending growth across our UK and RBSI retail and commercial businesses was 2.6%, excluding UK Government financial support schemes. Our capital and liquidity position remains strong after returning \u00a33.8 billion to shareholders, and default levels have remained low across all our portfolios. The CET1 ratio was 18.2%, reducing to 15.9% on 1 January 2022 following regulatory RWA and capital changes. We have made good progress on our phased withdrawal from the Republic of Ireland and will focus the financial commentary below on the Group excluding Ulster Bank RoI (Go-forward group).\n\nTotal income, excluding notable items, in the Go-forward group was 5.6% lower than prior year. Across the UK and RBSI retail and commercial businesses income increased by 1.4% reflecting strong balance sheet growth, principally in our mortgage book. NWM income was below expectations, down by 61.5%, compared with 2020, reflecting continued weakness in Fixed Income, impacted by subdued levels of customer activity and ongoing reshaping of the business, and exceptional levels of market activity in the prior year.\n\nWe delivered a cost reduction of \u00a3256 million, or 4.0%, in 2021, in line with our target for the year (1) . This has been achieved by transformation across our customer journeys and NWM business, in line with the strategic announcement made in February 2020 and a \u00a368 million reduction in the bank levy charge. Strategic costs of \u00a3787 million included \u00a3237 million in NWM related to transformation, \u00a3124 million of redundancy charges, \u00a388 million of technology spend, and an \u00a385 million goodwill impairment.\n\nA net impairment release of \u00a31,278 million reflects the low levels of realised losses we have seen across the year. Total impairment\n\nprovisions reduced by \u00a32.4 billion to \u00a33.8 billion during 2021 and as a result ECL coverage ratio decreased from 1.66% to 1.03%.\n\nWe are pleased to report a 2021 attributable profit of \u00a32,950 million, with earnings per share of 25.4 pence and a RoTE of 9.4%. A final dividend of 7.5 pence per share is proposed, bringing our total 2021 paid and proposed capital distributions to \u00a33.8 billion through a combination of ordinary dividends, directed buybacks of the UK Government stake and our on-market buyback programme.\n\nAcross the UK and RBSI retail and commercial businesses, and excluding UK Government support schemes, net lending increased by 2.6%. Mortgage growth exceeded the market, however commercial lending was behind market as we have sought to reduce certain exposures, through targeted sector reductions and capital actions, whilst continuing to focus on supporting customers through sustainable lending. During the second half of the year we completed \u00a38.1 billion Climate and Sustainable Funding and Financing against our \u00a3100 billion target.\n\nThe CET1 ratio remains strong at 18.2%, or 17.8% excluding IFRS 9 transitional relief. The 30 basis points reduction in the year includes capital distributions of c.240 basis points, partially offset by the reduction in RWAs, c.170 basis points, and the attributable profit net of IFRS 9 transitional relief and other capital movements. RWAs of \u00a3157.0 billion reduced by \u00a313.3 billion in 2021 mainly reflecting business movements in Commercial Banking, including targeted sector reductions, improvement in risk parameters and active capital management.\n\nOn 1 January 2022, the proforma CET1 ratio was 15.9% including the impact of regulatory RWA inflation, 200 basis points, the removal of the software development costs capital benefit, 20 basis points, and the tapering of IFRS 9 transitional relief, 10 basis points. RWAs increased by \u00a318.8 billion, including \u00a314.8 billion associated with mortgage risk weight changes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Operational highlights\n\n|                                                                                                    | 2021    | 2020     | 2019     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|----------|\n| Growth                                                                                             |         |          |          |\n| UK and RBSI retail and commercial businesses net lending excluding   UK Government support schemes | 305.7bn | \u00a3297.9bn | \u00a3289.7bn |\n| Gross new mortgage lending in Retail Banking                                                       | 36.0bn  | \u00a331.5bn  | \u00a333.3bn  |\n| AUM Net New Money (NNM)                                                                            | \u00a33.0bn  | \u00a31.5bn   | \u00a30.6bn   |\n| Percentage of customers using digital channels exclusively to interact with us                     |         |          |          |\n| Retail Banking                                                                                     | 60%     | 58%      | 46%      |\n| Commercial Banking                                                                                 | 83%     | 82%      | 76%      |\n| Simplification                                                                                     |         |          |          |\n| Reduction in other operating expenses                                                              | \u00a3256m   | \u00a3277m    | \u00a3310m    |\n| Artificial intelligence - retail banking Cora conversations                                        | 10.7m   | 8.4m     | 5.4m     |\n| Video banking interactions per week                                                                | 10,200  | 3,300    | <100     |\n| Capital                                                                                            |         |          |          |\n| Directed buyback value                                                                             | \u00a31,125m | -        | -        |\n| On-market buyback value                                                                            | \u00a3676m   | -        | -        |\n| Dividend per share (paid and proposed)                                                             | 10.5p   | 3p       | 14p      |\n| Risk-weighted assets (RWAs)                                                                        | 157.0bn | 170.3bn  | 179.2bn  |\n| CET1 ratio                                                                                         | 18.2%   | 18.5%    | 16.2%    |\n| As at 1 Jan 2022                                                                                   | 15.9%   | -        | -        |\n| Return on tangible equity                                                                          | 9.4%    | (2.4%)   | 9.4%     |\n\nRead more about our strateg/uni0069c pr/uni0069or/uni0069t/uni0069es on pages 18 and 19.\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nAdditional information",

        "page_content": "Chairman's statement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor much of 2021, there was a growing sense of cautious optimism that we might finally have put the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic behind us. However, towards the end of the year, our resilience was put to the test once more as the spread of new variants necessitated the reintroduction of various restrictions.\n\n## Building a purpose-led bank to champion potential\n\nWe champion potential; breaking down barriers and building financial confidence so the 19 million people, families and businesses we serve in communities up and down the country can rebuild and thrive.\n\nHoward Davies Chairman\n\nThat brought particular challenges for our colleagues, our customers and for the bank itself. But it also presented opportunities and NatWest Group's commitment to helping people, families and businesses to thrive has never been more important. We are building from extremely robust foundations as a bank which holds strong market positions, serving 19 million customers throughout the UK.\n\nFor the moment, a number of the key economic indicators remain relatively positive - growth has returned, unemployment is low, and the bank is seeing little in the way of significant defaults among its customers.\n\nHowever, there is no doubt that the rising cost of living is making life difficult for many. It seems certain that inflation will continue to increase in the short term at least - especially as energy prices remain high. And we are yet to see the full impact that the end of government support schemes will have on the employment or housing markets. The uncertainty is not just COVID-19-related, with global, European and domestic political considerations also having an impact.\n\nThe Bank of England's response has been limited so far and while the market is anticipating a continued trajectory of rate rises over the next twelve months, the low interest rate environment is set to persist for some time to come.\n\n'The extensive support that the bank has provided to its customers, colleagues and communities throughout the pandemic was a key focus for the Board in 2021. We also spent a significant amount of time ensuring that the implementation of the bank's strategy and transformation agenda was subject to rigorous oversight and scrutiny.'\n\nAgainst that backdrop, NatWest Group delivered a strong financial performance in 2021, returning to profitability and writing-back some of our pandemic-related impairment provisions as the economic outlook improved. The bank's share price also saw a sharp recovery throughout the year, increasing around 35% and outperforming our UK peers.\n\nAs our economy recovers and is reshaped to reflect new and accelerating trends, we are focused on delivering sustainable growth by creating deeper relationships with our customers and giving them the support they need at every stage of their lives - whether that is buying a house, saving for retirement or setting up and growing their own business.\n\nThe UK banking industry as a whole has held up well during the pandemic, remaining open for business and well capitalised. NatWest Group retains one of the strongest capital ratios among major European banks and we once again comfortably passed the Bank of England's stress test in December 2021, further demonstrating the resilience of our balance sheet to future crises. This, combined with our continued capital generation, means our bank is well placed to support its customers, invest for growth and drive sustainable returns to shareholders.\n\n\u00a33.8 billion shareholder distributions were announced for the financial year 2021, through buybacks - both directed and on-market - and dividends. We also announced that we would distribute at least \u00a31 billion in dividends each year to 2023 as we continue to optimise our capital ratio.\n\nUK Government Investments (UKGI), which manages the government's shareholding, announced three separate transactions during the course of 2021: the directed buyback by NatWest Group; an on-market placement of shares; and an ongoing trading plan. The government stake reduced from 62% at the start of 2021, to less than 53% by the end of the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis was welcome progress. And we may take part in further directed buybacks at the next opportunity, subject to agreement from HM Treasury. Any transaction of this nature could take the government's shareholding below 50% for the first time since the financial crisis. And while that would have little impact on our governance or operations, it would be an important symbolic moment for our bank.\n\nNatWest Group's financial performance has also been reflected in the bonus pool for 2021, which has increased from the previous year, where a significant reduction was made to reflect our COVID-19-related losses. It is important to note, however, that the bonus pool is slightly down on pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIt has been a period of relative stability in terms of Board composition, with no changes to our membership in 2021. As you would expect, we keep the composition, skills and experience of the Board under review, and over the next year or so we will need to recruit new members to cope with planned retirements. In the main, the Board continued to meet virtually throughout 2021. For 2022, we intend to adopt a hybrid calendar with some meetings being held virtually and some meetings in person, subject to relevant government guidelines. Our virtual meeting technology has served us well during the pandemic and we will continue to use it to support the efficient and effective running of the Board.\n\nThe extensive support that the bank has provided to its customers, colleagues and communities throughout the pandemic was a key focus for the Board in 2021. We also spent a significant amount of time scrutinising the implementation of the bank's strategy and transformation agenda as well as enhancing our oversight of the bank's culture.\n\nThe progress that Alison Rose and her strong and capable leadership team have delivered in the last two years has helped to ensure that NatWest Group is well placed to succeed and grow as the needs and expectations of our customers evolve. We are delivering on our purpose, underpinned by our strategic priorities, and as a result, generating long-term growth for our business, playing a positive role in our communities and driving sustainable returns to our shareholders. We know that by championing the potential of the 19 million people, families and businesses we serve, we will help them to thrive. And if they thrive, so will we.\n\nHoward Davies Chairman",

We are a relationship bank for a digital world, building ever deeper and closer connections with our customers throughout their financial lives, enabling people, families and businesses to thrive.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## We champion potential, helping people, families, and businesses to thrive\n\nOur future and our growth are built on this one, clear purpose. It's what drives us, defines us, and guides us. Because getting this right means success - for ourselves and for everyone we serve.\n\nAlison Rose Group Chief Executive Officer\n\nAs I look back on 2021, I'm filled with admiration for the resilience and adaptability that our colleagues and customers have demonstrated during the pandemic. Faced with unprecedented and constantly evolving challenges to the UK's public health and economy, the collective response has been nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nAs it has been throughout the pandemic, the health and well-being of our colleagues and customers continues to be our highest priority. In particular, for the key workers who have remained in our offices and branches to provide the level of service and support our customers have needed to rebuild and thrive.\n\nNatWest Group is the UK's leading business bank. It is also a truly regional bank, serving 19 million customers throughout the UK. We are proud of the role we play and the relationships we already have across every part of the country. And we are well positioned to deepen these relationships and to help our customers, our economy and our bank to grow because of the actions we have taken in recent years.\n\n## Thrive together\n\nIn spite of the difficult economic environment and the pressure this continues to place on people, families and businesses up and down the country, the UK remains an attractive and entrepreneurial market, with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) driving around half of UK turnover and employing 60% of the private sector workforce. It is also an increasingly competitive market, where banks have to maintain their relevance to earn their growth.\n\nAs the economy starts to recover and grow, customers' expectations of banks are changing faster than ever. So too is the way people live and work. Customers want a simple,\n\nengaging experience, designed to anticipate particular needs and reflect their priorities, just as they have in other areas of their lives.\n\nWhen I first took up my role as Chief Executive, we committed to a purpose that guides all of our decision-making - we champion potential, helping people, families and businesses to thrive. We also set out clear areas of strategic focus to deliver on this purpose in order to drive sustainable returns for our shareholders and build sustainable value in our bank. We are executing well against these areas of focus, delivering growth in key areas while controlling costs, better allocating our capital and accelerating our digital transformation.\n\nAs a relationship bank for a digital world, our focus now is on the opportunities we see for future growth. It is a simple principle: if our customers and economy thrive, so will we.\n\nSustainable growth will come from ever closer and deeper relationships with our customers at every stage of their lives. Relationships that are based on insight and shared goals, delivering a simpler customer experience that removes complexity and frustration. Relationships that reflect customers' values and aspirations for themselves and society. Relationships that start earlier in our customers' lives and which adapt to meet their evolving needs. All of which will be enabled by the strategic partnerships and acquisitions we have made, and by our efforts to simplify how customers interact with our bank so they can enjoy an easier, frictionless banking experience. It will also be driven by a better allocation of our capital - with \u00a33 billion being invested in the business across a three-year period from 2021 to 2023, in addition to the sustainable returns we are delivering to shareholders.\n\n## Our purpose\n\nWe champion potential, helping people, families and businesses to thrive\n\n## Our strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSupporting customers at\n\nevery stage of their lives\n\nPowered by innovation and partnerships\n\nSimple to deal with\n\nSharpened capital allocation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our initial areas of focus\n\nThese help us make a meaningful contribution to society while balancing the needs of our customers, colleagues and shareholders\n\nClimate\n\nLearning\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnterprise",

Our operating profit for 2021 of \u00a34.0 billion (\u00a34.3 billion including operating profit from discounted operations (1) ) increased from a loss of \u00a3481 million (\u00a3351 million loss including operating profit from discounted operations (1) ) the year before. This included impairment releases of \u00a31.3 billion, which reflected the low levels of realised losses we have seen across the year.\n\nWe also continued to make progress against our other financial targets. The bank's net lending - excluding government schemes - grew by \u00a37.8 billion in 2021, primarily driven by growth in mortgages. We removed a further \u00a3256 million of costs from the business and retain a capital ratio well above our target range.\n\nAt the same time, our digital transformation accelerated as our customers chose to interact with us in different ways. Around 60% of our retail current account holders now only interact with us digitally (1) and we have seen further strong growth in mobile payments and video banking. This digitalisation of customer journeys is crucial to our future\n\ngrowth, and our Net Promoter Scores are improving in key segments as a result. For example, our much-improved online process for renewing mortgages now takes as little as 10 minutes.\n\nWe are also using our digital capabilities to keep our customers safe and to build their financial capabilities, with credit scoring now available in our app, dedicated support lines available for customers in vulnerable situations and more than 1 million customers growing their savings with us by \u00a3100 or more for the first time.\n\nAs the UK's leading business bank and a committed champion of start-ups, we are removing barriers to enterprise, tackling inequality and supporting growth by helping entrepreneurs achieve their ambitions. We offer the UK's largest fully funded business accelerator network, with accelerator hubs across the country providing support for high-growth businesses, especially those led by under-represented groups.

We also helped create the SME Transformation Taskforce to unlock the growth opportunity for the UK economy, identified in our 'Springboard to Sustainable Recovery' report.\n\nTurning to our own business, the capital restructuring of NatWest Markets has made substantial progress. It is simpler, less capital intensive and better able to create opportunities for our commercial customers by meeting their financing and risk management needs, and by providing access to global markets as well as leadership in high-growth areas, such as the green and sustainable bond markets. As a result, we are creating a new franchise called Commercial and Institutional by bringing together our Commercial Banking, NatWest Markets and RBS International businesses. The creation of this new franchise is a further step in removing complexity and becoming a simpler bank for customers to deal with.\n\nWe continue to make good progress on our phased withdrawal from the Irish market, minimising job losses and protecting services while supporting our customers and colleagues to allow a smooth transition. During the year, we signed two agreements with Allied Irish Banks p.l.c. (AIB) and Permanent TSB p.l.c. (PTSB) which account for about 60% of the Ulster Bank loan book in the Republic of Ireland, including the transfer of colleagues, wholly or mainly supporting the relevant portfolios and 25 branch locations.\n\nThese structural changes, along with our strong capital position and continued capital generation, mean that we are well placed to invest for growth, to provide the support our customers need as the economy recovers and to drive sustainable returns to shareholders, with \u00a33.8 billion shareholder distributions announced for 2021 through dividends and buybacks.\n\nThe bank's financial performance in 2021 also included a fine following breaches of the Money Laundering Regulations 2007. NatWest Group takes its responsibility to prevent and detect financial crime extremely seriously. We deeply regret that we failed to adequately monitor one of our customers between 2012 and 2016 to prevent money laundering. And while the case has now come to an end, we continue to invest significant resources in the ongoing fight against financial crime and fraud.\n\n.\n\nWe are delivering our strategy through four strategic priorities, with the aim of driving long-term sustainable value and delivering on our 2023 targets, which we are now updating. In 2022, we expect to deliver income excluding notable items of above \u00a311.0 billion in the Go-forward group (1,2) We are amending our cost reduction target to around 3% per annum for 2022 and 2023 (2,3) , reflecting higher inflation and our ongoing investment in the business. Nevertheless, we maintain a strong focus on continued cost discipline. We retain our 2023 CET1 ratio of 13-14%, and we have upgraded our return on tangible equity target in 2023 to comfortably above 10% for the Group.\n\n## Tackling climate change\n\nOne key area where our bank has a critical role to play is in helping to tackle climate change. It is the biggest challenge we face as a society, requiring collaboration and co-operation on a global scale, and NatWest Group was proud to sponsor the COP26 global climate conference which took place in Glasgow in October/November 2021.\n\nOur industry has a responsibility to drive and influence positive change. As such, NatWest Group is committed to getting its own house in order, bringing to an end the most harmful activity and providing the support, advice and products our customers need in order to accelerate the transition to a net-zero economy.\n\nWe are one of the few banks to offer a Green Mortgage product, with \u00a3728 million of lending to retail customers since its launch in Q4 2020, and we established the Sustainable Homes and Buildings Coalition with British Gas, Worcester Bosch and Shelter to improve the energy efficiency of buildings in the UK. Working with the fintech company CoGo, we were also the first bank to introduce a carbon-tracking feature in our mobile banking app. And we are helping colleagues and customers to move to electric vehicles through a collaboration with Octopus Energy.\n\nOur Springboard to Sustainable Recovery report found that the transition to net zero can create a huge opportunity for SMEs. Close to 40% of our accelerator hubs are dedicated to supporting sustainable businesses to help our most innovative start-ups to take advantage of this opportunity. There is a clear societal responsibility here, but also an obvious commercial imperative in helping our customers to thrive as we transition to net zero.\n\n## Building a culture to champion potential\n\nIn seeking to make a positive contribution to the communities we serve, we are also building an open, inclusive and progressive place to work, breaking down barriers for our customers and for our colleagues.\n\nWe are a learning organisation and our culture is critical to our future success. We have worked with our colleagues as well as with our customers, suppliers and communities to create a new set of values that reflect the organisation we are today. Values that match the ambition, optimism and energy our purpose has given us, and that we can all believe in.\n\nThis builds on the progress we have made in recent years as we consider the needs of all our colleagues and stakeholders. In 2021, we launched our global Talent Academy to help identify and develop colleague potential, with almost 4,000 accepted onto the programme. We also offered mental health workshops for our line managers and our 1,300 Wellbeing Champions, as well as seeing strong take up of our virtual GP and physiotherapy offers.",

We were also recognised by the 'Good Business Pays' campaign for our commitment to paying our suppliers the day after receiving an invoice, in line with the Supplier Charter which we introduced in 2020.\n\nIn our top three layers globally, 38% of roles are currently filled by female colleagues, a 9% increase since we first introduced our target to have a full gender balance in these roles by 2030, but a 1% decrease from 31 December 2020. We know we have more to do and we continue to focus on the recruitment, retention and advancement of women to meet our 2030 target.\n\nIn 2020, we launched the Racial Equality Taskforce to listen, learn and better understand the barriers faced by colleagues, customers and communities from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic backgrounds. Of those who disclose their ethnicity, we have an aggregate of 11% Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues in our top four layers in the UK; a 3% increase since our 14% target was first introduced in 2018.\n\n## Living up to our purpose\n\nOver the coming years, we will create a closer and deeper relationship with the people, families and businesses that we serve throughout the UK. From teenagers to retirees, from newlyweds to new homeowners and from start-ups to the largest multinationals, we will understand them better, provide more value to them and help them to thrive.\n\nBy playing such a central role throughout the lives of our customers, by taking action on the issues they care about and by retaining their business as their needs and aspirations change, our bank will go from strength to strength.\n\nMore than that, it will make a meaningful contribution to our society, helping to grow and transition our economy as we move towards net zero, sustainably growing our business by living up to our purpose.\n\n## Alison Rose\n\nGroup Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate change in conversation\n\nAlison Rose talks about the legacy of COP26 and NatWest Group's continued commitment to help reach the 2015 Paris Agreement goals.\n\n## What did it mean for NatWest Group to be a principal partner of COP26?\n\nFirstly, it was a huge honour. As one of the UK's biggest banks - and indeed the biggest for business - we have both the ability and the responsibility to take a major role in the fight against climate change.\n\nWe wanted to achieve two things at the conference: to demonstrate how we can support our customers; and to ensure that we play a leading role in the global coalition of financial services organisations tackling climate change.\n\nWe know the financial sector is a key enabler in the drive towards net-zero emissions, so we invited our customers to COP26 and held events that explained the huge opportunity that climate change can bring to businesses. We formed alliances to help customers 'green' their homes, and collaborated with organisations such as CoGo to help our customers understand their carbon footprint. In this sense, we saw the conference as an incredible chance to showcase and develop the practical support we can offer our retail and business customers to lower their emissions.\n\nWith regard to collaborative action, we signed up to the UK Government's joint declaration on accelerating the transition to 100% zero emission vehicles, as well as announcing that we will be one of 27 new members of the Powering Past Coal Alliance, to accelerate the global transition from coal. This follows on from our role as a founding member of the Net Zero Banking Alliance and becoming part of the new coalition of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou mention the financial sector is a key enabler, how can banking make a difference?\n\nBanks have a vital role to play by providing customers with access to the necessary finance, expertise and products, there is the chance to drive real, positive change.\n\nImportantly, I believe this is not only good for the planet, but good for business too. Our 'Springboard to Sustainable Recovery' report clearly highlights this. The report shows that small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) can deliver a significant amount of the UK's abatement targets, if they get the right support. And this, we believe, is a huge opportunity for businesses.\n\nDemand for the financing to make this happen is already significant. In 2020, we set out to provide \u00a320 billion of Climate and Sustainable Funding and Financing over two years. I am delighted that we met this initial target in under 18 months, so in October 2021 we committed to an ambitious new goal of providing an additional \u00a3100 billion of Climate and Sustainable Funding and Financing between 1 July 2021 and the end of 2025.\n\nEducation and guidance are also key, which is why we worked with fintech company CoGo in 2021 to introduce a carbon-tracking feature in our mobile banking app helping retail customers reduce the climate impact of their spending. We are also working on similar pilot schemes for our business customers.\n\n## What do you think will be the biggest legacies of COP26?\n\nI think history will judge COP26 as the point when serious, collective climate action began across all industries and all countries. In particular, it showed the private sector starting to act together and at scale: putting their own houses in order; taking action on deforestation and biodiversity loss; and focusing on the opportunities of the transition to net zero.\n\nMost of all though, as 100,000 activists walked the streets of Glasgow, it felt like a rallying call to embed climate in all our decisions. Time will tell, but I hope that COP26 will be remembered as the moment where climate change truly became a global priority.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our Cl/uni0069mate-related d/uni0069sclosures on pages 64 to 71.\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements",

However,  due to the TCV programme being  delivered outdoors, in June we were  once again able to offer colleagues the  chance to do their bit to help nature  and biodiversity to thrive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| NGOs, academia and think tanks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | -

She'd wanted a car for a long time and was unsure on how to go about it, but a prompt on her NatWest mobile app about a personal loan offer was the encouragement she needed to drive ahead with her plans.\n\nNathalie booked a video call with us using her mobile app and was speaking to one of our team within 15 minutes. We made the process simple and easy for Nathalie, taking her through the loan application and also identifying that Nathalie would benefit from a savings account.\n\nBy 6pm that evening, Nathalie had the loan money in her account, giving her the financial support she needed to buy a car. We're passionate about getting to know our customers and supporting them with all their banking needs, whether we're helping them in-person in a branch, or through one of our innovative digital channels like video banking.\n\nWe think the help we gave to Nathalie is a great example of NatWest Group's determination to build deeper relationships with our customers and support them to achieve their different goals in life.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'We're passionate about getting to know our customers and supporting them with all their banking needs'\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\n<!-- image -->",

Reducing its carbon footprint has been a key priority. The company had already installed over 1,000 solar panels, producing around 280 kilowatts of electricity, but it also wanted to make the switch to all-electric vehicles.\n\nFor Vernon, investing in sustainable and innovative technology is key to the long-term success of his business. And this is exactly where NatWest was able to help.\n\nWhen Vernon mentioned his plans to the NatWest relationship manager, we were able to tell him of our collaboration with Octopus Energy. Through our collaboration - the first time a major bank and a renewable energy supplier have joined forces - we offer our retail, business and wealth customers a tailored package that improves the cost and efficiency of owning and running an electric vehicle.\n\nThe brewery now has eight charging points which the staff can use and are also open to the public. Vernon believes it has made a real difference in his company's shift to electric vehicles.\n\nWith our focus on partnerships and innovation, NatWest Group is making it easier and more affordable for our customers to make a positive difference to our environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'With our focus on partnerships and innovation, NatWest is making it easier and more affordable for our customers to make a positive difference to our environment.'\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, a month after she went self-employed, the pandemic struck.\n\nBeing a start-up company can be hard enough at the best of times. But trying to connect with suppliers and customers during a national lockdown was a real challenge. Mica needed all the support she could get.\n\nAs a long-standing personal banking customer, she knew NatWest was simple to deal with. So she reached out to our business banking team for help with setting up Floral Glory's payments system.\n\nRunning her business from home initially meant that transactions needed to work across virtual and physical platforms. Tyl by NatWest provided the solution.\n\nIt allowed Mica to accept online payments securely through her website or by phone. The next-day business settlement also really helped in the early days when cash flow was so important.\n\nAfter the lockdown, when Mica moved into her premises, Tyl once again helped her keep things simple. The portable card machine was ideal for moving around the shop, while each payment integrated straight into her accounting software.\n\nMica's story shows how NatWest is here to help.\n\nBy combining the right products and being simple to deal with, we make life easier for our customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 'By combining the right products and being simple to deal with, we make life easier for our customers.'\n\n25\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information",

As a global leader in the development and management of solar energy projects, they've seen the market for renewables grow sharply over the past decade.\n\nBut accessing that opportunity has required hard work, innovation and, of course, the financing to make it happen.\n\nNatWest Group has supported Lightsource bp throughout its journey from a UK start-up 10 years ago, to its emergence as a major renewable energy firm.\n\nThe company now employs 700 industry specialists working across 17 countries to help deliver affordable and sustainable solar power for businesses and communities around the world.\n\nFor us, our work with Lightsource bp aligns perfectly with our purpose and climate ambitions. We know the financial sector is a key enabler in the drive towards net-zero emissions, but it's more than that. As well as being good for the environment, it's also good business.\n\nIt's a belief we have committed to with our announcement in 2021 to provide an additional \u00a3100 billion of Climate and Sustainable Funding and Financing by the end of 2025.\n\nAnd we're continuing our journey with Lightsource bp too - agreeing in 2021 to be part of the funding package for the company's ambitious new growth strategy.\n\nWe believe focusing the allocation of capital in this way makes perfect sense. It's good for our business, the companies we support, and our planet.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Focusing the allocation of capital in this way makes perfect sense.

The 30 basis points reduction in the year principally reflects capital distributions, partially offset by the reduction in RWAs and the attributable profit. RWAs of \u00a3157.0 billion reduced by \u00a313.3 billion in 2021 mainly reflecting business movements in Commercial Banking, including targeted sector reductions, improvement in risk parameters and

        "page_content": "## NatWest Group continues to adapt to evolving market trends\n\nThe environment we operate in is constantly changing. Understanding the multiple influences on our business enables us to be prepared for change, to respond quickly, and to create value for the long term.\n\n## Economy\n\n## Overview\n\nIn 2021, the UK economy continued its recovery from the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown restrictions, with GDP approaching pre-pandemic levels towards the end of the year. The employment market continued to remain robust, with the furlough scheme proving an effective tool to lessen the impact of COVID-19 as well as helping the labour market emerge from COVID-19 in a position of strength. Towards the end of 2021, UK job vacancies remained elevated. Against this backdrop, inflationary pressure began to build with the Consumer Prices Index ending the year well ahead of the Bank of England's 2% target. Countering inflation is therefore likely to remain high on the agenda for policy makers in the short to medium term. In the longer term, demographic change, climate change, high levels of debt and inequality could all have financial impacts for our customers.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur business performance is correlated with economic factors. Put simply, when people, families and businesses thrive, so do we. We know the tough economic conditions many of our customers have faced throughout the year. As such, we have remained focused on removing barriers to doing business and providing more opportunities for companies to grow, helping the economy to build back better. Initiatives such as our 'Accelerator' programme, our 'Springboard to Sustainable Recovery' report, and an additional \u00a31 billion in funding to help support female-led businesses in the UK recover from COVID-19 have been a key part of this.\n\n'COVID-19 has increased our customers' reliance on technology with a further shift to digital, reinforcing the need for modern capabilities and resilient systems.'\n\n## Customers\n\n## Overview\n\nCustomers' needs and behaviours are changing as a result of new technologies. The impact of COVID-19 has accelerated digital trends as well as prompting different ways of working, shopping, socialising and communicating. Demographic shifts and changing labour patterns are also having a profound long-term effect on customer behaviours, as people work longer, retire later, rent for longer or buy property later in life.\n\n## Our response\n\nUnderstanding these trends allows us to better support our customers' needs, being there at every stage of their lives and tailoring banking services and products that meet their evolving expectations. By harnessing new technology and partnering with leading organisations, we have again enhanced and evolved our customer experiences in 2021. We have also continued our efforts to make banking more accessible for all of our customers through improving face-toface, digital and remote interactions. And in 2021, we again devoted significant focus to supporting customers facing financial difficulty or in vulnerable situations, as well as helping more people to start saving.\n\n## Technology\n\n## Overview\n\nNew business models and customer behaviours continue to rapidly evolve through advancing technology. COVID-19 has increased our customers' reliance on technology with a further shift to digital, reinforcing the need for modern capabilities and resilient systems. Our active digital users across both personal and business customers continued to grow in 2021.\n\n## Our response\n\nWith a focus on innovation, and through collaborations with experienced companies, our technology solutions have driven significant benefits for our customers. This has been particularly evident again in 2021 with our approach to Open Banking. Leveraging the ability to combine transaction and bank issuance data has helped us generate invaluable insights for our commercial customers. In terms of our own digital estate in 2021, we have also delivered further technological innovation to help protect privacy and customer confidentiality. In addition to the strong focus on delivering innovative solutions for our customers, technology transformation continues to prioritise simplification, stability and resilience, as well as year-on-year run-cost reduction.\n\n## Cyber threats\n\n## Overview\n\nCyberattacks pose a constant risk to our operations, both in relation to our own digital estate and indirectly with regards to our supply chain. Cybercrime continues to evolve rapidly. Attacks may be from individuals or highly organised criminal groups intent on stealing money or sensitive data, or potentially holding organisations to ransom.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe continue to invest significant resources in the development and evolution of cybersecurity controls, deploy rigorous due diligence with regards to third parties and work to protect and educate our colleagues and customers on fraud and scam activity. To provide continuity of service for customers with minimal disruption, we monitor and assess a diverse and evolving array of threats, both external and internal, as well as developing, strengthening or adapting existing control capability to be able to absorb and adapt to such disruptions.\n\n## Climate change\n\n## Overview\n\nClimate change represents an inherent risk to NatWest Group, not only from its impact on the global economy and our customers, but also through its potential effects on asset values, operational costs and business models as the essential transition to a net-zero economy accelerates. These risks are subject to increasing regulatory, political and societal change. Conversely, the requirement to reduce carbon emissions also means NatWest Group has a significant role to play in areas such as the provision of Climate and Sustainable Funding and Financing.\n\n## Our response\n\nClimate risk was formally incorporated into the NatWest Group risk directory as a principal risk in February 2021 and in April 2021, NatWest Group Board Risk Committee approved a principles-based climate risk policy. Our Climate Opportunities Group (COG) was established to support our ambition to be a leading bank in helping to address climate change. The COG brings together colleagues from all business segments to conceptualise and develop opportunities that complement the NatWest Group climate ambition. Being a principal partner of COP26 gave us the opportunity to re-state our commitment to working with our partners to help reduce carbon emissions. At the conference in Glasgow, we focused on highlighting the practical support we are providing our customers to help them achieve their climate ambitions, as well as strengthening our existing partnerships and building new ones. Our commitment to tackling climate change means we have already reduced our direct own operations footprint by 46%, against a 2019 baseline and plan to achieve a 50% reduction by 2025. We have also set stretching targets for our wider operational value chain and have an ambition to halve the impact of our financing activity by 2030.\n\nNatWest Group 2021 Climate and Sustainable Funding and Financing - Geographical split (1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1)  Since 1 July 2021, UK & Ireland \u00a35.5 billion, Western Europe \u00a31.9 billion and Other \u00a30.6 billion.\n\n## Regulation\n\n## Overview\n\nWe operate in a highly regulated market which continues to evolve in scope. Areas of current regulatory focus include: delivering good customer outcomes, in particular the FCA's current proposals for a Consumer Duty, which looks to expand its rules and principles to force firms to provide better consumer protection; operational resilience, in light of the UK authorities' new policy requirements; climate change, and the development of the regulatory framework for sustainable finance; fraud and financial crime, with a focus on protecting customers from ever-more sophisticated scams; capital and liquidity management, including the UK's approach to the implementation of Basel III; the UK's future regulatory framework, following its exit from the European Union and the opportunities that this provides; digital currencies, with the development of both public (central bank digital currencies) and private (e.g. stablecoins) offerings which have the potential to materially change the digital payments landscape; improving diversity, equity and inclusion in financial services, through policy developments focused on improved data collection and reporting, and use of targets for representation.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe constantly monitor regulatory change and work with our regulators to help shape those developments that materially impact the bank, lobbying when necessary either bilaterally or in partnership with one of our affiliated industry bodies. We implement new regulatory requirements where applicable and use our frequent engagement meetings with regulators to discuss key regulatory priorities.",

We seek to act in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and our approach to respecting human rights is informed by other international standards and principles including the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). We have established a human rights steering group, a management group that brings representatives from across NatWest Group together to coordinate our activities, and to make recommendations to NatWest Group Executive Committee and Board to develop and strengthen our approach. More information can be found at natwestgroup.com.\n\nTackling modern slavery forms an integral part of our approach to human rights. We seek to tackle modern slavery and human trafficking through continued implementation of policies covering our customers, colleagues and suppliers and by monitoring our financing and supply chain for this activity. Our full approach is outlined in our annual Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement which can be found at natwestgroup.com.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to engage with a range of stakeholders in relation to human rights including charities, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and campaign groups to help grow our knowledge and understanding of these issues. We remained members of the Thun Group and the UN Global Compact's UK Modern Slavery Working Group. We also continued to work with anti-slavery charity Unseen to support survivors and raise awareness of modern slavery with colleagues throughout NatWest Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ways of Working\n\nRe-imagining the workplace\n\nHow do you manage a never-before moment in the world of work?\n\nThat was the question we were suddenly posed with when COVID-19 hit. But as the pandemic played out, we quickly started to think beyond immediate operational requirements to what a new way of working could look like considering the needs of over 58,000 colleagues across a number of jurisdictions.\n\nBut we also knew we had a real opportunity to make the return to the work environment different from how it had always been: a more flexible design. Tailored to what mattered most to our colleagues.\n\nTo get there, we adopted a robust, data and experience-led approach. Through extensive colleague interviews, executive engagement and external research we started to build a picture of the new way colleagues would like to work and interact.\n\nOur insights quickly guided us that one size wouldn't fit all. And that a 'Ways of Working' framework designed around three models was a flexible and dynamic way to both deliver colleague choice and better meet customer needs.\n\nColleague safety, and health and wellbeing were paramount during roll-out. To ensure this, we knew that having a range of measures in place - from a 'Wellbeing Hub' and 'Best Practices Zones', to working from home guides and mental health advice - was vital.\n\nWe also realised that getting it right would take time. So we created a feedback loop, gathering colleague views and adapting our process. For example, following colleague suggestions we introduced reorientation events as well as onsite wellbeing support to help colleagues back into the office.\n\nWe're still on a journey, but it's one we're on together.\n\n'Our insights quickly guided us that one size wouldn't fit all'",

Whether it's providing early financial education, helping them onto the property ladder or building secure financial futures, we're there at every stage of our customers' lives. We are delivering on our strategy to support building a relationship bank for a digital world - combining the best people and the best technology.\n\nBy investing in world-class digital experiences which meet the needs of our customers (from our digital banking app and AI virtual assistant Cora, to video calling with expert advisers), we make sure they have 24/7 access to the help and information they need. Our focused investment in driving deeper-value exchanges with customers while digitalising more customer journeys and simplifying our business has resulted in a further \u00a352 million gross annualised cost reduction, as well as income growth from a number of products and journeys.\n\nTotal income (\u00a3m) 4,445 2020: 4,181\n\nOperating expenses (\u00a3m)\n\n(2,513) 2020: (2,540)\n\nOperating profit (\u00a3m) 1,968 2020: 849\n\nReturn on equity\n\n(%) 26.1 2020: 10.2\n\nNet loans to customers\n\n(\u00a3bn) 182.2 2020: 172.3\n\nVideo banking financial\n\nhealth checks 350k\n\n2020: 173k\n\nCustomers exclusively using digital channels (%)\n\n60 2020: 58\n\nCustomers helped to buy their first home 48k 2020: 32k\n\nWe're extremely proud of providing 30 years of free early financial education to children through our MoneySense programme. And we're delighted to now evolve this further through the acquisition of RoosterMoney in October 2021 - a leading children's banking app, which builds financial skills in a fun, accessible way. We are committed to helping more young customers with their financial capability and have seen a steady increase in the proportion of young people choosing to bank with us in 2021 versus pre-pandemic levels.\n\nWe have also increased the number of customers who choose us as their main bank in 2021, reaching our highest-ever score for customer satisfaction. We are helping all our customers make the most of their money and achieve their goals, especially at a time when many are facing financial difficulties. We know that at every life stage, whether our customers have a shortor long-term goal, saving needs to be easy and rewarding. Our Digital Regular Saver account, alongside budgeting and goal tools, was designed specifically to help first-time savers build financial resilience. (1) We aim to address the savings gap by helping two million customers start saving by the end of 2023; since launch we have enabled over one million customers to start their savings journey, including almost 471,000 in 2021. We also conducted more than 661,000 financial health checks in 2021, of which over 350,000 were completed via video banking.\n\nWe recognise that building secure financial futures begins early on in our customers' lives and we are there to support them from the start. Our digital investing platform, NatWest Invest and Royal Bank Invest, helps our customers with their longterm financial plans. By offering digital access to five funds managed by Coutts, customers can plan for life's big events or simply invest towards securing their financial future. Nearly 33,000 retail bank customers started investing through the platform in 2021.\n\nWhen our customers are ready to step onto the property ladder, they're in safe hands, we have 11.5% flow share of UK mortgages, we helped more than 48,000 customers to buy their first home and over 40,000 customers to re-mortgage. Our continued digitalisation of the mortgage journey means that we can now offer customers browsing price-comparison websites a more seamless experience; gaining a decision in principle upfront without them having to leave the website. Through our Green Mortgage, which we provided to around 2,900 customers in 2021, we proactively supported customers to lower their carbon footprint by offering discounted mortgage rates for buying more energy efficient homes.\n\nWe are also there to support our customers with their shortterm borrowing needs and enable them to achieve their goals sooner. We have over 3.8 million users of our 'Know My Credit Score' tool, with just under 1.4 million signing up in 2021. This helps customers better understand their credit options - and how the decisions they make today, could affect their finances tomorrow. We launched a new Purchase and Balance Transfer credit card and grew credit card balances faster than the market in the second half of the year. Our credit card customers can also now manage large purchases more easily by setting up an instalment plan to spread payments between three and 24 months.\n\nWe're always striving to make banking simpler for our customers. We now have over eight million customers regularly using our mobile app, which uses biometric authentication to make the user experience secure and convenient and 60% of our customers now interact with us exclusively via digital channels. We've also launched 'Banking My Way' in the app, making it easier for customers to tell us how we can best support their needs relating to accessibility or personal circumstances.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cora supporting our customers\n\nUsing AI to provide that personal touch\n\n'Cora' is NatWest Group's customer-facing AI virtual assistant, helping to provide support for our customers using both our digital and telephony channels.\n\nOver the last few years, we have significantly improved Cora's capability and intelligence. In 2021, Cora handled 10.7 million retail banking conversations, up 27% on the previous year.\n\nThe AI virtual assistant also fully supported 47% of all customer queries without having to hand over to a human.\n\nCora is now able to help customers by providing personalised responses to a range of different banking needs, from providing help on how to access the mobile app, to updating us when they move home.\n\nIn 2021, for the first time, Cora began assisting customers over the phone, allowing the use of natural conversation to self-serve.\n\nCora is now a key part of the bank's digital and telephony offering, with a constantly evolving role in frontline customer support. As well as improving our service efficiency, it also enables our colleagues to focus on more complex customer enquiries.\n\nWe will continue to invest in the use of innovative technologies to make it easier for our customers to get the support they require, when and where it is needed.\n\nFor us, this is a vital component of being a relationship bank for a digital world.\n\nGovernance\n\nAdditional information\n\n'The AI virtual assistant also fully supported 47% of all customer queries without having to hand over to a human.'\n\n<!-- image -->",

In July 2021, Coutts became a Certified B Corporation, evidencing our commitment to balance people, profit and the planet.\n\nTotal income (\u00a3m) 816 2020: 763\n\nOperating expenses (\u00a3m) (520) 2020: (455)\n\nOperating profit (\u00a3m) 350 2020: 208\n\nReturn on equity (%) 17.0 2020: 10.3\n\nNet loans to customers (\u00a3bn)\n\n18.4 2020: 17.0\n\nAUMA (1) (\u00a3bn) 35.6 2020: 32.1\n\nCustomer deposits (\u00a3bn) 39.3 2020: 32.4\n\nNatWest Invest/Royal Bank Invest/Coutts Invest users\n\n78,890 2020: 44,410\n\n- (1)  Private Banking manages assets under management portfolios on behalf of Retail Banking and RBSI and receives a management fee in respect of providing this service.\n\nWe partner with our clients and their families as their wealth needs evolve over their lifetime, ensuring that their wealth has its intended consequences. In 2021, we launched NatWest Group's first digital Junior ISA, which so far has enabled over 4,000 clients to start saving for their children's future more easily. We continue to develop our digital capabilities and have seen strong growth in digital sales with over 26% of net new money now being executed through digital channels. We also continue to meet the more complex lending and investment needs of Coutts clients through face-to-face specialist advisers and we welcomed a 29% increase in new Coutts clients in 2021 compared with 2020.\n\nAs a result of our collaboration with global asset manager BlackRock, Coutts invests in a dedicated range of bespoke funds managed and administrated by BlackRock on their platform. Coutts set the investment strategy and ESG policy for the funds and this relationship provides efficiency benefits for our clients. We have also increased our ability to influence change at the companies held within these bespoke funds to drive better ESG outcomes, engaging with over five times more companies across the UK, Europe and North America and voting on 79% more company resolutions in 2021 compared with 2020. Our online investment product series, Personal Portfolio funds, available as NatWest Invest, Royal Bank Invest and Coutts Invest grew significantly and more than doubled from \u00a30.9 billion in 2020 to \u00a31.9 billion in 2021.\n\nCoutts collaborated with BGF Group (BGF) to launch the UK Enterprise Fund and provide additional growth funding and support to SMEs across the UK. The fund is co-investing equity growth capital alongside BGF, taking minority stakes in businesses looking to scale in the UK, with initiatives to support female entrepreneurship and promote the diversity of management teams. In 2021, over 100 clients invested a combined \u00a342 million and Coutts and BGF intend to launch a further fund in 2022.\n\nIn November, we launched our first full-scale brand and television campaign to increase awareness and consideration among a new type of client: younger (35-44), female and entrepreneurial. The campaign 'real success takes true character', focused on the duality of acting in the right way being the reason for achieving long-term success and played into the progress we have made to become a B Corporation and our responsible investing credentials.\n\nIn June, we started to incentivise new and existing clients to improve the energy efficiency of their homes. We offer discounted mortgage fees on homes with an A or B EPC ratings and fee rebates to clients who improve their EPC rating above C within a year of taking out their mortgage. We continue to grow our nascent Green Mortgage book and have further plans to help our clients understand the carbon intensity of their homes. Coutts has been recognised by the Green Finance Institute as a Pioneer of the UK Green Home Finance Principles.\n\nWe introduced our new Coutts mobile app to a pilot population with a full roll out planned for 2022. We have introduced integrated biometrics for enhanced security and easy-to-use digital features such as first time beneficiary payment authorisation. In app domestic payments can be completed in one of the most efficient journeys in the UK market amongst other notable features. The latest digital tools have enabled clients to self-serve all disclosures during the onboarding process, including electronic e-signatures, and enabled us to send automated fraud alerts via SMS.\n\n'More than ever, we know we have a responsibility to make a positive difference to the world we live in.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial review\n\nAdditional information\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Doing well by doing good\n\nCoutts becomes a Certified B Corp\n\nAs a business, we believe we can be a force for good.\n\nIt's a conviction woven deeply in our history, most notably in the philanthropic legacy of Angela BurdettCoutts, whose family forged the bank.\n\nAnd now more than ever, we know we have a responsibility to make a positive difference to the world we live in. It's why - over two years ago - we made the decision to aim to be part of the ever-growing community of Certified B Corporations.\n\nB Corps are a new kind of business. Ones that balance purpose and profit - being required to consider the impact of their decisions on their workers, customers, suppliers, community and the environment.\n\nHowever, the journey to B Corp certification is understandably long and rigorous. The external accreditation took over 18 months and involved answering around 300 questions on everything from company governance and how we care for our colleagues, to our environmental impact and what we contribute to the community.\n\nMost meaningfully perhaps, we also changed our Articles of Association, enshrining the importance of considering all stakeholders in our decision-making.\n\nIn July 2021, as a result of these efforts, Coutts gained the proud distinction of being a Certified B Corp.\n\nSince then, we have been busy. Coutts was a founding member of the 'B Finance UK Coalition' which was launched at COP26, and also supported B Lab UK's Boardroom 2030 initiative.\n\nBut for us, this is very much just the beginning.\n\n'For us, this is very much just the beginning'",

We grew lending in areas where we have competitive advantage, such as climate and sustainable funding and financing where we delivered \u00a35.2 billion of lending. As a relationship bank for a digital world, our innovations allow us to better support our customers across a growing number of digital channels while simplifying and automating our own processes.\n\nTotal income (\u00a3m) 3,875 2020: 3,958\n\nOperating expenses (\u00a3m) (2,354)\n\n2020: (2,430)\n\nOperating profit/(loss) (\u00a3m) 2,594 2020: (399)\n\nNet loans to customers (\u00a3bn) 101.2 2020: 108.2\n\nReturn on equity\n\n(%) 22.0 2020: (4.5)\n\nTyl payments processed\n\n(m) 39.3 2020: 13.6\n\nIn 2021, we opened over 78,000 accounts for new businesses, supported c.55,000 individuals and businesses through c.200,000 interventions; of those supported c.52% were purpose-led businesses, c.60% identified as female and c.26% were from Minority Ethnic backgrounds. Further to publishing our 'Springboard to Sustainable Recovery' reports in March and October, we implemented our SME Task Force across all our regions to focus on five areas identified with the potential to create opportunity for SMEs tackling climate change. We continued our support for customers through Brexit, facilitating UK imports and exports by onboarding 27 more non-UK suppliers to Supply Chain Finance programmes and increasing the proportion of our lending to non-UK suppliers by 50%.\n\nAs transaction volumes recovered in the second half of 2021, our investments in Payit and Tyl led to continued growth in their respective customer bases. Payit became one of the largest Open Banking-enabled 'Payment Initiation Service' platforms in the UK by volume and Tyl, our point-of-sale solution for small businesses, processed its 50 millionth transaction during 2021. Our Confirmation of Payee API also won the first public tender with HMRC. We collaborated with NatWest Markets to underwrite 56 new transactions, \u00a36 billion commitments, and improve onboarding processes enabling customers to take advantage of our award-winning corporate FX services.\n\nOur strategy of collaborating with industry leaders to deliver better customer experiences evolved at pace in 2021 with a joint offering of charging infrastructure with Octopus, allowing customers to understand the carbon emissions of their supply chains and working on The Global Farm Metric with the Sustainable Food Trust.\n\nWe gave 16,000 additional SME customers access to a relationship manager through the launch of our new direct relationship manager proposition. We enhanced 32 digital sales and servicing journeys, enabling our customers to start and complete more journeys digitally. In 2021, over 60% of customers' service requests were initiated digitally and over two thirds of those were processed with no human intervention. Our AI virtual assistant, Cora handled over 1.2 million chats, of which more than half required no human intervention.\n\nWe continue to be disciplined in our capital allocation, allowing us to best support the economy in line with our strategy while maintaining a resilient balance sheet. In 2021, we embedded our climate commitments in our capital allocation and pricingdecision frameworks. Our new sector strategy reflects a continued rebalancing of our balance sheet towards sectors aligned to an economic recovery and building a fair transition to a green economy across the regions. In 2021, we delivered a \u00a31.5 billion risk-weighted assets (RWA) saving from targeted sector reductions, significant risk transfers and other active capital management actions; improving RWA efficiency by around 1%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## There when it counts\n\nChampioning business potential\n\nWe know it's essential for growing businesses to get the right kind of support at the right time.\n\nIt's why we place so much importance on championing potential in those early years. When a business has a clear commercial opportunity, we want to help them deliver on their ambitions.\n\nPensionBee is a great example. A direct-to-consumer financial technology company and a leading online pension provider in the UK, it enables customers to interact with their retirement savings through its unique combination of smart technology and dedicated customer service.\n\nWe assisted PensionBee in March 2021, in the run up to its planned IPO, with a \u00a310 million revolving credit facility through our innovative Growth Capital team. Our support gave the company that vital element of flexibility around optimising its capital structure to protect its cash runway.\n\nSpeed of arrangement was crucial. Working to short timescales we were able to deliver the contract for the required facility quickly, providing PensionBee with fast assurance that liquidity would be available if needed.\n\nThe company is continuing to move from strength to strength. Having more than doubled its assets under administration to \u00a32.25 billion in the year between September 2020 and 2021, it is now listed on the High Growth Segment of the main market of the London Stock Exchange and has announced its intention to transition to the Premium Segment in the first half of 2022.\n\nFor us, seeing PensionBee's success is massively rewarding. It shows that our support made a difference - at a time when it was needed most.\n\n'We want to help them deliver on their ambitions'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Speed of arrangement was crucial.

We helped our customers grow their deposits, with over 500 customers (who had either never saved with us or had previously saved less than \u00a3100 with us) now saving at least \u00a3100. We provided 8,729 financial health checks, of which over 21% were virtual and we removed six different mortgage fees and launched our mortgage broker portal to simplify our offering and support customers. We also launched our Green Mortgage to NatWest International customers in the UK as we support the wider climate ambitions of NatWest Group.\n\nFollowing the successful launch of Cora, our AI virtual assistant, 63% of interactions have been completed without the need for human intervention. RBSI's Social Enterprise Mentoring Scheme is also now well established and involves partnering with a social enterprise in each retail banking jurisdiction to share our knowledge and expertise. We have also shared our wellbeing material, which received the 'Wellbeing in the Workplace Star Award' for our work with Gibraltar Samaritans.\n\nPartnering with four banks, RBSI will contribute \u00a390,000 over three years to help secure the future of Jersey's Community Savings Limited - a registered charity working to promote financial inclusion.\n\nOperating profit of \u00a3358 million was \u00a3259 million higher than 2020, primarily reflecting a \u00a352 million impairment release combined with income growth and cost reduction. Net loans to customers increased by \u00a32.2 billion, or 16.5%, and customer deposits by \u00a36.2 billion, or 19.8% compared with Q3 2021. During the year, Moody's upgraded our long-term credit rating to A3, bringing us more in line with our peers, setting our rating outlook to stable and affirming the short-term credit rating at P-2; this reflects the resilience of the business throughout the pandemic, our continued profitability and strong balance sheet position.\n\nIn responding to changing customer demands, we introduced cheque deposits in our mobile app among other new features across our personal digital channels, contributing to a 23% increase in users. Overall, 82% of local banking customers are now registered with digital banking which is a 14% increase compared with 2020.\n\nOur Institutional Banking and Depositary Services business has received significant investment as it progresses on its digitisation journey. Customers have felt the benefits of this and the business continues to be a driver of growth with Climate and Sustainable Funding and Financing solutions increasingly popular. We have worked closely with NatWest Markets to strengthen our combined position as a trusted partner for these clients by supporting them with a holistic offering across products and geographies.\n\n'For us, this is about fulfilling our purpose, being part of the community we live and work in'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdditional information\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Helping financial inclusion\n\nRBSI in the community\n\nThink about what it means to be outside the financial system. To not have a bank account. To not be able to pay bills, obtain credit or save for the future.\n\nThe effects can be devastating, trapping people in a vicious cycle of poverty and financial exclusion, unable to participate fully in society.\n\nIt's a problem that we felt we could (and, should) help with. So, we decided to do something about it.\n\nWe got together with four other local banks in Jersey to support Community Savings Ltd - a registered charity which works to promote financial inclusion in Jersey by providing services, guidance and practical assistance to those most in need.\n\nWe know Community Savings well. We've been banking the charity since 2018 and recognise the outstanding work it does in Jersey supporting the financial inclusion of the islanders.\n\nCommunity Savings relies on grants, donations and bequests to ensure the continued running of its long-standing initiative. Its customers' money is not used to fund its operations and it strives to provide its services free of charge.\n\nOver the next three years, we are contributing \u00a390,000 to ensure that the charity is able to help provide access to mainstream banking services.\n\nFor us, this is about fulfilling our purpose, being part of the community we live and work in. But it's also more than that. We look after each other here on the island, and helping people with financial inclusion is a big part of that.'\n\nLynn Cleary Chief Financial Officer, RBS International\n\n<!-- image -->",

The NatWest Markets segment excludes the Central items & other segment.\n\nWe have made progress during 2021 to better support NatWest Group's corporate and institutional customers through refining our global footprint and product range. We have also simplified our operating model and leveraged expertise across the bank to improve core processes to support cost reduction.\n\nOur Foreign Exchange (FX) teams have worked with NatWest Group's Commercial, Retail and Private Banking segments on technology and customer sales initiatives to ensure that customers across NatWest Group benefit from our marketleading expertise.\n\nWe collaborated across RBSI, NatWest Markets and Commercial Banking to establish a team to grow our offering to the investment management sector and provide a more integrated experience for our Funds and Sponsors customers.\n\nWe continued to support our customers with their ESG and climate-related finance needs, with product innovation across bonds, FX, interest rate derivatives and private finance. In 2021, we completed \u00a39.7 billion of Climate and Sustainable Funding and Financing, including \u00a33.3 billion which will contribute towards the new NatWest Group target of \u00a3100 billion between 1 July 2021 and the end of 2025.\n\nOur support for customers has been recognised by a number of awards:\n\n- -'Lead manager of the year, sustainability bonds - local authority/municipality', and 'Lead manager of the year, green bonds - supranational, sub-sovereign and agency (SSAs)', from the Environmental Finance Bond Awards 2021.\n- -'Sterling Bond House of the Year' from the IFR Awards 2020 (awarded February 2021).\n- -'Best Agent of International US Private Placements' from the GlobalCapital Private Debt Awards 2020 (awarded February 2021).\n- -'Best Bank for ALM and Libor Transition Management' from the GlobalCapital Covered Bond Awards 2021.\n- -'#1 bank for Overall FX Service Quality to the UK corporate sector' from Coalition Greenwich 2021.\n\nWe have advanced product innovation in the voluntary carbon market by supporting NatWest Group's collaboration with other international banks to develop a transparent global marketplace for carbon offsets with clear and consistent pricing and standards known as Carbonplace. We also progressed the development of our digital bond capability, completing a successful pilot trade of a blockchain bond in the secondary market.\n\nWe made significant progress on the implementation of our agreement with BNP Paribas for the provision of house futures and associated back-office services, and in January 2022 we successfully went live with the outsourcing of back office services for our US-based Listed Derivatives business.\n\nNatWest Markets incurred an operating loss of \u00a3711 million in 2021. A reduction in income was driven by a weak performance in Fixed Income, reflecting subdued levels of customer activity and the continued reshaping of the business. This also contrasted with the exceptional levels of market activity seen in 2020. We continued to reduce costs in line with the strategic announcement in February 2020, with other expenses decreasing by 12.6%. RWAs were \u00a32.7 billion lower than 2020 reflecting lower levels of market risk and counterparty credit risk, including the impact of capital optimisation actions taken throughout the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting the UK Government to tackle climate change\n\nNatWest Markets and green finance\n\nBeing purpose-led is about knowing and fulfilling our responsibilities. It means delivering on our commitments to our stakeholders, society and the environment.\n\nOne of the most important ways we can do this is by helping tackle climate change.\n\nTo build out the green infrastructure needed to reach net-zero targets first requires the funding and the market mechanisms to deliver it. This is where NatWest Markets has a vital role to play.\n\nFollowing the UK Government's announcement of its first-ever sovereign green bond, we supported the second issuance of green gilts in October 2021 as joint bookrunner.\n\nWith these two green issuances, the UK's Debt Management Office has become one of the top three largest sovereign issuers of green bonds in the world.\n\nNatWest Markets is proud to be part of this process, and to have helped deliver on the government's commitment to issue a minimum of \u00a315 billion of green gilts in 2021-22.\n\nThe bond, which matures in July 2053, is the longest-dated sovereign green bond currently outstanding in the market. Crucially, it will help finance a whole range of climate projects such as offshore windfarms, zero-emission transport and schemes to decarbonise homes and buildings.\n\n'NatWest Markets is proud to have helped deliver on the government's commitment to issue a minimum of \u00a315 billion of green gilts in 2021-22'",

We will monitor and react to market conditions and refine our internal forecasts as the economic position evolves. The following statements are based on current market interest rate and economic expectations.\n\n- - In 2023, we expect to achieve a return on tangible equity of comfortably above 10% for the Group.\n- - In 2022, we expect income excluding notable items to be above \u00a311.0bn in the Go-forward group.\n- - We plan to invest around \u00a33 billion over 2021 to 2023 but, with continuing simplification, we plan to reduce Go-forward group operating expenses, excluding litigation and conduct costs, by around 3% in both 2022 and 2023.\n- - As a result of positive actions to change the shape of our book in recent years, we expect our through-the-cycle impairment loss rate to be around 20 - 30 basis points. We expect our 2022 and 2023 impairment charge to be lower than our through the cycle loss rate.\n- - Across 2022 and 2023, we expect movements in RWAs to largely reflect lending growth and our phased withdrawal from the Republic of Ireland.\n\n## Capital and funding\n\n- - We aim to end 2022 with a CET1 ratio of around 14% and target a ratio of 13-14% by 2023.\n- - We intend to maintain ordinary dividends of around 40% of attributable profit and to distribute a minimum of \u00a31 billion in each of 2022 and 2023 via a combination of ordinary and special dividends.\n- - We intend to maintain capacity to participate in directed buybacks of the UK Government stake, recognising that any exercise of this authority would be dependent upon HMT's intentions and is limited to 4.99% of issued share capital in any 12-month period.\n- - We will consider further on-market buybacks, in addition to the \u00a3750 million announced today, as part of our overall capital distribution approach as well as inorganic opportunities provided they are consistent with our strategy and have a strong shareholder value case.\n- - As part of the NatWest Group capital and funding plans we intend to issue between \u00a33 billion to \u00a35 billion of MREL-compliant instruments in 2022, with a continued focus on issuance under our Green, Social and Sustainability Bond Framework. NatWest Markets plc's funding plan targets \u00a34 billion to \u00a35 billion of public benchmark issuance.\n\n## Ulster Bank RoI\n\n- - We have made good progress on our phased withdrawal from the Republic of Ireland and expect the majority of the Allied Irish Banks and Permanent TSB asset sales to be largely complete by the end of 2022 and deposits to reduce over a longer timescale.\n- - We would expect income and RWAs to follow the balance sheet trajectory. We expect the cost base to reduce over time and anticipate other operating expenses, excluding withdrawal related costs, in 2023 will be around \u20ac200 million lower than 2021.\n- - We expect to incur disposal losses through income of around \u20ac300 million in 2022 and withdrawal related costs of around \u20ac600 million across 2022-24, with around \u20ac500 million incurred by the end of 2023.\n- - We expect the phased withdrawal to be capital accretive.\n- (1)  The guidance, targets, expectations and trends discussed in this section represent NatWest Group plc management's current expectations and are subject to change, including as a result of the factors described in the Risk Factors section on pages 406 to 426 of the 2021 NatWest Group plc Annual Report and Accounts and on pages 179 to 201 of the NatWest Markets Plc 2021 Annual Report and Accounts These statements constitute forward-looking statements. Refer to Forward-looking statements in this document.\n\nDuring 2021, we entered into binding agreements for the sale of material parts of our commercial and personal banking businesses with Allied Irish Banks p.l.c. (AIB) and Permanent TSB p.l.c. (PTSB), which subject to regulatory and other approvals and other conditions being satisfied, are expected to be completed during 2022 and 2023.\n\nSince the end of July 2021, (apart from the UBIDAC asset finance business), commercial banking has been closed to new customers, remaining open for existing customers only. Since the end of October 2021, we have stopped accepting applications from new personal customers, but continue to consider applications on a reduced number of products from existing personal customers, mainly mortgages.\n\nWe have focused on effective and timely communications, engaging with all customers impacted by the loan sales and launched the 'Choose, Move & Close' readiness campaign designed to give personal customers, especially those in vulnerable situations, as much notice as possible of the steps they will be required to take to move the products they hold with us that are not already covered by the sale agreements. This readiness campaign is an important step in our closure, not just for customers but for the industry too, as we work together to ensure the safe transition of customers to their new providers. With this in mind, we are engaging with the rest of the industry within the bounds of competition law, to allow them time to prepare for the volume of customers who will need to move or switch accounts. We are also engaging with the main direct debit originators and large employers to provide advance notice of the changes to allow them time to prepare to help their own customers and employees who will be switching accounts.\n\nIn July 2021, we launched our Customer Charter, a set of principles developed from our colleagues' ideas and suggestions for how we best serve customers and the communities in which we operate throughout the withdrawal process. This includes helping customers in vulnerable situations to close or move their accounts, continuing to provide financial education to customers and donating surplus office furniture to local communities and charities.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the phased withdrawal, our focus on colleague wellbeing has been a key priority. Listening sessions were held to answer questions and keep our colleagues informed. We also invested significantly in learning and development to support colleagues, which has included one-to-one career coaching sessions and career development focus workshops.\n\nThe results above are presented for continuing operations.

        "page_content": "## Section 172(1) statement\n\nIn this statement we describe how our directors have had regard to the matters set out in section 172(1) (a) to (f) of the Companies Act 2006 (section 172) when performing their duty to promote the success of the company.\n\n## Board engagement with stakeholders\n\nThe Board reviews and confirms its key stakeholder groups for the purposes of section 172 annually. For 2021, they remained customers, colleagues, communities, investors, regulators and suppliers. Examples of how the Board has engaged with key stakeholders, including the impact on principal decisions, can be found in this statement and on pages 14 to 17 (stakeholder engagement) and pages 102 to 113 (Corporate governance report).\n\n## Supporting effective Board discussions and decision-making\n\nOur purpose continues to influence Board discussions and decision-making.\n\nOur Board and Committee terms of reference reinforce the importance of considering both our purpose and the matters set out in section 172. Our Board and Committee paper template includes a section for authors to explain how the proposal or update aligns with our purpose and a separate section for them to include an assessment of the relevant stakeholder impacts for the directors to consider.\n\nOur directors are mindful that it is not always possible to achieve an outcome which meets the requirements, needs and/or expectations of all stakeholders who are, or may be, impacted. For decisions which are particularly challenging or complex, we introduced an additional page to our paper template in 2021 which provides directors with further information to support purposeful decision-making. This additional page uses the Blueprint for Better Business as a base and is aligned to our broader purpose framework.\n\n## Principal decisions\n\nPrincipal decisions are those decisions taken by the Board that are material, or of strategic importance, to the company, or are significant to NatWest Group's key stakeholders.\n\n## This statement describes three examples of principal decisions taken by the Board during 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLikely long-term consequences.\n\nEmployee interests.\n\nRelationships with customers, suppliers and others.\n\nThe impact on community and environment.\n\nMaintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct.\n\nActing fairly between members of the company.\n\n## Withdrawing from the Republic of Ireland\n\n## Factors considered:\n\n## What was the decision-making process?\n\nIn February 2021, the Board took the decision to commence a phased withdrawal from the Republic of Ireland. This was a very carefully considered decision by the Board that followed a strategic review of the Ulster Bank business in the Republic of Ireland, which concluded that Ulster Bank Ireland Designated Activity Company (UBIDAC) would not be able to generate sustainable long-term returns for NatWest Group plc's shareholders. Alongside the decision to withdraw, it was announced that a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding with Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c had been entered into in connection with the sale of a portion of UBIDAC's performing commercial loan book.\n\nTo support the Board in its decision-making, it received comprehensive papers prepared by management which updated the Board on the progress of each stage of the strategic review and sought the Board's support to proceed to the next stage. These papers included detailed analysis of the potential options available to execute the withdrawal (including potential counterparties and transactions), valuations, financial impacts, key risks, and stakeholder impacts and engagement plans. During its discussions, the Board acknowledged the complexity and challenges of a withdrawal and the various options were explored through the lenses of time, value, execution risk and stakeholder impacts.\n\n## How did the directors fulfil their duties under section 172? How were stakeholder interests considered?\n\nAt each stage of the strategic review the directors were mindful of their duties under section 172 including the likely long-term consequences of the decision. Each update the Board received provided an overview of relevant stakeholder considerations. The Board discussed in detail the various stakeholders that would be impacted (including shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, regulators and communities), what their concerns were likely to be and the key messages that would support engagement. The Chairman and Group CEO undertook engagement directly with key stakeholders and reported back to the Board on their discussions. The UBIDAC CEO also attended each meeting at which the strategic review was discussed to provide direct feedback to the Board on stakeholder concerns and considerations.\n\n## How was our purpose considered as part of the decision?\n\nConsidering relevant stakeholder interests is key to purposeful decision-making. Our new purposeful decision-making page was used to provide the Board with a detailed analysis of stakeholder considerations and impacts, using the Blueprint for Better Business framework. Having taken the decision to withdraw, the Board agreed this should be done in an orderly manner that was considerate to customers, colleagues, suppliers and other stakeholders.\n\n## Actions and outcomes\n\nThe Board continues to receive updates on the execution of the withdrawal. A binding agreement was subsequently reached with Allied Irish Banks p.l.c. on the sale of the majority of UBIDAC's performing commercial lending portfolio.\n\n## Approving capital distributions\n\n## Approving our refreshed values\n\nFactors considered:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What was the decision-making process?\n\nDuring 2021, the Board recommended a final dividend, agreed to participate in a directed buyback of ordinary shares from Her Majesty's Treasury, approved an interim dividend and agreed to commence an on-market buyback of ordinary shares, as well as providing outlook guidance to investors on capital distributions.\n\nThe Board's decisions were informed by the 2021 capital distribution plans as well as regular updates on NatWest Group plc's financial and capital positions. A key focus of Board-level discussions was how surplus capital was being managed.\n\nThe Group Board Risk Committee also reviewed all capital distributions proposals in advance of Board consideration, and recommended them to the Board for approval.\n\n## How did the directors fulfil their duties under section 172? How were stakeholder interests considered?\n\nAgain, in taking decisions, the directors were mindful of their duties under section 172. For the dividend decisions the directors were particularly focused on whether the declaration of a dividend would support the long-term sustainable success of the company. The Board also sought advice from NatWest Group plc's corporate brokers on investor expectations in respect of the outlook guidance.\n\n## How was our purpose considered as part of the decision?\n\nThe Board is aware that in taking decisions on capital distributions, it also needs to consider the financial implications of those decisions in terms of continuing to support customers and maintaining financial stability.\n\n## Actions and outcomes\n\nThe final dividend of 3 pence per ordinary share was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in April 2021 and an interim dividend of 3 pence per ordinary share was approved by the Board in July 2021.\n\nThe outlook guidance on capital distributions was announced as part of the 2020 annual results in February 2021. It stated that, subject to market conditions, the company intended to maintain ordinary dividends of around 40% of attributable profit and aimed to distribute a minimum of \u00a3800 million per annum from 2021 to 2023 via a combination of ordinary and special dividends. This was updated by the Board in July 2021 which increased the outlook guidance for capital distributions from \u00a3800 million to \u00a31 billion for 2021 and future periods (again subject to market conditions).\n\nIn March 2021, the company participated in a directed buyback of ordinary shares from Her Majesty's Treasury and in July 2021 the Board agreed to commence an on-market buyback of ordinary shares, further reducing the UK Government's shareholding in NatWest Group plc.\n\nFactors considered:\n\n## What was the decision-making process?\n\nIn July 2021, the Board received an update on the work being undertaken to refresh our values and the related behavioural framework to provide greater alignment to our purpose and strategy. At that time, the Board confirmed its support for the refresh and noted that the final proposal would be brought back to the Board for approval.\n\nIn December 2021, the Board was presented with detailed proposals from management seeking approval for the recommended refreshed values and behaviours. The paper explained the behavioural science and data-led approach that had been adopted and the range of stakeholders that had been engaged. The paper also set out the first draft of the people proposition that would be aligned to the refreshed values. The Board discussed the proposals and provided positive feedback on both the approach taken and the refreshed values.\n\n## How did the directors fulfil their duties under section 172? How were stakeholder interests considered?\n\nThe paper explained very clearly the stakeholder engagement that had been undertaken in developing the refreshed values and the draft people proposition, both in terms of the stakeholder groups consulted (which included colleagues, customers and communities) and the methods of engagement used (such as interviews with senior executives, workshops, focus groups, digital surveys, external partner review by Blueprint for Better Business and virtual engagement). A stakeholder overview also set out stakeholder impacts and a number of Board members provided direct input and feedback as part of the stakeholder engagement process. Colleagues were, understandably, the key focus of the Board's discussions.\n\n## How was our purpose considered as part of the decision?\n\nThe refresh of our values was undertaken to provide greater alignment with our purpose and strategy and the Board acknowledged this as part of its discussions.\n\n## Actions and outcomes\n\nThe Board approved the refreshed values in December 2021 and noted the intention to launch them to colleagues, customers and communities in 2022.\n\n'The Board knows how important it is to engage with our stakeholders, to listen to them and to consider their interests during Board discussions and decision-making. Understanding the needs of our stakeholders is at the core of our purpose framework.'\n\nHoward Davies, Chairman",

        "page_content": "Listening, engaging and partnering with our stakeholders is vital for the success of our business. It helps us to address our operational impacts and improve outcomes for customers, society and the environment. In the following sections we detail some of the notable steps we have taken to respond to our stakeholders' changing requirements during 2021.\n\n## Customers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Listening and responding to our customers\n\nWe want to know what our customers think about us. It helps us better understand their needs and improve the products and services we offer.\n\nTo achieve this, we have in place a framework of independent customer feedback surveys that measure satisfaction across our business segments. In terms of customer advocacy in 2021, Net Promoter Scores (NPS) for Retail Banking improved by six points for NatWest and seven points for Royal Bank of Scotland. Business Banking NPS remained flat. In Commercial Banking NPS declined by two points for NatWest and six points for Royal Bank of Scotland. Refer to page 56 for the full breakdown of scores.\n\nThe insight from these surveys is reported at the most senior levels of the bank and plays a crucial role in how we address the evolving requirements of our customers. In 2021, we responded to customer feedback with a range of innovative solutions.\n\nSo that customers can settle payments easily between family and friends (without the need to share account details or hold cash), we launched 'PayMe'. This service uses Payit, our Open Banking Payments solution, to request a payment from anyone who uses online or mobile banking and has a participating UK Bank account. Payment can be made via a link or QR code, which can be scanned by any device with a camera.\n\nOur approach to Open Banking and the innovative use of data has also created opportunities for reusing services and capabilities across NatWest Group products, making it simpler and quicker to develop and deploy them to our customers.\n\nFor example, through Tyl, Payit and Mettle we will be able to offer a seamless, one-bank payments proposition, delivering personalised, smart insights for businesses so they can track sales, target customers and grow loyalty.\n\nElsewhere, a new feature launched in 2021 in the mobile banking app to enable our retail and commercial customers to deposit cheques has swiftly become one of the app's most used features - testament to both the demand for, and usability of the function. For our Commercial Banking customers, we also enhanced our digital platform offering 'Bankline', with new and improved functionality within the service.\n\n## Making banking more accessible\n\nWe recognise that our customers' individual needs are all different. As such, we aim to make banking as accessible as possible for everyone, offering our customers the ability to choose from a variety of face-to-face, digital and remote options.\n\nWe have more than 800 branches and 16,000 physical points of presence, including our ATM network and our relationship with the Post Office, which remain an important part of how we deliver services to our customers and communities.\n\n## Customer trust\n\nNatWest\n\n74%\n\nQ4 2021\n\n76%\n\nQ4 2020\n\nRoyal Bank of Scotland\n\n68%\n\nQ4 2021\n\n61%\n\nQ4 2020\n\nSource: Yonder reputation tracker, GB, trust amongst Retail Banking customers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCustomers can now also take greater digital control of their finances through our mobile app, including the ability to open an account, check their credit score and apply for a mortgage. Our app is compatible with both Apple and Android accessibility features such as inverting colours and magnifiers, as well as biometric log-ins. We have also introduced a dark/ light mode for customers with visual impairments or dyslexia. Our AI virtual assistant, Cora supports customers via the 'message us' feature in the app, and our contact centre colleagues are just a click away with the 'tap to call' function.\n\nWhen our customers want the reassurance of a face-to-face conversation remotely, our video banking service is available. We offer customers who require additional support a range of accessibility services, such as accessible statements in braille, large print and audio CD. BT's Relay UK service also supports customers with hearing impairments through a type-to-talk service, while accessible card readers, rubber signature stamps, braille card wallets and our talking ATM service are other key accessibility features.\n\n## Combating financial crime\n\nDetecting and preventing financial crime to protect people, families and businesses is a key priority for NatWest Group. Along with other major banks and telecoms companies, we participated in a pilot scheme to introduce a hotline to help fight fraud across the industry and protect our customers from fraud and scams.\n\nSpearheaded by Stop Scams UK (SSUK), the phone number '159' is designed to disrupt scams in which victims have been contacted or engaged by a scammer via phishing or impersonation. The number works by encouraging customers experiencing suspected fraud to stop, hang up and call 159, at which point they are directed to their bank.\n\n## Supporting customers in vulnerable situations\n\nAt any time, a customer may find themselves either in a vulnerable situation or caring for a loved one experiencing a vulnerability. The continuing impact of COVID-19 has meant that for many of our customers this was a reality in 2021. Our dedicated customer care line, which was set up in response to the pandemic, has continued to support a significant number of our customers in 2021. Our support service 'Banking My Way' continues to develop, with customers now able to tell us about the support they need by updating their details in the new mobile app function.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to work with organisations such as 'GamCare' and the 'Money Advice Trust' to improve the support available to customers in vulnerable situations, connecting them to expert advice where appropriate. We also significantly expanded our referral programme with Citizens Advice, connecting customers to their advisers where we identify additional advice or vulnerability needs. In February 2021, with the domestic abuse charity SafeLives, we launched The Circle Fund. The Circle Fund, available for three years, supports SafeLives to provide small grants to help economic abuse victims and survivors to regain financial confidence and control. This follows from our announcement to donate \u00a31 million for the fund in 2020.\n\nWe know how important our branches are to our customers. But we also know that the ways in which our customers live, work and bank have altered dramatically in the past two years. To meet these changing needs and to help people, families and businesses to rebuild and thrive, we plan to turn our branches into sustainable local banking hubs.\n\nWe want to provide our customers a space in the heart of our high streets with a range of specialist services, venturing beyond traditional banking to help break down barriers to enterprise and increase financial capability. Our Broadmead Bristol hub, which opened earlier in 2021, is the first example of this.\n\nWithin the hubs, retail customers are able to connect face-to-face and learn more about financial education and how to best manage their money, and businesses can access expert advice and collaboration spaces. The hubs will also include enterprise zones, where potential and current customers can liaise with local enterprise managers and other specialists with access to initiatives such as 'Women in Business' or our 'Accelerator' programme.\n\nAmong the other features are: dedicated events and learning spaces, which can also be used by local charities or community groups; customer hot desks offering free Wi-Fi; private consultation rooms, where we can provide confidential assistance to customers both face to face and digitally; and self-service areas with colleague assistance to support people with simple banking transactions quickly and conveniently.\n\nAnd from listening to our customers, we understand that managing the environmental impact of the space is vital. To help reduce waste and promote sustainability, we've incorporated recycled furniture, included water bottle refill stations for customers and removed paper marketing materials. We'll also measure the climate impact of our new local banking hubs through the SKA and Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) assessments.",

and engagement\n\n## Private investors\n\nWe engaged with our private investors through our Annual General Meeting (AGM), virtual shareholder events, and our annual and strategic report communications.\n\nIn light of ongoing restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, investors were not be able to attend the 2021 AGM in person. However, we held a live virtual shareholder event a week prior to the AGM. Investors were invited to submit questions either in advance of, or during, the virtual event and the answers to questions on key themes were displayed on our website.\n\nIn addition, we held two further virtual events in July and November 2021. At these events, we spoke about the work NatWest Group is doing to support and stimulate enterprise, why it was so important for us to sponsor COP26 and how tackling climate change is at the core of our purpose. These virtual shareholder events remain a key component of our stakeholder engagement programme and provide an opportunity for private investors to hear from, and ask questions of, Board members and senior management on topics such as innovation, enterprise, sustainability and our financial performance. It is our intention to deliver further virtual events in 2022.\n\nIn addition, we published investor updates on the topics of 'Championing Enterprise' and 'Our Purpose: Beyond COP26'. These updates provided information on initiatives such as the relaunch of our enterprise programme, the additional \u00a31 billion in funding to help support female-led businesses in the UK recover from the pandemic, the introduction of our carbon footprint tracker for our mobile app and our launch of the UK's first carbon-neutral podcast. Our investor updates and recordings of our virtual events can be found on our website.\n\n## Institutional investors\n\nWe have a well-established programme of engagement with our institutional investors. The financial year begins with a presentation on our annual results in February, hosted by our Chairman, CEO and CFO. This live event includes an interactive Q&A session to give research analysts and investors an opportunity to ask questions and engage with our management team. We then follow up quarterly with presentations to the market when we announce each set of financial results in April, July and October. While these events could not be held face to face in 2021, we were able to host a live presentation and Q&A session via Zoom, enabling the same level of interaction in a virtual forum.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to the quarterly results presentations, we hosted a programme of virtual one-to-one and group meetings with institutional investors from around the world. Across our management team, we hosted over 250 meetings with investors covering key topics such as progress against our financial targets, strategic priorities, innovation, ESG and industry challenges. While the total number of one-to-one meetings was lower than the prior year when we saw an unusually heightened demand for time with management due to the pandemic, our CEO and CFO engaged regularly with UK Government Investments and our largest active institutional investors throughout the year.\n\nTo enhance our investor relations programme during a challenging time when we were unable to meet face to face, we hosted a series of 'Meet the Exco' and business spotlight presentations via Zoom. These events gave analysts and investors the opportunity to hear from key members of our executive team as they discussed their priorities for the year ahead and to ask questions live over Zoom.\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues were regularly discussed at our one-to-one meetings and we also engaged with specialist socially responsible investors through a programme of meetings with ESG analysts from institutional investors, presentations at ESG-focused conferences and increased interactions with sustainability rating agencies.\n\nAlongside the virtual shareholder events mentioned above, members of our Board hosted a live virtual corporate governance forum. This gave investors the opportunity to hear an update on Board priorities in 2021 and the opportunity for a discussion on corporate governance topics directly with our non-executive directors.\n\nA key development in terms of the transparency of our business during 2021 was the enhancement of two key areas of our non-financial reporting. In recognition that climate change is a critical global issue which has significant implications for our investors (as well as our customers, employees, suppliers and partners), we produced our first standalone Climate-related Disclosures Report in February 2021. This comprehensive document was a material step towards alignment with the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and recommended disclosures. The report covered our climate strategy and associated ambitions, governance, scenario analysis, risk management and climate-related metrics.\n\nWe also produced our first Environmental, Social and Governance Supplement - providing investors and other stakeholders with a deeper understanding of the work that we are doing to understand and manage issues facing our business, customers, communities and society as a whole.",

        "page_content": "## Colleagues\n\n## Helping our colleagues to thrive\n\nWe want NatWest Group to be a great place to work. By offering a fulfilling job, a healthy workplace, fair rewards, excellent development and great leadership, we believe together our colleagues can thrive and unlock the full potential of NatWest Group.\n\nOur People Pledge sets out commitments and initiatives in direct response to what colleagues tell us is important to help them in their jobs. Throughout 2021, we have worked with colleagues to champion their potential across all five parts of the pledge: 'Help you develop your skills'; 'Support your wellbeing'; 'Help customers thrive'; 'Create inclusive and connected teams'; and 'Help you make a difference'.\n\nThe pandemic has drastically altered how we work and has changed (perhaps forever) the relationship between employers and employees. We listen to our colleagues and use this insight to attract, engage and retain the best talent for the future. Our colleague listening strategy - which includes: our colleague opinion surveys; a Colleague Advisory Panel (CAP) that connects colleagues directly with our Board; the 'Colleague Experience Squad', a group of colleagues who volunteer to provide feedback on colleague products and services; and Workplace, our social media platform - contributes to our deeper understanding of colleague sentiment. We also track metrics and key performance indicators which we can benchmark with sector and high-performing comparisons.\n\nOver 46,700 colleagues (81%) participated in our September 2021 Our View survey. The results showed that colleague sentiment remains strong, despite the pandemic. Lead measures in culture, purpose, inclusion and building capability showed a continued and sustained year-on-year improvement (+1 percentage point each). Across all 15 measured categories, NatWest Group sits an average of 11 percentage points above the Global Financial Services Norm (GFSN) and five percentage points above the Global High Performance Norm (GHPN). (1)\n\nRegular interactions with our employee representatives such as trade unions, elected employee bodies and works councils are a vital means of transparency and engagement for us. We frequently use these sessions to discuss developments and updates on the progress of our strategic priorities. In 2021, topics included 'ways of working' and 'health and safety in the context of the pandemic'. We are also committed to respecting our employees' rights of freedom of association across all our business. In addition, our CAP was set up in 2018 to help promote colleague voices in the boardroom. For full details, refer to the Corporate governance report and ESG Supplement.\n\n## Performance and reward\n\nOur approach to performance management provides clarity for our colleagues on how their contribution links to our purpose, with all colleagues set performance goals across a balanced scorecard of measures. We continue to ensure employees are paid fairly for the work they do and are supported by simple and transparent pay structures in line with industry best practices.\n\n(1)  NatWest Group Our View results exclude Ulster Bank RoI.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe keep our policies and processes under review to ensure we do so. In general, the scores from the reward category in Our View declined since 2020, although in all but one category they remain above the GFSN. We will be looking to address this, subject to performance, in 2022.\n\nIn the UK, our rates of pay continue to exceed the Living Wage Foundation benchmarks and we ensure employees performing the same roles are paid fairly. We ensure colleagues have an awareness of financial and economic factors affecting our performance through quarterly 'Results Explained' communications and 'Workplace Live' events with our Group Chief Executive Officer and Group Chief Financial Officer. Refer to our Directors' remuneration report for full details on our remuneration policies and employee share plans.\n\n## Helping colleagues realise their potential\n\nAt NatWest Group, we exist to champion potential and help people, families, and businesses to thrive - helping them at every stage of their lives. We'll achieve our ambition to be a relationship bank for a digital world by working together as one team, across NatWest Group. Investing in our workforce in a variety of ways helps us achieve that. To support this, we're building a learning organisation that tests ideas and learns every day - helping colleagues develop the capabilities to stay relevant and employable for the future.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the pace of change, and it is likely that predictions made for 5-10 years' time working seamlessly alongside robotics, smarter uses of AI and collaboration across organisations and boundaries - will become the norm more quickly. This will have a significant impact on how people work and the capabilities they will need to thrive in this new world.\n\nAt NatWest Group, we believe that we have an obligation to help build skills across our industry. Working with the Financial Services Skills Commission, we led the build of an industrywide skills framework that is available via an online tool to all financial services organisations in the UK. Its purpose is to create a consistent language around skills across the industry - which in turn will support mobility and is in line with our commitment to support wider communities.\n\nIn 2021, we provided all colleagues with access to build future skills through the NatWest Group Learning Academy, bringing together learning opportunities and curated content into a single place. This supports our commitment for all colleagues to be upskilled in future-focused skills by 2025. Around 80% of colleagues have used it since it launched in 2020 and, in 2021, we've offered new topics including cybersecurity and innovation. It has helped us to increase colleague learning completions by 10%, with our target (aligned to the UN Sustainable Development Goals) to increase them by 50% at the end of 2023.\n\nAs well as increasing our colleagues' learning and development, we're also focused on ensuring that it's the right kind. We have made a commitment that half of all learning at NatWest Group is focused on building critical skills for the future. We have prioritised data and digital capability and have given our colleagues access to a range of opportunities to build these skills through the NatWest Group Academy. Early\n\nprogress is positive with data learning up 134% and digital learning up 31%. We also continue to invest in our people to do their job, with 99.6% of our front-line colleagues professionally accredited within their first 18 months in role.\n\nWe are committed to reskilling colleagues whenever possible. The Mobility Hub supports with redeploying colleagues and reskilling them for future work. In 2021, we commenced our first formal reskill programme, with 20 colleagues who were at risk of redundancy taking the opportunity to reskill as software engineers. Of these, 17 accepted permanent positions.\n\nIn 2021, we launched our global Talent Academy to help identify and develop colleagues with high potential through a programme of challenging and purposeful development opportunities. For the first time, colleagues were encouraged to self-nominate regardless of role, level, working pattern and location. Following a robust assessment process, 3,911 colleagues were accepted on to the programme. The cohort is 53% male and 47% female, and 23% of the successful applicants come from a Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic background, thus providing NatWest Group with a diverse talent pipeline for the future.\n\nAs we committed to, we hired over 1,000 interns, graduates and apprentices in 2021; including 205 colleagues who were recruited through our social mobility apprentice programmes and we aim to hire a further 1,100 interns, graduates and apprentices in 2022.\n\nWe are also focusing on building our leaders' capabilities, which is critical to delivering our purpose-led strategy. Our 'Determined to Lead' programme has helped focus and energise our people leaders, cultivating a framework for common leadership behaviours and practices. In addition, our leadership, talent and career support activity is enabled by our new Leadership and Coaching Faculty. This resource gives our leaders access to clear thinking, relevant frameworks and problem-solving approaches at the point of need.\n\nSupporting this, our succession planning processes enhance our framework to spot, develop and mobilise a diverse pool of our most promising talent. Successors are assessed and developed against a purpose-led profile that defines the behaviours, traits and drivers associated with success in a purpose-led role and organisation. Our Succession Council gives bank ExCo successors the opportunity to engage directly with the CEO and other ExCo members to ensure they have the potential and aspiration to reach ExCo level. Our most talented senior leaders are given exposure through Board & Talent sessions with interactive sessions discussing topics that are shaping the direction of NatWest Group.\n\nFollowing the success of our first NatWest Junior Management Team (JMT), a second cohort was selected in September 2021. The JMT mirrors the NatWest Group Executive Committee and brings a fresh perspective and voice to that team. They also deliver key strategic projects to broaden their experience, exposure and connections across NatWest Group.\n\nRefer to our ESG Supplement for full details on how we support colleagues to realise their potential.\n\nReferences to 'colleagues' in this Strategic report mean all members of our workforce (for example, contractors, agency workers).\n\n## Supporting our colleagues' wellbeing\n\nTo be part of NatWest Group means being part of something bigger than ourselves, where the strength of our culture underpins everything we do; an organisation where we all learn, grow, thrive and support each other. A vital part of this is having a fully embedded wellbeing strategy; refer to our ESG Supplement for full details.\n\n## Diversity, equity and inclusion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCreating a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace is integral to fulfilling our purpose. It enables us to truly connect with, and serve, our diverse customers and communities with the products and services they need. We remain committed to progressing our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy, focusing on becoming gender balanced, ethnically diverse, disability smart, LGBT+ innovative and an inclusive workplace.\n\n## Inclusive workplace\n\nColleague sentiment on inclusivity continued to increase in 2021, reaching a score of 93 percentage points. We are 14 percentage points above the GFSN and 10 percentage points above the GHPN. Although sentiment has increased in all colleague groups, our focus is now on where scores may vary for our minority colleague groups.\n\nOur 2021 Inclusion Week showcased diversity, equity and inclusion across our business. This offered time to reflect on why we need a diverse and inclusive workplace, to celebrate the progress we are making, and challenge ourselves to do more. We also continued to focus on behavioural change through new and enhanced learning modules. These include our mandatory learning and additional optional learning (such as 'Choose to Challenge', which educates colleagues on the importance of challenging behaviours that are not inclusive). For more details refer to our ESG Supplement.\n\nWe continued to support our employee-led networks, which have around 24,000 members globally. These include: Gender, Multicultural, Disability, Rainbow (LGBT+), Armed Forces, Families & Carers, Sustainable Futures, and Aspire. In 2021, NatWest Markets Americas' Energized Employees Network (and sub-networks) focused on uniting and empowering colleagues by running several events and initiatives, including 'One Small Step: The George Floyd Verdict' hosted by the Black Professional Network and 'New Ways of Working and the Impact on Women' hosted by the Gender Network.\n\nWe have been listed in the 'Working Families Benchmark Top 10 Employers', showing that we are among those leading the way in building a flexible, family-friendly workplace. We have also been accredited as a 'Good Work Standard' employer at Excellence (highest) level by the Mayor of London's office.\n\nWe marked 'South Asian Heritage Month' with cultural celebrations and awareness campaigns that define the diverse cultural tapestry of our South Asian colleagues. We ran events (such as wedding traditions across different faiths) and created a memory wall for colleagues to share personal histories.\n\nFor the third consecutive year, NatWest Poland received the highest score in 'Diversity IN CHECK' - a certification granted to employers well advanced in managing diversity and inclusion considerations.",

        "page_content": "## Gender balanced\n\nOur Board composition exceeds the FTSE Women Leaders target with a figure of 36% female representation. We have female representation of 29% on our executive management team, with a female Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, Chief People & Transformation Officer and Chief Governance Officer & Company Secretary.\n\nWe have a target to have full gender balance in our CEO-3 and above global roles by 2030. At 31 December 2021, we had, on aggregate, 38% women in our top three layers, a decline of 1% since 31 December 2020. While representing an increase of 9% since targets were introduced in 2015, we know we have more to do and we continue to focus on the recruitment, retention and advancement of women to meet our 2030 target.\n\nThe mean gender pay gap for NatWest Bank is 30.1% (median: 34.2%) and the mean gender bonus gap is 26.0% (median: 12.5%). The statutory bonus gap calculated in line with regulation is the number including recognition vouchers (mean 50.5%; median 92.9%). This means that even colleagues who received a small recognition voucher - for example a \u00a310 voucher - are included in the calculations. Most colleagues in our more junior jobs only receive fixed pay - a change made to provide more certainty over earnings; and this means that many colleagues included in the statutory bonus gap calculations only received a recognition voucher. We currently have a higher proportion of women in these roles. We therefore believe the figures excluding recognition vouchers, 26.0% (median: 12.5%), are the most accurate reflection of our gender bonus gap today.\n\nIn line with being a signatory to HM Treasury's 'Women in Finance Charter', we are committed to implementing its four key industry actions for gender balance across financial services. Executive Sponsor for Gender, David Lindberg (CEO, Retail Banking), is also part of the external Accountable Executive Taskforce for the Charter.\n\nIn 2021, we were listed as a 'Times Top 50 Employer for Women' for the 11th consecutive year. For the fifth year, we've retained our place in Bloomberg's 'Global Gender Equality Index'. NatWest Group India was recognised as the 'Winner of Gender Inclusive Workplace' by 'UN Women Asia Pacific Awards 2021' for the region and as a 'Top 10 Best Workplaces for Women 2021', awarded by the Great Place to Work (GPTW) Institute, India. Elsewhere, NatWest Poland won the 'Fair to Women' award, in recognition of their initiatives and, more specifically, for supporting women in technology.\n\nWe continued our long-standing collaboration with Women in Banking and Finance (WiBF), a volunteer-led organisation which aims to connect members to thought leaders, business leaders and women at all stages of their careers. Alison Rose was presented with WiBF's first President's Award, recognising her contribution to financial services over many years.\n\n## Ethnically diverse\n\nIntroduced in 2018, our ethnicity target is to have 14% Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues in our top four layers (CEO-4 and above) in the UK by 2025. At 31 December 2021,\n\nof 86% of colleagues who disclosed their ethnicity in the top four layers in the UK, we have on aggregate 11% Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues. This represents a 3% increase since targets were introduced. Overall, of those who disclose their ethnicity, 17% of colleagues in the UK identify as Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic.\n\nIn line with our commitment to transparency under the UK Government's Race at Work Charter and in anticipation of a requirement to disclose our ethnicity pay gap, we have voluntarily disclosed our ethnicity pay gap for NatWest Group combined UK & Ireland. The mean ethnicity pay gap for NatWest Group is 9.3% (median: 13.0%). The mean ethnicity bonus gap for NatWest Group is 24.2% (median: 17.9%). These bonus gap numbers are excluding recognition vouchers, the numbers including recognition vouchers are 32.8% (median 46.3%).\n\nWe are proud to be placed in the 'Top 10 Outstanding Employers' as part of 'Investing in Ethnicity Employer's Maturity Matrix', a position we have held since its inception in 2018. The Matrix creates a framework and provides a benchmark to assist employers on their ethnicity journey.\n\nIn 2020, we launched the Racial Equality Taskforce to listen, learn and better understand the barriers faced by colleagues, customers and communities from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic backgrounds. The Taskforce set out ten commitments in the Banking on Racial Equality report, including a new UK target to have Black colleagues occupying 3% of UK roles (CEO-5 and above) by 2025. At 31 December 2021, we have 1.5% of colleagues who identify as Black in the top five layers in the UK. Overall, of those who disclose their ethnicity, 2% of our colleagues in the UK identify as Black. In 2021, we published a first anniversary update on the report, for full details refer to natwestgroup.com.\n\nIn October, we celebrated Black History Month 2021 with a theme of Black Excellence. This provided opportunities to celebrate Black people striving to be the best version of themselves, and spotlight Black role models excelling in their chosen fields. We ran events throughout the month, with a keynote lecture from Lord Simon Woolley, supported by our Executive Sponsors for Ethnicity Simon McNamara (Chief Administration Officer) and Nigel Prideaux (Chief Communications Officer).\n\nIn 2021, we relaunched our Ethnicity Advisory Council to support our ethnicity and inclusion strategy. Chaired by Simon McNamara, nominated diversity and inclusion specialists from different industries will provide critical challenge, guidance, and direction on our strategy.\n\n## Disability smart\n\nIn 2021, we re-launched a career development programme on a virtual platform for colleagues with a disability to explore common barriers which impede progress and provide access to tools and techniques to help overcome them.\n\nWe undertook a discovery session with Lexxic (specialist psychology consultants) to help us create an environment where neurodiversity can flourish. This helped inform us of areas for improvement, with the aim of exploring how to\n\nbecome an even more neuroinclusive employer. We have a roadmap in place, with five key areas: governance and strategy; awareness and education; positive management culture; attracting and retaining neurodiverse talent; and future ways of working.\n\nSince 2019 we have sponsored the Business Disability Forum's (BDF) Scottish Disability Conference, bringing together organisations to support each other in becoming disability smart. In 2021, the conference ran virtually and consisted of workshops which facilitated group discussions on topics including disability and diversity in the wake of COVID-19, how to have conversations about disability at work, and supporting neurodiverse colleagues in the workplace. The workshops had more than 330 attendees.\n\nIn 2021, we refreshed our disability smart e-learning module to help colleagues understand how we can be more inclusive and accessible for all colleagues and customers. The module included an overview of why accessibility is important from our Executive Sponsor for Disability, Oliver Holbourn (Director of Strategy & Ventures) and featured colleagues sharing experiences.\n\nOur efforts to be disability smart are recognised through a gold rating in the BDF benchmark and Leader (the highest level) status in the UK Government's Disability Confident Scheme.\n\nIn India, we launched an On-Demand Sign Language programme to facilitate access to sign language interpreters for colleagues with hearing impairments for one-on-one discussion and team meetings. NatWest Group India received special recognition for disability smart work practices at the GPTW Diversity & Inclusion Award Summit 2021. In Poland, we ran a 'Becoming Disability Smart' project to increase support for colleagues with disabilities. A new assistive technology and workplace adjustment process was introduced, as well as updated safety arrangements for disabled colleagues.\n\n## LGBT+ innovative\n\nIn 2021, we celebrated Pride by running a host of different events that celebrated some of the successes we've had with progressing our work. We also participated in the UK Stonewall Workplace Equality Index to understand what more we can do to support our LGBT+ colleagues and customers. This will provide us with a definitive benchmark and allow us to assess our achievements and progress on LGBT+ equality going forward. Our Executive Sponsor for LGBT+, Jen Tippin (Chief People & Transformation Officer), is guiding and shaping our roadmap for the future.\n\nDuring 2021, we created a new LGBT+ e-learning module to be launched in 2022. The module focuses on establishing colleagues' understanding of various subjects across the gender identity and sexual orientation spectrum. Our global learning uses colleagues' perspectives and insights from external partners to enhance understanding. We also reviewed and updated our international travel safety guidance for LGBT+ colleagues and our family friendly policies to ensure language and scenarios are LGBT+ inclusive.\n\nAs a founding partner of the British LGBT Awards in 2015, we continued our support in 2021 as a sponsor.

We firmly believe NatWest Group has a role to play in this process, positively impacting communities at both a local and national level.\n\n## Focused on our communities\n\nDuring the year we worked with the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) to carry out dedicated research into community strength: 'Pillars of the Community' explored what government, business and the third sector can do to strengthen local communities as the UK recovers from the pandemic. The research identified the barriers that prevent local communities from thriving and set out a range of policy initiatives that could help to overcome these barriers.\n\nWe were also once again in regular contact with our communities, including through our regional boards, leveraging existing relationships and forming new ones. Our seven regional boards are key to delivering the bank's strategy at a local level and championing potential across the UK. With membership drawn from across the bank, the local insight and strong teamwork of the boards is vital in demonstrating our purpose to the communities we are part of.\n\nThe boards have been particularly important during the pandemic, bringing people together to help serve our customers and support our colleagues. In 2021, the regional boards continued to focus on engaging with colleagues, customers and communities across the nations and regions of the UK, particularly in the areas of climate, learning and enterprise.\n\n## Real-life support\n\nWe believe in supporting our customers with practical measures that can help them in their day-to-day lives. In doing so, we can provide part of the vital infrastructure that communities need to live and thrive, such as our mobile banking fleet, which visited nearly 600 communities every week in 2021.\n\nIn response to the pandemic we have changed the way we interact with our customers and communities, launching video banking so our customers can meet with us from the comfort of any location they choose. Elsewhere, NatWest Group's collaborations with Business in The Community (BITC), Hatch and Digital Boost are another vital link with our business communities, providing access to networks, sponsorship and mentorship opportunities.\n\n## Helping young people into work\n\nIn 2021, we launched our 'CareerSense' programme - which provides free-to-access tools to develop critical skills and support youth employability prospects for 13 to 24-year-olds especially for those from low-income families and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic backgrounds. In November 2021, we also\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYoung people have been hit hard by the pandemic. From disrupted study time to reduced job prospects, the current generation of pupils and school leavers will be feeling the shockwaves of COVID-19 for a long time to come. - Bless Chiwanda\n\nSo, when NatWest Group launched the CareerSense programme in 2021, I saw it as great way of offering some practical help, and welcomed the opportunity to get involved.\n\nAlong with almost 600 of my colleagues, who have also volunteered, I became a CareerSense Ambassador: a role that has involved me supporting a local high school in Edinburgh, running sessions for S4 pupils.\n\nThe experience has been great. Not just because of the positive feedback from the school, but because I've been able to see so many of the young people get engaged about their next steps. It's also given me the opportunity to reflect on my own personal development. To think about the skills and behaviours I use daily to deliver my work, while also making a positive change to my local community.\n\nSince its launch in June 2021, over 8,200 pupils have registered to attend a skills exploration workshop. That's a lot of young people getting the career support they need.\n\nwelcomed our first cohort to the CareerSense 'Find Your Path', an initiative for young people not in employment, education or training, which has been created and delivered in partnership with regional youth delivery partners. The scheme helps young people to benefit from a range of skills-development sessions, mentoring and paid work experience.\n\nTo support the CareerSense programme we have developed the mycareersense.com website, which offers access to a range of free tools and resources, as well as the learning content accessed through our NatWest Learning Academy.\n\nIn addition, we launched an external learning academy 'Learning with NatWest' in November 2021 which supports communities, families and businesses (both customers and non-customers), focusing on five key capabilities: climate; employability; entrepreneurship and enterprise; future skills; and financial capability. For more information, please refer to our NatWest Group ESG Supplement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Regulators\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ongoing dialogue\n\nWe operate in a highly regulated market which continues to evolve in scope. As such, we understand the need to have an ongoing, constructive and open dialogue with all relevant regulatory bodies.\n\nDuring 2021, this included bilateral responses to material consultations or other requests for comment/input issued by various government, regulatory and standard-setting bodies. Key consultations that NatWest Group has responded to bilaterally include the FCA's Consumer Duty proposals; its work on diversity and inclusion; the UK Government's plans for audit and corporate governance reform; the independent review of Ring-fencing and Proprietary Trading; and the Payment Systems Regulator's proposals on Authorised Push Payment (APP) scams.\n\nWe formally engage with our regulators, at both senior executive and Board level, as well as via individual nonexecutive directors, through continuous assessment and proactive engagement meetings. Most notably, during 2021, we kept our regulators fully informed of any contingencies and impacts on our operations as a result of COVID-19. This has been particularly relevant for monitoring compliance with the Financial Conduct Authority's Senior Managers and Certification Regime to ensure that all governance arrangements across NatWest Group have been kept under review in the context of the pandemic. We have also engaged with regulators during policy proposal phases on a number of occasions to help inform priorities.\n\n## Suppliers\n\n## Our Supplier Charter\n\nAs a purpose-led business, we foster strong relationships with all our key stakeholders, including our supply chains. In 2022, our ambition is to quantify the impact of all supplier activities through a supplier engagement framework.\n\nA key milestone towards this ambition was the launch of the NatWest Group 'Supplier Charter' in September 2020. The charter sets out our aims and expectations in the areas of ethical business conduct, human rights, environmental sustainability, diversity and inclusion, the Living Wage and prompt payment. It details what we expect from our suppliers, but also outlines our own commitments in these key areas and the outcomes we aim to achieve by working together. In 2021, led by NatWest Group's Chief Administrative Officer and with collaboration from subject matter experts and policy owners, we completed our first annual review of the charter.\n\nCentral to the aims of charter, we worked with EcoVadis - a leading organisation providing third-party, evidence-based assessments of sustainability performance. EcoVadis is helping us to understand and measure our own performance and that of our suppliers against the charter, enabling us to identify social, environmental and ethical improvements. NatWest Group has made significant progress in the first year of working with EcoVadis, with 834 suppliers invited to take part in the assessment, representing over 85% of our in-scope supplier spend. During 2021, NatWest Group Supply Chain Services has delivered the biggest and fastest deployment of EcoVadis supplier sustainability assessments in the UK.\n\n## Continuing to support our suppliers\n\nWe are determined to pay our suppliers promptly for the services that they provide to us. Our standard payment terms are normally 30 days. However, from earlier on in the COVID-19 pandemic and since, we have maintained immediate payment on receipt of goods and services whenever possible. This supports our suppliers during this difficult financial period and goes beyond our commitment undertaken as a signatory to the UK Government's 'Prompt Payment Code', which requires payment to be made in 60 days.",

This assessment of relative significance identified the following principal risks as being most exposed to climate-related impacts: credit risk; operational risk; reputational risk; conduct risk and regulatory compliance risk.\n- -NatWest Group regularly considers existing and emerging regulatory requirements related to climate change through external horizon scanning and monitoring of emerging regulatory requirements which is completed by our Legal, Governance and Regulatory Affairs team.\n\n## Future priorities\n\nContinue enhancements to our enterprise wide risk toolkit to support identification and assessment of risk impact on other principal risks.\n\n## References\n\nNatWest Group plc 2021 Climate-related Disclosures Report - section 3.1, 3.2, 4.1.\n\n## Our processes for managing climate-related risks\n\n## Summary\n\n- -The management of climate risk is largely delivered through three mechanisms: scenario analysis, long-term balance sheet transformation and enhanced climate risk data capabilities.\n- -NatWest Group has established a climate risk appetite statement, determining the level of risk which the climate risk policy seeks to operate within.\n- -A climate maturity rating was developed, which supports ongoing assessment of climate risk management throughout the organisation. This approach translated NatWest Group's climate risk policy into thematic management outcomes.\n- -As at 31 December 2021, NatWest Group has achieved first generation implementation of climate risk management, with a predominantly qualitative approach to internal risk policy outcomes, covering priority sectors or customers. Where quantitative approaches are applied, they are predominantly conducted on an ad hoc basis.\n\n## Future priorities\n\n- -Work will continue to further integrate climate-related risk across business processes to achieve full integration within risk management and decision-making.\n- -Future target state includes, but is not limited to, climate risk being systematically captured as a quantified risk factor within lending and risk decision-making, informing limits and pricing.\n\n## References\n\nNatWest Group plc 2021 Climate-related Disclosures Report - sections 3.1, 3.2, 4.2.\n\n## How our processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into overall risk management\n\n## Summary\n\n- -Retail credit risk: A review of EPC and flood impact was finalised for the Retail Banking residential mortgage portfolio; Credit oversight tracking of EPC and flood risk concentrations have been developed. In addition, preliminary climate operational measures were developed.\n- -Wholesale credit risk: Continued evolution of our credit risk frameworks to incorporate climate risk, for example its inclusion in Transaction Acceptance Standards (TAS) and in climate commentary within credit applications for the majority of the wholesale portfolio.\n- -Operational risk: NatWest Group-wide operational risk climate scenarios were completed in 2021.

        "page_content": "## Own operational footprint\n\nDuring 2021 (1) , we reduced our direct own operations (2) carbon footprint (3) 46% against 2019 baseline, and increased our renewable electricity consumption to 97%.\n\n## Net-zero carbon (3)\n\nWe plan to reduce the carbon footprint for our wider operational value chain by 50% (against a 2019 baseline) by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050.\n\nWhile there was previously no standard definition of net zero, as part of COP26, in October 2021 the SBTi released the 'SBTi Corporate Net Zero Standard', the world's first net zero framework which encapsulates the full value chain of Scope 3 and deep decarbonisation targets. To support NatWest Group's public commitments to the Net Zero Banking Alliance, we plan to align to the SBTi's definition for own operations and also account for the wider value (4) chain, including suppliers. We have a target to reduce our direct own operations carbon footprint by 50% by 2025 (2019 baseline) and plan to halve the carbon footprint of our wider operational value chain by 2030, with minimum 90% decarbonisation by 2050 for all emissions (refer section 5.7 of the NatWest Group plc 2021 Climaterelated Disclosures Report for approach to financed emissions). We intend to neutralise the remaining 10% of emissions with high quality internationally recognised carbon credits (5) to achieve net zero. We plan to continue making significant emission reductions within our own operations, alongside investments to mitigate GHG emissions through carbon removal projects, programmes and solutions that provide benefits to climate, especially those that generate additional co-benefits for people and nature, in line with SBTi guidance.\n\nAs the first part of our journey, we are disclosing an initial view of our upstream emissions for our 2021 footprint, with a plan to refine this view and disclose our downstream emissions for 2022. Further, from 2022, NatWest Group will be using the outputs from our 2021 energy audits to run a programme to improve our building EPC ratings, reducing our climate impact. Our 2021 total market-based operational footprint 66,149 tCO2e covers Scopes 1, 2 and our direct own operation upstream Scope 3. This includes emission reductions from the use of green electricity covering 97% of our consumption through green tariffs and renewable electricity certificates, but in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, it does not include emissions reduction from the use of carbon credits. Further detail on our decarbonisation plans can be found on page 71 of the NatWest Group plc 2021 Climate-related Disclosures Report.\n\nWhen announcing our Climate Positive (6) ambition in February 2020, the wide-ranging impacts from COVID-19 could not have\n\nbeen anticipated. By procuring a minimum 120,000 tCO2e in carbon credits, in line with our market-based 2019 baseline, while simultaneously reducing emissions from our own operations, we have already achieved our ambition to be Climate Positive in 2021 for our direct own operations. We used 120,000 tCO2e of internationally recognised carbon credits which add environmental, social and community benefits compared to the 2021 residual market-based 66,149 tCO2e Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. We had previously targeted a 25% reduction in emissions from our direct own operations by 2025 (2019 baseline) but are now increasing this to 50% as we seek to build on the emissions reductions that have already occurred.\n\n## Energy and carbon\n\nIn 2021, we reduced our direct operational Scope 1, 2 and 3 (business travel, paper, waste, water, commuting and work from home) emissions by 46% against a 2019 baseline. This has been through a number of emission reduction activities as well as impacts from COVID-19.\n\nDespite COVID-19, a number of key projects were still completed in 2021. Notable highlights include:\n\n- -Renewable power : NatWest Group has partnered to develop a solar generation facility in the UK under a corporate power purchase agreement. The facility is due to start generating low-carbon electricity for the bank from 2024 and will bring additional renewable generation capacity online to facilitate the decarbonisation of the UK power grid. Once constructed, the facility is expected to generate 40% of NatWest's electricity demand in the UK.\n- -Branch investments : The high-performance specification implemented for a branch fit-out in Bristol meant that we achieved an energy performance rating of 'B' and achieved Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) SKA Silver rating in terms of the design's broader sustainable design.\n- -Lifts : The first phase of a replacement passenger lift system at our offices at 250 Bishopsgate, London, leading to a 30% reduction in the energy use of the lifts; making the lifts 'A' rated in terms of energy.\n- -Building Management System investment : In our Coutts head office we have invested in 'out BMS controllers' which have provided a better environment for our colleagues and enable more efficient energy management from the facilities management team. We have also installed dashboard screens in the customer and colleague areas in both the Coutts head office and 250 Bishopsgate to educate on the energy usage of the buildings.\n\n## Streamlined energy and carbon reporting\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                        | 2021                       | 2021                                        | 2020                     | 2020                                        |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions                                                                                                                                         | UK and  offshore (1)  area | Global total  (excluding UK  and offshore)' | UK and offshore (1) area | Global total  (excluding UK   and offshore) |\n| Emissions from the combustion of fuel and operation of any facility   (Scope 1 (2)  Direct) CO2e (tonnes) (*)                                                          | 17,464                     | 1,663                                       | 18,443                   | 1,921                                       |\n| Emissions from the purchase of electricity, heat, steam or cooling by  the company for its own use (Scope 2 (3)  Indirect) Location-based  CO2e emissions (tonnes) (*) | 52,735                     | 16,305                                      | 63,841                   | 23,057                                      |\n| Total gross Scope 1 & Scope 2 (location-based) emissions CO2e (tonnes) (*)                                                                                             | 70,199                     | 17,968                                      | 82,284                   | 24,977                                      |\n| Energy consumption used to calculate above emissions (kWh)                                                                                                             | 329,396,747                | 40,652,346                                  | 347,909,621              | 49,510,271                                  |\n| Intensity ratio: Location-based CO2e emissions per FTE (Scope 1 & 2)  (tonnes/FTE)                                                                                     | 1.71                       | 1.03                                        | 1.83                     | 1.37                                        |\n| Scope 3 (4)  CO2e emissions from direct operations, paper, water, waste,  business travel, commuting and working from home (tonnes) (*)                                | 36,016                     | 8,855                                       | 38,502                   | 14,967                                      |\n| Total gross CO2e emissions for direct operations (Scope 1, location-based  Scope 2, Scope 3) (tonnes) (*)                                                              | 106,215                    | 26,823                                      | 120,787                  | 39,944                                      |\n| Intensity ratio: Location-based CO2e emissions per FTE (Scope 1, 2 & direct  operations Scope 3) (tonnes/FTE)                                                          | 2.59                       | 1.54                                        | 2.69                     | 2.19                                        |\n| Scope 2 (5)  (Indirect) Market-based CO2e emissions (tonnes) (*)                                                                                                       | 12                         | 2,139                                       | 8,860                    | 2,346                                       |\n\n## Emissions methodology and basis of preparation\n\nBoundary: We have reported on all emission sources required under the Companies (Directors' Report) and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) Regulations 2018. Our reporting year runs from October 2020 to September 2021. The emissions reporting boundary is defined as all entities and facilities either owned or under our operational control.\n\nCalculation : Emissions have been calculated using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard and associated guidance and include all greenhouse gases, reported in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) and global warming potential values. When converting data to carbon emissions, we use Emission Factors from UK Government Emissions Conversion Factors for Company Reporting (Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, 2021), CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (International Energy Agency, 2021) or relevant local authorities as required. NatWest Group utilises a third-party software system, Envizi, to capture and record our environmental impact and ensure audit requirements are met. All data is aggregated at a regional level to reflect the total regional consumption. The regional consumption results are then collated to reflect the total NatWest Group footprint. CO2e values are attributed to these sources via an automatic conversion module in the Envizi system. For more information, please see the own operational footprint page on natwestgroup.com.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Risk overview\n\n## Impactful and effective risk management supports NatWest Group in delivering its strategy and purpose.\n\nRisk is an inherent part of doing business. Some types of risk - such as credit risk or market risk for example - are an integral part of NatWest Group's day-to-day activities and a vital part of revenue generation. Other risks, such as those arising from changes in the economy or the competitive landscape, are an inescapable part of the environment in which NatWest Group operates and must also be managed and mitigated.\n\nEffective risk management is a vital element of ensuring NatWest Group is able to achieve its long-term strategy and fulfil its purpose.\n\nNatWest Group operates an enterprise-wide risk management framework. The framework - which is supported by policies, standards and operational procedures - sets out a consistent approach to managing risk across the organisation. It is aligned to NatWest Group's purpose and is designed to support intelligent risk-taking.\n\nWhile the Board reviews and approves the framework, all colleagues share ownership of risk management. The industrystandard three lines of defence approach is used to define responsibilities. This aims to ensure that risks are properly identified and assessed, managed and mitigated, monitored and reported.\n\nNatWest Group's independent Risk function designs and maintains the framework. The Risk function - which is led by the Chief Risk Officer - also provides oversight and monitoring of all risk management activities. The Chief Risk Officer plays an integral role in providing the Board with advice on NatWest Group's risk profile, the performance of its controls and in providing challenge where a proposed business strategy may exceed risk tolerance.\n\nNatWest Group has identified a number of principal risks. These are risks that are an inherent part of banking activity and have the potential to significantly affect NatWest Group's performance or prospects. They are categorised as financial and non-financial principal risks.\n\nIn addition, a regular process identifies top and emerging risks. These are specific scenarios of concern that may combine elements of several principal risks - or create new types of threat altogether - and which, without appropriate management and mitigation, could have a significant negative impact on NatWest Group's ability to meet its strategic objectives. These are detailed on page 75.\n\nRisk appetite is a key component of the framework. It defines the level and types of risk NatWest Group is willing to take as part of its business activities. Risk appetite is set in line with overall strategy and approved by the Board. It supports the strategic aim of building a sustainable business by providing colleagues with a structured approach to risk-taking within agreed boundaries.\n\nInformation on the risk profile relative to risk appetite, as well as details of new and emerging risks, is reported regularly to the Board and to NatWest Group's senior risk committees.\n\n| Principal financial risks   | Principal non-financial risks   |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Credit risk                 | Conduct risk                    |\n| Traded market risk          | Financial crime risk            |\n| Non-traded market risk      | Operational risk                |\n| Capital adequacy            | Regulatory compliance risk      |\n| Liquidity and funding       | Model risk                      |\n| Earnings stability          | Climate risk                    |\n| Pension risk                | Reputational risk               |\n\n## Areas of focus in 2021\n\nThe global economy continued to grow, though more slowly than expected. The aftershocks of the pandemic also intensified uncertainty around both the pace of recovery and the longer-term future. Accordingly, risk management played a critical role throughout the year, focusing both on striking the correct balance between risk and opportunity, and also on ensuring that supporting processes, policies and controls were properly optimised to deal with the heightened risk environment. Providing a clear risk perimeter allowed NatWest Group's customer-facing franchises to operate safely as they set out to achieve NatWest Group's purpose of helping people, families and businesses to thrive.\n\nAs a result, NatWest Group's credit risk profile remained in line with expectations, though given the heightened uncertainty, this remained an area of significant risk management focus. Impairment releases were significant. IFRS 9 forward-looking expected credit losses for performing assets in Stage 1 and Stage 2 reduced and actual Stage 3 default charges were relatively modest. However, NatWest Group anticipates increased default levels in 2022 as the longer-term impacts of pandemic-related disruption emerge. Other headwinds, such as ongoing supply chain challenges and inflation, have the potential to heighten the credit risk profile.\n\nNatWest Group's traded and non-traded market risk profiles were also broadly stable, though the potential second-order effects of the pandemic on both remain a key risk management consideration.\n\n## Compliance and conduct\n\nFurther progress was made on the compliance agenda during 2021. This included the introduction of a digital rules-mapping platform intended to enhance NatWest Group's assessment and implementation of regulatory obligations. In addition, a new ring-fencing hub was established to provide an aggregated view of ring-fencing compliance and risk management. The conduct risk profile also remained a key focus. In December 2021, the NatWest Markets subsidiary pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and one count of securities fraud related to historical spoofing conduct by former employees in US Treasuries markets between 2008 and 2014. As part of the plea agreement, NatWest Markets will pay\n\na criminal fine and a criminal forfeiture as well as restitution. The plea agreement also imposes an independent corporate monitor. NatWest Markets has also committed to compliance programme reviews and improvements. Throughout the year, with many colleagues working from home, additional controls around the supervision of certain roles remained in place to ensure secure and compliant operations. Controls established to mitigate risks relating to the recording of regulated communications, the flow of inside information and management of conflicts of interest also remained a focus.\n\n## Financial crime\n\nWhile work continues to enhance the control environment relating to financial crime risk, operational weaknesses between 2012 and 2016 resulted in the inadequate monitoring of a UK-incorporated NatWest Bank Plc customer. Regulations require risk-sensitive ongoing monitoring of customers for the purposes of preventing money laundering. NatWest Bank Plc co-operated fully with the regulator's investigation into this case and, in October 2021, pleaded guilty to three breaches of the Money Laundering Regulations 2007.\n\nNatWest Group takes its responsibility to prevent and detect financial crime extremely seriously and continues to make significant multi-year investments to strengthen and improve its overall financial crime framework with prevention systems and capabilities. This investment continued during 2021 and there was significant risk management focus on the systems and processes relating to customer due diligence, transaction monitoring and automated customer screening. NatWest Group continues to work with law enforcement agencies, industry bodies and regulators to develop intelligence and collaborative solutions to prevent financial crime.\n\n## Anti-bribery and corruption (ABC)\n\nNatWest Group is committed to ensuring it acts responsibly and ethically, both when pursuing its own business opportunities and when awarding business. Consequently, it has embedded appropriate policies, mandatory procedures and controls to ensure its employees, and any other parties it does business with, understand these obligations and abide by them whenever they act for NatWest Group. ABC training is mandatory for all staff on an annual basis, with targeted training appropriate for certain roles.

In addition, the qualitative consideration of climate-related risk was made mandatory for most of the wholesale portfolio within credit assessments, and enhancements were made to NatWest Group's environmental, social and ethical framework to address reputational risks arising from carbon-intensive sectors. NatWest Group also participated in the Bank of England's Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario stress test exercise. This exercise was designed to support improved understanding of the financial system's exposure to climate-related risks and the likely challenges to business models emerging from climate change. While participation was mandatory, the exercise also helped NatWest Group in understanding and preparing to manage risks that could arise, both in terms of the transition to net zero and the physical risks from climate change.\n\n## LIBOR\n\nRisks relating to the reform of interest-rate benchmarks were a consistent focus during the year. With the exception of certain tenors, publication of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), a key benchmark in the global financial markets for many years, ceased on 31 December 2021. In preparation for the move to alternative risk-free rates - including the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) - NatWest Group stopped offering Sterling LIBOR for new transactions on 31 March 2021. A Group-wide transition programme coordinated work to help customers smoothly transition from a range of LIBORbased products, such as mortgages, investment-backed lending and derivatives, to those using alternative benchmarks. Significant attention was paid to the potential conduct risks arising from transition activity, as well as related operational risks, in order to ensure appropriate customer outcomes. In addition, there was a strong focus on carefully managing the associated compliance risk, market risk and counterparty credit risk. The complexity of the transition, especially in relation to so-called 'tough legacy' contracts that cannot be transitioned to alternative reference rates, also heightened execution risk. The FCA has proposed that use of synthetic sterling LIBOR may be permitted for a number of legacy contracts. It's expected that management of related risks will remain a focus into 2022 as NatWest Group continues to support its customers through the transition.\n\n## Information and cyber-security\n\nCyber crime is an ever-present threat across the digital landscape and continues to evolve rapidly. Attacks may be from individuals or highly-organised criminal groups intent on stealing money or sensitive data, or potentially holding organisations to ransom. NatWest Group takes this threat seriously and continues to work with industry bodies, peers and the National Cyber Security Centre to gather and share intelligence. During 2021, there was continued risk management focus on ensuring defences remain optimised for the evolving threat.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nNatWest Group's multi-year programme to enhance risk management capability at every level of the organisation continued with an ongoing emphasis on risk culture. This work aims to embed a generative risk culture across all three lines of defence - where risk management is an integral part of the way colleagues work and think. The approach supports intelligent risk-taking, better customer outcomes, stronger and more sustainable business as well as an improved cost base. During 2021, there was a focus on a number of risk culture initiatives, including improvements in risk data and systems alignment as well as enhancements to risk identification processes and risk culture management information.\n\n## Model risk\n\nAn effective understanding of likely future outcomes and the scale of likely hazards is an essential part of forward-looking risk management. NatWest Group is heavily reliant on modelling across all aspects of its business. Ensuring its models are designed effectively - and that associated assumptions, data inputs and techniques are appropriate - remained a key risk management focus in 2021. This included a programme of ongoing work to upgrade a number of models to improve predictability and compliance with new regulatory requirements.\n\n## Risk-weighted assets (RWAs)\n\nRWAs were down \u00a313.3 billion at 31 December 2021, ending the year at \u00a3157 billion (from \u00a3170.3 billion in 2020). This was mainly driven by a \u00a39.8 billion reduction in credit risk RWAs as well as reductions in market risk RWAs (\u00a31.4 billion), counterparty credit risk RWAs (\u00a31.2 billion) and operational risk RWAs (\u00a30.9 billion).\n\n## Common Equity Tier 1 ratio\n\nNatWest Group maintained a strong CET1 ratio of 18.2% (2020 - 18.5%), reflecting both the \u00a313.3 billion reduction in RWAs and a \u00a32.9 billion decrease in CET 1. This decrease was mainly driven by the directed buy-back and associated pension contribution of \u00a31.2 billion and on-market share buy-backs totalling \u00a31.5 billion, as well as foreseeable dividends and associated pension contributions of \u00a31.2 billion and a \u00a31.1 billion decrease in the IFRS 9 transitional adjustment and other reserve reductions, offset by the \u00a33 billion attributable profit in the period. The CET1 ratio reduced to 15.9% on 1 January 2022 as a result of regulatory RWA and capital changes.\n\n## Leverage ratios\n\nThe CRR leverage ratio decreased to 4.4% (2020 - 5.2%) due to a \u00a340 billion increase in leverage exposure and a \u00a34 billion decrease in Tier 1 capital. The UK leverage ratio decreased to 5.8% (2020 - 6.4%) due to the decrease in Tier 1 capital.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nUnder the 2021 Bank of England solvency stress test, on an IFRS 9 transitional basis NatWest Group's low point CET1 ratio was 10.4%. This was above the reference rate of 7%. The transitional Tier 1 leverage ratio low point was projected to be 4.4% under stress. NatWest Group also took part in the Bank of England's Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario.\n\n## Liquidity and funding\n\nThe liquidity portfolio increased by \u00a324.1 billion to \u00a3286.4 billion. Primary liquidity increased by \u00a338.2 billion to \u00a3208.6 billion. The increase in primary liquidity resulted mainly from customer deposits, TFSME funding, new issuances and a methodology change to include UBIDAC cash at central banks.\n\n## Top and emerging risks\n\nA continuous process is used to identify and manage the Group's top and emerging risks. These are risks that could have a significant negative impact on the ability to operate or meet strategic objectives.\n\n| External                 | External                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Climate-related  risks   | NatWest Group and its customers may face significant climate-related risks, including those arising from the transition  to a net-zero economy. These risks are receiving increasing regulatory, political and societal scrutiny, both in the UK  and internationally. There are significant uncertainties as to the extent and timing of the manifestation of the physical  risks of climate change, such as more extreme and frequent weather events and reductions in biodiversity. Embedding  climate risk into the Group's risk framework and adapting NatWest Group's operations and business strategy to  address the risks is in line with the purpose-led strategy. |\n| Competitive  environment | NatWest Group operates in markets that are highly competitive, raising the threat of a loss of market share, reduced  revenue and lower profitability. The risks mainly relate to changes in regulation, developments in financial technology  (including digital currency), new entrants to the market and changes in customer behaviour. The Group closely  monitors the competitive environment and adapts strategy as appropriate to deliver innovative and compelling  propositions for customers.                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| COVID-19                 | The COVID-19 crisis could impede the Group's ability to meet its targets and deliver its purpose-led strategy. Despite  delivery of a mass vaccination programme in the UK, uncertainty remains around the future evolution of the virus and  the ultimate impact of the pandemic on NatWest Group and its customers. Key mitigation measures to manage the  uncertainty include scenario analysis, stress testing and active portfolio management including the adjustment of  risk appetite.                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Cyber threats            | The threat from cyber attacks is constant both directly to businesses such as NatWest Group and to others in the  supply chain. As cyber attacks evolve and become more sophisticated, NatWest Group continues to invest in additional  capability and controls designed to defend against the evolving threats. There is a sustained focus on managing the  impact of the attacks and maintaining the availability of services for NatWest Group's customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Regulatory, legal        | relation to the UK's withdrawal from the European Union and a Scottish independence referendum.

NatWest Group continues to manage and implement change in line with  its strategic plans while assessing execution risks and taking appropriate mitigating action. In addition, the Group  continues to monitor and strengthen its control environment including in relation to financial crime, through robust  governance and controls frameworks.                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Data  management         | NatWest Group operations and strategy are highly dependent on the accuracy and effective use of data. Failure  to have current, high-quality data and/or the ineffective use of such data could result in a failure to deliver NatWest  Group's strategy including reducing costs and meeting customer expectations. The Group is focused on delivering  a long-term data strategy alongside control and policy framework enhancements governing data usage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| People risk              | NatWest Group's success depends on its ability to attract, retain and develop highly skilled and qualified personnel,  including senior management, directors and key employees in a highly competitive market and under internal cost  reduction pressures. A combination of strategic workforce planning, including in relation to critical role resource and  retention of specific skills, and close monitoring of staff turnover levels and colleague wellbeing are key mitigants.                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Third-party  suppliers   | Operational risks arise from NatWest Group's reliance on third-party suppliers to provide a range of services,  including information technology. While the ineffective management of these risks could adversely affect NatWest  Group, significant resources and planning have been devoted to mitigate the risks including the implementation of  robust risk controls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |",

Similarly, such exercises were carried out across credit risk, market risk, pension risk, capital adequacy, liquidity and funding, operational risk and conduct risk - in order to ensure NatWest Group remains appropriately resilient even in extreme circumstances.\n\nIn assessing NatWest Group's future prospects, the Board considers a period of three years to be appropriate. Although strategic and business planning - as well as internal stress tests - are based on a five-year timespan, levels of uncertainty increase as the time horizon extends and therefore the shorter period is considered more suitable for this assessment. The Board will continue to monitor and consider the appropriateness of this period.\n\nIn assessing NatWest Group's viability over that three-year time frame, the Board has considered a wide range of information, including:\n\n## Strategic\n\n- -NatWest Group's long-term business and strategic plans;\n- -Its liquidity and funding profile, including projections over the relevant period;\n- -Its current capital position and projections over the relevant period.\n\n## Risk\n\n- -NatWest Group's risk profile and risk management practices, including the processes by which risks are identified and mitigated;\n- -Its principal risks as well as the top and emerging risks that could have a significant negative impact on NatWest Group's licence to operate or meet its strategic objectives over the medium term;\n- -Internal stress tests, which include consideration of NatWest Group's principal and emerging risks within the scenario design.\n\n## Regulatory\n\n- -The results of the Bank of England 2021 solvency stress test;\n- -The Group's results in the Bank of England's Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES);\n- -The output of the Group's 2021 Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP).\n\n## Operating environment\n\n- -The wider political and economic environment within which NatWest Group operates, including uncertainties relating to the geopolitical outlook and the global pandemic.\n\nThe Group's business and strategic plans, which are reviewed and evaluated on an annual basis at minimum, provide long-term direction. This includes multi-year forecasts assessing NatWest Group's expected financial position throughout the planning period. Threats to the achievement of those plans - including financial, operational, conduct and financial crime risks - are identified and assessed through\n\nNatWest Group's enterprise-wide risk management framework. As part of this, Board-approved risk appetite is a key consideration. Performance against risk appetite for each of the principal risks is reported to the Board on a regular basis together with assessments of emerging risks that could have an impact within the planning horizon. NatWest Group's principal risks and uncertainties are set out on pages 72 to 75. Further detail can be found in the Risk and capital management section of the Annual Report and Accounts (pages 187-285).\n\nThe effects of COVID-19 and associated government responses remained an important consideration particularly in relation to the impacts on customers - including the end of government support schemes and the likely trajectory of the overall recovery. The impact of the pandemic and potential aftershocks are subject to continuous monitoring with additional focus in NatWest Group's senior risk committees and at Board level. In addition, other impacts, such as the effect of sustained supply chain disruption for business and corporate clients, were also a focus.\n\nA series of internally-developed stress scenarios supports NatWest Group's planning processes. During 2021, a range of future economic conditions of increasing severity was defined in order to support internal modelling and assess NatWest Group's potential performance over the planning horizon. These included a base case - or central - scenario using a set of assumptions such as expected GDP growth of 1.7% over the scenario period, an average Bank of England base rate of 0.8% and a total change in the UK house price index of 12.1%. This scenario also assumed a resilient labour market following the end of the government furlough scheme and inflation peaking in early 2022, followed by a gradual easing of pressures in the medium term. While potential performance was also assessed against a more positive, or upside scenario, NatWest Group's likely response to more adverse and challenging conditions was assessed using a suite of downside scenarios ranging from moderate to extreme. The assumptions used in these scenarios included GDP contraction of -1.8% and -7.9%, base rate of 1.5% or -0.5%, and house price index falls of -3% and -26%.\n\nAdditional scenarios, assuming much more severe conditions - ranging from a sharp economic downturn in the UK to persistent COVID-19 impacts and a global recession - were also used for internal modelling and planning purposes. These included a range of challenges relating to NatWest Group's principal risks. Internal scenarios used for the ICAAP are designed to be extreme but plausible and take account of potential risk management actions and mitigation supported by the enterprise-wide risk management framework. For example, a range of financial crime scenarios was assessed using both one-in-25-years and one-in-100-years stresses to analyse the likely impacts of extreme events on the Group's licence to operate. These assessed the potential impacts of external fraud, sanctions, money laundering, tax evasion or bribery\n\nIn addition, NatWest Group's top and emerging risks are a significant consideration in internal planning as well as in assessing future capital and liquidity resilience under adverse scenarios through the ICAAP and ILAAP.\n\nReverse stress testing is also used to assess scenarios and circumstances that could make NatWest Group's business model unviable. These exercises begin with a definition of business model failure - including capital adequacy thresholds - and then analyse the events that could cause that failure. NatWest Group uses a range of stress scenarios that include systemic events, that may affect the entire financial system, idiosyncratic events that would create adverse consequences for only NatWest Group and a combination of these. During 2021, reverse stress testing considered the impact of sustained income challenges and increased impairments in a recession. Significant drops in UK GDP (-9%, -12, -15%) were factored in together with high unemployment (16-17%), a collapse in asset prices (commercial real estate values falling, for example, by up to 50%) and a dramatic reduction in house prices (-34%, -47% and -50%). In each of the extreme scenarios, NatWest Group remained above the defined thresholds.\n\nThe results of the 2021 Bank of England solvency stress test were also considered as part of the assessment. The assumptions involved in this stress scenario included a significant drop in UK GDP (37% of 2019 UK GDP) between 2020 and 2022, an unemployment spike just under 12% and a 33% fall in residential and commercial property prices. The scenario also included a 31% cumulative fall in world GDP. NatWest Group remained considerably above the hurdle rate before and after strategic management actions.\n\nIn considering NatWest Group's prospects over the period of the viability assessment, the Board's assessment in this regard is that NatWest Group is appropriately resilient and able to withstand a combination of severe economic shocks without breaching regulatory thresholds.\n\nThe assessment also considered the effects of an intensifying competitive environment particularly in the context of the disruption to underlying economic cycles due to COVID-19. Throughout the year, consideration was given to the likelihood of a catastrophic cyberattack within the time frame of the assessment. While NatWest Group operates a multi-layered system of defences, there is a possibility that a successful cyberattack could have a severe effect on operations. However, the evolving threat is continually monitored. NatWest Group remains prepared and continues to invest in this area to ensure that it remains robustly protected.\n\nPlanning also takes into account a range of correlated risks in order to ensure that NatWest Group's strategy and forecasts remain appropriate for the evolving environment. During 2021, there was further management focus on the potential crystallisation of a severe but plausible combination of both principal risks and top and emerging risks. Such combinations could amplify existing risks and adversely affect NatWest Group's profitability. The results of these exercises were considered by the Executive Risk Committee and form part of NatWest Group's forward-looking risk management activity.\n\nWhile considering both near-term and medium-term risks in its assessment - and given the increased uncertainty over longer-term predictions - the Board noted analysis performed as part of NatWest Group's participation in the Bank of England's CBES test. While this is a mandatory stress test, the activity supports NatWest Group in understanding and preparing to manage risks that could arise, both in terms of the transition to net zero and the physical risks from climate change. This included a Group-wide operational risk scenario, assuming significant business disruption due to an intense heatwave. Aspects of the CBES scenarios were also used in the Group's ICAAP process and in internal stress tests, particularly in relation to credit risk.\n\nIn drawing its conclusions, the Board also considered the following:\n\n- -The Group's strong capital position (CET1 ratio of 18.2%-17.8% excluding IFRS 9 transitional relief). The current capital position provides significant headroom above both NatWest Group's minimum requirements and its MDA threshold requirements;\n- -Its ability to generate capital in recent years;\n- -Its proposed distribution strategy to shareholders; and\n- -Its strong liquidity position (LCR of 172% at 31 December 2021 and liquidity headroom of \u00a389.9 billion).\n\nBased on the factors above, the current financial forecasts, the management of NatWest Group's principal risks, including mitigating actions, and the strength of its capital and liquidity positions, NatWest Group's Board has a reasonable expectation that NatWest Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities over the three-year period of the assessment.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The matrix reflects our directors' self-assessment of the skills and experience they bring to Board discussions, in line with pre-determined criteria aligned to current and future strategic priorities.\n\nThe 2021 external Board evaluation did not identify any immediate or material gaps in Board skills and experience, however it was acknowledged that the Board would benefit from additional technology expertise. The Board and Group Nominations and Governance Committee will continue to keep Board skills and composition under review during 2022.\n\n## UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nThroughout 2021, NatWest Group plc applied the principles and complied with all of the provisions of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code with the following exceptions:\n\n- -Provision 17 - that the Group Nominations and Governance Committee should ensure plans are in place for orderly succession to both the board and senior management positions, and oversee the development of a diverse pipeline for succession; and\n- -Provision 33 - that the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee should have delegated responsibility for setting remuneration for the Chairman and executive directors.\n\nThe Board considers these are matters that should be reserved for the Board.\n\nOur full 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code compliance statement is available on page 181.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur full Corporate governance report /uni0069s ava/uni0069lable on pages 102 to 187 and /uni0069ncludes our Board Comm/uni0069ttee reports, the D/uni0069rectors' remunerat/uni0069on report and the Report of the d/uni0069rectors.",

We achieved our Group cost reduction target of 4.0% and lending growth across our UK and RBSI retail and commercial businesses was 2.6%, excluding UK Government financial support schemes.\n\nOur capital and liquidity position remains strong after returning \u00a33.8 billion to shareholders, and default levels have remained low across all our portfolios. The CET1 ratio was 18.2%, reducing to 15.9% on 1 January 2022 following regulatory RWA and capital changes. We have made good progress on our phased withdrawal from the Republic of Ireland and will focus the financial commentary below on the Group excluding Ulster Bank RoI (Go-forward group).\n\nTotal income, excluding notable items, in the Go-forward group was 5.6% lower than prior year. Across the UK and RBSI retail and commercial businesses income increased by 1.4% reflecting strong balance sheet growth, principally in our mortgage book. NWM income was below expectations, down by 61.5%, compared with 2020, reflecting continued weakness in Fixed Income, impacted by subdued levels of customer activity and ongoing reshaping of the business, and exceptional levels of market activity in the prior year.\n\nBank NIM (1) of 2.39% was 7 basis points lower than 2020 impacted by reduced structural hedge income, yield curve movements and lower unsecured balances.\n\nWe delivered a cost reduction of \u00a3256 million, or 4.0%, in 2021, in line with our target for the year. This has been achieved by transformation across our customer journeys and NWM business, in line with the strategic announcement made in February 2020 and a \u00a368 million reduction in the bank levy charge.\n\nA net impairment release of \u00a31,278 million reflects the low levels of realised losses we have seen across the year. Total impairment provisions reduced by \u00a32.4 billion to \u00a33.8 billion during 2021 and as a result ECL coverage ratio decreased from 1.66% to 1.03%.\n\nWe are pleased to report a 2021 attributable profit of \u00a32,950 million, with earnings per share of 25.4 pence and a RoTE of 9.4%.\n\nA final dividend of 7.5 pence per share is proposed, bringing our total 2021 paid and proposed capital distributions to \u00a33.8 billion through a combination of ordinary dividends, directed buybacks of the UK Government stake and our on-market buyback programme.\n\nAcross the UK and RBSI retail and commercial businesses, and excluding UK Government support schemes, net lending increased by 2.6%. Mortgage growth exceeded the market, however commercial lending was behind market as we have sought to reduce certain exposures, through targeted sector reductions and capital actions, whilst continuing to focus on supporting customers through sustainable lending.\n\nCustomer deposits in the Go-forward group increased by \u00a349.3 billion, or 12.0%, in 2021 including \u00a39.4 billion related to Treasury repo activity. Across the UK and RBSI retail and commercial businesses customer deposits increased by 10.0%, as customers continued to build and retain liquidity.\n\nTNAV per share increased by 3 pence in the quarter to 272 pence largely reflecting the attributable profit partially offset by movements in the cash flow hedging reserve.\n\n## Capital, funding and liquidity\n\nThe CET1 ratio remains strong at 18.2%, or 17.8% excluding IFRS 9 transitional relief. The 30 basis points reduction in the year includes capital distributions of c.240 basis points, partially offset by the reduction in RWAs, c.170 basis points, and the attributable profit net of IFRS 9 transitional relief and other capital movements. RWAs of \u00a3157.0 billion reduced by \u00a313.3 billion in 2021 mainly reflecting business movements in Commercial Banking, including targeted sector reductions, improvement in risk parameters and active capital management.\n\nOn 1 January 2022, the proforma CET1 ratio was 15.9% including the impact of regulatory RWA inflation, 200 basis points, the removal of the software development costs capital benefit, 20 basis points, and the tapering of IFRS 9 transitional relief, 10 basis points. RWAs increased by \u00a318.8 billion, including \u00a314.8 billion associated with mortgage risk weight changes.\n\nThe liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of 172%, representing \u00a389.9 billion headroom above 100% minimum requirement, increased by 7 percentage points compared with 2020. Total wholesale funding increased by \u00a36.0 billion in the year to \u00a376.7 billion.\n\n- (1)  Excludes NatWest Markets, liquid asset buffer and Ulster Bank RoI.\n\n|                                                                                           | Year ended (1)   | Year ended (1)   | Year ended (1)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                                                                                           | 2021 \u00a3m          | 2020 \u00a3m          | Variance \u00a3m      |\n| Continuing operations                                                                     |                  |                  |                  |\n| Go-forward group income (2,3)                                                             | 10,284           | 10,286           | (2)              |\n| Total income                                                                              | 10,512           | 10,508           | 4                |\n| Operating expenses                                                                        | (7,758)          | (7,858)          | (100)            |\n| Profit before impairment releases/(losses)                                                | 2,754            | 2,650            | 104              |\n| Operating profit/(loss) before tax                                                        | 4,032            | (481)            | 4,513            |\n| Profit/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders                                       | 2,950            | (753)            | 3,703            |\n| Excluding notable items within total income (4)                                           |                  |                  |                  |\n| Go-forward group income excluding notable items  (2,3)                                    | 10,074           | 10,670           | (596)            |\n| Total income excluding notable items (3)                                                  | 10,267           | 10,892           | (625)            |\n| Operating expenses                                                                        | (7,758)          | (7,858)          | 100              |\n| Profit before impairment releases/(losses) excluding notable items                        | 2,509            | 3,034            | (525)            |\n| Operating profit/(loss) before tax excluding notable items                                | 3,787            | (97)             | 3,884            |\n| UK and RBSI retail and commercial businesses income excluding notable items (3)           | 9,620            | 9,486            | 134              |\n| Performance key metrics and ratios                                                        |                  |                  |                  |\n| Bank net interest margin (3,5)                                                            | 2.39%            | 2.46%            | (0.07%)          |\n| Bank average interest earning assets (3,5)                                                | \u00a3314bn           | \u00a3301bn           | \u00a313bn            |\n| Cost:income ratio (3)                                                                     | 73.4%            | 74.4%            | (1.1%)           |\n| Loan impairment rate (3)                                                                  | (35bps)          | 85bps            | (120bps)         |\n| Total earnings per share attributable to ordinary shareholders -

This has been achieved by transformation across our customer journeys and NWM business, in line with the strategic announcement made in February 2020 and a \u00a368 million reduction in the UK bank levy charge.\n- \uf02d Strategic costs of \u00a3787 million included \u00a3237 million in NWM related to transformation, \u00a3124 million of redundancy charges, \u00a388 million of technology spend and an \u00a385 million goodwill impairment.\n- \uf02d Litigation and conduct costs of \u00a3466 million represent the net impact of a number of remediation and litigation matters concluding.

Total impairment provisions reduced by \u00a32.4 billion to \u00a33.8 billion during 2021 and as a result ECL coverage ratio decreased from 1.66% to 1.03%. Whilst we are comfortable with the strong credit performance of our book, we continue to hold economic uncertainty post model adjustments (PMA) of \u00a30.6 billion, or 15.3% of total impairment provisions. We will continue to assess this position throughout the year.\n\n| Tax - Continuing operations   | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 (1) \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|---------------|\n| Tax charge                    | (996)     | (74)          |\n| UK corporation tax rate       | 19.0%     | 19.0%         |\n| Effective tax rate            | 24.7%     | (23.7%)       |\n\n- (1) Comparative results have been re-presented from those previously published to reclassify certain operations as discontinued operations as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\n- \uf02d A tax charge of \u00a3996 million for the year ended 31 December 2021 arises rather than the expected tax charge of \u00a3766 million based on the UK corporation tax rate of 19%. The higher tax charge reflects the UK banking surcharge, and other nondeductible items such as UK bank levy. These factors have been partially offset by the impact on the group's UK net deferred tax asset of the increased tax rate from 1 April 2023, enacted on 10 June 2021.

These movements were driven by a decrease in underlying volumes due to matured trades and buyouts exceeding new trades and lower mark-to-market valuations due to higher interest rates for major currencies in the year.\n- \uf02d Loans to customers - amortised cost, decreased by \u00a31.6 billion, to \u00a3359.0 billion including \u00a311.3 billion decrease in Ulster Bank ROI predominantly due to a reclassification of banking portfolio loans to assets of disposal groups, partially offset by an \u00a39.9 billion increase in Retail Banking driven by strong gross mortgage lending.\n- \uf02d Other financial assets, which includes debt securities, equity shares and other loans, decreased by \u00a39.0 billion, 16%, to \u00a346.1 billion, primarily due to reductions in debt securities.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n86\n\n- \uf02d Customer deposits increased by \u00a348 billion, 11%, to \u00a3479.8 billion including increases of \u00a317.1 billion in Retail Banking, \u00a310 billion in Commercial Banking and \u00a37.0 billion in Private Banking as customers retained liquidity in light of the COVID-19 economic uncertainty.

Lending growth was supported by a strong performance in mortgages and a return to unsecured lending growth in the second half of 2021.\n- \uf02d Total income was \u00a3264 million, or 6.3%, higher than 2020 reflecting mortgage balance and margin improvement, higher transactional-related fee income and non-repeat of loss on acquisition, partially offset by the impact of the lower interest rate environment on deposit returns, lower average unsecured balances and the annualised impact of regulatory changes on fee income.\n- \uf02d Retail Banking completed \u00a31.1 billion of Climate and Sustainable Funding and Financing in 2021, which will contribute towards the new NatWest Group target of \u00a3100 billion of Climate and Sustainable Funding and Financing between 1 July 2021 and the end of 2025.\n- \uf02d Net interest margin was 5 basis points lower than 2020 reflecting lower deposit returns and lower average unsecured balances, partly offset by higher mortgage margins.\n- \uf02d Other expenses decreased by \u00a345 million, or 2.0%, compared with 2020 primarily reflecting an 8.8% reduction in headcount as a result of continued customer digital adoption, automation and improvement of end-to-end customer journeys, including digitalising the customer account opening processes, leading to an increase in straight through processing within journeys from 45% in December 2020 to 70% in December 2021.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n88\n\n- \uf02d Strategic costs of \u00a3117 million in Q4 2021 include an \u00a385 million impairment of goodwill, reflecting a legacy business in accelerated run down within Retail Banking.\n- \uf02d Net loans to customers increased by \u00a39.9 billion, or 5.7%, compared with 2020 as a result of strong gross new mortgage lending and improved retention. Gross new mortgage lending was \u00a336.0 billion with flow share of 11.5%, supporting mortgage balance growth of \u00a39.8 billion or 6.0%, representing a stock share of 11.0%. Cards were stable however, we have seen improved customer spend and demand in the second half of 2021. Personal advances reduced by \u00a30.2 billion as customers made higher overdraft repayments in H1 2021, reflecting the impact of UK Government restrictions partly offset by growth in H2 2021 as customer demand for personal loans increased as the UK economy recovered.\n- \uf02d An impairment release of \u00a336 million primarily reflects ECL provision releases in the non-defaulted portfolio.\n- \uf02d Customer deposits increased by \u00a317.1 billion, or 10.0%, compared with 2020 as UK Government schemes combined with Covid related restrictions resulted in lower customer spend and increased savings in H1 2021.\n- \uf02d RWAs were broadly stable compared with 2020 primarily reflecting lending growth, offset by continued quality improvements.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Segment performance continued\n\n## Private Banking\n\n|                              | 2021    | 2020   | Variance   | Variance   |\n|------------------------------|---------|--------|------------|------------|\n| Income statement             | \u00a3m      | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m         | %          |\n| Net interest income          | 480     | 489    | (9)        | (2)        |\n| Non-interest income          | 336     | 274    | 62         | 23         |\n| Total income                 | 816     | 763    | 53         | 7          |\n| Other expenses               | (504)   | (466)  | (38)       | 8          |\n| Strategic costs              | (19)    | (15)   | (4)        | 27         |\n| Litigation and conduct costs | 3       | 26     | (23)       | (88)       |\n| Operating expenses           | (520)   | (455)  | (65)       | 14         |\n| Impairment releases/(losses) | 54      | (100)  | 154        | (154)      |\n| Operating profit             | 350     | 208    | 142        | 68         |\n| Performance ratios           |         |        |            |            |\n| Return on equity (1)         | 17.0%   | 10.3%  | 6.7%       |            |\n| Net interest margin          | 1.76%   | 2.05%  | (0.29%)    |            |\n| Cost:income ratio            | 63.7%   | 59.6%  | 4.1%       |            |\n| Loan impairment rate         | (29bps) | 58bps  | (87bps)    |            |\n\n|                                                       | 2021   | 2020   | Variance   | Variance   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|------------|\n| Capital and balance sheet                             | \u00a3bn    | \u00a3bn    | \u00a3m         | %          |\n| Loans to customers (amortised cost)                   |        |        |            |            |\n| - personal                                            | 2.3    | 2.2    | 0.1        | 5          |\n| - mortgages                                           | 11.8   | 10.7   | 1.1        | 10         |\n| - other                                               | 4.4    | 4.2    | 0.2        | 5          |\n| Total loans to customers (amortised cost)             | 18.5   | 17.1   | 1.4        | 8          |\n| Loan impairment provisions                            | (0.1)  | (0.1)  | -          | -          |\n| Net loans to customers (amortised cost)               | 18.4   | 17.0   | 1.4        | 8          |\n| Total assets                                          | 29.9   | 26.2   | 3.7        | 14         |\n| Assets under management (AUMs) (2)                    | 30.2   | 27.0   | 3.2        | 12         |\n| Assets under administration (AUAs) (2)                | 5.4    | 5.1    | 0.3        | 6          |\n| Assets under management and administration (AUMA) (2) | 35.6   | 32.1   | 3.5        | 11         |\n| Customer deposits                                     | 39.3   | 32.4   | 6.9        | 21         |\n| Loan:deposit ratio                                    | 47%    | 52%    | (5%)       | (10)       |\n| Risk-weighted assets                                  | 11.3   | 10.9   | 0.4        | 4          |\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\n- \uf02d In 2021, Private Banking delivered strong growth across AUMA, lending and deposits which has supported a 2021 return on equity of 17.0% and operating profit of \u00a3350 million. Digital net new money across NatWest Invest, Royal Bank Invest and Coutts Invest of \u00a30.8 billion in 2021 is more than double 2020. Approximately 2,114 new customers were onboarded into Private Banking, an increase of around 29% compared to 2020.\n- \uf02d Total income was \u00a353 million, or 6.9%, higher than 2020 reflecting a \u00a354 million consideration from the sale of the Adam & Company investment management business in Q4 2021 and strong balance growth partially offset by lower deposit returns in a lower interest rate environment.\n- \uf02d NatWest Group completed the sale of Adam & Company's investment management business on 1 October 2021 for a total consideration of \u00a354 million, which has been recorded as a notable item in the Q4 2021 results.\n- \uf02d Net interest margin decreased by 29 basis points reflecting lower deposit returns and higher liquidity portfolio costs.\n- \uf02d Other expenses were \u00a338 million, or 7.9%, higher than 2020 principally due to investment in digital infrastructure and an increase in headcount related to the enhancement of AUMA growth propositions.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n89\n\n- \uf02d A net impairment release of \u00a354 million in 2021 mainly reflects ECL provision releases in non-default portfolios.\n- \uf02d Customer deposits increased by \u00a36.9 billion, or 21.3%, compared with 2020 reflecting strong personal and commercial inflows as UK Government restrictions resulted in clients continuing to build and retain liquidity.\n- \uf02d Net loans to customers increased by \u00a31.4 billion, or 8.2%, compared with 2020 driven by continued strong mortgage lending growth of \u00a31.1 billion or 10.3%, including gross new lending of \u00a33.3 billion. RWAs increased by \u00a30.4 billion, or 3.7%.\n- \uf02d AUMAs increased by \u00a33.5 billion, or 10.9%, driven by an increase in AUM net new money (NNM) of \u00a33.0 billion and AUM positive investment performance of \u00a32.1 billion, partially offset by the \u00a31.8 billion impact of the sale of Adam & Company's investment management business and \u00a30.2 billion EEA resident client outflows following the UK's exit from the EU. AUM NNM of \u00a33.0 billion represents 9.3% of opening AUMAs, which is double NNM in 2020.\n\nFinancial review",

NatWest Markets has made good progress on building a refocused, sustainable business from which it can grow. NatWest Markets incurred an operating loss in 2021 but has largely completed its RWA reduction and continued to reduce operating expenses, and in Q4 2021, introduced changes to Rates which will improve the strategic alignment with the rest of the business and drive income growth. NatWest Markets performance at the beginning of 2022 has been in line with expectations.\n- \uf02d NatWest Markets completed \u00a39.7 billion of Climate and Sustainable Funding and Financing in 2021, including \u00a33.3 billion in H2 2021 which will contribute towards the new NatWest Group target of \u00a3100 billion between 1 July 2021 and the end of 2025.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n92\n\n- \uf02d Income excluding asset disposals/strategic risk reduction and OCA was \u00a3757 million, or 61.5% lower than 2020. The performance of Fixed Income was weak in 2021 impacted by subdued levels of customer activity and the reshaping of the business, in contrast to the prior year which benefitted from exceptional levels of market activity generated by the initial spread of the COVID-19 virus. Both Currencies and Capital Markets income were lower than in 2020 but performed broadly in line with expectations.\n- \uf02d A net impairment release of \u00a335 million in 2021 reflects releases against a number of cases throughout the year.\n- \uf02d Other expenses decreased by \u00a3131 million, or 12.6%, compared with 2020 reflecting continued reductions in line with the strategic announcement in February 2020.\n- \uf02d RWAs decreased by \u00a32.7 billion, or 10.0%, compared with 2020 reflecting lower levels of market risk and counterparty credit risk, including the impact of capital optimisation actions taken throughout the year.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Segment performance continued\n\nUlster Bank RoI\n\nContinuing operations\n\n|                              | 2021   | 2020 (1)   | Variance   | Variance   | 2021   | 2020 (1)   | Variance   | Variance   |\n|------------------------------|--------|------------|------------|------------|--------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Income statement             | \u20acm     | \u20acm         | \u20acm         | %          | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m         | \u00a3m         | %          |\n| Net interest income          | 116    | 137        | (21)       | (15)       | 100    | 122        | (22)       | (18)       |\n| Non-interest income          | 149    | 113        | 36         | 32         | 128    | 100        | 28         | 28         |\n| Total income                 | 265    | 250        | 15         | 6          | 228    | 222        | 6          | 3          |\n| Other expenses               | (487)  | (462)      | (25)       | 5          | (421)  | (409)      | (12)       | 3          |\n| Strategic costs              | (25)   | (28)       | 3          | (11)       | (22)   | (25)       | 3          | (12)       |\n| Litigation and conduct costs | (45)   | (8)        | (37)       | 463        | (39)   | (7)        | (32)       | 457        |\n| Operating expenses           | (557)  | (498)      | (59)       | 12         | (482)  | (441)      | (41)       | 9          |\n| Impairment releases/(losses) | 33     | (157)      | 190        | (121)      | 28     | (139)      | 167        | (120)      |\n| Operating loss               | (259)  | (405)      | 146        | (36)       | (226)  | (358)      | 132        | (37)       |\n| Average exchange rate - \u20ac/\u00a3  |        |            |            |            | 1.163  | 1.125      |            |            |\n\n|                                     | 2021   | 2020   | Variance   | Variance   | 2021   | 2020       | Variance   | Variance   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|------------|--------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Capital and balance sheet           | \u20acbn    | \u20acbn    | \u20acbn        | %          | \u00a3bn    | \u00a3bn        | \u00a3m         | %          |\n| Loans to customers (amortised cost) |        |        |            |            |        |            |            |            |\n| - mortgages                         | 7.3    | 15.2   | (7.9)      | (52)       | 6.2    | 13.7       | (7.5)      | (55)       |\n| - other lending                     | 1.1    | 5.7    | (4.6)      | (81)       | 1.0    | 5.1        | (4.1)      | (80)       |\n| Total loans to customers (amortised | 8.4    | 20.9   |            |            | 7.2    |            | (11.6)     | (62)       |\n| cost) Loan impairment provisions    | (0.5)  | (0.9)  | (12.5) 0.4 | (60) (44)  | (0.5)  | 18.8 (0.8) | 0.3        | (38)       |\n| Net loans to customers (amortised   | 7.9    | 20.0   | (12.1)     | (61)       | 6.7    | 18.0       | (11.3)     | (63)       |\n| cost) Total assets                  | 27.2   | 29.6   | (2.4)      | (8)        | 22.8   | 26.6       | (3.8)      | (14)       |\n| Funded assets                       | 27.2   | 29.6   | (2.4)      | (8)        | 22.8   | 26.6       | (3.8)      | (14)       |\n| Customer deposits                   | 21.9   | 21.8   | 0.1        | 0.5        | 18.4   | 19.6       | (1.2)      | (6)        |\n| Risk-weighted assets                | 10.9   | 13.2   | (2.3)      | (17)       | 9.1    | 11.8       | (2.7)      | (23)       |\n| Spot exchange rate - \u20ac/\u00a3            |        |        |            |            | 1.190  | 1.113      |            |            |\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\n- \uf02d Ulster Bank RoI continues to make progress on its phased withdrawal from the Republic of Ireland. On 17 December 2021 UBIDAC entered a legally binding agreement with Permanent TSB p.l.c. (PTSB) for the proposed sale of approximately \u20ac7.6 billion of gross performing loans as at 30 June 2021, comprising performing non-tracker mortgages, performing loans in the micro-SME business, the UBIDAC Asset Finance business, including its digital platform, and 25 Ulster Bank branch locations. Completion of the sale is subject to obtaining competition, regulatory and other approvals, including PTSB's holding company shareholder approval, and other conditions being satisfied. The transaction is expected to occur in phases between Q4 2022 and Q1 2023 with the majority of loans expected to transfer by Q4 2022.\n- \uf02d Progress continues with Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c. (AIB) for the transfer of approximately \u20ac4.2 billion, plus up to \u20ac2.8 billion of undrawn exposures, of performing commercial lending. A key part of the process is to complete the regulatory approvals and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has already carried out an extended preliminary investigation and on 31 December 2021 announced its decision to carry out a Phase 2 investigation into the proposed sale. There is no firm date for the completion of this process. Discussions are ongoing with other counterparties about their potential interest in other parts of the bank.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n93\n\n- \uf02d The values shown above represent the continuing operations of Ulster Bank RoI, including re-presented comparatives for the income statement. The representation is in accordance with IFRS 5 'Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations'.\n- \uf02d Other expenses were \u20ac25 million, or 5.4%, higher than 2020, due to higher VAT costs and regulatory levies, partially offset by a 15% reduction in headcount, lower advertising spend and back office operational costs.\n- \uf02d Total income was \u20ac15 million, or 6.0%, higher than 2020 reflecting gains arising from the adjustment of the swap hedging portfolio to align the modelled maturity position of deposits and other balances to the withdrawal plan, offset by lower lending levels and fee income as a result of the decision to withdraw from the RoI market.\n- \uf02d A net impairment release of \u20ac33 million in 2021 reflects improvements in the reducing loan portfolios and economic forecasts.\n- \uf02d Net loans to customers decreased by \u20ac12.1 billion primarily due to the reclassification of \u20ac10.7 billion of loans to the disposal group.\n\nFinancial review",

COVID-19 also remained a key area of focus for the Board in 2021, particularly the support being provided to our customers and colleagues. The three additional independent non-executive directors of NatWest Holdings Limited attend all Board and relevant Board Committee meetings as observers and contribute a ring-fenced bank perspective to Board and Committee discussions.\n\nFurther details of the Board's principal activities during 2021 can be found on page 104.\n\nAs a Board, we know how important it is to engage with our stakeholders, to listen to them and to consider their interests during Board discussions and decision-making. Understanding the needs of our stakeholders is at the core of our purpose framework as shown on pages 12 to 13.\n\nExamples of how the Board has engaged with key stakeholders and considered their interests, including the impact on principal decisions, can be found on pages 14 to 17 and pages 52 to 53 of the Strategic report and later in this Corporate governance report.\n\nThere were no changes to Board or Board Committee membership during 2021, however we continue to keep the composition, skills and experience of the Board under review.\n\n## Board effectiveness\n\nIn 2021, the Board and Committee evaluation was externally facilitated by Independent Board Evaluation. Further information on how the evaluation was conducted, key outcomes and actions arising can be found on page 112.\n\n## UK Corporate Governance Code 2018\n\nAll directors are committed to observing high standards of corporate governance, integrity and professionalism.\n\nInformation on how the company has applied the Principles and complied with the Provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (the Code) can be found in this Corporate governance report under the Code's five main section headings. A formal statement of compliance with the Code can be found on page 181.\n\nIn conclusion I would like to thank my fellow Board members for their outstanding contributions and commitment throughout the year.\n\n## Howard Davies\n\nChairman of the Board\n\n17 February 2022\n\n## Board and Committee meetings\n\nThe table below shows Board and Committee membership and directors' meeting attendance during 2021. There were six scheduled Board meetings during 2021, the same number as in 2020.\n\nIn addition to scheduled meetings, additional ad hoc meetings of the Board and some of its Committees were held throughout the year to receive updates and deal with time-critical matters. There were eight additional Board meetings held in 2021 compared to 16 additional meetings held in 2020. When directors are unable to attend meetings convened at short notice, they receive the papers and have the opportunity to provide their feedback in advance.\n\nIn accordance with the Code, the Chairman and the non-executive directors met at least once without executive directors present.\n\n## Board and Committee membership and meeting attendance in 2021\n\n|                    | Board     | Board   | Group Audit  Committee (GAC)   | Group Audit  Committee (GAC)   | Group Board Risk  Committee (BRC)   | Group Board Risk  Committee (BRC)   | Group Nominations  and Governance  Committee (N&G)   | Group Nominations  and Governance  Committee (N&G)   | Group Performance  and Remuneration  Committee (RemCo)   | Group Performance  and Remuneration  Committee (RemCo)   | Group Sustainable  Banking Committee  (SBC)   | Group Sustainable  Banking Committee  (SBC)   | Technology and  Innovation  Committee (TIC)   | Technology and  Innovation  Committee (TIC)   |\n|--------------------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Director           | Scheduled | Ad hoc  | Scheduled                      | Ad hoc                         | Scheduled                           | Ad hoc                              | Scheduled                                            | Ad hoc                                               | Scheduled                                                | Ad hoc                                                   | Scheduled                                     | Ad hoc                                        | Scheduled                                     | Ad hoc                                        |\n| Howard Davies      | 6/6       | 8/8     | -

A hybrid meeting was held in July and in September the full Board was able to meet in person for the first time since the start of the pandemic.\n\nAt each scheduled Board meeting the directors received reports from the Chairman, Board Committee Chairmen, Group Chief Executive Officer (Group CEO), Group Chief Financial Officer (Group CFO), Group Chief Risk Officer and other members of the executive management team, as appropriate (referred to in the Board annual calendar which follows as 'regular reports'). Other senior executives attended Board meetings throughout the year to present reports to the Board. This provided the Board with an opportunity to engage directly with management on key issues and support succession planning.\n\nThe Board and Group Executive Committee (ExCo) operating rhythm continues to support a proactive and transparent agenda planning and paper preparation process. This process includes the following key elements:\n\n- -A pre-Board meeting with the Chairman, Group CEO, Group CFO and Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary to ensure the Board and executive management are aligned on Board agendas.\n- -A post Board meeting with the Chairman, Group CEO and Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary to discuss what went well or could be improved after each meeting.\n- -A look ahead paper at each ExCo and Board meeting setting out key items that will be discussed at the next meeting.",

These have supported agenda planning and helped to guide how the Board spends its time, ensuring appropriate focus on the longer-term and strategic issues. Whilst our response to the COVID-19 pandemic continued to be a priority for the Board, there was a shift away from standalone pandemic-related updates towards integrated reporting on COVID-19 related matters across the Board agenda, including through our regular reports and business reviews.\n\nThe Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary maintains an annual agenda planner designed to ensure that all matters set out in the Board's terms of reference are considered by the Board. The table below is an overview of the main matters considered by the Board during 2021 and also shows the Board training provided. In 2021, we introduced the use of videos into Board training and presentations which has been well received by the Board. They have been used, for example, to deliver background materials as well as insights from colleagues and customers to support Board discussions.\n\nAd hoc meetings of the Board were held concurrently with scheduled meetings of the Board of NatWest Holdings Limited in March and September, to deal with any time critical matters or to support efficient review of items of mutual interest.\n\n## Board annual calendar for 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                    | Spotlight and ad hoc items                                                                                                                                                  | Scheduled items                                | Training                                       |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| January   (ad hoc) | -

        "page_content": "## Subsidiary governance and ring-fencing\n\nNatWest Group plc is a listed company with equity listed on the London and New York stock exchanges.\n\nNatWest Holdings Limited (NWH) is the holding company for our ring-fenced operations, which include our retail, commercial and private banking businesses. A common board structure is operated such that the directors of NWH are also directors of The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and National Westminster Bank Plc. Known collectively as the NWH Sub Group, the boards of these three entities meet concurrently.\n\nOn 3 May 2021, following Court approval, the business of Ulster Bank Limited was transferred into its immediate parent, National Westminster Bank Plc (NWB Plc). This reorganisation saw the Ulster Bank brand in Northern Ireland become a trading name of NWB Plc and simplified the NatWest Group by aligning the legal entity structure with the pre-existing management structure. The simplification ensured continuity of service under the Ulster Bank brand, with customers continuing to receive the same products and services through the same channels. Colleagues became employees of NWB Plc, with their existing benefits and conditions of employment remaining unchanged.\n\nAn integral part of NatWest Group's governance arrangements is the appointment of three double independent non-executive directors (DINEDs) to the boards, and board committees, of the NWH Sub Group. They are Francesca Barnes, Graham Beale, and Ian Cormack.\n\nThe DINEDs are independent in two respects: (i) independent of management as non-executives; and (ii) independent of the rest of NatWest Group by virtue of their NWH Sub Group-only directorships.\n\nThe DINEDs play a critical role in NatWest Group's ring-fencing governance structure, and are responsible for exercising appropriate oversight of the independence and effectiveness of the NWH Sub Group's governance arrangements, including the ability of each board to take decisions independently.\n\nThe DINEDs attend NatWest Group plc Board and relevant Board Committee meetings in an observer capacity.\n\nThe governance arrangements for the boards and board committees of NatWest Group plc and the NWH Sub Group have been designed to enable NatWest Group plc to exercise appropriate oversight and to ensure that, as far as is reasonably practicable, the NWH Sub Group is able to take decisions independently of the wider Group.\n\nNatWest Markets supports NatWest Group's corporate and institutional customers through NatWest Markets Plc and its subsidiaries.\n\nRBS International serves retail, commercial and corporate customers and financial institutions and operates through The Royal Bank of Scotland International (Holdings) Limited and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Group Nominations and Governance Committee monitors the governance arrangements of NatWest Group plc and its\n\nsubsidiaries and approves appointments to the boards of principal and material regulated subsidiaries, as described in the Group Nominations and Governance Committee report on page 114.\n\n## 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nThroughout the year the company has applied the Principles and complied with the Provisions of the Code, except in relation to:\n\n- -Provision 17 that the Group Nominations and Governance Committee should ensure plans are in place for orderly succession to both the board and senior management positions and oversee the development of a diverse pipeline for succession; and\n- -Provision 33 that the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee should have delegated responsibility for setting remuneration for the Chairman and executive directors.\n\nIn both instances, the Board considers that these are matters which should rightly be reserved for the Board, as set out in more detail in our statement of compliance on page 181.\n\nIn addition, the Board has delegated two particular aspects of the Code's provisions to Board Committees, with regular updates provided to the Board as appropriate:\n\n- -The Group Audit Committee has delegated responsibility for reviewing and monitoring NatWest Group's whistleblowing process.\n- -The Group Sustainable Banking Committee has delegated responsibility for reviewing key workforce policies and practices (not related to pay) to ensure they are consistent with NatWest Group's values and support long-term sustainable success.\n\nFor further information please refer to the remainder of this report and the relevant Committee reports on the following pages.\n\nFurther information on how the company has applied the Principles and complied with the Provisions of the Code is set out below under the Code's five main section headings.\n\n## Board leadership and company purpose\n\n## Role of the Board\n\nThe Board is collectively responsible for promoting the long-term sustainable success of the company, driving both shareholder value and contribution to wider society. The Board's role is to provide leadership of the company within a framework of prudent and effective controls which enables risk to be assessed and managed. The Board establishes NatWest Group's purpose, values and strategy and leads the development of NatWest Group's culture. The Board sets the strategic aims of the company and its subsidiaries, ensures that the necessary resources are in place for NatWest Group to meet its objectives, is responsible for the raising and allocation of capital and reviews business and financial performance. It ensures that the company's obligations to its shareholders and other key stakeholders are understood and met.\n\nThe Board terms of reference include a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for the Board's decision and are reviewed at least annually. They are available at natwestgroup.com. An internal review confirmed the Board had fulfilled its remit as set out in its terms of reference during 2021.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nThe Board has established a number of Board Committees with particular responsibilities. Please refer to the Committee Chairman reports for further details. Board Committee terms of reference are available at natwestgroup.com.\n\n## Purpose, values, strategy and culture\n\nIn February 2020, and following an extensive period of stakeholder engagement, the Board approved NatWest Group's purpose and strategy. Throughout 2021, our\n\npurpose has continued to inform and drive our response to the pandemic, acting as an important point of reference during Board discussions, debate and decision-making.\n\nThe Board received its annual purpose update in December 2021 which summarised progress in becoming a purpose-led bank against the three purpose focus areas of climate, enterprise and learning. It highlighted the progress to date on embedding purpose and delivering against public commitments; the key areas of focus for 2022; and an update on stakeholders' perception of NatWest Group and its purpose aligned to the Blueprint for Better Business framework.\n\nFurther information on progress against our purpose and strategic priorities can be found in the Strategic report.\n\nThe Board assesses and monitors NatWest Group's culture in several ways, as illustrated by the diagram below.\n\n## NatWest Group plc - Board responsibilities in relation to culture\n\n-Leads the development of NatWest Group's culture, values and standards.\n\n- -Assesses and monitors culture.\n- -Reviews and approves NatWest Group's values.\n\n## Board reporting on culture\n\n| What did the Board receive?                                                       | receive it?           | When did it  Key areas of focus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Banking Standards Board (BSB)  presentation (now FSCB)                            | February              | BSB's 2020 Survey Annual Report and its review of the embedding of purpose in  NatWest Group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Colleague Advisory  Panel reports                                                 | March June December   | Feedback on discussions from Colleague Advisory Panel meetings.

The Board's agenda and engagement plans were structured to enhance the Board's understanding of stakeholders' views and interests. This in turn has informed Board discussions and decision-making.\n\n## Workforce engagement\n\nNatWest Group's Colleague Advisory Panel (CAP) was set up in 2018 to help promote colleague voices in the boardroom and supports our compliance with Code requirements in relation to Board engagement with the workforce.\n\nThrough the CAP, colleagues can engage directly with senior management and the Board on topics which are important to them, thereby strengthening the voice of colleagues in the Boardroom. The CAP is made up of 28 colleagues who represent employee-led networks, talent programmes, employee representative bodies or are self-nominated. In this way we ensure the panel is diverse, inclusive and representative of the workforce.\n\nThe CAP met with representatives from the Board three times in 2021 to discuss issues such as wellbeing, remuneration (including executives and the wider workforce), climate, retail banking strategy, sustainability and purpose. The CAP continues to be highly regarded by those who attend and has proven to be an effective way of establishing two-way dialogue between colleagues and Board members. In 2022 we are reviewing our approach to how the Board engages with the workforce.\n\nThe Stakeholder engagement section of the Strategic report on pages 14 to 17 includes examples of how the Board engaged directly with stakeholders, and our section 172(1) statement on pages 52 to 53 describes how stakeholder interests have been considered in board decision-making, including principal decisions.\n\nSet out below is an overview of further ways in which stakeholder views have been communicated to the Board, which often takes place indirectly via management updates.\n\n| Stakeholder  Group   | How stakeholder  views have been  communicated   |                                                                                      | Examples of what was shared                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | How did the Board use that information?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Customers            | -

At that time, it was acknowledged that a refreshed set of values, aligned to our purpose, would be presented to the Board in December 2021 for approval and that workforce policies and practices would be updated where required to ensure ongoing alignment to NatWest Group's values.\n\nThe Group Audit Committee retains responsibility for reviewing and monitoring NatWest Group's whistleblowing process.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nThe Directors' Conflicts of Interest policy sets out procedures to ensure that the Board's management of conflicts of interest and its powers for authorising certain conflicts are operating effectively.\n\nEach director is required to notify the Board of any actual or potential situational or transactional conflict of interest and to update the Board with any changes to the facts and circumstances surrounding such conflicts.\n\nSituational conflicts can be authorised by the Board in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the company's Articles of Association. The Board considers each request for authorisation on a case-by-case basis and has the power to impose conditions or limitations on any authorisation granted as part of the process. Details of all directors' conflicts of interest are recorded in a register which is maintained by the Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary and reviewed annually by the Board.\n\n## Division of responsibilities\n\nThe Board has 11 directors comprising the Chairman, two executive directors and eight independent non-executive directors, one of whom is the Senior Independent Director.\n\nDirector biographies and details of the Board Committees of which they are members can be found on pages 98 to 101.\n\n## Non-executive director independence\n\nThe Board considers that the Chairman was independent on appointment and that all current non-executive directors are independent for the purposes of the Code.\n\n## Chairman and Group CEO\n\nThe role of Chairman is distinct and separate from that of the Group CEO and there is a clear division of responsibilities, with the Chairman leading the Board and the Group CEO managing the business day to day.\n\n## Senior Independent Director\n\nThroughout 2021, Mark Seligman, as Senior Independent Director, acted as a sounding board for the Chairman, and as an intermediary for other directors when necessary. He was also available to shareholders to discuss any concerns they may have had, as appropriate.\n\n## Non-executive directors\n\nAlong with the Chairman and executive directors, the non-executive directors are responsible for ensuring the Board fulfils its responsibilities under its terms of reference.\n\nThe non-executive directors combine broad business and commercial experience with independent and objective judgment. They provide constructive challenge, strategic guidance, and specialist advice to the executive directors and the executive management team and hold management to account.\n\nThe balance between non-executive and executive directors enables the Board to provide clear and effective leadership across NatWest Group's business activities and ensures no one individual or small group of individuals dominates the Board's decision-making.\n\nThe Chairman and non-executive directors meet at least once every year without the executive directors present.\n\nDetails of the key responsibilities of the Chairman, Group CEO, Senior Independent Director and non-executive directors are available at natwestgroup.com.\n\nThe performance of the Chairman and non-executive directors is evaluated annually and further details of the process undertaken can be found on page 113.\n\n## Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary\n\nThe Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary, Jan Cargill, works closely with the Chairman to ensure effective and efficient functioning of the Board and appropriate alignment and information flows between the Board and its Committees.\n\nThe Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board and individual directors on all governance matters, and also facilitates Board induction and directors' professional development.\n\n## Executive management\n\nThe Group CEO is supported by Group ExCo, which considers strategic, financial, capital, risk and operational issues affecting NatWest Group and reviews relevant matters in advance of Board submission. Group ExCo's membership comprises the Group CEO, Group CFO and the Group Chief Risk Officer; who are also members of the wider executive management team.

        "page_content": "## Time commitment and external appointments\n\nIt is anticipated that non-executive directors will allocate sufficient time to the company to discharge their responsibilities effectively and will devote such time as is necessary to fulfil their role. Directors have been briefed on the limits on the number of other directorships that they can hold under the requirements of the fourth Capital Requirements Directive.\n\nThe Code emphasises the importance of ensuring directors have sufficient time to meet their board responsibilities. Prior to appointment, significant commitments require to be disclosed with an indication of the time involved. External appointments require prior Board approval, with the reasons for permitting significant appointments explained in the Annual Report and Accounts.\n\nLena Wilson and Frank Dangeard both re-organised their portfolios of appointments and took up new appointments in 2021. Ms Wilson was appointed as a non-executive director and subsequently Chair of Picton Property Income Limited and as a non-executive director and Chair of AGS Airports Limited and Mr Dangeard was appointed Chairman of SPEAR Investments I B.V. These appointments were approved by the Board in advance and the Board considered both potential conflicts and time commitment and was satisfied that each would be able to continue to meet their commitments to NatWest Group given the other changes to their respective portfolios.\n\nThe Board continues to monitor the commitments of the Chairman and directors and is satisfied that they are able to allocate sufficient time to enable them to discharge their duties and responsibilities effectively.\n\n## Information\n\nAll directors receive accurate, timely and clear information on all relevant matters and have access to the advice and services of the Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary. In addition, all directors are able, if necessary, to obtain independent professional advice at the company's expense.\n\nOur Board and Committee paper template includes a section for authors to explain how the proposal or update aligns with our purpose and a separate section for them to include an assessment of the relevant stakeholder impacts for the directors to consider. This aligns with the directors' duties under section 172(1) of the Companies Act 2006 and further details on how the directors have complied with their section 172(1) duties can be found on pages 52 to 53 of the Strategic report.\n\nOur directors are mindful that it is not always possible to achieve an outcome which meets the requirements, needs and/or expectations of all stakeholders who are, or may be, impacted. For decisions which are particularly challenging or complex, we introduced an additional page to our paper template in 2021 which provides directors with further information to support purposeful decision-making. This additional page uses Blueprint for Better Business as a base and is aligned to our broader purpose framework.\n\n## Induction and professional development\n\nEach new director receives a formal induction on joining the Board, which is coordinated by the Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary and tailored to suit the requirements of the individual concerned. This includes visits to NatWest Group's major businesses and functions and meetings with directors and senior management. Meetings with external auditors, counsel and stakeholders are also arranged as appropriate.\n\nAll new directors receive a copy of the NatWest Group Director Handbook. The Handbook operates as a consolidated governance support manual for directors of NatWest Group plc and the NWH Sub Group, providing both new and current directors with a single source of information relevant to their role. It covers a range of topics including NatWest Group's corporate structure; the Board and Board Committee operating model; Board policies and processes; and a range of technical guidance on relevant matters including directors' duties, conflicts of interest, and the UK Senior Managers and Certification Regime. The Handbook forms part of a wider library of reference materials available via our resources portal.\n\nDirectors have access to a wide range of briefing and training sessions and other professional development opportunities. Internal training relevant to the business of NatWest Group is also provided. Directors undertake the training they consider necessary to assist them in carrying out their duties and responsibilities. The non-executive directors discuss their training and professional development with the Chairman at least annually. Details of the training and development undertaken by directors during 2021, which is co-ordinated by the Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary, can be found on pages 104 to 105 (Board annual calendar for 2021).\n\n## Composition, succession and evaluation Composition\n\nThe Board is structured to ensure that the directors provide NatWest Group plc with the appropriate combination of skills, experience, knowledge and diversity, as well as independence.\n\nGiven the nature of NatWest Group's businesses, experience of banking and financial services is clearly of benefit, and the Board has a number of directors with substantial experience in those areas. Our directors also possess substantial skills and experience in the areas of Transformation, Financial Markets/ Investment Banking, and Environmental, Social and Governance (including climate).\n\nIn December 2021 the Group Nominations and Governance Committee reviewed, and the Board approved, a refreshed version of our Board skills matrix, a summary view of which is set out below.\n\nThe Board skills matrix reflects directors' self-assessment of the skills and experience they bring to Board discussions, in line with pre-determined criteria aligned to current and future strategic priorities, and will continue to be considered by the Group Nominations and Governance Committee, and the Board, at least once a year.\n\n## Board skills and experience\n\nSkills and experience\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n11\n\nBoard Committees also comprise directors with a variety of skills and experience so that no undue reliance is placed on any one individual.\n\n## Succession\n\nAs set out in its terms of reference the Board is responsible for ensuring adequate succession planning for the Board and senior management, so as to maintain an appropriate balance of skills and experience within NatWest Group and on the Board.\n\nIn 2021 the Board received two updates on talent and executive succession planning which enabled them to monitor the internal talent pipeline and provide feedback. These updates included a detailed analysis of the diversity of the talent pool, with a view towards continuing to improve diversity over the longer term.\n\nThe Board also held a talent session with potential Executive Committee successors, and members of the Group Sustainable Banking Committee held an informal session with executive talent. These sessions helped our non-executive directors to get to know potential future leaders, through focused debates on strategic topics.\n\nThe Group Nominations and Governance Committee supports the Board on Board succession planning, including making recommendations to the Board on Board appointments and Board Committee membership.\n\nIn February 2021 (following review and recommendation by the Group Nominations and Governance Committee), the Board approved succession plans for the roles of Senior Independent Director and Committee Chairs, covering orderly transition plans for the short and medium term, and contingency arrangements which could be implemented in case of an emergency. These succession plans are reviewed by the Group Nominations and Governance Committee and approved by the Board at least once a year.\n\nFurther information on the role of the Group Nominations and Governance Committee and its activities during 2021 can be found in the Committee Chairman's report on page 114.\n\n## Election and re-election of directors\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Code, all directors stand for election or re-election by shareholders at the company's AGM.\n\nIn accordance with the UK Listing Rules, the election or re-election of independent directors also requires approval by a majority of independent shareholders.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nIn accordance with the Code, an evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Committees, the Chairman and individual directors takes place annually. The evaluation is externally facilitated every three years, with internal evaluations in the intervening years.\n\nAn external evaluation was conducted in 2018 by Independent Board Evaluation (IBE), with internal evaluations taking place in 2019 and 2020. IBE returned in 2021 to facilitate their second external Board and Committee evaluation for NatWest Group. Further details on how IBE was selected in 2021, how the 2021 evaluation was conducted and the outcomes and actions arising from that process are set out in this section.\n\n## Progress following the 2020 internal Board evaluation\n\nA number of actions were progressed during 2021 in response to the findings of the 2020 internal Board evaluation.\n\n| 2020 actions                                                                               | 2021 progress                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Agree a shorter and more focused set of  Board objectives for 2021.                        | - A more concise set of Board objectives was agreed for 2021, supporting effective  management of Board priorities and agenda planning.                                                                                  |\n| Explore different options for directors to  engage with customers.                         | - Through a customer engagement programme a number of non-executive directors  observed customer facing colleagues in action and heard customer feedback as  part of a focus group or customer listening surgery.        |\n| Review potential enhancements to Board  Management Information on customers  and suppliers | - Board reporting was enhanced to include customer measures aligned to purpose  and transformation targets, and enhanced tracking of progress against customer  advocacy and satisfaction targets. -                     |\n|                                                                                            | There was also a review and alignment of customer measures used across the  businesses, to ensure greater consistency of reporting. - Our business review template was updated to provide for more detailed reporting    |\n| Enhance Board visibility of Executive  Committee successors.                               | - Board visibility of the executive talent pipeline was enhanced through Board and  Group Sustainable Banking Committee talent sessions. - Senior executives below Executive Committee level continued to present papers |\n\nDetails of progress made against the actions arising from the 2020 internal Committee evaluations can be found in the relevant Committee Chairman Reports.",

        "page_content": "## 2021 External Board Committee evaluation\n\nIBE were engaged to facilitate the external evaluation in 2021. IBE had previously conducted the 2018 evaluation and at that time, NatWest Group's corporate governance arrangements were undergoing significant change in preparation for the implementation of ring-fencing.\n\nFollowing a recommendation from the Group Nominations and Governance Committee, the Board agreed that the 2021 evaluation should be conducted externally in accordance with the Code and that IBE should be appointed again to provide important continuity. The Board concluded that IBE's appointment would also provide a helpful opportunity to review how ring-fencing governance arrangements had embedded since the 2018 exercise.\n\nIBE has no other connection with NatWest Group. The sections of this report which describe the process followed or which attribute opinions to the external facilitator have been agreed with IBE prior to publication.\n\n|                             | How the evaluation was conducted                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Objectives and  scope       | - The Chairman, Group CEO and Chief Governance Officer and Company Secretary briefed IBE on the  objectives of the 2021 Board and Committee evaluation. - The NatWest Group plc and NWH Sub Group Boards and Board Committees were confirmed to be in scope  for a comprehensive performance review.

Board relationships with management were more transparent, and there was a better balance between support and challenge from the Board. Care would be required to ensure this balance was maintained. Whilst working remotely remained challenging and directors missed the opportunity for informal interaction, they were pleased at how quickly and effectively they had been able to adapt.\n\nAfter a period of stability in terms of Board composition, the IBE report highlighted the importance of prioritising Board succession planning in future. IBE highlighted scope to enhance the Board's technology experience, and the importance of ensuring appropriate focus on diversity (with respect to age, gender, experience and ethnicity). These are matters which the Board and Group Nominations and Governance Committee will keep under review during 2022.\n\nIBE also observed that NatWest Group's ring-fencing governance arrangements, which had just been introduced at the time of the 2018 evaluation, were now considered to be operating effectively with no significant issues or concerns raised.\n\nIn February 2022 the Board agreed a detailed action plan in response to the recommendations set out in IBE's 2021 external Board evaluation report, which included the following:-\n\n| Theme                                          | 2022 actions                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Strategy                                       | Introduce a new operating rhythm for Board engagement and oversight with more frequent sessions  during the year focused on key strategic topics.                                                      |\n| Board focus and priorities                     | Agree a new set of Board objectives for 2022. Identify opportunities to streamline the Board agenda  and other Board activities to facilitate effective management of Board priorities.                |\n| Engagement with the  business and stakeholders | Identify further opportunities for non-executive directors to engage with the business and key  stakeholders either through participation in existing business initiatives or Board specific activity. |\n| Colleague engagement                           | Review the Board's overall approach to colleague engagement, including the role of the Colleague  Advisory Panel, to ensure it remains fit for purpose.                                                |\n\nImplementation of the 2021 Board evaluation action plan will be overseen by the Group Nominations and Governance Committee during 2022.\n\n## 2021 Board Committee evaluations - outcomes and actions\n\nDetails of the outcomes of the 2021 external Board Committee evaluations can be found in the relevant Committee Chairman reports. Progress against these actions will be tracked at Committee level during 2022.\n\n## 2021 Individual director and Chairman effectiveness reviews\n\nThe Chairman met each director individually to discuss their own performance and continuing professional development and establish whether each director continues to contribute effectively to the company's long-term sustainable success. The Chairman also shared peer feedback provided to IBE as part of the evaluation process.\n\nSeparately, the Senior Independent Director, together with the Senior Independent Director of the ring-fenced bank, sought feedback on the Chairman's performance from the non-executive directors, executive directors and other key internal and external stakeholders and discussed it with the Chairman. This included peer feedback provided to IBE by directors as part of the evaluation process.\n\n## Audit, risk & internal control\n\nInformation on how the company has applied the Principles and complied with the Provisions set out in this section of the Code can be found throughout the Annual Report and Accounts. The following sections are of particular relevance:\n\n- -the Group Audit Committee Chairman's letter and the report of the Committee (page 116) which sets out the process undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of both the Internal Audit function and the external auditors in 2021, and the principal findings thereof. It also explains the approach taken to ensuring the integrity of financial and narrative statements, and confirms that it supports the Board in the assessment of NatWest Group's disclosures to be fair, balanced and understandable;\n- -the viability statement (page 76) which details how the Board has assessed the future prospects of NatWest Group plc and the ways in which risks are considered and managed in order to achieve its strategic objectives;\n- -the Compliance report (page 181), which explains the internal control framework in place; and\n- -the Group Board Risk Committee Chairman's letter and report of the Committee (page 124) which explains how the Board oversees the principal and emerging risks facing NatWest Group and how management addresses these.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nThe Directors' remuneration report on pages 136 to 139 provides information on the activities of the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee, the decisions taken on remuneration during the year and why the Committee believes these are the right outcomes in the circumstances. The report also details how the remuneration policy for executive directors supports the delivery of the company's strategic goals and purpose, with significant delivery in shares to provide long-term alignment with shareholders. Information is also included on wider workforce remuneration and the steps taken to engage with the workforce around remuneration and ensure fair pay and a healthy culture.",

In addition, the Committee monitors NatWest Group's governance arrangements to ensure that best corporate governance standards and practices are upheld and considers developments relating to banking reform and analogous issues affecting NatWest Group. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board in respect of any consequential amendments to NatWest Group's operating model.\n\nThe terms of reference of the Committee are reviewed annually, approved by the Board and are available at natwestgroup.com.\n\n## Principal activity during 2021\n\nThere were no changes to the composition of the Board during 2021. The Committee nevertheless acknowledges the tenure of a number of current Board directors and therefore made succession planning a priority in 2021. The Committee reviewed the contribution of a number of Board members under the Board Appointment Policy which sees non-executive directors appointed for an initial three year term, subject to annual re-election at the AGM. Following assessment by the Committee, they may then be appointed for a further three year term. Non-executive directors may continue to serve beyond six years, subject to a maximum tenure of nine years. The tenures of current Board directors is set out on page 81.\n\nIn addition to reviewing the structure, size and composition of the NatWest Group plc Board, the Committee has also continued to oversee work aimed at further enhancing NatWest Group's subsidiary governance framework. A number of our material regulated subsidiaries made appointments to their boards during 2021, which the Committee has overseen. Spencer Stuart and Green Park have both been engaged during the year to support NatWest Group's subsidiary board search activity. The firms are members of the retained executive search panel of suppliers (managed by NatWest Executive Search). Spencer Stuart also provide leadership advisory and senior executive search and assessment services to the Human Resources function within NatWest Group.\n\nIn addition to succession planning, the Committee has overseen the process to reach agreement with the PRA in respect of the renewal of regulatory modifications which ensure the continuation of a governance model that is compatible with ring-fencing legislation.\n\nDuring the year the Committee continued to monitor NatWest Group's governance arrangements to ensure that they remain appropriate by reference to best practices in corporate governance (having regard to relevant legislation, guidelines, industry practice and developments affecting NatWest Group in the markets where it operates).\n\nDuring 2021 the Committee considered a number of external policy developments and the potential impacts on NatWest Group's corporate governance framework, including HM Treasury's independent review of ring-fencing and proprietary trading, as well as discussion and consultation papers issued by the FCA, PRA and Bank of England on proposals to enhance diversity and inclusion in the financial sector.\n\n## Membership and meetings\n\nThroughout 2021 the Committee comprised the Chairman of the Board and four independent non-executive directors. Graham Beale also observes meetings of the Committee in his capacity as Senior Independent Director of NWH Ltd and member of the NWH Ltd Nominations Committee.\n\nThe Committee holds a minimum of four meetings per year and meets on an ad hoc basis as required. In 2021, there were four meetings. Individual attendance by directors at these meetings is shown in the table on page 103.\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\nThe 2021 review of the effectiveness of the Board and its senior Committees was facilitated by Independent Board Evaluation, a specialist board evaluation consultancy. The Committee has considered and discussed the outcomes of the evaluation and accepts the findings, more information on which can be found on page 112. Overall, the review concluded that the Committee's responsibilities had been discharged effectively with no material recommendations being identified for action. The Committee will continue to ensure that the full Board is appropriately sighted on the work of the Committee, including the Board succession activity that will be a key priority for the Committee during 2022.\n\nThe outcomes of the evaluation have been reported to the Board and the Committee will track progress during the year.\n\n## Boardroom Inclusion Policy\n\nAs noted on page 81, the Board operates a Boardroom Inclusion Policy which reflects the most recent industry targets and is aligned to the NatWest Group Inclusion Policy and Principles applying to the wider bank. The policy currently applies to the most senior NatWest Group boards: NatWest Group plc, NWH Ltd, NWB Plc and RBS plc. A copy of the Boardroom Inclusion Policy is available at natwestgroup.com/ who-we-are.\n\n## Objectives and targets\n\nThe Boardroom Inclusion Policy's objectives ensure that the Board, and any Committee to which it delegates nomination responsibilities, follows an inclusive process when making nomination decisions. That includes ensuring that the nomination process is based on the principles of fairness, respect and inclusion, that all nominations and appointments are made on the basis of individual competence, skills and expertise measured against identified objective criteria and that searches for Board candidates are conducted with due regard to the benefits of diversity and inclusion.\n\n## Monitoring and reporting\n\nThroughout 2021 the Board met the recommendation of the Parker Review with at least one member of the Board being of Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic background and it intends to continue to meet that recommendation.\n\nAt the end of 2021 the Board exceeded the recommendation of the FTSE Women Leaders Review ((formerly the HamptonAlexander Report) 33% female representation on the boards), with 36% of the Board being female.\n\nThe boards of NatWest Group plc and the NWH Group meet consecutively and share a largely common membership.\n\nWhen considered together, the director population across both boards currently meets the Parker target and exceeds the FTSE Woman Leaders target with a female representation of 36%.\n\nDiversity and inclusion progress, including information about the appointment process, will continue to be reported in the Group Nominations and Governance Committee's report in the NatWest Group plc Annual Report and Accounts.\n\nThe balance of skills, experience, independence, knowledge and diversity on the Board, and how the Board operates together as a unit, is reviewed annually as part of the Board evaluation. Where appropriate, findings from the evaluation will be considered in the search, nomination and appointment process. Further details on NatWest Group's approach to diversity can be found on page 59.\n\n## Howard Davies\n\nChairman of the Group Nominations and Governance Committee 17 February 2022",

This report sets out the key areas of focus for the GAC during the year and explains how the Committee discharged its key responsibilities.\n\nA core function of the Committee is to oversee and challenge the processes undertaken by management in the preparation of the published financial and relevant non-financial information. The Committee also assists the NatWest Group Board in carrying out its responsibilities relating to accounting policies and internal control functions. More detail on the remit of the Committee can be found in its terms of reference which are reviewed annually and available at natwestgroup.com.\n\nScrutinising the integrity and quality of the financial results released by NatWest Group over the course of the year continued to be a priority for the Committee. As part of its review of disclosures such as the quarterly, interim and full year results, the Committee also considered detailed reports from management on the judgments applied during the preparation of the information and legal and regulatory developments. Consideration was also given to management's assessment of the internal controls over financial reporting and the GAC also received reports from both the internal auditors on the internal control environment and the external auditors on internal controls over financial reporting and key accounting and judgmental matters.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the annual, interim and quarterly supplements on climate, purpose and ESG matters, as well as the annual Climate-related Disclosures Report. Particular scrutiny was given to the controls and basis of preparation for these releases. The Committee recognises such disclosures will continue to evolve over time. The impact of climate-related issues on financial statements more broadly was also considered by the Committee during the year.\n\nAs the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken by the Government in response persisted throughout 2021, the Committee dedicated much time to the consideration of accounting judgments. In particular the Committee considered how the judgments were applied to determining post-model adjustments, as well as the actual and forecast impact on credit losses. The performance of internal\n\nmodels used by management for these purposes continued to improve following enhancements implemented in 2020. Benchmarking data provided by the PRA and the external auditor has again offered helpful context to the Committee given the continued uncertain conditions.\n\nThe Committee oversight of the performance of the Internal Audit function and ensuring its independence is a key responsibility of the Committee. In February 2021 a new Chief Audit Executive joined NatWest Group and I have supported him in delivering enhancements to the operation and focus of the Internal Audit function.\n\nI have continued to be NatWest Group's whistleblowing champion, and the Committee maintains responsibility for oversight of the independence, autonomy and effectiveness of NatWest group's whistleblowing policies and procedures. In 2021 NatWest Group has continued to offer an effective whistleblowing service to colleagues.\n\nI welcomed the opportunity to respond to the consultation launched by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) into audit and corporate governance. Stakeholders were invited to share their views on a range of proposals relating to the UK's corporate governance framework for major companies and the way they are audited. I shared my views as Chairman of the GAC on the most pertinent proposals, which were submitted alongside a detailed NatWest Group-wide response. I would like to extend my thanks to my fellow Committee members and attendees for their contributions to the work of the GAC during 2021.\n\n## Patrick Flynn\n\nChairman of the Group Audit Committee 17 February 2022\n\n## Membership\n\nFull biographical details of the members of the Committee during 2021 are set out on pages 98 and 101. The members are all independent non-executive directors who also sit on other Board committees in addition to the GAC (as set out in their biographies). This common membership helps facilitate effective governance across all finance, risk and remuneration matters and ensures that agendas are aligned and duplication of responsibilities is avoided.\n\nMembers of the GAC are selected with a view to the expertise and experience of the Committee as a whole and with proper regard to the key issues and challenges facing NatWest Group. As NatWest Group plc is a listed company on the London and New York stock exchanges it has certain obligations as to the expertise and qualifications of the Audit Committee. The Board is satisfied that all GAC members have recent and relevant financial experience and are independent as defined in the SEC rules under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 'Exchange Act') and related guidance. The Board has further determined that Patrick Flynn, Mark Seligman and Robert Gillespie are all 'financial experts' for the purposes of compliance with the Exchange Act Rules and the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, and that they have competence in accounting and/or auditing as required under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\n\n## Meetings and visits\n\nFive scheduled meetings of the Committee were held in 2021, four of which took place immediately prior to the release of the financial results each quarter. During the year all members attended the meetings, all of which were held virtually. All meetings were also attended, in an observational capacity, by the two non-executive directors of NatWest Holdings who are members of that entity's Audit Committee.\n\nIn conjunction with the Group and NWH Board Risk Committee (BRC) and the NWH Audit Committee, the GAC undertook its annual programme of visits to control functions. Constructive and insightful discussions were held with members of management from the Risk, Internal Audit and Finance teams.\n\n## Performance evaluations\n\nIn 2021 the annual review of the effectiveness of the Board and its senior Committees, including the GAC, was conducted externally by Independent Board Evaluation. It was determined that the GAC had continued to operate effectively during 2021,\n\nmeeting its statutory duties. The outcomes of the evaluation were considered by the Committee and subsequently reported to the Board. The Committee will support management's consideration of the recommendation to review the leadership structure of the Finance function, and this was discussed with the Group CFO in the context of talent development and longer term planning for the function. The Committee also welcomed the recommendation to improve the diversity of the Committee membership, and this will be reviewed by the Nominations and Governance Committee as part of its ongoing business. The depth of financial expertise of the Committee was also recognised via the evaluation. The Committee is satisfied it fulfilled its terms of reference in 2021.\n\nThe Committee continued to monitor the performance of the external auditor and the Internal Audit function in 2021. Formal assessments were undertaken at the end of the year via an internal process and the Committee reviewed summaries of the feedback provided by relevant stakeholders. Progress made to address the recommendations of the previous year's evaluations was welcomed.\n\n## Financial and non-financial reporting\n\nThe GAC considered a number of accounting judgments and reporting issues in the preparation of NatWest Group's financial results throughout 2021. The Committee reviewed the quarterly, interim and full year results announcements, the annual reporting suite of documents and other principal financial and non-financial releases for recommendation to the NatWest Group plc Board for approval. This included the disclosures required by the TCFD and the quarterly Climate, Purpose and ESG measures supplements. Consideration was given to the controls surrounding the preparation of these releases.\n\n| Matter                   | Role of Committee and  context of discussion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | How the Committee addressed the matter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Expected  credit losses  | To review and challenge  management's judgements  in relation to credit  impairments and the  underlying assumptions,  methodologies and models  applied, and any post-model  adjustments required. To  also consider the impact of  macro-economic risks on  the credit environment. | The GAC focused on the key assumptions, methodologies and post-model  adjustments applied to provisions under IFRS 9. The continued economic  uncertainty during 2021 and the dislocation between the economics and  the credit impacts observed, led management to adopt a measured  approach to the release of IFRS 9 provisions in the year. In evaluating  management's proposal to release \u00a31.3 billion, the Committee considered  the previously implemented enhancements to the internal models and  the improvements in the economic environment during 2021. Industry  benchmarking data, particularly in the first half of the year, was also  helpful to the Committee and informed its considerations. The Committee  recognises that post-model adjustments should be limited to considerations |\n| Treatment  of goodwill   | To consider the treatment  of goodwill throughout  the year and ensure  the carrying value was  appropriate and suitable  disclosures were made.                                                                                                                                      | Management did not identify any reason to undertake an out of  cycle reassessment of goodwill during 2021. Following discussion and  challenge, the Committee was satisfied that goodwill remained recoverable  throughout the year, and that appropriate disclosures were included in the  quarterly and interim financial releases. The Committee considered and  supported management's proposed write down of \u00a385 million of goodwill in  RBS (and at higher levels) on the basis of materiality at the end of the year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Valuation  methodologies | To consider valuation  methodologies, assumptions  and judgments made  by management.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | The GAC considered valuation methodologies and assumptions for  financial instruments carried at fair value and scrutinised judgments made  by management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |",

In carrying out this important role, the Committee helps to ensure that NatWest Group is purpose-led in its decision-making, building long-term value in the business. More detail on the remit of the Committee can also be found in its terms of reference which are reviewed annually and available at natwestgroup.com.\n\nDuring 2021 the committee ensured its time was prioritised to focus on oversight of NatWest Group's principal and emerging risks, including improvements to the management of financial crime risk, model risk improvements, and the risk impacts of developments in the external environment as a result of COVID-19. It has also maintained oversight of the continued enhancement of the enterprise-wide risk management framework and the development of regular risk reporting to drive more insightful reporting to the Board.\n\nIt is expected that these will continue to be areas of focus in 2022 as NatWest Group drives towards return to appetite in a number of areas and further impact of COVID-19 is experienced.\n\nFurther information on key topics considered during the year and areas of focus and challenge by the Committee is provided on the following pages.\n\nI would like to thank my fellow Committee members for their continued commitment, support and challenge throughout the year.\n\n## Morten Friis\n\nChairman of the Group Board Risk Committee 17 February 2022\n\n'BRC has focused on oversight of NatWest Group's principal risks, including financial crime risk management and model risk management, whilst also overseeing improvements in the quality of underlying risk management frameworks and reporting.'\n\n## Membership\n\nBRC comprises four independent non-executive directors. The details of the members and their skills and experience are set out on pages 98 to 101.\n\nPatrick Flynn is chairman of the Group Audit Committee of which Robert Gillespie and I are also members. Robert is also chairman of the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee (RemCo) and Lena Wilson sits on this Committee. This common membership across Committees helps to ensure effective governance across the committees.\n\nRegular attendees at BRC meetings include: the Group Chairman, Group Chief Executive Officer, Group Chief Financial Officer, Group Chief Risk Officer, Group Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel, Group Chief Audit Executive and the external auditor. External advice is sought by the Committee where appropriate.\n\nTwo non-executive directors of NWH Ltd (the ring-fenced bank) attended Committee meetings as observers in their capacity as members of NWH Ltd's BRC. Meetings of the Group and NWH Ltd's BRCs share much of a common agenda and are generally run in parallel.\n\n## Meetings and visits\n\nThere were eight scheduled meetings of the Committee held in 2021 and one ad hoc meeting of members only was required to discuss executive remuneration matters. The majority of meetings were held virtually during the year due to the pandemic but there was one in person meeting arranged in the second half of the year when circumstances allowed. Details of meeting attendance can be found on page 103.\n\nOutside of formal meetings, the Committee also held an additional meeting on financial crime and met with the Risk Leadership Team to help build relationships and provide the team with greater insights on the Committee's perspectives. Members of the Group and NWH Ltd's BRCs also undertook a programme of visits to the Risk, Internal Audit and Finance functions, in conjunction with members of the Group and NWH Ltd's Audit Committees.\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\nThroughout the year the Committee acted in accordance with its terms of reference. The annual review of the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees, including BRC, facilitated by Independent Board Evaluation, a specialist board evaluation consultancy.\n\nOverall, the review concluded that the Committee operated effectively and had evolved in a positive way. Some areas for potential enhancement were also identified which included streamlining reporting and driving action to address major issues of reputational significant to NatWest Group.

The Committee received  quarterly updates from all three lines of defence which included updates  on progress on return to appetite plans, transformation, emerging risks  and issues, and the Skilled Person's report findings. In addition, the  Committee considered the Money Laundering Reporting Officer's (MLRO's)  report, from the newly appointed MLRO, and considered the enterprise- wide financial crime risk assessment. The CRO reported on the financial  crime risk profile and progress on remediation as part of the risk  management report at each meeting. Throughout the year, the Committee  challenged management on return to appetite slippage, adequacy of  resource and external support, and the pace of transformation and |\n| Model risk      | BRC maintained close  oversight of management  activity to return to appetite  for model risk.                                      | can protect our customers.  The Committee evaluated the appropriateness of the model risk  management framework, including required model changes, regulatory  approval thereof, and the return to appetite plan. The Committee  requested a number of additional spotlight sessions in March, July,  September and October 2021 to maintain close oversight of progress. In  intervening months, updates were given via the risk management report.  The Committee requested additional metrics to differentiate between  models where remediation and validation had been completed but  regulatory approval had not been obtained from those models where  management action was still underway and there was particular focus on  progress of IFRS9 and Internal Ratings Based (IRB) models.

On behalf of the Board, we have focused our efforts on NatWest Group's progress against our purposeful commitments and ambitions.\n\nIn response to feedback arising from the 2021 performance evaluation, it was agreed that the Committee should enhance its focus on customer service and experience. This is now reflected in our terms of reference and refreshed sustainable banking pillars - Climate; Customers; Enterprise; People & Culture; and Conduct & Ethics.\n\n## 2021 Highlights\n\nWe held several spotlight sessions throughout the year, covering our five SBC pillar topics. Committee members challenged the actions taken by management to run the bank as a sustainable business and sought the views of internal and external stakeholders wherever possible. Meeting time is prioritised towards meaningful debate and discussion.\n\nBelow are the key discussion points and outcomes for 2021.\n\n## Climate\n\nAt its annual climate spotlight session, the Committee discussed external developments relating to climate and their potential impact on NatWest Group, including key messages emerging from an NGO roundtable and an update on COP26 preparations. The Committee also considered a detailed update on progress against NatWest Group's climate-related goals and targets.\n\nA franchise-led session on climate-related returns and opportunities included deep dives on clean buildings and voluntary carbon markets. Updates were also considered on climate measurement and reporting; managing the financial and non-financial risks arising from climate change; how\n\nNatWest Group was reducing its own carbon footprint; and investor insights. Later in the year, the Committee also received a deep dive session on NatWest Group's first carbon budget in the context of our carbon emission reduction commitments. A key outcome was to challenge management on climate transition activity, specifically to maintain a opportunistic perspective and to consider the sustainable business model and performance impacts of exiting climate sectors as part of climate budgeting activity.\n\nDiscussion and questions focused on accelerating the transition to net zero for customers in their daily lives and for businesses, including creating new products, services, and sustainable funding and financing. The Committee was impressed by the excellent levels of collaboration demonstrated across NatWest Group and noted the benefits of effective partnerships with third parties on climate-related initiatives. There was debate on how NatWest Group maintains a leadership position while promoting industry-wide progress, and on fostering meaningful partnerships. A key management action was to report back on which ESG surveys and NGO reports were most valued by NatWest Group's influential investors, to direct appropriate resources.\n\nThe discussion continued to build Board level knowledge on the financial risks from climate change. The discussion should influence future proposition and strategy design, particularly around how NatWest Group helps customers to transition, the approach to investor relations and future climate budgeting.\n\n## Customers (including enterprise)\n\nThe Committee received an update on customer service and experience, focused on three key customer segments: Under 30s, Affluent, and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). Franchise CEOs and their teams presented on the range of measures which had been introduced to support customers and communities because of the pandemic.\n\nDiscussion and questions focused on the impact of the pandemic on customers' needs for products and services. Areas of debate included the steps being taken within each segment to enhance customer service and experience, as well as peer comparisons and broader industry trends.\n\nAn external speaker connected to a youth charity joined to help us understand how young people had been hardest hit by the economic crisis arising from the pandemic.\n\nA key outcome was a greater understanding of how youth opinions and expectations of banks had evolved as a result of the pandemic, allowing both management and the Board directors present to better consider the opportunities and needs relating to this important customer segment during future strategy design.\n\n## People & Culture\n\nReflecting an enhanced level of focus on culture at Board level, the Committee's People & Culture meeting concentrated on the cultural change involved in building a purpose-led bank. The meeting began with a 'Living our purpose' spotlight session covering some of the diversity, equity and inclusion\n\ninitiatives which focused on community learning and social mobility. We were joined by two guest speakers - one of NatWest Group's apprentices who joined the bank from school, and charity partner of CareerSense (NatWest Group's employability programme which aims to support 13 to 24 year olds to have the skills, knowledge and experience to take control of their future) - who helped us understand how these programmes are changing the lives of young people.\n\nThe Committee also discussed the results of the latest Our View survey where employees respond to questions covering wellbeing, purpose, building capability and leadership. Linked to this was an update from Internal Audit on their Behavioural Risk reviews, where team sub-cultures are assessed using behavioural science for indicators of potential future conduct issues.\n\nKey areas of discussion and challenge were the need to coordinate and potentially simplify the range of diversity, equity and inclusion policies and practices, culture measurement reporting improvements and assurance of management action to address behavioural sub-culture findings.\n\nA key outcome and example of constructive, Board level challenge was the request for a further deep dive on the branch culture findings, where the Committee felt more detail and understanding was needed about behaviours, products and practices involved, and the improvements planned for.\n\n## Conduct & Ethics\n\nFollowing discussion at the People & Culture session, the Committee received a deep dive presentation on branch culture which focused on safe sales practices, the ongoing branch transformation activity and culture improvement plans which focus on customer feedback rather than product targets. The report and presentation were well received and demonstrated a robust management response to the issues raised.\n\nSpotlight sessions on customer trust, fraud and human rights were also presented, followed by a group discussion with external insights from a guest speaker who challenged NatWest Group's approach and shared practical suggestions based on experience of leading on human rights activity for a global consumer goods company.\n\nDiscussion and challenge focused on the social dimension of the ESG agenda; an area in which interest and expectations are increasing. The Committee listened to customer calls about romance and cryptocurrency scams which prompted discussion about some of the conduct and ethical dilemmas NatWest Group and the wider industry are facing around customer behaviour and responsibility.\n\nA specific conduct-related action was for management to provide data on colleague abuse and related support, given the worrying trend seen in service industries generally.\n\n## Supporting long-term value creation\n\nGiven its purpose responsibilities, the Committee continues to receive a purpose dashboard providing a useful snapshot of NatWest Group's progress against key purpose targets and metrics.\n\nThe Committee also considered and provided advice to the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee on customer, strategy, people and culture targets and performance, advocating for sustainable targets with the incentive framework.\n\nCommittee members enjoyed meeting potential executive-level successors in July 2021, when we explored with top talent how NatWest Group can continue to support, build relationships, and grow within the communities NatWest Group serves.\n\n## Membership, meetings and escalation\n\nThere were no changes to the Committee's membership during 2021. Membership of the SBC continues to comprise three non-executive directors as members, with two nonexecutive directors from NatWest Group's ring-fenced bank board observing, along with management attendees. More details of membership and attendance for the SBC can be found in the Corporate governance report.\n\nThe Committee's operating rhythm, including the number of scheduled meetings held in the year and escalation mechanisms, has not changed since last year's report. Two ad hoc meetings were scheduled to accommodate executive remuneration policy matters. Authority is delegated to the SBC by the Board and a regular report of the Committee's activities is provided to the Board. The Committee's terms of reference are available at natwestgroup.com and these are reviewed annually and approved by the Board.\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\nThe annual review of the effectiveness of the Board and its senior Committees was conducted externally in 2021. The report on the SBC was a positive one. I was pleased to read that the agendas feel well-purposed and my fellow directors enjoy the range of presentations and insights as much as I do. We discussed recommendations relating to driving harder to action and effecting change in the areas within our remit, noting the successes and limitations of our current meeting structure and schedule.\n\nWe agreed to maintain a keener eye on management actions going forward which should support enhanced management accountability. I would also like to continue to see customer experience and service remain at the heart of each of our sessions.\n\nAreas of focus for 2022 will follow this year's structure with the same dedicated meeting themes. The structure will retain some flexibility to allow us to respond to any emerging issues within the Committee's remit should something significant arise. Challenging views and a diverse range of insights will continue to be sought to support the 2022 meetings.\n\nThe Committee operated within its Terms of Reference during the year.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs I envisaged in last year's report, the Committee has continued to oversee Purpose progress across the Group during what has been a critical time of embedding, with enhanced focus on customer service and experience.\n\nWe have continued to benefit from a broad range of internal and external stakeholder perspectives, and our discussions have been all the richer for it.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has contributed to the Committee's activities during 2021, including my fellow directors, attendees, and presenters, for their commitment and dedication.\n\n## Mike Rogers\n\nChairman of the Group Sustainable Banking Committee 17 February 2022",

In doing so, the Committee also gives due consideration to NatWest Group's purpose.\n\nAuthority is delegated to TIC by the Board and a regular report of the Committee's activities is provided to the Board. The terms of reference are available at natwestgroup.com. These are reviewed annually and approved by the Board.\n\n## Principal activity during 2021\n\nDuring 2021, the Committee has played an important role in helping to support and challenge management plans to use technology and innovation as part of its journey to become a relationship bank for a digital world. TIC focused on the principal themes of digitising the core, future ready, innovation, partnerships and ventures, and emerging threats and opportunities. As agreed, as part of the 2020 Committee evaluation, it deliberately focused on a smaller number of deep dives into specific aspects of each theme, including competitor position and link to purpose. Key highlights included:\n\n## Digitising the core\n\nThe Committee received a number of spotlight sessions on the development of existing technology, architecture, and processes to enhance customer experience and maintain the health and resilience of IT systems.\n\nThe Committee considered management programmes designed to automate pioneer customer journeys, including Account Opening and Pay a Bill or Person, which impact 70 to 80% of customer interactions and the majority of the customer base. The Committee considered how the activity would improve customer experience, reduce cost, and utilise One Bank capabilities to drive a consistent approach. Committee discussions focused on digitising the front to back architecture; the use of digital journeys in branch and telephony channels; the benefits from immediate decisioning; and from simplifying the product offering and supporting processes and technology.\n\n'The Committee has played an important role in helping to support and challenge management plans to use technology and innovation as part of its journey to become a relationship bank for a digital world.'\n\nThe Committee also discussed how predictive analytics, including machine learning, was being used within the Retail and Private Banking businesses, primarily to assist with identification of potential customer needs and plans to extend the use of such techniques to the Commercial Banking business.\n\nTIC also considered how Open Finance was changing the sector and the changes required to core systems and architecture. The Committee noted the increased use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to improve the NatWest Group's internal architecture, maximise re-use of assets and to improve customer experience. In addition, the external consumption and monetisation of bank produced APIs in conjunction with partners was also considered. The Committee discussed potential opportunities presented by the development of FreeAgent (integrated lending for NatWest Group customers based on cashflow forecast), Payit (Open Banking payments offering), and data sharing to support new SME customers onboarding.\n\nThe Committee received an update regarding changes in the use of technology by the Risk function. TIC discussed technology and data transformation underway, including the use of robotic process automation and workflow tools; movement of risk engines to a cloud-based solution; data transformation; and use of 'Software as A Service' applications for solutions. The Committee discussed and challenged how proposed changes to the logical data architecture could improve regulatory reporting and noted that approach reduced complexity via data consolidation and assigning end to end ownership for such data.\n\nThe update on the use of technology and innovation as part of NatWest Group's security and cyber defences, included the evolution of the threats faced by NatWest Group; the strength of NatWest Group's defences against such attacks to date; and the continuous innovation approach being implemented. Mr James Lyne, Head of Research and Development at the SANS Institute and member of NatWest Group's Technology Advisory Board provided an external perspective on how NatWest Group compared to competitors and challenges being faced by the industry.\n\n## Future ready\n\nThe Committee considered a number of actions being taken within the organisation to transform data and technology capabilities and deploy forward-looking technology.\n\nTIC received an update on how new technology was empowering colleagues to adapt to a digital future by providing modern software, such as Workday, which had seen high adoption rates. Implementation of Ask Archie, NatWest Group's chatbot, and accelerated adoption of tools such as Microsoft Office 365 and Zoom as a result of COVID-19 were also considered. The Committee discussed and challenged the mindset and behaviour changes needed to embrace adoption, the technology challenges posed by legacy technology platforms, and contention between tools which were managed via One Bank design oversight.\n\nThe Committee discussed the manner in which potential acquisitions would be considered from a technology and innovation perspective. Discussion focussed on external threats, lessons learned from prior acquisitions and potential targets.\n\n## Innovation & partnerships and ventures\n\nBeing powered by innovations and partnerships is a key part of NatWest Group's strategy.\n\nTIC considered an update on the framework and approach to partnership working from a technology and innovation perspective. This was supported by certain deep dives on existing strategic relationships. TIC also discussed the potential income threat from payments disruption and potential opportunities to address this threat.\n\nThe Committee received updates regarding key Venture's initiatives, including Tyl and Rapidcash. In relation to Tyl, the Committee noted that it extended beyond helping businesses to receive payments by helping customers to run and grow their business as well as giving back to the community. The Committee discussed and challenged growth plans and how the business was proposed to be scaled following reduced growth, partly as a result of COVID-19. The competitive environment, emergence of non-traditional payment providers, and the potential to make greater use of merchant acquiring data to help customers and drive further development was also considered.\n\nRegarding Rapidcash, TIC noted the transition of the business into Commercial Banking as a market leading product with the potential to disrupt the asset finance market by resolving issues such as long onboarding times, links to customers' accounting software packages to provide 'always on' lending and use of an invisible trust account to resolve customer pain points.\n\n## Emerging threats and opportunities\n\nTIC considered the potential threats and opportunities presented by big technology companies, including innovation from China-based technology companies. The Committee noted the collaborative approach taken by management to deepen relationships beyond supplier relationships into partnership working to solve customer needs.\n\nThe Committee discussed the evolution of digital currencies, exploration of central bank digital currencies and growth of tokenised assets and the potential threats and opportunities presented. It was agreed that this would continue to be monitored.\n\n## Membership and meetings\n\nThe Committee is comprised of three non-executive director members, Frank Dangeard, Patrick Flynn, and me. More details of membership and attendance at meetings can be found on page 103 of the Corporate governance report.\n\nThe Committee is supported by management and the Group CEO, Group CFO, Chief Administration Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Director of Innovation, Director of Strategy & Corporate Development and Chief Technology Officer are all standing attendees.\n\nExternal insights were also provided through the updates provided by management.\n\nThe Committee held four scheduled meetings during 2021.\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\nThe annual review of the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees, including TIC, was facilitated by Independent Board Evaluation, a specialist board evaluation consultancy. Throughout the year the Committee acted in accordance with its terms of reference and, overall, the review concluded that the Committee operated effectively, and had responded to prior feedback regarding focus on a smaller number of spotlight items.\n\nThe review suggested that, given the importance of technology and innovation, the Committee could arrange its work in a way that would be more accessible to all Board members. As a result, it was agreed that appropriate agenda topics would be opened to all Board Directors in future and that consideration would be given to reducing the number of Committee meetings held taking into account the sessions opened up to the full Board in future years.\n\nThe outcomes of the evaluation have been reported to the Board and the Committee will track progress during 2022.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI am delighted to chair this Committee as it continues to support the Board in an area core to NatWest Group's purpose to champion potential, helping people, families, and businesses to thrive.\n\nTogether with my fellow directors, we will retain our focus on monitoring the future technology and innovation landscape and its impact on NatWest Group in order to ensure continued resilience and help NatWest Group become a relationship bank in a digital world. The Committee will continue to shape opportunities arising from management's response to both threats and opportunities that align with NatWest Group's purpose.\n\nI want to take the opportunity to thank the Committee members and attendees for their continued commitment during 2021.\n\n## Yasmin Jetha\n\nChairman of the Technology and Innovation Committee 17 February 2022",

        "page_content": "## Directors' remuneration report\n\n## Contents\n\n136 Chairman's introduction\n\n- 140 Remuneration at a glance\n- 143 The Directors' Remuneration Policy and wider workforce remuneration\n- 158 The Annual remuneration report\n- 175 Other remuneration disclosures\n\nLetter from Robert Gillespie, Chairman of the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee\n\n## Dear Shareholder,\n\nOn behalf of the Board I am pleased to set out the Directors' remuneration report for 2021. There continues to be heightened public interest in pay, as the wider economy and society attempts to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic conditions have improved, which has led to an increasingly competitive external market for key talent and skills. Many companies are having to manage higher than usual attrition rates. Furthermore, the level of inflation in the UK economy has increased significantly, as have forecasts of its level in the coming year, which has given rise to heightened expectations of general salary increases. For many individuals, the experience of working from home has led to significant changes in how working environments are now perceived. As a result, we have had many important matters to consider during the year.\n\nAs part of this report, we have set out proposals for a new Directors' Remuneration Policy (the Policy). Subject to approval from shareholders, this will apply from the 2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM), with the first awards being granted under the new Policy in March 2023. This letter explains why we are seeking approval for this new policy which is significantly different from the existing policy which has been in force since 2017. The report also details the remuneration decisions we made under the existing Policy for 2021.\n\n## Summary of the year\n\nNatWest Group has delivered a strong operating performance in 2021, returning to profitability with an attributable profit of \u00a32,950 million. NatWest Group's share price also saw a sharp\n\nrecovery throughout the year, increasing around 35% and outperforming our UK peers. Our capital distribution plan has helped return \u00a33.8 billion to shareholders through buybacks, both directed and on-market, and dividends. Our strong capital position and continued capital generation mean that NatWest Group is well placed to invest for growth, to provide the support our customers need as the economy recovers and to drive sustainable returns to shareholders.\n\nWe have also been acutely aware in our deliberations that during 2021 the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) imposed a fine of \u00a3265 million on NatWest Bank Plc for breaches of the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 over five years ago. My report explains how we have taken this matter into account in our pay decisions.\n\n## Wider workforce remuneration\n\nThe Committee has a very keen interest in wider workforce remuneration. Our colleagues enable us to achieve our purpose of helping people, families and businesses to thrive. It is therefore vital they are paid fairly and in ways that support our values and culture.\n\nI met with the Colleague Advisory Panel (CAP) during the year and we had a good discussion on our approach to executive and wider workforce remuneration. We know how important it is to have fair and transparent pay structures for all. One of the suggestions from the CAP was to explore how our Fair Pay Charter could receive a higher profile within the bank which the Committee is taking forward. I also explained certain challenges we have been facing with the current Policy for executive directors, as described later in my letter. Further details regarding my engagement with the CAP is set out on page 154.\n\nOver the year we have seen demand rise rapidly for certain skill sets. This has put pressure on retaining talent within NatWest Group. With the decisions we make as a Committee, we seek to recognise these demands while meeting our commitment to pay colleagues fairly, in line with our Fair Pay Charter.\n\nI am pleased that the lowest level of pay for UK-based colleagues at NatWest Group has exceeded the Living Wage foundation benchmarks in the UK for several years. We take a similar approach across our major hubs outside the UK. The fixed pay investment we have made over the last few years has typically been higher than the rate of inflation for that period. This investment has been targeted primarily towards our most junior and lowest paid colleagues, areas where specialist skills are required leading to high attrition rates and those lowest in their salary ranges.\n\nI know from speaking to colleagues that they are concerned by the economic conditions especially in our main hub in the UK. Our 2022 pay discussions with our recognised trade unions are still ongoing, but we believe the proposed salary increases, which would provide an expected 3.6% on average across the wider global workforce from April 2022, demonstrate a materially improved pay position with fair outcomes for our colleagues. For the most junior colleagues in the UK, the minimum proposed salary increase would be \u00a3600 and the majority of them would be in line to receive at least 4%.\n\nWe have agreed a bonus pool of \u00a3298 million in respect of 2021 for those colleagues who are eligible to receive a bonus award. This is 44% higher than the 2020 bonus pool, which was significantly reduced to reflect the impact of COVID-19. It is also 3% lower than the 2019 bonus pool, which was agreed prior to COVID-19. We have followed a consistent process for determining the bonus pool since 2014. When determining the pool, we considered a balanced scorecard of strategically important measures, including financial performance, customer outcomes, colleague experience and risk performance. In 2021, we included a new measure of progress against our climate ambitions.\n\nA material downward adjustment was applied to the 2021 bonus pool to reflect the fine imposed on NatWest Bank Plc for breaches of the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 and ongoing financial crime remediation considerations. This adjustment was apportioned across all business areas to reflect the impact on the bank's financial performance and to reinforce to colleagues the need to ensure the effective management of financial crime. Whilst progress has been made in recent years on NatWest Group's management of financial crime, an all-colleague financial crime performance goal has been introduced in 2022 so that it continues to receive the appropriate focus. We have also initiated an accountability review into the events that led to the breaches of the Money Laundering Regulations 2007. The possible need for individual pay adjustments to prior year awards, using the malus and clawback provisions in the NatWest Group remuneration construct, will be considered as part of the accountability process.\n\n## Revised remuneration policy for executive directors\n\nThe current Policy was introduced in 2017 and renewed in 2020. The Committee believes it has worked well in supporting our culture of prudent risk taking, by introducing a significantly restrained variable pay position for executive directors in return for more consistent pay outcomes during a time of significant transition for the organisation.\n\nThe Committee has been mindful that the current Policy is not aligned to standard market practice and that some of its unique features have been subject to challenge. Over the last year, we have listened carefully to shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nWe have also been mindful that the bank is nearing the end of its long process of normalisation and the Government continues to sell its shareholding which will result in a normalised shareholder base. Finally, we have found the operation of the pre-vest test more difficult than expected. We have concluded in the light of all these factors that substantial change to our existing Policy is required and that now is the appropriate time for NatWest Group to transition to a more market-standard remuneration model rather than waiting until the next triennial vote on the Policy in 2023.\n\nUnder regulatory requirements, which have been in force for a number of years, regulated banks may only offer variable pay equal to 100% of fixed pay, unless shareholder approval is obtained to increase the ratio to 200% of fixed pay. NatWest Group did not seek shareholder approval and has operated on a 1:1 structure. The Board is not seeking to change this position as it believes the current construct supports our belief\n\nin prudent risk taking and the maintenance of restrained compensation levels. We do, however, believe that executives should be incentivised using a structure that balances both short-term and longer-term performance, while maintaining our focus on prudent risk management. We are, therefore, proposing that our current long-term incentive (LTI) construct is replaced by a more widely accepted and competitive construct based around annual bonus plus Restricted Share Plan (RSP) awards.\n\nIn total, the changes set out in this report would result in expected total compensation increasing by 19% for the CEO and by 13% for the CFO, once the transition period is complete. This would bring both executive directors closer to, but still below, the average expected total compensation paid by the other major UK banks.\n\nWe recognise that the move to a more normal construct which involves an increase to total compensation represents a material change and intend to make the transition to the new Policy over two years. The phasing will mean that no more than half of the increase will apply in year one.\n\nThe Committee is highly aware that any increase in compensation will be closely scrutinised by shareholders. It is, therefore, important for us to be clear on why we believe the combination of annual bonus plus RSP represents the best cultural and strategic fit for our organisation and why the proposed opportunities under each element are appropriate. By introducing a market-aligned annual bonus mechanism we will increase the performance alignment within the package to annual performance based on formulaic and weighted measures and targets. This will provide greater transparency on performance outcomes and a more direct link between pay and the delivery of our strategic targets. The market-aligned RSP will also ensure that we continue to retain a level of balance within the package between annual performance and longer-term alignment with the shareholder experience.\n\nDelivering a remuneration package which is sufficiently competitive both in structure and quantum to attract and retain our senior team has been a significant consideration in determining the proposed new arrangements. You can find detailed information about the new Policy on pages 140 to 152 below.\n\nThe Committee has consulted widely with shareholders and the final form of the proposals being put forward for shareholder approval reflects much of the feedback we have received. In my discussions with some of our major shareholders, it has become clear that the current management team is highly regarded and that it would be imprudent to ignore this when setting an appropriate pay scale. Further details of the consultation findings are set out in this report.\n\nThe Board believes that these proposals are in the company's best interests as they move our remuneration policy into line with market norms and provide a more competitive package to our executive directors, which is a very important factor in attracting and retaining highly talented colleagues. The Board, therefore, recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the new Policy.",

        "page_content": "## Executive director pay for 2021 and salaries for 2022\n\n## Alison Rose\n\nAt the time of the last Policy renewal in 2020, we committed to considering salary increases for Ms Rose during the life of the Policy. No increases have been made since her appointment in 2019. In December 2021, we noted the proposed average salary increase for the wider global workforce and agreed that a reduced rate of increase would be appropriate for the executive directors. As a result, Ms Rose's salary will increase by 2% under the existing Policy from 1 April 2022.\n\nIn considering performance against the LTI targets for 2021, we agreed that Ms Rose's performance has been highly impressive. Finance and climate performance was strong with targets achieved and despite a marginal 'miss' on the 'building capability' target, our people scores were good. Targets for supporting enterprise were also met and customer performance had improved in most areas. In terms of risk performance, while there had been some progress, it was noted that there was more work to do on the control environment.\n\nExternal assessments of Ms Rose's performance were also very favourable, especially in relation to leadership on COVID-19 schemes and COP26. Board members welcomed Ms Rose's frankness and transparency during the year.\n\nOur overall assessment of Ms Rose's performance for 2021 led the Committee to agree that an LTI award of \u00a31,598,000 would be an appropriate outcome, which represents 145% of salary and 83% of the maximum LTI award. In order to ensure parity of treatment with the wider workforce, the LTI outcome reflected an adjustment to mirror the downward adjustment to the 2021 bonus pool for the fine imposed on NatWest Bank Plc for breaches of the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 and ongoing financial crime remediation considerations. Ms Rose's LTI award will be granted in March 2022.\n\n## Katie Murray\n\nMs Murray's salary has remained unchanged since her appointment to the Board in January 2019 and the Committee agreed that an increase of 2% would be appropriate. The increase will take effect from 1 April 2022.\n\nIn considering an LTI award for 2021, we agreed that Ms Murray had also performed well during the year. Along with the achievements noted against LTI targets for Ms Rose, Ms Murray had successfully delivered the quarterly results, with proactive investor engagement and made good progress on refreshing the annual reporting process. Cost reduction targets were also met for Finance and NatWest Group.\n\nOur overall assessment of performance for 2021 led the Committee to agree that an LTI award of \u00a31,057,500 would be an appropriate outcome, which represents 141% of salary and 71% of the maximum LTI award. In line with the approach taken for Ms Rose, the LTI outcome reflected an adjustment to mirror the downward adjustment to the 2021 bonus pool for the fine imposed on NatWest Bank Plc for breaches of the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 and ongoing financial crime remediation. Ms Murray's LTI award will be granted in March 2022.\n\n## 2019 LTI award vesting outcome\n\nFollowing an assessment of her performance in 2018, Ms Rose received an LTI award over 2019, while CEO of Commercial & Private Banking. Ms Murray was on a different remuneration construct for the 2018 performance year and did not receive an LTI award in 2019.\n\nThe Committee carried out a pre-vest assessment at the end of 2021 for awards granted in 2019 which vest in 2022. This involved considering whether anything had come to light since grant that would change our original view of performance of the beneficiaries of the award during the 2018 financial year.\n\nWe used a structured set of questions and evidence factors to guide discussions. From the analysis, we agreed that customer and risk were areas that merited further consideration. Supported by external opinion, we concluded that although customer performance had declined in one business area, it was not due to factors within management's reasonable control. Therefore, no adjustment was made relating to customer.\n\nOn risk performance, the pre-vest test confirmed there had been no material deterioration in risk culture or profile over the relevant period. However, management performance relating to financial crime remediation over the 2018 performance year was considered to be an area that merited further investigation using the Risk & Control underpin.\n\nThe Group Board Risk Committee (BRC) concluded that, while management had taken significant action to drive delivery of the financial crime remediation programme, there had not been a full appreciation of scale, complexity and interdependencies of the programme at the time of the 2019 LTI grant, resulting in delays to the proposed return to appetite.\n\nThe BRC recommended that an adjustment be considered and as a result we applied a pre-vest reduction of 5% of Ms Rose's original maximum 2019 LTI award resulting in a reduction of 32,234 shares vesting. A pre-vest reduction of 5% of the original maximum was also made to the 2019 LTI award held by the former CEO, Ross McEwan.\n\nThe total adjustments made to their respective maximum 2019 LTI award levels, when combined with adjustments made pre-grant, amounted to 17% for Ms Rose and 11% for Mr McEwan. You can find full details of the pre-vest assessment for both Ms Rose and Mr McEwan on page 159 to 160.\n\n## 2019 LTI award to Alison Rose\n\n|        | Maximum   | Granted   | Shares to vest   |\n|--------|-----------|-----------|------------------|\n| Shares | 644,672   | 568,829   | 536,595          |\n| Value  | \u00a31.7m     | \u00a31.5m     | \u00a31.197m          |\n\nThe \u00a31.197 million value reflects an aggregate reduction of 17% of the maximum LTI award level for Ms Rose across pre-grant and pre-vest stages. It also reflects the fall in the share price over the performance period.\n\nWhile the performance cycle has completed, the shares from this award will vest in tranches up to 2026. Malus and clawback provisions help ensure that recipients maintain a long-term focus in their decision-making and aligns with regulatory expectations.\n\n## Approach to windfall gains\n\nIn my report last year, I highlighted that windfall gains had become a focal point for shareholders due to share price volatility as a result of the pandemic. When the LTI grants were made in 2021, the share price had risen over the prior year resulting in fewer shares being granted to satisfy a given quantum of award. We, therefore, did not consider there were any obvious potential windfall gains implications for award levels that should be addressed at the time of grant. We continue to believe that vesting, rather than at grant, is the best time to consider any adjustments for windfall gains.\n\nTo guide our judgment, we continue to operate a framework designed to assess whether windfall gains have arisen over the period from grant to vest and the factors to be considered in making any adjustments.\n\n## Gender and ethnicity pay reporting\n\nThe Committee considers gender and ethnicity pay gap metrics to be another important indicator and full details can be found in the Strategic report and at natwestgroup.com. This is the fourth year that we have published ethnicity pay gap information on a voluntary basis. We are confident that colleagues are paid fairly and policies and processes are kept under review to make sure this continues to be the case.\n\n## Climate in remuneration\n\nFrom 2020, we have included a climate goal and related measures in our executive director performance goals. Climate will continue to be an integral part of the annual bonus scorecard to be introduced under the new Policy proposals.\n\nAs mentioned above, the bonus pool agreed for the wider workforce was also determined for 2021 having regard to performance against strategically important measures, including our climate ambition. This ensures that the work of colleagues in supporting the transition to a low carbon economy is being reflected in pay decisions.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nThe Committee understands the expectations of shareholders, colleagues and wider society relating to the oversight of remuneration continue to evolve. It is also very aware that the bank's commitment to purpose, to equality of opportunity and to fighting climate change must be fully reflected in compensation outcomes for its employees in general and its leaders in particular. I have referred to all these matters throughout this letter and the Committee will continue to focus on these and other emerging issues in the coming year.\n\nThe Committee is focused on ensuring the smooth transition to the new Policy, assuming it is approved by shareholders at the 2022 AGM. Set out later in this document is the annual bonus scorecard expected to be used in respect of 2022. We would expect the bonus scorecard to continue to evolve to ensure that it is incentivising progress against NatWest Group's purpose-led targets and wider societal needs.\n\nWe have committed to publish our climate transition plan which will support alignment with the Paris Agreement. Future climate targets will in turn evidence progress towards longerterm climate objectives. We will also continue to engage with colleagues to explain the alignment of our approaches to executive and wider workforce remuneration and to listen to their feedback.\n\nThis is my last report as the Chairman of the Committee as I will have completed nine years as a director of NatWest Group later this year. It has been a great privilege to perform the role of Chairman of the Committee for the last five years. I believe it is imperative for NatWest Group to be able to motivate and retain colleagues of great ability at every level in the firm and therefore to be able to evidence the link between its remuneration policies, culture and purpose. I strongly believe that the proposed changes to the Policy are an important step in the evolution of NatWest Group to being a purpose led organisation and hope shareholders will vote for its approval at the forthcoming AGM.\n\n## Robert Gillespie\n\nChairman of the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee\n\n17 February 2022",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration at a glance\n\nDelivering a restrained but competitive level of pay for executive directors which is aligned with our cultural values\n\n## What is driving the move to a new Policy?\n\nUnder the current Policy we deliver variable pay through a single long-term incentive arrangement, which operates in a different way to those more commonly seen in the market, particularly in the case of the main UK banks. The LTI-only construct operates within a 1:1 variable to fixed pay ratio with executive directors receiving a significantly restrained but more predicable level of pay, thereby encouraging safe and secure growth within appetite.\n\nHowever, it has become apparent through our stakeholder engagement process that certain shareholders continue to have reservations with regard to the current Policy and its unique features, in particular, the lack of formulaic, weighted performance measures, and the removal of pro-rating. The Committee has given considerable thought to how it should address such feedback and, conscious that we are continuing on a trajectory towards private ownership, believe now would be an appropriate time to introduce a more market-aligned annual bonus and RSP construct for executive directors.\n\n## Why are we increasing total compensation?\n\nThe Committee has also been mindful that while we have successfully recruited highly talented executive directors under the current Policy, our compensation levels are falling too far behind our nearest competitors. The Board is very pleased with the performance of the executive directors since appointment. We believe that continuing an approach that is materially behind our peers is imprudent and that a move towards a more flexible remuneration structure, which delivers more competitive levels of pay, is justified and in the best interests of the business.\n\nThe new Policy will result in an increase to total compensation for executive directors, with maximum variable pay set at 100% of base salary for annual bonus and 150% of base salary for RSP awards. While this enables us to deliver more competitive levels of pay, maximum compensation levels for the CEO would still be the lowest compared with other major UK banks and significantly lower than peers who continue to operate traditional long-term incentive plan (LTIP) constructs, demonstrating continued restraint on executive pay. The increase in variable pay levels should also be viewed in the context of us making further changes to the Policy which will introduce less favourable leaver treatment, increased shareholding requirements and longer holding periods for the fixed share allowance.\n\nWe recognise moving to a more normal construct represents a material change and intend to make the transition in two phases. For the first year, maximum awards will be limited to 85% of base salary for annual bonus and 125% of salary for the RSP. The charts opposite illustrate the transition for the CEO from our current Policy and also show that compensation levels will move closer to, but still below, the average maximum and target compensation levels at the other major UK banks. The CFO will also be below the average maximum and target compensation levels at the other major UK banks.\n\nNatWest Group CEO maximum variable pay % of salary (\u00a3000 total compensation (TC) maximum)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMajor UK banks average\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## NatWest Group CEO target variable pay % of salary (\u00a3000 total compensation (TC) target)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMajor UK banks average\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How does the new Policy ensure continued shareholder alignment?\n\nWith the adoption of the RSP, we will replace our current leaver terms with market aligned best practice leaver terms, with pro-rating reintroduced in good-leaver scenarios for RSP awards. Shareholding requirements will be increased from 400% to 500% of salary for the CEO and from 250% to 300% of salary for the CFO and the fixed share allowance release period will be extended from three to five years.\n\nAs is the case under the current Policy, around 67% of expected remuneration would continue to be delivered under the new Policy in shares, which will be subject to deferral and retention requirements. Along with the proposed increase in shareholding requirements, this will continue to ensure close symmetry between executives, shareholders and the financial health of the business.\n\n125%\n\n85%\n\n125%\n\n85%\n\nWith bonus expected to vest at 50% of maximum opportunity, the combination of the RSP and bonus means that we are still guiding towards an expected vesting level of 80% for variable remuneration outcomes. This is aligned with the position under our current LTI-only construct which is expected to vest at 80% of maximum opportunity. However, in the case of the new Policy, the expected vesting level of 80% depends on executive directors achieving on-target performance across the annual bonus scorecard.\n\n## How does the RSP operate in practice and does it satisfy shareholder guidelines?\n\nThe Committee will be required to assess the performance of executives under the RSP construct, both at the pre-grant and pre-vest stage. The pre-grant test will measure whether executives have achieved satisfactory performance over the performance period prior to grant, using the existing performance management processes that apply to all colleagues across the bank.\n\nRSP awards will also be subject to an underpin assessment at pre-vest stage. The underpin assessment is designed to ensure that sustainable performance has been achieved over the course of the vesting period.\n\nWhile RSP awards are expected to be granted and vest at 100% of maximum opportunity, the combination of the RSP pre-grant and pre-vest tests enable the Committee to make downward adjustments, potentially to zero, in order to guard against payments for failure.\n\nWe know that shareholder guidelines normally expect an appropriate discount, of at least 50%, to be applied when introducing RSP awards compared to a traditional LTIP with performance conditions. As our current Policy differs in a number of ways to traditional practice and has already delivered a more restrained pay position, with significantly reduced maximum total compensation levels, it would not be appropriate to apply the 50% discount to our current LTI construct.\n\nRecognising that the principle of a 50% discount to an LTIP equivalent construct remains important to stakeholders, the Committee is satisfied that the proposed move to the RSP is aligned with the spirit of the guidelines as it delivers more than a 50% reduction when the RSP construct is compared with more traditional LTIP constructs envisaged by the guidance. This is illustrated further in the chart opposite.\n\n## Engagement with stakeholders on remuneration\n\nEvery year we undertake an engagement programme with major shareholders and other stakeholders before the Committee makes final decisions on pay awards. In late 2021 and early 2022, we met with several institutional shareholders, UK Government Investments, proxy advisors and the UK regulators to discuss our approach to remuneration for the 2021 performance year and our proposed policy amendments for executive directors.\n\n## NatWest Group CEO variable pay % of salary (\u00a3000 total compensation maximum)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBonus\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOne of the principal areas of focus during meetings was the transition to the new Policy including the new variable pay structure with annual bonus and RSP awards. The Committee Chairman explained that NatWest Group remained committed to prudent yet competitive compensation levels that would assess long-term performance and ensure alignment with shareholder interests. Discussions also highlighted that under the new Policy shareholders would expect continued adherence to best practice and transparent remuneration disclosures. The Committee acknowledged the need to ensure the ongoing alignment of all aspects of the new Policy with market best practice. A summary of the new Policy and how it compares to the current Policy can be found on the next page, followed by the main Policy tables which set out further details.\n\nIn addition to the above discussions, we also held three virtual shareholder events with retail shareholders in 2021 to ensure we heard from the wider shareholder base on matters of importance. The event held in November 2021 focused on climate and one of our shareholders asked how we link executive pay to ESG measures including climate. Yasmin Jetha, one of our directors who was present at the event, confirmed that climate measures had been introduced for executive directors in 2020 which assessed performance with reference to progress towards climate positive operations, the funding and financing of climate and sustainable finance, and the setting of sector specific targets for emissions reduction. Ms Jetha's response also noted that executive director performance had, for several years, also been assessed with reference to social and governance measures, with diversity and inclusion targets having been in place since 2017. Further shareholder events are planned for 2022. Shareholders play a vital role in helping us develop remuneration practices that meet the needs of all our stakeholders and we are grateful for their involvement in the process.\n\nIt is also now more important than ever that we listen to our colleagues and use the insight we gain to attract, engage and retain the talent we need for the future. In November 2021, the Committee Chairman met with our Colleague Advisory Panel to discuss executive and wider workforce pay. The outcome of such discussion is summarised in more detail in the 'colleague listening strategy' section later in this report.",

When  recruiting new directors, our Policy aims to be competitive and to structure pay in line with the  framework applicable to current directors (as stated in the tables above), while recognising that  some adjustment to quantum may be necessary to secure the preferred candidate. The pension allowance for new executive directors will be in line with that of the wider UK workforce.  We can continue to honour existing commitments in the event of an internal promotion. A buy-out  policy exists to replace awards forfeited or payments foregone, which is in line with regulatory  requirements. The Committee will minimise buy-outs wherever possible and ensure they are no  more generous than, and on substantially similar terms to, the original awards or payments they  are replacing. No sign-on awards will be offered on joining. Any awards granted following recruitment may be made under such NatWest Group employee  share plans as are in place from time to time or otherwise in accordance with the relevant provisions  in the Listing Rules.

The Committee  will ensure that any proposals relating to termination payments are fair and reasonable and  recognise that failure is not rewarded. There are no pre-determined provisions for compensation on  termination, other than when we determine that a redundancy payment is properly due under our  redundancy policy in place from time to time. There is discretion for NatWest Group to make a  payment in lieu of notice (based on salary only) which is released in monthly instalments. The  executive director must take all reasonable steps to find alternative work and any remaining  instalments will be reduced as appropriate to offset income from any such work. Chairman and non-executive directors Instead of service contracts, the Chairman and the non-executive directors have letters of  appointment that reflect their responsibilities and time commitments. There are no notice periods  and we will pay no compensation in the event of termination, other than standard payments for the  period served up to the termination date. Under the Board Appointment Policy, non-executive directors are appointed for an initial term of  three years, subject to annual re-election by shareholders. At the end of this initial term, a further  three-year term may be agreed. Non-executive directors may be invited to serve beyond six years,  up to a maximum tenure of nine years. The Chairman is not subject to the Board Appointment Policy  but is subject to the Code's requirements relating to the maximum tenure period for chairs.

        "page_content": "## Provisions\n\n## Operation\n\nTreatment of outstanding share plan awards on termination\n\n## Contractual provisions\n\nOn termination, we will treat awards in accordance with the relevant plan rules or other terms on which they were granted. Individuals will only qualify for good leaver treatment if they leave due to ill-health, injury, disability, death, retirement (as agreed with NatWest Group), redundancy, the employing company ceasing to be a member of NatWest Group, transfer of the employing business, or any other reason if, and to the extent, the Committee decides in any case. Malus and clawback provisions will continue to apply to all leavers, and could be used to adjust awards if subsequent issues relating to executive directors' performance come to light. In the event of a change of control, outstanding awards will be treated in line with the provisions of the relevant plan rules, as approved by shareholders.\n\n## Fixed share allowances\n\nShares will continue to be released over the applicable retention period helping to ensure that former executive directors maintain an appropriate interest in shares. In all leaver circumstances, executive directors will continue to be eligible to receive a pro-rated fixed share allowance to reflect the period up to the termination date.\n\n## LTI awards (under the existing Policy)\n\nLTI awards normally lapse on leaving unless the termination is for one of the specified good leaver reasons. LTI awards held by good leavers will normally vest on the original vesting dates, subject to the performance conditions being met and the rules of the relevant plan. No pro-rating applies after grant for LTI awards granted from 2018 onwards.\n\nThe existing Policy allows good leaver retirement to be granted provided the individual is not leaving to work in a capacity considered to be competing directly and materially with NatWest Group. The new Policy introduces a more typical and less favourable definition of retirement that will not allow good leaver retirement treatment where individuals take up a commensurate role elsewhere or a role with a company providing banking services. The new Policy will also address the concerns from some shareholders by introducing pro-rating for RSP awards in good leaver circumstances.\n\n## Annual bonus awards (for performance year 2022 and later years)\n\nAny deferred bonus awards that are unvested will normally lapse on leaving unless good leaver circumstances apply, in which case the awards will normally continue to vest on the original vesting dates. Provided that individuals leave in good-leaver circumstances, they will be eligible to be considered for an annual bonus award for their final year of employment.\n\n## RSP awards (for performance year 2022 and later years)\n\nRSP awards that are unvested will normally lapse on leaving unless specified good-leaver circumstances apply. For good leavers, awards are pro-rated for time served during the three-year performance period and will normally continue to vest on the original vesting dates. Individuals will not be eligible to be considered for an RSP award for the final year of employment.\n\nContracts include standard clauses covering remuneration arrangements and discretionary incentive plans (as set out in this report). The contracts also reference: reimbursement of reasonable out-ofpocket expenses; annual leave; redundancy terms and sickness absence; the performance review process; directors' and officers' insurance; the disciplinary procedure; and terms for dismissal in the event of personal underperformance or breaches of NatWest Group's policies.\n\nThe Committee retains the discretion to make payments (including but not limited to professional and outplacement fees) to: facilitate smooth handovers; mitigate against legal claims; and/or procure reasonable assistance with investigations or claims, subject to any payments being made pursuant to a settlement or release agreement.\n\n## Summary of proposed changes for executive directors\n\nUnder the new Policy, LTI awards will be replaced with annual bonuses and RSP awards. This will provide a more market-aligned and competitive remuneration package for executive directors, while incentivising growth and the delivery of our purpose-led strategy. It will also align more closely to shareholder expectations, with pro-rating applying to RSP awards in good leaver circumstances and annual bonus outcomes being determined with reference to weighted performance measures and robust strategic targets. RSP awards will contribute to nearly 67% of expected pay being delivered in shares, further supporting the delivery of sustainable long-term performance. The fixed share allowance retention period will also be extended from three to five years, further aligning remuneration to the long term. The pay levels under the Policy were decided after considering relevant market positioning for similar roles at comparable financial services companies. They remain relatively modest compared to other major UK bank peers. We selected performance measures for annual bonus and RSP awards to reflect a cross section of our main strategic deliverables. There will be greater transparency on the link between performance and pay outcomes through weighted annual bonus measures with non-financial targets being set to reflect our purpose-led strategy.\n\n## Other changes under the new Policy for executive directors\n\n| Performance conditions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Leaver terms                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Shareholding requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| While LTI awards under the existing Policy  are based on assessing performance in  the round, we will base bonus awards  under the new Policy on a weighted  scorecard of annual measures and targets  aligned with our strategic priorities.

To recognise working practices have changed, and also to discourage unnecessary travel, the Board has moved to a hybrid model whereby meetings take place both in person and remotely. The change under the Policy will allow the Chairman and non-executive directors to receive assistance when they are attending Board meetings from another location, including meeting any costs that are considered reasonable and appropriate. Arrangements will be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe Committee retains discretion to make minor amendments to the Directors' Remuneration Policy that reflect changing legal or regulatory requirements or guidelines. We will not make any material changes to the advantage of directors without first reverting to shareholders for approval.",

The maximum annual bonus award will be limited to 85% of base salary in year one rising to 100% of base salary in year two. The maximum RSP award will be limited to 125% of base salary in year one rising to 150% of base salary in year two.\n- (3)  The expected value assumes annual bonus payments will be made at 50% of maximum opportunity and RSP awards will vest at 100% of maximum.\n- (4)  Maximum 1 in the charts assumes both annual bonus and RSP awards are paid and vest in full, at 100% of maximum. Maximum 2 extends this to show the impact of a 50% increase in the share price for RSP awards over the period from grant to vest. The benefits figure includes standard benefit funding as outlined in the Policy but excludes any potential other benefits under the Policy such as travel assistance in connection with company business. We will disclose the value of any taxable business expenses in the total remuneration table each year.\n\n## Aligning executive pay with ESG performance and our purpose-led strategy\n\nIn addition to considering financial measures, the process to determine variable pay for executive directors under the new Policy will continue to reflect progress against our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) priorities. The combined bonus scorecard for 2022 and the assessment of satisfactory performance under the RSP will align with the five principles of a purpose-led business, as set out in the Blueprint for Better Business (BfBB) framework. The five principles form part of our purpose framework and you can find more details of this on page 13 of the Strategic report.\n\n## Five principles of a purpose-led business\n\n| A guardian for  future generations                                                                                                                       | Honest and fair  with customers  and suppliers                                                                                                                                  | A good citizen                                                                                          | A responsible  and responsive  employer                                                                                                                          | Has a purpose which  delivers long-term  sustainable  performance                                                                      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Tackling climate  change is core to  our purpose.

This helps us improve by assessing colleague (1) sentiment and our progress in creating a great place to work.\n\n## Regular engagement\n\n## Colleague Advisory Panel (CAP)\n\n- -Twice a year, a colleague opinion survey (Our View) allows people to have a say on what it feels like to work at NatWest Group.\n- -Just over 46,700 (81%) of our colleagues participated in the latest survey and there is regular engagement throughout the year.\n- -Question and answer sessions take place with senior executives throughout the year.\n- -Feedback from colleagues forms part of the People and Culture measures that impact executive pay.\n- -Engagement on remuneration also takes place with representatives from Unite in Great Britain and Offshore and the Financial Services Union in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe CAP was established in 2018 to help us promote colleague voice in the boardroom. The CAP is chaired by Lena Wilson, one of our non-executive directors, and allows colleagues to engage directly with senior management and the Board on topics that are important to them. It includes colleagues who volunteered to be involved, representatives from trade union bodies and works councils, the colleague-led networks and junior management teams.\n\nAfter each meeting, the Board receives a summary and a follow-up call is then held with the CAP so that CAP members can hear how their views were shared and what happened as a result. The CAP continues to be highly regarded by those who attend and has proven to be an effective way of establishing two-way dialogue between colleagues and Board members. In November 2021, the Committee Chairman met with the CAP to discuss executive and wider workforce remuneration. There was a focus on fairness, simplicity, transparency and inclusion which runs through all colleague remuneration.\n\nMembers were appreciative of the presentation, saying it was a very clear explanation of NatWest Group's approach to remuneration. They were keen to see how our Fair Pay Charter could receive a higher profile and also discussed NatWest Group's approach to salary increases and the impact of the rising cost of living. The Committee Chairman explained that the combination of inflation and higher living costs was something employers had not faced for some time. The COVID-19 pandemic had also had a significant impact across society. Economic factors alongside the external pay market and longer-term business affordability would all need to be taken in to account when deciding our investment in fixed pay.\n\nClimate was the overall theme of the November meeting and the Committee Chairman referred to this in his presentation. He highlighted that executive directors had specific performance goals and measures linked to climate cost, our climate footprint and colleague feedback, all of which was considered when deciding their pay awards. New ways of working were also discussed, and the Group Chief People and Transformation Officer highlighted that focus groups were being run to understand the cost impact of working from home.\n\nA number of actions were agreed at the meeting for further consideration and the Chair of the CAP provided the Board with an update on the feedback received from colleagues.\n\n- (1)  Colleagues means all employees and, in some instances, other members of the wider workforce (including contractors and agency workers).\n\n## Our View survey\n\nThe Our View colleague opinion survey compares responses from colleagues at NatWest Group against those from other companies, known as the Global Financial Services Norm (GFSN). In general, the scores from the Reward category in Our View have declined over the last year although they remain above the GFSN in all but one category. The reduction in scores was anticipated as the impact of the global pandemic on our financial performance meant investment in fixed pay was constrained last year and our bonus pool was reduced. Some colleagues also felt they had limited opportunity over the last year to use some of the benefits they had purchased under our benefit scheme.\n\n|                                                                |   2021 favourable  score | Versus   2020   |   Versus   GFSN |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Total Reward (1)                                               |                       76 | -4              |              +4 |\n| Colleagues who think they are paid fairly for the work they do |                       67 | -6              |              +4 |\n| Understand how their pay is determined                         |                       87 | -2              |             +13 |\n| Understand how their bonus is determined                       |                       72 | -5              |              -5 |\n| Believe NatWest Group's benefit programme fits their needs     |                       80 | -1              |              +5 |\n| Manager regularly gives them recognition for work well done    |                       87 | no change       |              +5 |\n\n- (1)  NatWest Group Our View scores for 2021 exclude Ulster Bank RoI.\n\n## Pay gaps and pay ratio disclosures\n\nPay equality, including neutrality in respect of protected characteristics, is a core feature of our approach, to support equal pay for equal work. You can find the latest gender and ethnicity pay gap reporting for NatWest Group together with the steps being taken to address the position in the 'Our Colleagues' section of the Strategic Report and at natwestgroup.com. You can also see the CEO-to-employee pay ratios and further information on remuneration for the wider workforce later in this report.\n\n## Further information on our wider workforce approach.\n\nFair reward is one of the key things we are committed to in order to provide a great place to work for everyone. Our Fair Pay Charter is one of the ways we do this and you can find further information on our approach in our ESG Supplement. The 'Our Colleagues' section of the Strategic Report also sets out how we helping colleagues to thrive and realise their potential, how we support their wellbeing and how we create a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture.\n\n## How we align wider workforce and executive pay\n\nConsistent with our approach to executive pay, our remuneration policy for all colleagues aims to be simple, transparent and to promote the long-term success of NatWest Group. It encourages a culture where individuals are rewarded for sustained performance in line with risk appetite and for demonstrating the right behaviours. These principles apply to everyone with adjustments made where necessary to comply with local requirements. As set out on the previous page, the Committee Chairman met with colleagues through the CAP in November 2021 to discuss how we take a consistent approach to workforce remuneration. He also highlighted some of the challenges being faced with the existing Policy for executive directors. The proposed introduction of annual bonus for executive directors under the new Policy will create closer alignment with the remuneration construct for the wider workforce. A significant proportion of our colleagues are eligible to receive annual bonus awards, subject to performance.",

Ultimately, we 'pay for performance', underpinned by a robust performance management process;\n- 2.  be market facing - we benchmark ourselves against a core peer group and ensure our pay is fair, competitive and affordable; and\n- -A simple and transparent pay policy supports colleagues in doing the right thing.\n- -Our more junior colleagues are typically paid through fixed pay only, which was increased when variable pay was removed.\n- -This provides them with greater security and allows them to fully focus on the needs of the customer.\n- 3.  ensure compliance and governance - our reward design must be within policy, meet the expectations and requirements of our regulators and be appropriately aligned with the expectations of our shareholders and customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPay for executive directors is aligned with the wider workforce, with two main differences:\n\n- i. the use of RSP awards; and\n- ii.  a requirement to maintain a holding of shares in NatWest Group, both during and after employment.\n- These differences are deliberate and recognise that it is in the best interests of our stakeholders for executive directors to have a significant proportion of their remuneration paid in shares and subject to long-term holding requirements.\n\n## Our approach to the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 'Code')\n\nThis table supplements other information in this report by demonstrating some of the ways in which we meet the requirements and spirit of the Code. We continue to monitor and reflect on best practice when developing our remuneration practices. By introducing weighted annual bonus measures, rather than assessing performance in the round, the new Policy for executive directors creates a more direct link between the delivery of our strategy and pay and performance outcomes. We consider both the outcomes and how they have been achieved to encourage and reward behaviours in line with our values. Malus and clawback provisions together with long holding periods reinforce the need for recipients to act in the best interests of our stakeholders.\n\n| Provision                                                                              | Our approach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Review workforce                                                                       | - Every year we consider how pay has been distributed across NatWest Group, analysing performance ratings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| remuneration                                                                           | by grade and diversity categories.

In April 2020, Ms Rose announced she would forgo 25% of her fixed pay for the rest of the year. A reduction of \u00a3426,078 was applied to her fixed share allowance and NatWest Group made a comparable donation to the NET Coronavirus Appeal.\n- (2)  Includes standard benefit funding at \u00a326,250 per annum. In addition, Ms Rose received travel assistance in connection with company business (\u00a325,314) and assistance with home security (\u00a329,703). Ms Murray also received travel assistance (\u00a3990) and home security arrangements (\u00a32,519) for 2021.\n- (3)  The executive directors receive a monthly cash allowance and can choose to participate in the company's defined contribution pension arrangements.\n- (4)  The 2021 value for Ms Rose relates to an LTI award granted in 2019, prior to becoming an executive director. The Committee assessed performance prior to vesting as set out below and on the next page. No discretion was exercised as a result of the share price changing over the performance period. Ms Murray was not eligible for an LTI award in 2019.\n\n## Vesting of 2019 LTI award (audited)\n\nThe table summarises the number of shares due to vest to Ms Rose following the pre-grant and pre-vest performance assessments and the estimated vesting value for the 2019 LTI award, shown in the single total figure of remuneration above.

Before vesting, the Committee carries out a further review to consider whether anything has come to light which might call the original award into question. Internal control functions and PwC, as independent advisers, the Group Board Risk Committee (BRC) and the Group Sustainable Banking Committee (SBC) support the Committee in this assessment, with the outcome set out below.\n\nLooking back to performance for 2018 and 'knowing what we know now', has NatWest Group\n\n## Core questions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhere the answer is 'Yes', three further questions are considered:\n\n- 1.  Is the underperformance due to factors within management's reasonable control in the circumstances?\n- 2.  Can the underperformance be linked back to the performance year to which the award relates, rather than to performance developments since?\n- 3.  Is it appropriate to reflect the underperformance in the current pre-vest test (i.e. if the underperformance has not been adequately reflected in other ways such as subsequent pre-grant tests for awards granted in the interim)?\n\nIf the answer to each of these questions is 'Yes', the Committee may decide that a further adjustment prior to vesting is appropriate, and it has the discretion to decide the amount.\n\n## Further analysis\n\nThe areas of customer and risk were investigated with a specific focus on Financial Crime (FC) remediation.\n\n- -Supported by external opinion, we concluded that while NPS had declined within Ulster Bank ROI over the\n- period, it was not considered to be due to factors which related to the 2018 award year or were within management's reasonable control.\n- -Although on risk there had been no material deterioration in risk culture or profile over the period, it was felt appropriate that the management performance relating to FC remediation should be assessed using the Risk & Control underpin.\n- (1)  FSCB was formerly the Banking Standards Board. NatWest Group will cease to take part in the FSCB survey from 2022. Going forwards the LTI pre vest test culture assessment will be assessed using Our View; NatWest Group's internal colleague opinion survey.\n\nAchievement of 'threshold level of sustainable performance' has been evidenced.\n\nNo adjustment proposed, subject to the underpins below.\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management",

We can use the underpins to consider events arising during the period between grant and the end of year three. Having reviewed the facts relating to management performance with regard to FC remediation, and recognising its significance, BRC agreed it would be appropriate for the Committee to consider an adjustment to 2019 LTI vest levels.\n\n## BRC assessment and recommendation to invoke the Risk & Control underpin\n\nFollowing a detailed investigation by management, the BRC concluded that, while management had taken significant action to drive delivery of the FC remediation programme, there had not been a full appreciation of the scale, complexity and interdependencies of the programme at the time of the 2019 LTI grant which had resulted in technology and programme delays. This had led to target dates being pushed out for critical deliverables to return within risk appetite, with such delays not being fully reflected at grant or in subsequent grants. Following the steps above, the BRC recommended that the Committee consider applying the Risk & Control underpin for the 2019 LTI awards.\n\n## Assessment by the Committee and final outcome (audited)\n\nAfter considering the Risk & Control underpin and the organisational significance of the FC remediation programme alongside the Group's other priorities and performance in 2018, the Committee agreed that the awards of three individuals holding 2019 LTI awards would be adjusted. Ross McEwan was viewed as having supervisory responsibility for the delivery of the FC remediation programme and Alison Rose was considered to have had joint primary responsibility for the delivery of the programme, during 2018. The third individual, who is not currently an executive director and has not held such a role in the past, was also considered to have joint primary responsibility for the programme in 2018. The Committee considered at length the differing level of involvement of and responsibilities held by the three individuals, to ensure that fair and proportionate adjustments were made.\n\nMr McEwan received an LTI award of 625,712 shares out of a maximum of 663,633 shares in 2019 after the application of the pre-grant performance assessment. Under the pre-vest assessment above, a further reduction of 5% of the maximum award was applied using the Risk & Control underpin, resulting in a balance of 592,530 shares. Ms Rose received a 2019 LTI award of 568,829 shares following the pre-grant test, representing a 11.76% reduction from the maximum possible award. The Committee and the Board agreed that a further reduction of 5% of Ms Rose's 2019 LTI maximum award level would be appropriate using the Risk & Control underpin, resulting in a balance of 536,595 shares. Applying a consistent reduction for Mr McEwan and Ms Rose was considered to be appropriate as whilst Mr McEwan was not primarily responsible for the delivery of the programme, he continued to play a significant role as Group CEO and was expected to provide clear line manager direction and oversight given the importance of the FC remediation programme. These pre-vest reductions to the 2019 LTI awards of Mr McEwan and Ms Rose resulted in a total reduction, based on their respective maximum 2019 LTI awards, of 11% for Mr McEwan and 17% for Ms Rose. Further details on Mr McEwan's arrangements can be found in the payments to past directors' section.\n\n## Scheme interests - LTI awards granted during 2021 (audited)\n\n|               | Grant date    | Face value   | Award  price   | Shares  awarded (1)   | Vesting levels                                    | Performance requirements                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|---------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Alison Rose   | -             | -            | - \u00a31.6746      | -                     |                                                   | The award was subject to a pre-grant assessment of  performance over 2020.

We use a robust process to review performance against pre-set goals relevant to NatWest Group's strategic aims for that year, but apply our judgment without a formulaic range for vesting or mechanistic weightings. Risk & Control and Stakeholder Perception underpins also apply, under which we can consider if there are any other factors that would lead to a downwards adjustment. The CFO's performance was assessed in line with the framework set out below and also with reference to the performance of the Finance function.\n\nA further performance assessment will take place in early 2025 before any vesting takes place. This will operate in a similar way to the pre-vest framework in place for the 2019 LTI awards, as described in detail on page 159. It will consider whether anything has come to light that would indicate the assessment below did not represent a correct view of performance at that time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Core strategic  areas                                              | Measures and targets to assess pre-grant  performance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Performance against targets for 2021                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Ratings            |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Scorecard                                                          | Run a safe and secure bank                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | NatWest Group cost savings were \u00a3256 million or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Partially          |\n| Financial &  Business Delivery                                     | Achieve cost reduction target by reducing  other expenses, excluding operating lease  depreciation, by around 4% in comparison                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 4.0% meaning the target has been met.

As part of its 'performance in the round' judgment, the Committee noted that targets had been met or exceeded for five of the areas above, while five were partially met and two were missed, albeit narrowly in both cases. The highlighted priority measures were a key focus for the Committee as it applied its judgment to assess performance for the year.\n\n## Alison Rose (audited)\n\nTurning to individual performance, Ms Rose was considered to have had a strong year. NatWest Group's underlying financial performance was viewed as strong, which had resulted in significant shareholder distributions across 2021. Progress had been made against NatWest Group's Enterprise and Climate goals and NatWest Group's contribution to COP26 was considered to have been strong. People scores remained strong, despite a marginal 'miss' on building capability, and Customer scores were improved in most areas. NatWest Group continued to be behind target on its Risk performance, although progress had been made in some areas. Taking into account performance against the core goals as set out above, the Committee agreed an LTI award level of \u00a31,598,000 would be appropriate, which represents 145% of salary and 83% of the maximum LTI award. In order to ensure parity of treatment with the wider workforce, the LTI outcome reflected an adjustment to mirror the downward adjustment to the 2021 bonus pool for the fine imposed by the FCA on NatWest Bank Plc for breaches of the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 and ongoing FC remediation considerations.",

Ms Murray had shown excellent leadership on the cost and investment agenda and had made progress on the Finance transformation agenda. In light of performance achieved, the Committee agreed that an LTI award of \u00a31,057,500 would be appropriate, which represents 141% of salary and 71% of the maximum award available. In line with the approach taken for Ms Rose, the LTI outcome reflected an adjustment to mirror the downward adjustment to the 2021 bonus pool for the fine imposed on NatWest Bank Plc for breaches of the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 and ongoing FC remediation considerations.\n\n|              | Maximum award   | Reduction  for pre- grant  performance   | LTI award to be  made in 2022   | Award level agreed  by Committee   (% of maximum)   |\n|--------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Alison Rose  | \u00a31,925,000      | \u00a3327,000                                 | \u00a31,598,000                      | 83%                                                 |\n| Katie Murray | \u00a31,500,000      | \u00a3442,500                                 | \u00a31,057,500                      | 71%                                                 |\n\n## Remuneration for the Chairman and non-executive directors\n\nA change was made to the level of fees for the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee, with the Committee Chairman receiving an increase from \u00a360,000 to \u00a368,000 per annum and members receiving an increase from \u00a330,000 to \u00a334,000 per annum with effect from 1 July 2021. Committee fees had not changed since 2014 and the review took place after considering the time commitment against the other NatWest Group Board Committees and market practice. The number of meetings remained consistently high and was not expected to change due to the heavily-regulated nature of remuneration at large banks. The annual engagement with our stakeholders on remuneration also required a significant amount of work, particularly for the Committee Chairman. After reflecting on current and expected future time commitment, it was agreed to bring the rates in line with those currently paid for the BRC and the Group Audit Committee. No directors are involved in decisions regarding their own remuneration.\n\nThe temporary increase in the fees for the Chairman of the CAP, to reflect additional engagement with the workforce due to COVID-19, came to an end on 1 April 2021 with fees reverting from \u00a330,000 to \u00a315,000 per annum.

Ross McEwan stepped down from the Board as CEO in October 2019. Mr McEwan qualified for good leaver treatment meaning his outstanding LTI awards continue to vest on their scheduled vesting dates and pro-rating does not apply. All awards remain subject to a performance assessment prior to vesting and the potential application of malus and clawback provisions.\n\nAs set out earlier in this report, Mr McEwan received an LTI award of 625,712 shares in 2019 which was reduced to 592,530 shares following the application of the pre-vest assessment and Risk and Control underpin. The remaining shares are due to vest between 2022 and 2026, subject to good leaver criteria continuing to be met. The value of the shares is \u00a31,321,342 based on the average share price over October to December 2021. A further disclosure will be made in next year's report following the pre-vest assessment of the final LTI award granted to Mr McEwan in 2020. In addition, Mr McEwan received assistance with his UK tax return for his final year of employment with NatWest Group and a payment was made in relation to taxes incurred as a result of a business trip to California while in employment, with payments totalling \u00a310,700. There are no other payments to past directors to disclose for 2021.\n\n## Implementation of remuneration policy in 2022\n\n## Pay arrangements\n\nBoth executive directors will receive LTI awards in March 2022 in respect of the 2021 performance year. You can find details of these awards on page 164. Under the existing Policy, a salary increase of 2% has been agreed for executive directors from 1 April 2022, which is below the expected average salary increase for the wider global workforce of 3.6%. Subject to the new Policy being approved by shareholders at the 2022 AGM, the revised annual pay arrangements that will apply from the date of the AGM for the 2022 performance year are set out below.\n\n|              | Salary   (1 Jan 2022)   | Salary   (1 April 2022)   | Standard   benefits (1)   | Pension       | Fixed share  allowance (2)   | Maximum bonus  award for 2022 (3)   | Maximum RSP award  for 2022 (4)   |\n|--------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Alison Rose  | \u00a31,100,000              | \u00a31,122,000                | \u00a326,250                   | 10% of salary | 100% of salary               | 85% of salary                       | 125% of salary                    |\n| Katie Murray | \u00a3750,000                | \u00a3765,000                  | \u00a326,250                   | 10% of salary | 100% of salary               | 85% of salary                       | 125% of salary                    |\n\n## Annual bonus and RSP\n\nSubject to being approved by shareholders at the 2022 AGM, the Policy on pages 143 to 147 will apply to the executive directors from 2022. The Committee intends to implement the new Policy as follows.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nThe 2022 bonus scorecard will be based on weighted performance measures and appropriately stretching targets across financial and non-financial areas that align with our purpose-led strategy. For 2022, these will be apportioned as follows:\n\n- -Financial performance measures will represent 60% of the overall scorecard. Target ranges have been set in line with the budget. A qualitative overlay will be applied to consider actual performance and how the outcome has been achieved. Any M&A activity and performance versus the market will be considered in the final assessment;\n- -Non-financial measures will be focused across Climate, Customer, Purpose, Culture and People, Enterprise and Capability. For 2022, these areas will represent an aggregate of 35% of the scorecard;\n- -Personal measures will represent 5% of the overall scorecard and the performance of each executive director will be based on a discretionary assessment at year end; and\n- -A downward Risk modifier will also apply, enabling risk performance to be assessed and awards reduced, potentially to zero, as required. This will be based on an assessment of:\n- -Annual risk performance assessment of Franchises/Functions/Legal Entities;\n- -Annual assessment of individual performance against executive director risk and control goals; and\n- -Qualitative behavioural observations from the Group Chief Risk Officer.\n\nIn the first year of implementation the annual bonus will be granted at a maximum value of 85% of base salary.",

No award will be made if threshold performance, as determined by the Committee, is not achieved.\n\nThe level of the award to be paid will vary between 10% for threshold performance and 100% for maximum performance. Target performance will pay out at 50% of maximum opportunity.\n\nAll assessments of performance are subject to the Committee's judgment to determine the appropriate outcome. Discretion will only be used by the Committee when the application of the formulaic performance outcome drives an unrepresentative outcome or when it is necessary to take into account strategic, economic or societal impacts that were not or could not have been accounted for at the point of agreeing the bonus scorecard.\n\n## Annual bonus performance measure and targets for 2022\n\n| Category         | Performance measures                                                                 | Target                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                  | Financial                                                                            | Financial                                                                                                                                                                                   | Financial                                                                                                                                                                         | Financial                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|                  | Go-forward group (1)  ROTE.

The RSP is bolstered by the annual bonus, which ensures that executive directors are also incentivised to deliver on the key strategic priorities of NatWest Group, with robust weighted performance measures as set out on the previous page. After the pre-grant test and underpin, the RSP would be expected to pay out at 100% in the vast majority of cases to deliver the expected value under the construct. In the first year of implementation, the RSP will be granted at a maximum value of 125% of base salary. This will rise to 150% of base salary in the second year of the new Policy.\n\n## Pre-grant test\n\nThe first RSP award will be granted in early 2023. Executive directors will be granted an RSP award provided the Committee considers performance over 2022 has been satisfactory, based on an assessment against our performance management framework.\n\n## Pre-vest underpin\n\nRSP awards will not be subject to further performance conditions. However, before vesting, the Committee will review the outcomes of the business against the following underpin criteria.\n\nA sustainable level of performance over the period will be considered with reference to:\n\n- 1.  the level of capital held relative to the maximum distributable amount;\n- 2.  total distributions paid relative to our distribution policy; and\n- 3.  any material deterioration in the risk or regulatory compliance profile or control environment of NatWest Group, or a serious conduct or reputational event.\n\nThe Committee will make an assessment at the end of the three-year performance period to determine whether sustainable performance has been achieved. The Committee will refer to the above underpin criteria in determining whether this has been the case. Following the Committee's assessment, RSP awards may vest in full, in part or lapse in their entirety. The Committee will also retain the right to consider other factors and apply discretion before making a decision on the final vesting outcome. This will mitigate any potential unintended outcomes that might arise and ensure that there is a fair outcome. The Committee will explain its reasons for applying discretion in either direction, or for not doing so. The Committee reserves the right to change the underpin criteria when granting new RSP awards over the Policy period.",

The rate will increase from \u00a330,000 per annum to \u00a334,000 per annum. This is closer to the fees paid for the equivalent role at peer banks and also aligns with the rates currently being paid to members of the Group Board Risk Committee, the Group Audit Committee and the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee. The change will apply from 1 January 2022 and is within the limits allowed under the existing remuneration policy.\n\n| Fees for NatWest Group plc Board (1)   | Rates from  1 January 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Chairman (composite fee)               | \u00a3750,000                     |\n| Non-executive director basic fee       | \u00a380,000                      |\n| Senior Independent Director            | \u00a334,000                      |\n\n| Fees for NatWest Group plc Board Committees (1)   | Member   | Chairman   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|\n| Group Board Risk Committee                        | \u00a334,000  | \u00a368,000    |\n| Group Audit Committee                             | \u00a334,000  | \u00a368,000    |\n| Group Performance and Remuneration Committee      | \u00a334,000  | \u00a368,000    |\n| Group Sustainable Banking Committee               | \u00a330,000  | \u00a360,000    |\n| Technology and Innovation Committee               | \u00a330,000  | \u00a360,000    |\n| Group Nominations and Governance Committee        | \u00a315,000  | -          |\n\nOther fees for NatWest Group plc Board directors\n\n| Chairman of NatWest Markets Plc (composite fee to cover all boards and committees)   | \u00a3264,000   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Chairman of the Colleague Advisory Panel                                             | \u00a315,000    |\n\n## Other external directorships\n\nThe Board must approve any additional appointments undertaken by directors outside NatWest Group. Steps are in place to make sure that directors comply with regulatory limits on the number of directorships held. The Board also considers whether it is appropriate for executive directors to retain any remuneration from any new external roles, depending on the appointment. You can find details of current external appointments in the biographies section of the Corporate Governance report.\n\n## Annual change in directors' pay compared to average change in employee pay\n\nRemuneration for employees is based on salary, benefits and annual bonus. The CEO and CFO receive fixed share allowances and are eligible for LTI awards rather than an annual bonus. The Chairman and non-executive directors receive fees rather than salary and do not receive any variable pay. We regularly review membership of Board Committees and changes in membership will impact the level of fees paid to non-executive directors from one year to the next. The benefits figures for non-executive directors can also change significantly year on year depending on the amount of travel undertaken in connection with Board meetings.\n\n|                          | 2020 to 2021   | 2020 to 2021   | 2020 to 2021   | 2019 to 2020   | 2019 to 2020   | 2019 to 2020   |\n|--------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Annual percentage change | Salary         | Benefits (1)   | Annual Bonus   | Salary         | Benefits (1)   | Annual Bonus   |\n| UK employees (2)         | 2.02%          | 4.68%          | 35.24%         | 2.86%          | 1.70%          | -32.4%         |\n| Executive directors      |                |                |                |                |                |                |\n| Alison Rose (3)          | 0%             | 0%             | n/a            | -              | -              | n/a            |\n| Katie Murray             | 0%             | 0%             | n/a            | 0%             | 0%             | n/a            |\n\n| Chairman and non-executive directors   | Fees   | Benefits   | Annual Bonus   | Fees   | Benefits   | Annual Bonus   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|------------|----------------|--------|------------|----------------|\n| Howard Davies                          | 0%     | 8%         | n/a            | 0%     | 9%         | n/a            |\n| Frank Dangeard                         | 1%     | 0%         | n/a            | 0%     | -75%       | n/a            |\n| Patrick Flynn                          | 0%     | -67%       | n/a            | 2%     | -70%       | n/a            |\n| Morten Friis                           | 17%    | 214%       | n/a            | 14%    | -80%       | n/a            |\n| Robert Gillespie                       | 3%     | -33%       | n/a            | -3%    | -84%       | n/a            |\n| Yasmin Jetha (4)                       | 33%    | 100%       | n/a            | -      | -          | n/a            |\n| Mike Rogers                            | 1%     | -100%      | n/a            | 0%     | -83%       | n/a            |\n| Mark Seligman                          | 1%     | 0%         | n/a            | -4%    | -88%       | n/a            |\n| Lena Wilson                            | 8%     | 25%        | n/a            | 16%    | -64%       | n/a            |",

        "page_content": "## CEO to employee pay ratios\n\nThe ratios compare the total pay of the CEO against the pay of three UK employees, whose earnings represent the lower, median and upper quartiles of the UK employee population. A significant proportion of the CEO's pay is delivered in LTI awards. As these are linked to performance and share price movements, this part of the ratio can fluctuate significantly from one year to the next. None of the three employees identified this year received LTI awards. Information based on salary only is included as a further comparison.\n\nThe pay ratios reflect the diverse range of roles and pay levels across NatWest Group as a large financial services company. The median employee for 2021 works in Services and the median pay ratio is consistent with the pay, reward and progression policies for UK employees taken as a whole. We are committed to paying each individual a fair rate for the role performed, using consistent reward policies and offering opportunities for progression. We set out further information on our fair pay approach earlier in this report and in the supporting ESG Supplement at natwestgroup.com. The change in the median pay ratio since 2018 is largely driven by the more volatile nature of pay for the CEO. In April 2020, the CEO decided to forgo 25% of her fixed pay for the rest of the year which also contributed to the ratio falling in 2020 before returning to more typical levels in 2021. Based on a comparison of salary only, the trend is more stable.\n\n|      |             | Pay ratios         | Pay ratios   | Pay ratios    | Pay ratios   | Remuneration values (\u00a3000)   | Remuneration values (\u00a3000)   | Remuneration values (\u00a3000)   | Remuneration values (\u00a3000)   | Remuneration values (\u00a3000)   |\n|------|-------------|--------------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Year | Methodology |                    | P25  (LQ)    | P50  (Median) | P75   (UQ)   | Calculation                  | CEO                          | Y25   (LQ)                   | Y50  (Median)                | Y75   (UQ)                   |\n| 2018 | A           | Total remuneration | 143:1        | 97:1          | 56:1         | Total remuneration           | 3,578                        | 25                           | 37                           | 64                           |\n|      |             | Salary only        | 44:1         | 30:1          | 19:1         | Salary only                  | 1,000                        | 23                           | 33                           | 51                           |\n| 2019 | A           | Total remuneration | 175:1        | 118:1         | 69:1         | Total remuneration           | 4,517                        | 26                           | 38                           | 66                           |\n|      |             | Salary only        | 44:1         | 30:1          | 19:1         | Salary only                  | 1,017                        | 23                           | 34                           | 52                           |\n| 2020 | A           | Total remuneration | 99:1         | 66:1          | 39:1         | Total remuneration           | 2,615                        | 26                           | 40                           | 66                           |\n|      |             | Salary only        | 46:1         | 31:1          | 20:1         | Salary only                  | 1,100                        | 24                           | 36                           | 54                           |\n| 2021 | A           | Total remuneration | 130:1        | 87:1          | 51:1         | Total remuneration           | 3,588                        | 28                           | 41                           | 70                           |\n|      |             | Salary only        | 44:1         | 29:1          | 20:1         | Salary only                  | 1,100                        | 25                           | 37                           | 55                           |\n\n- (1)  The data for 2021 is based on remuneration earned by Alison Rose, as set out in the single figure of remuneration table in this report.\n- (2)  The employees at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles (lower, median and upper quartiles) were determined as at 31 December of the relevant year, based on full-time equivalent remuneration for all UK employees. This includes fixed pay (salary, pension funding and where relevant benefit funding and other allowances) and also any variable pay (based on the amount to be paid). For employees who work part-time, fixed pay is grossed up to the full-time equivalent.\n- (3)  'Option A' methodology was selected as this is considered the most statistically accurate method under the reporting regulations. UK employees receive a pension funding allowance set as a percentage of salary. Some employees, but not the CEO, continue to participate in the defined benefit pension scheme. Under this, it would be possible to recognise a higher value, which would in turn reduce the ratios. However, for simplicity and consistency with regulatory disclosures, we have included the pension funding allowance value in the calculation for all employees.\n- (4)  The data for the three employees identified has been considered and fairly reflects pay at the relevant quartiles among the UK employee population. Each of the three individuals was a full-time employee during the year and none received an exceptional award that would otherwise inflate their pay figure\n\n## Summary of remuneration levels for employees in 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1)  For 2021, the disclosure of remuneration levels for employees includes anyone employed by NatWest Group during the year. This is a change of approach from previous years when we only included colleagues employed at year end.\n\n## Directors' interests in NatWest Group plc shares (audited)\n\nUnder the existing shareholding requirements, the CEO and CFO need to build up and maintain shares to the value of 400% of salary and 250% of salary respectively. The requirements apply both during employment and for two years after leaving, in line with best practice. Procedures are in place to enforce the shareholding requirements, and you can find further details on page 147. Subject to approval of the new Policy by shareholders at the 2022 AGM, the requirements will be increased to 500% of salary for the CEO and 300% of salary for the CFO.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nShares held outright\n\nShares awards that count\n\ntowards requirement\n\n- Shares awards still subject to performance\n\n## Share interests held by directors\n\n|                              | Alison   Rose             | Katie  Murray   | Howard  Davies   | Frank  Dangeard   | Patrick  Flynn   | Morten  Friis (2)   | Robert  Gillespie   | Yasmin  Jetha   | Mike  Rogers   | Mark  Seligman (3)   | Lena  Wilson   |\n|------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|\n| Shares held (1)              | 2,155,298 886,232 100,000 |                 |                  | 5,000             | 20,000           | 20,000              | 25,000              | 30,000          | 20,000         | 30,000               | 20,000         |\n| Shareholding requirement     | 400% of  salary           | 250% of  salary | -                | -                 | -                | -                   | -                   | -               | -              | -                    | -              |\n| Position against requirement | 501% of  salary           | 316% of  salary | -                | -                 | -                | -                   | -                   | -               | -              | -                    | -              |\n\n- (1)  Shares owned beneficially as at 31 December 2021 or at the date of stepping down from the Board if earlier.

Some shareholders continued to express concerns with some parts of  the policy for executive directors, as explained earlier in this report, and the challenges in maintaining a  competitive level of pay for executive directors have heightened over the past year. This led the Committee  to believe that amendments should be proposed to shareholders at the 2022 AGM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Managing conflicts         | To mitigate potential conflicts of interest, directors are not involved in decisions regarding their own  remuneration and the Committee rather than management appoint remuneration advisers. Attendees  also play an important role in advising the Committee but are not present when their own remuneration is  discussed. The Group Chief People & Transformation Officer may be present when discussions take place on  senior executive pay, as there is considerable benefit from her participation. However, she is never present  for discussions on her remuneration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Committee Advisers         | PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) was first appointed as remuneration adviser by the Committee in 2010  and reappointed in 2021, following an annual review of the quality of advice and the level of fees.

The Committee  also took account of the views of the Chairman, the CEO, the CFO, the Group Chief HR Officer, the Group  Chief People & Transformation Officer, the Director of Reward & Employment, the Group Chief Risk Officer  and the Group Chief Audit Executive. The Committee also received input from the BRC, the GAC, the SBC  and the Performance and Remuneration Committees for the principal legal entities across NatWest Group.

The Committee was considered to have managed a number of challenging items well in a  difficult year. It was noted there had been a number of unscheduled meetings, but on balance the  Committee recognised that additional discussions had been necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n\n## Robert Gillespie\n\nChairman of the NatWest Group Performance and Remuneration Committee\n\n17 February 2022\n\n## Other remuneration disclosures\n\nThis section contains disclosures which are required in accordance with UK regulatory requirements and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Pillar 3 disclosure requirements. They also take into account the European Banking Authority (EBA) guidelines on sound remuneration policies. It should be read in conjunction with the Directors' remuneration report starting on page 136.\n\n## Remuneration policy for all colleagues\n\nThe remuneration policy supports the business strategy and is designed to promote the long-term success of NatWest Group. It aims to reward the delivery of good performance provided this is achieved in a manner consistent with NatWest Group values and within acceptable risk parameters.\n\nThe remuneration policy applies the same principles to everyone, including Material Risk Takers (MRTs), with some minor adjustments where necessary to comply with local regulatory requirements. The main elements of the Policy are set out below.\n\n## Base salary\n\nThe purpose is to provide a competitive level of fixed cash remuneration.\n\n## Operation\n\nWe review base salaries annually to ensure they reflect the talents, skills and competencies that the individual brings to the business.\n\n## Role-based allowance\n\nCertain MRT roles receive role-based allowances in order to provide fixed pay that reflects the skills and experience required for the role.\n\n## Operation\n\nRole-based allowances are fixed allowances which form an element of overall fixed remuneration for regulatory purposes. They are based on the role the individual performs.\n\nThey are delivered in cash and/or shares depending on the level of the allowance and the seniority of the recipient. Shares are subject to a minimum three-year retention period.\n\n## Benefits and pension\n\nThe purpose is to provide a range of flexible and competitive benefits.\n\n## Operation\n\nIn most jurisdictions, benefits or a cash equivalent are provided from a flexible benefits account. Pension funding forms part of fixed remuneration and NatWest Group does not provide discretionary pension benefits.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nThe purpose is to support a culture where individuals recognise the importance of helping people, families and businesses to thrive and are rewarded for superior performance.\n\n## Operation\n\nThe annual bonus pool is based on a balanced scorecard of measures including financial and business delivery, customer, people and culture, climate and risk and control measures. Allocation from the pool depends on the performance of the business area and the individual.\n\nWe use a structured performance management framework to support individual performance assessment. This is designed to assess performance against longer-term business requirements across a range of financial and non-financial metrics. It also evaluates adherence to internal controls and risk management. We use a balanced scorecard to align with the business strategy. Each individual will have defined measures of success for their role.\n\nWe also take risk and conduct performance into account. Control functions are assessed independently of the business units that they oversee. Objectives and remuneration are set according to the priorities of the control area, not the targets of the businesses they support. The Group Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Audit Executive have the authority to escalate matters to Board level if management do not respond appropriately.\n\nIndependent control functions exist for the main legal entities outside the ring fence (NWM Plc and RBSI). Dual solid reporting lines are in place into the respective legal entity CEOs and the NatWest Group Control Function Heads.\n\nAwards may be granted up to a maximum of 100% of fixed pay. For awards made in respect of the 2021 performance year, immediate cash awards continue to be limited to a maximum of \u00a32,000. In line with regulatory requirements for MRTs, 40% of awards under \u00a3500,000 will be deferred over four, five or seven years. This rises to 60% for awards over \u00a3500,000. For MRTs, a minimum of 50% of any variable pay is delivered in shares and a 12-month retention period applies to the shares after vesting.\n\nThe deferral period is four years for standard MRTs and Risk Manager MRTs who meet the 'non-higher paid' condition. It rises to five years for 'higher paid' Risk Manager MRTs, FCA Senior Management Functions (SMF) roles and PRA SMFs who meet the 'non-higher paid' condition; and to seven years for 'higher paid' PRA SMFs. All awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions.\n\n## Long-term incentive (LTI) awards\n\nThe purpose and operation of LTI awards is explained in detail in the Directors' remuneration report. Instead of an annual bonus, NatWest Group provides executive directors and certain members of NatWest Group's senior executive committees with LTI awards. Any awards made are subject to a performance assessment prior to grant and again prior to vesting.\n\n## Shareholding requirements\n\nThe requirements promote long-term alignment between senior executives and shareholders.",

        "page_content": "## Operation\n\nExecutive directors and certain members of NatWest Group's senior executive committees are required to build up and hold a shareholding equivalent to a percentage of salary. There is a restriction on the number of shares that individuals can sell until this requirement is met.\n\n## Company share plans\n\nThe purpose is to provide an easy way for individuals to hold shares in NatWest Group plc, which helps to encourage long-term thinking and provides a direct involvement in NatWest Group's performance.\n\n## Operation\n\nColleagues in certain jurisdictions are offered the opportunity to contribute from salary and acquire shares in NatWest Group plc through company share plans. This includes Sharesave and the Buy As You Earn plan in the UK. Any shares held are not subject to performance conditions.\n\n## Criteria for identifying MRTs\n\nThe EBA has issued criteria for identifying MRT roles, which includes those staff whose activities have a material influence over NatWest Group's performance or risk profile. These criteria are both qualitative (based on the nature of the role) and quantitative (based on the amount a colleague is paid).\n\nIn 2021, MRTs were identified for 11 legal entities (including at parent holding company and consolidated levels) within NatWest Group. The MRT criteria are applied for each of these entities, and consequently many MRTs are identified in relation to more than one entity.\n\nThe qualitative criteria can be summarised as: staff within the management body; senior management; other staff with key functional or managerial responsibilities including for risk management; and staff who individually, or as part of a Committee, have authority to approve new business products or to commit to credit risk exposures and market risk transactions above certain levels.\n\nThe quantitative criteria are: individuals earning \u00a3658,000 or more in the previous year; individuals earning less than \u00a3658,000 in the previous year, but more than a threshold set at the higher of \u00a3440,000 or the average total earnings of the management body and senior management for the relevant legal entity and who can impact the risk profile of a material business unit; and individuals in the top 0.3% of earners of the relevant legal entity for the previous year. In addition to the qualitative and quantitative criteria, NatWest Group has applied its own minimum standards to identify roles that are considered to have a material influence over its risk profile.\n\n## Personal hedging strategies\n\nThe conditions attached to discretionary share-based awards prohibit the use of any personal hedging strategies to lessen the impact of a reduction in the value of such awards. Recipients explicitly acknowledge and accept these conditions when any share-based awards are granted.\n\n## Risk in the remuneration process\n\nNatWest Group's approach to remuneration promotes effective risk management through having a clear distinction between fixed remuneration (which reflects the role undertaken by an individual) and variable remuneration (which is directly linked to performance and can be risk-adjusted). Fixed pay is set at an appropriate level to discourage excessive risk-taking and which would allow NatWest Group to pay zero variable pay.\n\nWe achieve focus on risk through clear inclusion of risk in performance goals, performance reviews, the determination of variable pay pools, incentive plan design and the application of malus and clawback. The Committee is supported in this by the Group Board Risk Committee (BRC) and the Risk function, as well as independent oversight by the Internal Audit function.\n\nWe use a robust process to assess risk performance. We consider a range of measures, specifically: capital, liquidity and funding risk; credit risk; market risk; pension risk; compliance and conduct risk; financial crime; climate risk; operational risk; business risk and reputational risk. We also consider our overall risk culture.\n\nRemuneration arrangements are in line with regulatory requirements and we fully disclose and discuss the steps taken to ensure appropriate and thorough risk adjustment with the PRA and the FCA.\n\n## Variable pay determination\n\nFor the 2021 performance year, NatWest Group operated a robust control function-led, multi-step process to assess performance and determine the appropriate bonus pool by business area and function. At multiple points throughout the process, we made reference to NatWest Group-wide business performance (from both affordability and appropriateness perspectives) and the need to distinguish between 'go-forward' and 'resolution' activities.\n\nThe process uses financial, climate, customer and people measures to consider a balanced scorecard of performance assessments at the level of each business area or function. We then undertake risk and conduct assessments at the same level to ensure performance achieved without appropriate consideration of risk, risk culture and conduct controls, is not inappropriately rewarded.\n\nBRC reviews any material risk and conduct events and, if appropriate, an underpin may be applied to the individual business and function bonus pools or to the overall bonus pool. BRC may recommend a reduction of a bonus pool if it considers that risk and conduct performance is unacceptable or that the impact of poor risk management has yet to be fully reflected in the respective inputs.\n\nFollowing further review against overall performance and conduct, taking into account input from the CFO on affordability and capital and liquidity adequacy, the CEO will make a final recommendation to the Committee, informed by all the previous steps and her strategic view of the business. The Committee will then make an independent decision on the final bonus pool taking all of these earlier steps into account.\n\nThe assessment process for LTI awards to executive directors and other recipients is also founded on a balanced scorecard approach. The scorecard is aligned with the multi-step bonus pool process, reflecting a consistent risk management performance assessment.\n\n## Remuneration and culture\n\nNatWest Group continues to assess conduct and its impact on remuneration as part of the annual Group-wide bonus pool process and also via the accountability review framework. Many colleagues receive fixed pay only, which provides them with greater security and allows them to fully focus on the needs of the customer. The Committee will continue to review workforce remuneration and the alignment of incentives and reward with culture.\n\nThe governance of culture is clearly laid out. SMF roles have clearly defined accountabilities. The delivery of these accountabilities is taken into account in their performance and pay decisions. The Board and Group Sustainable Banking Committee (SBC) also play essential roles in building cultural priorities. Frameworks are in place to measure progress.\n\n## Accountability review process and malus/clawback\n\nWe introduced the accountability review process in 2012 to identify any material risk management, control and general policy breach failures, and to ensure accountability for those events.\n\nThis allows NatWest Group to respond to instances where new information would change the variable pay decisions made in previous years and/or the decisions to be made in the current year. Potential outcomes under the accountability review process are:\n\n- -malus - to reduce (to zero if appropriate) the amount of any unvested variable pay awards prior to payment;\n- -clawback - to recover awards that have already vested; and\n- -in-year bonus reductions - to adjust variable pay that would have otherwise been awarded for the current year.\n\nAs part of the acceptance of variable pay awards, colleagues must agree to terms that state that malus and clawback may be applied. Any variable pay awarded to MRTs is subject to clawback for seven years from the date of grant. Since the 2016 performance year onwards, this period can be extended to 10 years for MRTs who perform a SMF role under the Senior Managers Regime where there are outstanding internal or regulatory investigations at the end of the normal sevenyear clawback period. Awards to other colleagues (non-MRTs) are subject to clawback for 12 months from each vesting date.\n\nYou can read more about the circumstances in which malus, clawback or in-year bonus reduction may be applied on page 157.\n\nDuring 2021 a number of issues and events were considered under the accountability review framework. The outcomes covered a range of actions including reduction (to zero where appropriate) of unvested awards through malus and the suspension of awards pending further investigation.\n\n## Remuneration of MRTs\n\nThe quantitative disclosures below are made in accordance with regulatory requirements in relation to 846 individuals who have been identified as MRTs for one or more entities across NatWest Group plc. The number of MRTs identified has decreased since last year due to a reduction in credit 'initiators' and changes in credit authorities.\n\nWe have excluded two individuals from the tables below on the basis that, although they have been identified as an MRT in relation to a role within a subsidiary entity, they do not receive any remuneration for this role and are not an MRT in relation to their primary role for NatWest Group.\n\nYou can find details of remuneration paid to MRTs in Pillar 3 reporting on a consolidated, sub-consolidated and solo entity level at natwestgroup.com.",

Under the NatWest Group bonus deferral structure, immediate cash awards are limited to \u00a32,000 per person, with a further payment of cash and shares within Year 0.\n\n## Derogations\n\nThe regulations allow some flexibility not to apply certain requirements that would normally apply to MRTs where an individual's annual variable remuneration does not exceed \u00a344,000 and does not represent more than one third of the individual's total annual remuneration (derogations permitted under point (b) of Article 94(3) of CRD V). We have used this flexibility to disapply MRT rules relating to deferral and delivery of awards in shares for 274 MRTs in respect of the performance year 2021. Total remuneration for these individuals in 2021 was \u00a335.88 million (of which \u00a331.16 million was fixed pay and \u00a34.72 million was variable pay).\n\n## Ratio between fixed and variable remuneration\n\nThe variable component of total remuneration for MRTs at NatWest Group shall not exceed 100% of the fixed component (except where local jurisdictions apply a lower maximum ratio for variable pay). The average ratio between fixed and variable remuneration for 2021 was approximately 1 to 0.42. The majority of MRTs were based in the UK.\n\n## Outstanding deferred remuneration\n\nThe table below includes deferred remuneration awarded or paid out in 2021 relating to prior performance years.\n\nTotal amount\n\n| Deferred and retained remuneration                                  | Total amount  of deferred  remuneration  awarded for  previous  performance  periods   \u00a3m   | Of which: due  to vest in the  financial year \u00a3m                    | Of which:  vesting in  subsequent  financial years  \u00a3m              | Amount of  performance  adjustment  to deferred  remuneration  that was due to  vest in the  financial year  \u00a3m   | Amount of  performance  adjustment  to deferred  remuneration  due to vest in  future financial  years   \u00a3m   | Total amount  of adjustment  during the  financial year  due to ex post  implicit  adjustments (1) \u00a3m   | Total amount  of deferred  remuneration  awarded before  the financial  year actually  paid out in the  financial year  \u00a3m   | of deferred  remuneration  awarded for  previous  performance  period that has  vested but is  subject to  retention  \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| NatWest Group plc NEDs  -

Adopting this approach ensures that all directors have an opportunity to contribute to succession planning discussions for Board and senior management, in support of achieving an appropriate balance of skills, experience, knowledge and diversity at senior levels within NatWest Group and on the Board. It also means that all directors have an opportunity to review, consider and become familiar with the next generation of executive leaders.\n\nIn respect of Provision 33, the Board also considers that this is a matter which should rightly be reserved for the Board and this is an approach the Board has adopted for a number of years. Remuneration for the executive directors is first considered by the Group RemCo which then makes recommendations to the Board for consideration. This approach allows all non-executive directors, and not just those who are members of the Group RemCo, to participate in decisions on the executive directors' and the Chairman's remuneration and also allows the executive directors to input to the decision on the Chairman's remuneration. The Board believes this approach is very much in line with the spirit of the Code and no director is involved in decisions regarding his or her own remuneration. A copy of the Code can be found at www.frc.org.uk.\n\nThe Board does not anticipate any changes to its approach on these aspects of the Code.\n\nFurther information on how NatWest Group plc has applied the Principles, and complied with the Provisions, of the Code can be found in the Corporate governance section of this report, which includes cross-references to relevant sections of the Strategic report and other related disclosures.\n\nNatWest Group plc has complied in all material respects with the Financial Reporting Council Guidance on Audit Committees issued in September 2012 and April 2016.\n\nUnder the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, specific standards of corporate governance and business and financial disclosures and controls apply to companies with securities registered in the US. NatWest Group plc complies with all applicable sections of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, subject to a number of exceptions available to foreign private issuers.\n\n## Internal control\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the system of internal controls that is designed to maintain effective and efficient operations, compliant with applicable laws and regulations. The system of internal controls is designed to manage, or mitigate, risk to an acceptable residual level rather than eliminate it entirely. Systems of internal control can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement, fraud or loss.\n\nOngoing processes for the identification, evaluation and management of the principal risks faced by NatWest Group operated throughout the period from 1 January 2021 to 17 February 2022, the date the directors approved the Annual Report and Accounts. These included the semi-annual Control Environment Certification process, which requires senior members of the executive and management to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of their internal control frameworks and certify that their business or function is compliant with the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 and the UK Corporate Governance Code. The policies that govern these processes - and reports on internal controls arising from them - are reviewed by the Board and meet the requirements of the Financial Reporting Council's Guidance on Risk Management Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting.\n\nNatWest Group operates a three lines of defence model, which provides an effective apportionment of responsibilities and accountabilities across the organisation. As part of its second line of defence role, the Risk oversight function exercises oversight and challenge of the risk management activities undertaken by the first line of defence, which is responsible for designing, implementing and maintaining effective processes, procedures and controls to mitigate risks within risk appetite. The Internal Audit function, which is the third line of defence, undertakes independent and objective assurance activities and provides reports to the Board and executive management on the quality and effectiveness of governance, risk management and internal controls to monitor, manage and mitigate risks in achieving NatWest Group's objectives.\n\nThe effectiveness of NatWest Group's internal controls is reviewed regularly by the Board, the Group Audit Committee and the Group Board Risk Committee. In addition, the Board receives a risk management report at each scheduled Board meeting. Executive management committees in each of NatWest Group's businesses also receive regular reports on significant risks facing their business and how these are being controlled. Details of the bank's approach to risk management are given in the Risk & Capital Management section of the Annual Report and Accounts.",

        "page_content": "While work continues to enhance the control environment relating to financial crime risk, operational weaknesses between 2012 and 2016 resulted in the inadequate monitoring of a UK-incorporated NatWest Bank Plc customer. Regulations require risk-sensitive ongoing monitoring of customers for the purposes of preventing money laundering. NatWest Bank Plc co-operated fully with the regulator's investigation into this case and, in October 2021, pleaded guilty to three breaches of the Money Laundering Regulations 2007. NatWest Group takes its responsibility to prevent and detect financial crime extremely seriously and continues to make significant multiyear investments to strengthen and improve its overall financial crime framework with prevention systems and capabilities. Almost \u00a3700 million has been invested in the last five years, including upgrades to transaction monitoring systems, automated customer screening and new customer due diligence solutions.\n\nNatWest Group continued to make enhancements to other aspects of the wider control environment in 2021. This has included the management of delivery of regulated programmes such as the IRB programme, as required by Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) and the European Banking Authority (EBA). NWG continued to focus on the embedding of a strong risk culture to support a robust control environment.\n\nThe remediation of known control issues continued to be an important focus for both the Group Audit Committee and the Board Risk Committee during 2021. For further information on their oversight of remediation of the most significant issues, please refer to the Report of the Group Audit Committee and the Report of the Group Board Risk Committee. As part of its activities, the Group Audit Committee has received confirmation that management has taken, or is taking, action to remedy significant failings or weaknesses identified through NatWest Group's control framework.\n\nWhile not being part of the bank's system of internal control, the Group's independent auditors present to the Group Audit Committee reports that include details of any significant internal control deficiencies they have identified. Further, the system of internal controls is also subject to regulatory oversight in the UK and overseas. Additional details of regulatory oversight are given in the Risk & Capital Management section.\n\nWhile several planned activities designed to enhance the control environment were disrupted by the extensive impact of COVID-19 (thereby delaying the achievement of the NatWest Group's control environment target), the control environment remained largely stable in 2021. There was continuing management focus on the delivery of regulatory programmes - including the internal transformation programme established in response to updated IRB regulation from the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) and the European Banking Authority (EBA) - as well as a review of the controls and processes relating to certain regulatory reporting. There was also significant focus on work to enhance controls relating to financial crime risks - including ongoing work to strengthen customer due diligence standards. The focus of the of NatWest Group in establishing and maintaining a robust risk culture made a valuable contribution to the overall control environment.\n\nThe remediation of known control issues remained a focus of the Group Audit Committee and the Group Board Risk Committee during 2021. For further information on their oversight of remediation of the most significant issues, please refer to the Report of the Group Audit Committee and the Report of the Group Board Risk Committee. The Group Audit Committee has received confirmation that management has taken, or is taking, action to remedy significant failings or weaknesses identified through NatWest Group's control framework. The Group Audit Committee and the Group Board Risk Committee will continue to focus on such remediation activity, particularly in view of the transformation agenda.\n\nWhile not being part of the Group's system of internal control, the Group's independent auditors present to the Group Audit Committee reports that include details of any significant internal control deficiencies they have identified. Further, the system of internal controls is also subject to regulatory oversight in the UK and overseas. Additional details of regulatory oversight are given in the Risk and capital management section.\n\n## Internal control over financial reporting\n\nNatWest Group plc is required to comply with Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2021.\n\nNatWest Group has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2021 based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in the 2013 publication of 'Internal Control - Integrated Framework'.\n\nBased on its assessment, management has concluded that, as of 31 December 2021, NatWest Group's internal control over financial reporting is effective.\n\nNatWest Group's auditors have audited the effectiveness of NatWest Group's internal control over financial reporting and have given an unqualified opinion.\n\nManagement's report on NatWest Group's internal control over financial reporting will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F.\n\n## Disclosure controls and procedures\n\nAs required by Exchange Act rules, management (including the Group CEO and Group CFO) have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness and design of NatWest Group's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act rules) as at 31 December 2021. Based on this evaluation, management (including the Group CEO and Group CFO) concluded that NatWest Group plc's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report and Accounts.\n\n## Changes in internal control\n\nThere was no change in NatWest Group's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, NatWest Group's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## The New York Stock Exchange\n\nAs a foreign private issuer with American Depository Shares representing ordinary shares, preference shares and debt securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE), NatWest Group plc is not required to comply with all of the NYSE governance standards applicable to US domestic companies (the NYSE Standards) provided that it follows home country practice in lieu of the NYSE Standards and discloses any significant ways in which its corporate governance practices differ from the NYSE Standards. NatWest Group plc is also required to provide an Annual Written Affirmation to the NYSE of its compliance with the mandatory applicable NYSE Standards. In March 2021 NatWest Group plc submitted its most recent Annual Written Affirmation to the NYSE which confirmed NatWest Group plc's full compliance with the applicable provisions.\n\nThe Group Audit Committee fully complies with the mandatory provisions of the NYSE Standards (including by reference to the rules of the Exchange Act) that relate to the composition, responsibilities and operation of audit committees. More detailed information about the Group Audit Committee and its work during 2021 is set out in the Group Audit Committee report on pages 116 to 123.\n\nThe Board has reviewed its corporate governance arrangements and is satisfied that these are consistent with the NYSE Standards, subject to the following departures:\n\n- i. NYSE Standards require the majority of the Board to be independent. The NYSE Standards contain different tests from the Code for determining whether a director is independent. NatWest Group plc follows the Code's requirements in determining the independence of its directors and currently has eight independent non-executive directors, one of whom is the Senior Independent Director.\n- ii.  The NYSE Standards require non-management directors to hold regular sessions without management present, and that independent directors meet at least once a year. The Code requires the Chairman to hold meetings with nonexecutive directors without the executives present and non-executive directors are to meet without the Chairman present at least once a year to appraise the Chairman's performance and NatWest Group plc complies with the requirements of the Code.\n- iii.  The NYSE Standards require that the nominating/ corporate governance committee of a listed company be composed entirely of independent directors. The Chairman of the Board is also the Chairman of the Group Nominations and Governance Committee, which is permitted under the Code (since the Chairman was considered independent on appointment). The terms of reference of the Group Nominations and Governance Committee differ in certain limited respects from the requirements set out in the NYSE Standards, including because the Group Nominations and Governance Committee does not have responsibility for overseeing the evaluation of management.\n- iv. The NYSE standards require that the compensation committee of a listed company be composed entirely of independent directors. Although the members of the Group RemCo are deemed independent in compliance with the provisions of the Code, the Board has not assessed the independence of the members of the Group RemCo and Group RemCo has not assessed the independence of any compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser, in each case, in accordance with the independence tests prescribed by the NYSE Standards. The NYSE Standards require that the compensation committee must have direct responsibility to review and approve the CEO's remuneration. As stated at the start of this Compliance report, in the case of NatWest Group plc, the Board rather than the Group RemCo reserves the authority to make the final determination of the remuneration of the CEO.\n- v.  The NYSE Standards require listed companies to adopt and disclose corporate governance guidelines. Throughout the year ended 31 December 2021, NatWest Group plc has complied with all of the provisions of the Code (subject to the exception described above) and the Code does not require NatWest Group plc to disclose the full range of corporate governance guidelines with which it complies.\n- vi. The NYSE Standards require listed companies to adopt and disclose a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers and employees, and promptly disclose any waivers of the code for directors or executive officers. NatWest Group has adopted a code of conduct which is supplemented by a number of key policies and guidance dealing with matters including, among others, anti-bribery and corruption, anti-money laundering, sanctions, confidentiality, inside information, health, safety and environment, conflicts of interest, market conduct and management records. This code of conduct applies to all officers and employees and is fully aligned to the PRA and FCA Conduct Rules which apply to all directors. The Code of Conduct is available to view on NatWest Group's website at natwestgroup.com.\n\nThis Compliance report forms part of the Corporate governance report and the Report of the directors.",

Following these changes the company owns three main subsidiaries, NatWest Holdings Limited (the parent of the ring-fenced group which includes National Westminster Bank Plc, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and Ulster Bank Ireland DAC), NatWest Markets Plc (the investment bank and the parent of NatWest Markets N.V.) and The Royal Bank of Scotland International (Holdings) Limited (the parent of The Royal Bank of Scotland International Limited).\n\nFurther details of the principal subsidiary undertakings are shown in Note 33 of the consolidated financial statements and a full list of subsidiary undertakings and overseas branches is shown in Note 12 of the parent company accounts.\n\nFollowing placing and open offers in December 2008 and in April 2009, HM Treasury (HMT) owned approximately 70.3% of the enlarged ordinary share capital of the company. In December 2009, the company issued a further \u00a325.5 billion of new capital to HMT in the form of B shares. HMT sold 630 million of its holding of the company's ordinary shares in August 2015. In October 2015 HMT converted its entire holding of 51 billion B shares into 5.1 billion new ordinary shares of \u00a31 each in the company. HMT sold a further 925 million of its holding of the company's ordinary shares in June 2018.\n\nIn March 2021, the company carried out an off-market purchase of 591 million of its ordinary shares from HMT.\n\nIn May 2021, HMT sold 580 million ordinary shares through an accelerated book building process to institutional investors.\n\nIn July 2021, HMT announced its intention to sell part of its shareholding over a 12 month period from August 2021 via a trading plan, for up to 15% of the aggregate total trading volume.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, HMT's holding in the total voting rights of the company was 52.96%. The percentage was correct as at the date of notification on 5 November 2021.\n\n## Activities\n\nNatWest Group is engaged principally in providing a wide range of banking and other financial services. Further details of the organisational structure and business overview of NatWest Group, including the products and services provided by each of its operating segments and the markets in which they operate are contained in the Business review. Details of the strategy for delivering the company's objectives can be found in the Strategic report.\n\n## Results and dividends\n\nUK company law provides that dividends can only be paid if a company has sufficient distributable profits available to cover the dividend. A company's distributable profits are its accumulated, realised profits not previously distributed or capitalised, less its accumulated, realised losses not previously written off in a reduction or re-organisation of capital. At 31 December 2021, NatWest Group Plc's distributable profits were \u00a331 billion.\n\nThe profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders of NatWest Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2021 amounted to \u00a32,950 million compared with a loss of \u00a3753 million for the year ended 31 December 2020, as set out in the consolidated income statement on page 300.\n\nIn 2021 NatWest Group paid an interim dividend of \u00a3347 million, or 3.0p per ordinary share (2020 - nil).\n\nThe company has announced that the directors have recommended a final dividend of \u00a3844 million, or 7.5p per ordinary share (2020 - \u00a3364 million or 3.0p per ordinary share). The final dividend recommended by directors is subject to shareholders' approval at the Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2022.\n\nIf approved, payment will be made on 4 May 2022 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 18 March 2022. The ex-dividend date will be 17 March 2022.\n\nSubject to above mentioned condition, the payment of interim dividends on ordinary shares is at the discretion of the Board.\n\n## Colleagues\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, NatWest Group employed 57,800 people (excluding temporary staff). Details of all related costs are included in Note 3 to the consolidated accounts.\n\n## Employment for disabled persons\n\nFor colleagues with disabilities NatWest Group supports them with workplace adjustments so that they can succeed. If a colleague becomes disabled NatWest Group will, wherever possible, make adjustments to support them in their existing role or re-deploy them to a more suitable alternative role.\n\nWith external recruitment, the NatWest Group Careers site gives comprehensive insights into NatWest Group jobs, culture, locations and application processes. It also hosts a variety of blog content to portray stories of what it is like to work at NatWest Group. The company also makes sure that candidates can easily request any adjustments to help complete their application or assessment.\n\n## Going concern\n\nNatWest Group's business activities and financial position, the factors likely to affect its future development and performance and its objectives and policies in managing the financial risks to which it is exposed and its capital are discussed in the Business review. The risk factors which could materially affect NatWest Group's future results are set out on pages 406 to 426. NatWest Group's regulatory capital resources and significant developments in 2021 and anticipated future developments are detailed in the Capital, liquidity and funding section on pages 249 to 265. This section also describes NatWest Group's funding and liquidity profile, including changes in key metrics and the build up of liquidity reserves.\n\nHaving reviewed NatWest Group's principal risks, forecasts, projections and other relevant evidence, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue in operational existence for a period of 12 months from the date of this report. Accordingly, the financial statements of NatWest Group and of the company have been prepared on a going concern basis.\n\n## UK Code for Financial Reporting Disclosure\n\nNatWest Group plc's 2021 financial statements have been prepared in compliance with the principles set out in the Code for Financial Reporting Disclosure published by the British Bankers' Association in 2010. The Code sets out five disclosure principles together with supporting guidance. The principles are that NatWest Group and other major UK banks will provide high quality, meaningful and decision-useful disclosures; review and enhance their financial instrument disclosures for key areas of interest to market participants; assess the applicability and relevance of good practice recommendations to their disclosures, acknowledging the importance of such guidance; seek to enhance the comparability of financial statement disclosures across the UK banking sector; and clearly differentiate in their annual reports between information that is audited and information that is unaudited.\n\n## Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF) and Disclosures on Expected Credit Losses (DECL) Taskforce recommendations\n\nThe EDTF, established by the Financial Stability Board, published its report 'Enhancing the Risk Disclosures of Banks' in October 2012, with an update in November 2015 covering IFRS 9 expected credit losses (ECL). The DECL Taskforce, jointly established by the Financial Conduct Authority, Financial Reporting Council and the Prudential Regulatory Authority, published its phase 2 report recommendations in December 2019.\n\nNatWest Group plc's 2021 Annual Report and Accounts and Pillar 3 Report reflect EDTF and have regard to DECL Taskforce recommendations.\n\n## Authority to repurchase shares\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting in 2021 shareholders authorised the company to make market purchases of up to 1,216,656,575 ordinary shares. The directors utilised the authority obtained at the 2021 AGM to conduct a share buyback programme (the 'Programme') of up to \u00a3750 million, as announced to the market on 30 July 2021. The Programme's purpose is to reduce the ordinary share capital of NatWest Group.\n\nTaking into account the reduction in issued ordinary share capital which occurred as a result of the off-market buyback announced on 19 March 2021, the maximum number of ordinary shares that could be purchased by the company under the Programme was 1,157,583,542. The Programme commenced on 2 August 2021 and, as at 31 December 2021, 310,802,416 ordinary shares (nominal value \u00a3310,802,416) had been purchased by the company at an average purchase price of 217.5796p per ordinary share for the total consideration of \u00a3676,242,656. A further 29,735,044 ordinary shares (nominal value \u00a329,735,044) were purchased by the company from 1 January to 18 January 2022 at an average purchase price of 245.5264p per ordinary share for the total consideration of \u00a373,007,375. All of the purchased ordinary shares were cancelled, representing 2.93% of the company's issued ordinary share capital. Shareholders will be asked to renew this authorisation at the Annual General Meeting in 2022.\n\nOn 6 February 2019 the company held a General Meeting and shareholders approved a special resolution to give the company authority to make off-market purchases of up to 4.99% of its ordinary share capital in issuance from HMT (or its nominee) at such times as the directors may determine is appropriate. Full details of the proposal are set out in the Circular and Notice of General Meeting available at natwestgroup.com. This authority was renewed at the Annual General Meeting in 2021 and shareholders will be asked to renew the authority at the Annual General Meeting in 2022.\n\nThe company utilised the authority it obtained at the 2020 AGM to make an off-market purchase of 590,730,325 ordinary shares (nominal value \u00a3590,730,325) in the company from HMT on 19 March 2021, at a price of 190.50p per ordinary share for the total consideration of \u00a31,125,341,269, representing 4.86% of the company's issued ordinary share capital. The company cancelled 390,730,325 of the purchased ordinary shares and held the remaining 200,000,000 ordinary shares in treasury. The company has used a total of 19,062,290 treasury shares to satisfy the exercise of options and the vesting of share awards under the employee share plans and the balance of ordinary shares held in treasury as at 31 December 2021 was 180,937,710.\n\nAt the 2021 Annual General Meeting, shareholders authorised the company to make an off-market purchase of preference shares in the company. The company announced on 15 December 2021 that it had utilised this authority to purchase 157,546 5.5% cumulative preference shares (nominal value \u00a3157,546), representing 39.39% of the share class, at a purchase price of 102%, for the total consideration of \u00a3160,697 and 259,314 11.00% cumulative preference shares (nominal value \u00a3259,314), representing 51.86% of the share class, at a purchase price of 155%, for the total consideration of \u00a3401,937. The company cancelled all of the purchased preference shares.\n\n## Additional information\n\nWhere not provided elsewhere in the Report of the directors, the following additional information is required to be disclosed by Part 6 of Schedule 7 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008.\n\nThe rights and obligations attached to the company's ordinary shares and preference shares are set out in our Articles of Association, copies of which can be obtained from Companies House in the UK or can be found at natwestgroup.com. Noncumulative preference share details are set out in Note 22 of the consolidated accounts.\n\nThe cumulative preference shares represent less than 0.005% of the total voting rights of the company, the remainder being represented by the ordinary shares.\n\nIn a show of hands at a General Meeting of the company, every holder of ordinary shares and cumulative preference shares, present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote, shall have one vote.\n\nOn a poll, every holder of ordinary shares or cumulative preference shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote, shall have four votes for every share held. The notices of Annual General Meetings and General Meetings specify the deadlines for exercising voting rights and appointing a proxy or proxies to vote in relation to resolutions to be passed at the meeting.\n\nThere are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the company other than certain restrictions which may from time to time be imposed by laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws). At the 2021 Annual General Meeting, shareholders gave authority to directors to offer a scrip dividend alternative on any dividend paid up to the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 2024. Pursuant to the UK Listing Rules, certain employees of the company require the approval of the company to deal in the company's shares.\n\nThe rules governing the powers of directors, including in relation to issuing or buying back shares and their appointment, are set out in our Articles of Association. It will be proposed at the 2022 Annual General Meeting that the directors' authorities to allot shares under the Companies Act 2006 (the Companies Act) be renewed. The Articles of Association may only be amended by a special resolution at a General Meeting of shareholders. The company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities and/or voting rights. There are no persons holding securities carrying special rights with regard to control of the company. A number of the company's employee share plans include restrictions on transfers of shares while shares are subject to the plans. Note 3 sets out a summary of the plans.",

        "page_content": "Under the rules of certain employee share plans, voting rights are exercised by the Trustees of the plan on receipt of participants' instructions. If a participant does not submit an instruction to the Trustee no vote is registered.\n\nFor shares held in the company's other employee share trusts, the voting rights are exercisable by the Trustees. However, in accordance with investor protection guidelines, the Trustees abstain from voting. The Trustees would take independent advice before accepting any offer in respect of their shareholdings for the company in a takeover bid situation. The Trustees have chosen to waive their entitlement to the dividend on shares held by the Trusts.\n\nA change of control of the company following a takeover bid may cause a number of agreements to which the company is party to take effect, alter or terminate. All of the company's employee share plans contain provisions relating to a change of control. In the context of the company as a whole, these agreements are not considered to be significant.\n\n## Directors\n\nThe names and brief biographical details of the current directors are shown on pages 98 to 101.\n\nHoward Davies, Frank Dangeard, Patrick Flynn, Morten Friis, Robert Gillespie, Yasmin Jetha, Katie Murray, Mike Rogers, Alison Rose, Mark Seligman and Lena Wilson all served throughout the year and to the date of signing of the financial statements.\n\nAll directors of the company are required to stand for election or re-election annually by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and, in accordance with the UK Listing Rules, the election or re-election of independent directors requires approval by all shareholders and also by independent shareholders.\n\n## Directors' interests\n\nThe interests of the directors in the shares of the company at 31 December 2021 are shown on page 171. None of the directors held an interest in the loan capital of the company or in the shares or loan capital of any of the subsidiary undertakings of the company, during the period from 1 January 2021 to 17 February 2022.\n\n## Directors' indemnities\n\nIn terms of section 236 of the Companies Act, Qualifying Third Party Indemnity Provisions have been issued by the company to its directors, members of the NatWest Group and NWH Executive Committees, individuals authorised by the PRA/FCA, certain directors and/or officers of NatWest Group subsidiaries and all trustees of NatWest Group pension schemes.\n\n## Controlling shareholder\n\nIn accordance with the UK Listing Rules, the company has entered into an agreement with HM Treasury (the 'Controlling Shareholder') which is intended to ensure that the Controlling Shareholder complies with the independence provisions set out in the UK Listing Rules. The company has complied with the independence provisions in the relationship agreement and as far as the company is aware the independence and procurement provisions in the relationship agreement have been complied with in the period by the controlling shareholder.\n\n## Shareholdings\n\nThe table below shows shareholders that have notified NatWest Group that they hold more than 3% of the total voting rights of the company at 31 December 2021.\n\n|                                                                | Ordinary  shares  (millions)   | % of issued  share capital  with voting  rights held 1   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Solicitor For The Affairs of                                   |                                |                                                          |\n| Her Majesty's Treasury as Nominee   for Her Majesty's Treasury | 6,038                          | 52.96                                                    |\n| Norges Bank                                                    | 348                            | 3.07                                                     |\n\nOn 11 February 2022 a notification under Rule 5 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules ('DTR') was received from HMT notifying that they held 5,735 million ordinary shares, representing 50.94% of the issued share capital with voting rights.\n\nAs at 17 February 2022, no further notifications have been received under Rule 5 of the DTR.\n\n## Listing rule 9.8.4\n\nThe information to be disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts under LR 9.8.4, is set out in this Directors' report with the exception of details of contracts of significance under LR 9.8.4 (10) and (11) given in Additional information on page 427.\n\n## Political donations\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting in 2021, shareholders gave authority under Part 14 of the Companies Act 2006, for a period of one year, for the company (and its subsidiaries) to make political donations and incur political expenditure up to a maximum aggregate sum of \u00a3100,000. This authorisation was taken as a precaution only, as the company has a longstanding policy of not making political donations or incurring political expenditure within the ordinary meaning of those words.\n\nDuring 2021, NatWest Group made no political donations, nor incurred any political expenditure in the UK or EU and it is not proposed that NatWest Group's longstanding policy of not making contributions to any political party be changed. Shareholders will be asked to renew this authorisation at the Annual General Meeting in 2022.\n\n## Directors' disclosure to auditors\n\nEach of the directors at the date of approval of this report confirms that:\n\n(a) so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company's auditors are unaware; and\n\n(b) the director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a director to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company's auditors are aware of that information.\n\nThis confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act.\n\n## Auditors\n\nErnst & Young LLP (EY LLP) are the auditors and have indicated their willingness to continue in office. A resolution to re-appoint EY LLP as the company's auditors will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

The directors are required to prepare Group financial statements, and as permitted by the Companies Act 2006 have elected to prepare company financial statements, for each financial year in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and IFRS as adopted by the European Union. They are responsible for preparing financial statements that present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of NatWest Group. In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\n- -select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n- -make judgments and estimates that are reasonable, relevant and reliable; and\n- -state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements.\n- -prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company and Group will continue in business.\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of NatWest Group and to enable them to ensure that the Annual Report and Accounts complies with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of NatWest Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nUnder applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic report, Directors' report, Directors' remuneration report and Corporate governance statement that comply with that law and those regulations. The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company's website.\n\nThe directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:\n\n- -the financial statements, prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and IFRS as adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and\n- -the Strategic report and Directors' report (incorporating the Financial review) include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\nIn addition, the directors are of the opinion that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company's position and performance, business model and strategy.\n\nBy order of the Board\n\n| Howard Davies      | Alison Rose-Slade             | Katie Murray                  |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Chairman           | Group Chief Executive Officer | Group Chief Financial Officer |\n| 17 February 2022   |                               |                               |\n| Board of directors |                               |                               |\n| Chairman           | Executive directors           | Non-executive directors       |\n| Howard Davies      | Alison Rose-Slade             | Frank Dangeard                |\n|                    | Katie Murray                  | Patrick Flynn                 |\n|                    |                               | Morten Friis                  |\n|                    |                               | Robert Gillespie              |\n|                    |                               | Yasmin Jetha                  |\n|                    |                               | Mike Rogers                   |\n|                    |                               | Mark Seligman                 |\n|                    |                               | Lena Wilson                   |",

NatWest Group remained committed to supporting its customers while operating safely and soundly in line with its strategic objectives.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a slowly-recovering economy, the credit risk profile remains heightened and there is an expectation that the impacts of the pandemic will continue to be seen in the performance of NatWest Group's portfolios for some time. NatWest Group anticipates increased default levels in 2022 as a result.\n\nWhile the direct impact on NatWest Group's operational risk profile reduced, NatWest Group continued to closely monitor the second-order impacts on its transformation agenda, with a significant focus on managing resource to protect key regulatory deliveries. The continued evolution of NatWest Group's ways of working - to include large-scale working from home - also required significant operational risk focus, particularly in terms of business resilience.\n\nAs a result of its strong balance sheet and prudent approach to risk management, NatWest Group remains well placed to withstand these aftershocks as well as providing support to customers when they need it most.\n\n## Risk management framework\n\n## Introduction\n\nNatWest Group operates an enterprise-wide risk management framework, which is centred around the embedding of a strong risk culture. The framework ensures the governance, capabilities and methods are in place to facilitate risk management and decision-making across the organisation.\n\nThe framework ensures that NatWest Group's principal risks which are detailed in this section - are appropriately controlled and managed. It sets out the standards and objectives for risk management as well as defining the division of roles and responsibilities.\n\nThis seeks to ensure a consistent approach to risk management across NatWest Group and its subsidiaries. It aligns risk management with NatWest Group's overall strategic objectives.\n\nThe framework, which is designed and maintained by NatWest Group's independent Risk function, is owned by the Chief Risk Officer. It is reviewed and approved annually by the Board. The framework incorporates risk governance, NatWest Group's three lines of defence operating model and the Risk function's mandate.\n\nRisk appetite, supported by a robust set of principles, policies and practices, defines the levels of tolerance for a variety of risks and provides a structured approach to risk-taking within agreed boundaries.\n\nWhile all NatWest Group colleagues are responsible for managing risk, the Risk function provides oversight and monitoring of risk management activities, including the implementation of the framework and adherence to its supporting policies, standards and operational procedures. The Chief Risk Officer plays an integral role in providing the Board with advice on NatWest Group's risk profile, the performance of its controls and in providing challenge where a proposed business strategy may exceed risk tolerance.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n189\n\nIn addition, there is a process to identify and manage top risks, which are those that could have a significant negative impact on NatWest Group's ability to meet its strategic objectives. A complementary process operates to identify emerging risks. Both top and emerging risks may incorporate aspects of - or correlate to - a number of principal risks and are reported alongside them to the Board on a regular basis. Culture\n\nRisk culture is at the heart of NatWest Group's risk management framework and its risk management practice. The risk culture target is to make risk part of the way employees work and think.\n\nA focus on leaders as role models and action to build clarity, develop capability and motivate employees to reach the required standards of behaviour are key to achieving the risk culture target. Colleagues are expected to:\n\n- \uf02d Take personal responsibility for understanding and proactively managing the risks associated with individual roles.\n- \uf02d Understand the risks associated with individual roles.\n- \uf02d Respect risk management and the part it plays in daily work.\n- \uf02d Align decision-making to NatWest Group's risk appetite.\n- \uf02d Escalate risks and issues early; taking action to mitigate risks and learning from mistakes and near-misses.\n- \uf02d Consider risk in all actions and decisions.\n- \uf02d Challenge others' attitudes, ideas and actions.\n- \uf02d Report and communicate risks transparently.\n\nThe target risk culture behaviours are embedded in NatWest Group's Critical People Capabilities and are clearly aligned to the core values of 'serving customers', 'working together', 'doing the right thing' and 'thinking long term'. These act as an effective basis for a strong risk culture because the Critical People Capabilities form the basis of all recruitment and selection processes.\n\n## T Trraaiinniinngg\n\nEnabling employees to have the capabilities and confidence to manage risk is core to NatWest Group's learning strategy. NatWest Group offers a wide range of learning, both technical and behavioural, across the risk disciplines. This training can be mandatory, role-specific or for personal development. Mandatory learning for all staff is focused on keeping employees, customers and NatWest Group safe. This is easily accessed online and is assigned to each person according to their role and business area. The system allows monitoring at all levels to ensure completion.\n\n## O Ouurr  CCooddee\n\nNatWest Group's conduct guidance, Our Code, provides direction on expected behaviour and sets out the standards of conduct that support the values. The code explains the effect of decisions that are taken and describes the principles that must be followed.\n\nThese principles cover conduct-related issues as well as wider business activities. They focus on desired outcomes, with practical guidelines to align the values with commercial strategy and actions. The embedding of these principles facilitates sound decision-making and a clear focus on good customer outcomes.\n\nWhere appropriate, if conduct falls short of NatWest Group's required standards, the accountability review process is used to assess how this should be reflected in pay outcomes for the individuals concerned (for more information on this process refer to page 155). The NatWest Group remuneration policy ensures that the remuneration arrangements for all employees reflect the principles and standards prescribed by the PRA rulebook and the FCA handbook. Any employee falling short of the expected standards would also be subject to internal disciplinary policies and procedures. If appropriate, the relevant authority would be notified.\n\nRisk and capital management",

        "page_content": "## Risk management framework continued\n\n## T Thhrreeee  lliinneess  ooff  ddeeffeennccee\n\nNatWest Group uses the industry-standard three lines of defence model to articulate accountabilities and responsibilities for managing risk. This supports the embedding of effective risk management throughout the organisation. All roles below the CEO sit within one of the three lines. The CEO ensures the efficient use of resources and the effective management of risks as stipulated in the risk management framework and is therefore considered to be outside the three lines of defence principles.\n\n## First line of defence\n\nThe first line of defence incorporates most roles in NatWest Group, including those in the customer-facing franchises, Technology and Services as well as support functions such as Human Resources, Legal and Finance.\n\nThe first line of defence is empowered to take risks within the constraints of the risk management framework and policies as well as the risk appetite statements and measures set by the Board.\n\nThe first line of defence is responsible for managing its direct risks. With the support of specialist functions such as Legal, Human Resources and Technology, it is also responsible for managing its consequential risks by identifying, assessing, mitigating, monitoring and reporting risks.\n\n## Second line of defence\n\nThe second line of defence comprises the Risk function and is independent of the first line.\n\nThe second line of defence is empowered to design and maintain the risk management framework and its components. It undertakes proactive risk oversight and continuous monitoring activities to confirm that NatWest Group engages in permissible and sustainable risk-taking activities.\n\nThe second line of defence advises on, monitors, challenges, approves, escalates and reports on the risk-taking activities of the first line, ensuring that these are within the constraints of the risk management framework and policies as well as the risk appetite statements and measures set by the Board.\n\n## Third line of defence\n\nThe third line of defence is the Internal Audit function and is independent of the first and second lines.\n\nThe third line of defence is responsible for providing independent and objective assurance to the Board, its subsidiary legal entity boards and executive management on the adequacy and effectiveness of key internal controls, governance and the risk management in place to monitor, manage and mitigate the key risks to NatWest Group and its subsidiary companies achieving their objectives.\n\nThe third line of defence executes its duties freely and objectively in accordance with the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors' Code of Ethics and International Standards.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nRisk appetite defines the type and aggregate level of risk NatWest Group is willing to accept in pursuit of its strategic objectives and business plans. Risk appetite supports sound risk taking, the promotion of robust risk practices and risk behaviours, and is calibrated annually.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n192\n\nFor certain principal risks, risk capacity defines the maximum level of risk NatWest Group can assume before breaching constraints determined by regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, the operational environment, and from a conduct perspective. Establishing risk capacity helps determine where risk appetite should be set, ensuring there is a buffer between internal risk appetite and NatWest Group's ultimate capacity to absorb losses.\n\n## R Riisskk  aappppeettiittee  ffrraammeewwoorrkk\n\nThe risk appetite framework supports effective risk management by promoting sound risk-taking through a structured approach, within agreed boundaries. It also ensures emerging risks and risk-taking activities that might be out of appetite are identified, assessed, escalated and addressed in a timely manner.\n\nTo facilitate this, a detailed annual review of the framework is carried out. The review includes:\n\n- \uf02d Assessing the adequacy of the framework when compared to internal and external expectations.\n- \uf02d Assessing the level of embedding of risk appetite across the organisation.\n- \uf02d Ensuring the framework remains effective and acts as a strong control environment for risk appetite.\n\nThe Board approves the risk appetite framework annually.\n\n## E Essttaabblliisshhiinngg  rriisskk  aappppeettiittee\n\nIn line with NatWest Group's risk appetite framework, risk appetite is maintained across NatWest Group through risk appetite statements. These are in place for all principal risks and describe the extent and type of activities that can be undertaken.\n\nRisk appetite statements consist of qualitative statements of appetite supported by risk limits and triggers that operate as a defence against excessive risk-taking. Risk measures and their associated limits are an integral part of the risk appetite approach and a key part of embedding risk appetite in day-today risk management decisions. A clear tolerance for each principal risk is set in alignment with business activities.\n\nThe annual process of reviewing and updating risk appetite statements is completed alongside the business and financial planning process. This ensures that plans and risk appetite are appropriately aligned.\n\nThe Board sets risk appetite for all principal risks to help ensure NatWest Group is well placed to meet its priorities and longterm targets even in challenging economic environments. This supports NatWest Group in remaining resilient and secure as it pursues its strategic business objectives.\n\nNatWest Group's risk profile is frequently reviewed and monitored. Management focus is concentrated on all principal risks as well as the top and emerging risk issues which may correlate to them. Risk profile relative to risk appetite is reported regularly to senior management and the Board.\n\nNatWest Group policies directly support the qualitative aspects of risk appetite. They define the qualitative expectations, guidance and standards that stipulate the nature and extent of permissible risk taking and are consistently applied across NatWest Group and its subsidiaries.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Risk management framework continued Identification and measurement\n\nIdentification and measurement within the risk management process comprises:\n\n- \uf02d Regular assessment of the overall risk profile, incorporating market developments and trends, as well as external and internal factors.\n- \uf02d Assessment of trading and non-trading portfolios.\n- \uf02d Monitoring of the risks associated with lending and credit exposures.\n- \uf02d Review of potential risks in new business activities and processes.\n- \uf02d Analysis of potential risks in any complex and unusual business transactions.\n\nThe financial and non-financial risks that NatWest Group faces are detailed in its Risk Directory. This provides a common risk language to ensure consistent terminology is used across NatWest Group. The Risk Directory is subject to annual review to ensure it continues to fully reflect the risks that NatWest Group faces.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nMitigation is a critical aspect of ensuring that risk profile remains within risk appetite. Risk mitigation strategies are discussed and agreed within NatWest Group.\n\nWhen evaluating possible strategies, costs and benefits, residual risks (risks that are retained) and secondary risks (those that arise from risk mitigation actions themselves) are also considered. Monitoring and review processes are in place to evaluate results. Early identification, and effective management of changes in legislation and regulation are critical to the successful mitigation of compliance and conduct risk. The effects of all changes are managed to ensure the timely achievement of compliance. Those changes assessed as having a high or medium-high impact are managed more closely. Emerging risks that could affect future results and performance are also closely monitored. Action is taken to mitigate potential risks as and when required. Further in-depth analysis, including the stress testing of exposures, is also carried out.\n\n## Testing and monitoring\n\nTargeted risk processes and controls - including controls within the scope of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 - are subject to independent testing and monitoring.\n\nThis activity is carried out to confirm to both internal and external stakeholders - including the Board, senior management, the customer-facing franchises, Internal Audit and NatWest Group's regulators - that such processes and controls are being correctly implemented and operate adequately and effectively. A consistent testing and monitoring methodology is in place across NatWest Group.\n\nTesting and monitoring activity focuses on processes and controls relating to credit risk, financial crime risk, operational resilience, and compliance and conduct risk. However, a range of controls and processes relating to other risk types is also subject to testing and monitoring activity as deemed appropriate within the context of a robust control environment.\n\nThe Risk Testing & Monitoring Forum assesses and validates the annual plan as well as the ongoing programme of reviews.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n193\n\n## Stress testing\n\n## S Sttrreessss  tteessttiinngg  --  ccaappiittaall  mmaannaaggeemmeenntt\n\nStress testing is a key risk management tool and a fundamental component of NatWest Group's approach to capital management. It is used to quantify and evaluate the potential impact of specified changes to risk factors on the financial strength of NatWest Group, including its capital position.\n\nStress testing includes:\n\n- \uf02d Scenario testing, which examines the impact of a hypothetical future state to define changes in risk factors.\n- \uf02d Sensitivity testing, which examines the impact of an incremental change to one or more risk factors.\n\nThe process for stress testing consists of four broad stages:\n\n| Define scenarios             | \uf02d \uf02d \uf02d   | Identify macro and NatWest Group  specific vulnerabilities and risks. Define and calibrate scenarios to  examine risks and vulnerabilities.

        "page_content": "## Risk management framework continued\n\nSpecific areas that involve capital management include:\n\n- \uf02d Strategic financial and capital planning - by assessing the impact of sensitivities and scenarios on the capital plan and capital ratios.\n- \uf02d Risk monitoring - by monitoring the risks and horizon scanning events that could potentially affect NatWest Group's financial strength and capital position.\n- \uf02d Risk appetite - by gaining a better understanding of the drivers of, and the underlying risks associated with, risk appetite.\n- \uf02d Risk mitigation - by identifying actions to mitigate risks, or those that could be taken, in the event of adverse changes to the business or economic environment. Key risk mitigating actions are documented in NatWest Group's recovery plan.\n\nReverse stress testing is also carried out in order to identify circumstances that may lead to specific, defined outcomes such as business failure. Reverse stress testing allows potential vulnerabilities in the business model to be examined more fully.\n\n## Capital sufficiency - going concern forward-looking view\n\nGoing concern capital requirements are examined on a forward-looking basis - including as part of the annual budgeting process - by assessing the resilience of capital adequacy and leverage ratios under hypothetical future states. These assessments include assumptions about regulatory and accounting factors (such as IFRS 9). They incorporate economic variables and key assumptions on balance sheet and P&L drivers, such as impairments, to demonstrate that NatWest Group and its operating subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital. A range of future states are tested. In particular, capital requirements are assessed:\n\n- \uf02d Based on a forecast of future business performance, given expectations of economic and market conditions over the forecast period.\n- \uf02d Based on a forecast of future business performance under adverse economic and market conditions over the forecast period. Scenarios of different severity may be examined.\n\nThe potential impact of normal and adverse economic and market conditions on capital requirements is assessed through stress testing, the results of which are not only used widely across NatWest Group but also by the regulators to set specific capital buffers. NatWest Group takes part in stress tests run by regulatory authorities to test industry-wide vulnerabilities under crystallising global and domestic systemic risks.\n\nStress and peak-to-trough movements are used to help assess the amount of capital NatWest Group needs to hold in stress conditions in accordance with the capital risk appetite framework.\n\n## Internal assessment of capital adequacy\n\nAn internal assessment of material risks is carried out annually to enable an evaluation of the amount, type and distribution of capital required to cover these risks. This is referred to as the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). The ICAAP consists of a point-in-time assessment of exposures and risks at the end of the financial year together with a forwardlooking stress capital assessment. The ICAAP is approved by the Board and submitted to the PRA.\n\nThe ICAAP is used to form a view of capital adequacy separately to the minimum regulatory requirements. The ICAAP is used by the PRA to assess NatWest Group's specific capital requirements through the Pillar 2 framework.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n194\n\n## Capital allocation\n\nNatWest Group has mechanisms to allocate capital across its legal entities and businesses. These aim to optimise the use of capital resources taking into account applicable regulatory requirements, strategic and business objectives and risk appetite. The framework for allocating capital is approved by the CFO with support from the Asset & Liability Management Committee.\n\n## Governance\n\nCapital management is subject to substantial review and governance. The Board approves the capital plans, including those for key legal entities and businesses as well as the results of the stress tests relating to those capital plans.\n\n## S Sttrreessss  tteessttiinngg  --  lliiqquuiiddiittyy\n\n## Liquidity risk monitoring and contingency planning\n\nA suite of tools is used to monitor, limit and stress test the risks on the balance sheet. Limit frameworks are in place to control the level of liquidity risk, asset and liability mismatches and funding concentrations. Liquidity risks are reviewed at significant legal entity and business levels daily, with performance reported to the Asset & Liability Management Committee on a regular basis. Liquidity Condition Indicators are monitored daily. This ensures any build-up of stress is detected early and the response escalated appropriately through recovery planning.\n\n## Internal assessment of liquidity\n\nUnder the liquidity risk management framework, NatWest Group maintains the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process. This includes assessment of net stressed liquidity outflows under a range of severe but plausible stress scenarios. Each scenario evaluates either an idiosyncratic, market-wide or combined stress event as described in the table below.\n\n| Type                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Idiosyncratic  scenario | The market perceives NatWest Group to be  suffering from a severe stress event, which  results in an immediate assumption of  increased credit risk or concerns over  solvency.                                                                                      |\n| Market-wide  scenario   | A market stress event affecting all  participants in a market through contagion,  potential counterparty failure and other  market risks. NatWest Group is affected under  this scenario but no more severely than any  other participants with equivalent exposure. |\n| Combined  scenario      | This scenario models the combined impact of  an idiosyncratic and market stress occurring  at once, severely affecting funding markets  and the liquidity of some assets.                                                                                            |\n\nNatWest Group uses the most severe outcome to set the internal stress testing scenario which underpins its internal liquidity risk appetite. This complements the regulatory liquidity coverage ratio requirement.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Risk management framework continued\n\n## S Sttrreessss  tteessttiinngg  --  rreeccoovveerryy  aanndd  rreessoolluuttiioonn  ppllaannnniinngg\n\nThe NatWest Group recovery plan explains how NatWest Group and its subsidiaries - as a consolidated group - would identify and respond to a financial stress event and restore its financial position so that it remains viable on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe recovery plan ensures risks that could delay the implementation of a recovery strategy are highlighted and preparations are made to minimise the impact of these risks. Preparations include:\n\n- \uf02d Developing a series of recovery indicators to provide early warning of potential stress events.\n- \uf02d Developing a recovery playbook to provide a concise description of the actions required during recovery.\n- \uf02d Clarifying roles, responsibilities and escalation routes to minimise uncertainty or delay.\n- \uf02d Detailing a range of options to address different stress conditions.\n- \uf02d Appointing dedicated option owners to reduce the risk of delay and capacity concerns.\n\nThe plan is intended to enable NatWest Group to maintain critical services and products it provides to its customers, maintain its core business lines and operate within risk appetite while restoring NatWest Group's financial condition. It is assessed for appropriateness on an ongoing basis and is updated annually. The plan is reviewed and approved by the Board prior to submission to the PRA each year. Individual recovery plans are also prepared for NatWest Holdings Limited, NatWest Markets Plc, RBS International (Holdings) Limited, Ulster Bank Ireland DAC and NatWest Markets N.V.. These plans detail the recovery options, recovery indicators and escalation routes for each entity.\n\nFire drill simulations of possible recovery events are used to test the effectiveness of NatWest Group and individual legal entity recovery plans. The fire drills are designed to replicate possible financial stress conditions and allow senior management to rehearse the responses and decisions that may be required in an actual stress event. The results and lessons learnt from the fire drills are used to enhance NatWest Group's approach to recovery planning.\n\nUnder the resolution assessment part of the PRA rulebook, NatWest Group is required to carry out an assessment of its preparations for resolution, submit a report of the assessment to the PRA and publish a summary of this report.\n\nResolution would be implemented if NatWest Group was assessed by the UK authorities to have failed and the appropriate regulator put it into resolution. The process of resolution is owned and implemented by the Bank of England (as the UK resolution authority). A multi-year programme is in place to further develop resolution capability in line with regulatory requirements.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n195\n\n## S Sttrreessss  tteessttiinngg  --  mmaarrkkeett  rriisskk\n\n## Non-traded market risk\n\nNon-traded exposures are reported to the PRA on a quarterly basis. This provides the regulator with an overview of NatWest Group's banking book interest rate exposure. The report includes detailed product information analysed by interest rate driver and other characteristics, including accounting classification, currency and counterparty type.\n\nScenario analysis based on hypothetical adverse scenarios is performed on non-traded exposures as part of the Bank of England and European Banking Authority stress test exercises. NatWest Group also produces an internal scenario analysis as part of its financial planning cycles.\n\nNon-traded exposures are capitalised through the ICAAP. This covers gap risk, basis risk, credit spread risk, pipeline risk, structural foreign exchange risk, prepayment risk, equity risk and accounting volatility risk. The ICAAP is completed with a combination of value and earnings measures. The total nontraded market risk capital requirement is determined by adding the different charges for each sub risk type. The ICAAP methodology captures at least ten years of historical volatility, produced with a 99% confidence level. Methodologies are reviewed by NatWest Group Model Risk and the results are approved by the NatWest Group Technical Asset & Liability Management Committee.\n\nNon-traded market risk stress results are combined with those for other risks into the capital plan presented to the Board. The cross-risk capital planning process is conducted once a year, with a planning horizon of five years. The scenario narratives cover both regulatory scenarios and macroeconomic scenarios identified by NatWest Group.\n\nVulnerability-based stress testing begins with the analysis of a portfolio and expresses its key vulnerabilities in terms of plausible, vulnerability scenarios under which the portfolio would suffer material losses. These scenarios can be historical, macroeconomic or forward-looking/hypothetical. Vulnerabilitybased stress testing is used for internal management information and is not subject to limits. The results for relevant scenarios are reported to senior management.\n\n## Traded market risk\n\nNatWest Group carries out regular market risk stress testing to identify vulnerabilities and potential losses in excess of, or not captured in, value-at-risk. The calculated stresses measure the impact of changes in risk factors on the fair values of the trading portfolios.\n\nNatWest Group conducts historical, macroeconomic and vulnerability-based stress testing. Historical stress testing is a measure that is used for internal management. Using the historical simulation framework employed for value-at-risk, the current portfolio is stressed using historical data since 1 January 2005. This methodology simulates the impact of the 99.9 percentile loss that would be incurred by historical risk factor movements over the period, assuming variable holding periods specific to the risk factors and the businesses.\n\nRisk and capital management",

The results for relevant scenarios are reported to senior management.\n\n## I Inntteerrnnaall  sscceennaarriiooss\n\nDuring 2021, NatWest Group continuously refined and reviewed a series of internal scenarios - benchmarked against the Bank of England's illustrative scenario - as the impact of COVID-19 evolved, including actual and potential effects on economic fundamentals. These scenarios included:\n\n- \uf02d The impact of travel restrictions, social distancing policies, self-isolation and sickness on GDP, employment and consumer spending.\n- \uf02d The effect on house prices, commercial real estate values and major project finance.\n- \uf02d The impacts on business investment in critical sectors.\n- \uf02d The effect of government interventions such as the Job Retention Scheme and the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme.\n\nApplying the macro-scenarios to NatWest Group's earnings, capital, liquidity and funding positions did not result in a breach of any regulatory thresholds.\n\nInternal scenarios were also used to assess the potential impacts of severe weather events on NatWest Group's operations in the UK and India.\n\n## R Reegguullaattoorryy  ssttrreessss  tteessttiinngg\n\nIn 2021, NatWest Group participated in the regulatory stress tests conducted by the Bank of England following their suspension in 2020 as a result of COVID-19. The scenario was hypothetical in nature and does not represent a forecast of NatWest Group's future business or profitability. The results of regulatory stress tests are carefully assessed and form part of the wider risk management of NatWest Group. Following the UK's exit from the European Union on 31 December 2020, only relevant European subsidiaries of NatWest Group will take part in the European Banking Authority stress tests going forward. NatWest Group itself will not participate.\n\n## Bank of England stress test\n\nDesigned to assess the resilience of major UK banks to reasonable worst-case stress in the current environment. The severity of the test is related to policymakers' assessments of risk levels across markets and regions.\n\nThe 2021 stress test assessed the impact of a severe economic path from 2021 to 2025 on top of the economic shocks arising from the pandemic. The scenario implied a cumulative three-year loss of 37% of 2019 UK GDP and 31% of 2019 global GDP with the UK's trading partners experiencing severe and synchronised slowdowns, a decline in equity prices and a rise in bond spreads. The scenario also included a 33% fall in UK residential property prices and a rise in UK unemployment of 5.6 percentage points to peak at 11.9%.\n\nThe stress was based on an end-of-2020 balance sheet starting position.\n\nUnder the 2021 Bank of England solvency stress test, on an IFRS 9 transitional basis, the CET1 ratio reached a low point of 10.4%. This was above the reference rate of 7%.\n\nTier 1 leverage ratio was projected to be 4.4% under stress. This was above the reference rate of 3.6%\n\nOn an IFRS 9 non-transitional basis, the CET1 ratio reached a low point of 10.3%. This was above the reference rate of 7%.  Tier 1 leverage ratio was projected to be 4.4% under stress.  This was above the reference rate of 3.6%\n\nThe 2021 Bank of England solvency stress result demonstrated that the balance sheet continues to be robust with a strong capital position.\n\n## Scenario\n\n## Results\n\n## What does this mean?\n\nNatWest Group also took part in the Bank of England's Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES). This exercise was designed to assess the resilience of the largest UK banks and insurers to the physical and transition risks associated with climate change. The CBES used three 30-year scenarios to explore the risks - Early Action (in which the transition to a net-zero emissions economy gets underway with carbon taxes and associated policies intensifying gradually), Late Action (in which the transition is delayed until 2031, with a sudden increase in the intensity of carbon taxes and climate policy leading to a recession) and No Additional Action (in which no new climate policies are introduced and the physical impacts of climate change are most severe). The Bank of England is expected to publish aggregate findings in 2022 though, given the exploratory nature of the exercise, it will not use CBES to set capital requirements.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n196\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Credit risk\n\n## Definition (audited)\n\nCredit risk is the risk that customers and counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligation to settle outstanding amounts.\n\n## Sources of risk (audited)\n\nThe principal sources of credit risk for NatWest Group are lending, off-balance sheet products, derivatives and securities financing, and debt securities. NatWest Group is also exposed to settlement risk through foreign exchange, trade finance and payments activities.\n\n## Key developments in 2021\n\n- \uf02d The outlook for credit risk and asset quality improved during 2021 with the economic recovery from the disruption caused by COVID-19 being faster than initially forecast.\n- \uf02d In Personal, lending criteria and underwriting standards, which had been tightened during 2020 in response to COVID-19, were selectively relaxed as economic conditions improved and portfolio performance stabilised following the conclusion of payment holidays.\n- \uf02d The overall expected credit loss (ECL) decreased materially as a result, with lower than expected defaults and exposures moving from Stage 2 into Stage 1. Stage 3 ECL charges remained low, reflecting the effect of government support schemes mitigating against defaults.\n- \uf02d In Wholesale, sector specific risk appetite continued to be closely monitored and appropriately adjusted during the year for those sectors most affected by COVID-19.  As in Personal, a selective relaxation of lending criteria and underwriting standards was possible as economic conditions improved and portfolio performance stabilised.\n- \uf02d NatWest Group continued to progress embedding climate change considerations in credit assessment and monitoring, including scenario analysis to assess the materiality of climate change risks. For further information refer to the 2021 Climate-related disclosures report.\n\n## Governance (audited)\n\nThe Credit Risk function provides oversight and challenge of frontline credit risk management activities.\n\nGovernance activities include:\n\n- \uf02d Defining credit risk appetite measures for the management of concentration risk and credit policy to establish the key causes of risk in the process of providing credit and the controls that must be in place to mitigate them.\n- \uf02d Oversight of the first line of defence to ensure that credit risk remains within the appetite set by the Board and that controls are being operated adequately and effectively.\n- \uf02d Approving and monitoring operational limits for business segments and credit limits for customers.\n- \uf02d Assessing the adequacy of ECL provisions including approving key IFRS 9 inputs (such as significant increase in credit risk (SICR) thresholds) and any necessary in-model and post model adjustments through NatWest Group and business unit provisions and model committees.\n- \uf02d Development and approval of credit grading models.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nCredit risk appetite aligns to the strategic risk appetite set by the Board and is set and monitored through risk appetite frameworks tailored to NatWest Group's Personal and Wholesale segments.\n\n## P Peerrssoonnaall\n\nThe Personal credit risk appetite framework sets limits that control the quality and concentration of both existing and new business for each relevant business segment.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n197\n\nThese risk appetite measures consider the segments' ability to grow sustainably and the level of losses expected under stress. Credit risk is further controlled through operational limits specific to customer or product characteristics.\n\n## W Whhoolleessaallee\n\nFor Wholesale credit, the framework has been designed to reflect factors that influence the ability to operate within risk appetite. Tools such as stress testing and economic capital are used to measure credit risk volatility and develop links between the framework and risk appetite limits.\n\nFour formal frameworks are used, classifying, measuring and monitoring credit risk exposure across single name, sector and country concentrations and product and asset classes with heightened risk characteristics.\n\nThe framework is supported by a suite of transactional acceptance standards that set out the risk parameters within which businesses should operate.\n\nCredit policy standards are in place for both the Wholesale and Personal portfolios. They are expressed as a set of mandatory controls.\n\n## Identification and measurement\n\n## C Crreeddiitt  sstteewwaarrddsshhiipp (audited)\n\nRisks are identified through relationship management and credit stewardship of customers and portfolios. Credit risk stewardship takes place throughout the customer relationship, beginning with the initial approval. It includes the application of credit assessment standards, credit risk mitigation and collateral, ensuring that credit documentation is complete and appropriate, carrying out regular portfolio or customer reviews and problem debt identification and management.\n\n## A Asssseett  qquuaalliittyy (audited)\n\nAll credit grades map to an asset quality (AQ) scale, used for financial reporting. This AQ scale is based on Basel probability of defaults. Performing loans are defined as AQ1-AQ9 (where the probability of default (PD) is less than 100%) and defaulted non-performing loans as AQ10 or Stage 3 under IFRS 9 (where the PD is 100%). Loans are defined as defaulted when the payment status becomes 90 days past due, or earlier if there is clear evidence that the borrower is unlikely to repay, for example bankruptcy or insolvency.\n\n## C Coouunntteerrppaarrttyy  ccrreeddiitt  rriisskk\n\nCounterparty credit risk arises from the obligations of customers under derivative and securities financing transactions.\n\nNatWest Group mitigates counterparty credit risk through collateralisation and netting agreements, which allow amounts owed by NatWest Group to a counterparty to be netted against amounts the counterparty owes NatWest Group.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nMitigation techniques, as set out in the appropriate credit policies and transactional acceptance standards, are used in the management of credit portfolios across NatWest Group. These techniques mitigate credit concentrations in relation to an individual customer, a borrower group or a collection of related borrowers. Where possible, customer credit balances are netted against obligations. Mitigation tools can include structuring a security interest in a physical or financial asset, the use of credit derivatives including credit default swaps, credit-linked debt instruments and securitisation structures, and the use of guarantees and similar instruments (for example, credit insurance) from related and third parties.\n\nRisk and capital management",

NatWest Group values residential property individually during the loan underwriting process, either by obtaining an appraisal by a suitably qualified appraiser (for example, Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS)) or using a statistically valid model. In both cases, a sample of the valuation outputs are periodically reviewed by an independent RICS qualified appraiser. NatWest Group updates residential property values quarterly using the relevant residential property index namely:\n\n| Region                           | Index used                                                  |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| UK (including  Northern Ireland) | Office for National Statistics House  Price Index           |\n| Republic of Ireland              | Central Statistics Office Residential  Property Price Index |\n\nThe current indexed value of the property is a component of the ECL provisioning calculation.\n\nCommercial real estate valuations - NatWest Group has an actively managed panel of chartered surveying firms that cover the spectrum of geography and property sectors in which NatWest Group takes collateral. Suitable RICS registered valuers for particular assets are typically contracted through a service agreement to ensure consistency of quality and advice. Valuations are generally commissioned when an asset is taken as security; a material increase in a facility is requested; or a default event is anticipated or has occurred. In the UK, an independent third-party market indexation is applied to update external valuations once they are more than a year old and every three years, a formal independent valuation review is commissioned. In the Republic of Ireland, assets are revalued in line with the Central Bank of Ireland threshold requirements, which permits indexation for lower value residential assets, but demands regular valuations for higher value assets.\n\n## Assessment and monitoring\n\nPractices for credit stewardship - including credit assessment, approval and monitoring as well as the identification and management of problem debts - differ between the Personal and Wholesale portfolios.\n\n## P Peerrssoonnaall\n\nPersonal customers are served through a lending approach that entails offering a large number of small-value loans. To ensure that these lending decisions are made consistently, NatWest Group analyses internal credit information as well as external data supplied by credit reference agencies (including historical debt servicing behaviour of customers with respect to both NatWest Group and other lenders). NatWest Group then sets its lending rules accordingly, developing different rules for different products.\n\nThe process is then largely automated, with each customer receiving an individual credit score that reflects both internal and external behaviours and this score is compared with the lending rules set. For relatively high-value, complex personal loans, including some residential mortgage lending, specialist credit managers make the final lending decisions. These decisions are made within specified delegated authority limits that are issued dependent on the experience of the individual.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n198\n\nUnderwriting standards and portfolio performance are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain adequate in the current market environment and are not weakened materially to sustain growth. The actual performance of each portfolio is tracked relative to operational limits. The limits apply to a range of credit risk-related measures including projected credit default rates across products and the loan-tovalue (LTV) ratio of the mortgage portfolios. Where operational limits identify areas of concern management action is taken to adjust credit or business strategy.\n\n## W Whhoolleessaallee\n\nWholesale customers - including corporates, banks and other financial institutions - are grouped by industry sectors and geography as well as by product/asset class and are managed on an individual basis. Customers are aggregated as a single risk when sufficiently interconnected.\n\nA credit assessment is carried out before credit facilities are made available to customers. The assessment process is dependent on the complexity of the transaction. Credit approvals are subject to environmental, social and governance risk policies which restrict exposure to certain highly carbon intensive industries as well as those with potentially heightened reputational impacts. Customer specific climate risk commentary is now mandatory.\n\nIn response to COVID-19, a new framework was introduced to categorise clients in a consistent manner across the Wholesale portfolio, based on the effect of COVID-19 on their financial position and outlook in relation to the sector risk appetite. This framework has been retained and updated to consider viability impacts beyond those directly related to COVID-19 and classification via the framework is now mandatory and must be refreshed annually. The framework extends to all Wholesale borrowing customers and supplements the Risk of Credit Loss framework in assessing whether customers exhibit a SICR, if support is considered to be granting forbearance and the time it would take for customers to return to operating within transactional acceptance standards. Tailored approaches were also introduced for business banking, commercial real estate and financial institution customers.\n\nFor lower risk transactions below specific thresholds, credit decisions can be approved through self-sanctioning within the business. This process is facilitated through an auto-decision making system, which utilises scorecards, strategies and policy rules. Such credit decisions must be within the approval authority of the relevant business approver.\n\nFor all other transactions, credit is only granted to customers following joint approval by an approver from the business and the credit risk function or by two credit officers. The joint business and credit approvers act within a delegated approval authority under the Wholesale Credit Authorities Framework Policy. The level of delegated authority held by approvers is dependent on their experience and expertise with only a small number of senior executives holding the highest approval authority. Both business and credit approvers are accountable for the quality of each decision taken, although the credit risk approver holds ultimate sanctioning authority.\n\nTransactional acceptance standards provide detailed transactional lending and risk acceptance metrics and structuring guidance. As such, these standards provide a mechanism to manage risk appetite at the customer/transaction level and are supplementary to the established credit risk appetite.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Credit risk continued\n\nCredit grades (PD) and loss given default (LGD) are reviewed and if appropriate reapproved annually. The review process assesses borrower performance, including reconfirmation or adjustment of risk parameter estimates; the adequacy of security; compliance with terms and conditions; and refinancing risk.\n\n## Problem debt management\n\n## P Peerrssoonnaall\n\n## Early problem identification\n\nPre-emptive triggers are in place to help identify customers that may be at risk of being in financial difficulty. These triggers are both internal, using NatWest Group data, and external using information from credit reference agencies. Proactive contact is then made with the customer to establish if they require help with managing their finances. By adopting this approach, the aim is to prevent a customer's financial position deteriorating which may then require intervention from the Collections and Recoveries teams.\n\nPersonal customers experiencing financial difficulty are managed by the Collections team. If the Collections team is unable to provide appropriate support after discussing suitable options with the customer, management of that customer moves to the Recoveries team. If at any point in the collections and recoveries process, the customer is identified as being potentially vulnerable, the customer will be separated from the regular process and supported by a specialist team to ensure the customer receives appropriate support for their circumstances.\n\n## Collections\n\nWhen a customer exceeds an agreed limit or misses a regular monthly payment the customer is contacted by NatWest Group and requested to remedy the position. If the situation is not regularised then, where appropriate, the Collections team will become more involved and the customer will be supported by skilled debt management staff who endeavour to provide customers with bespoke solutions. Solutions include short-term account restructuring, refinance loans and forbearance which can include interest suspension and 'breathing space'. In the event that an affordable/sustainable agreement with a customer cannot be reached, the debt will transition to the Recoveries team. For provisioning purposes, under IFRS 9, exposure to customers managed by the Collections team is categorised as Stage 2 and subject to a lifetime loss assessment, unless it is 90 days past due or has an interest non-accrual status, in which case it is categorised as Stage 3.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the relationship may pass to a specialist support team prior to any transfer to recoveries, depending on the outcome of customer financial assessment.\n\n## Recoveries\n\nThe Recoveries team will issue a notice of intention to default to the customer and, if appropriate, a formal demand, while also registering the account with credit reference agencies where appropriate. Following this, the customer's debt may then be placed with a third-party debt collection agency, or alternatively a solicitor, in order to agree an affordable repayment plan with the customer. An option that may also be considered, is the sale of unsecured debt. Exposures subject to formal debt recovery are defaulted and, under IFRS 9, categorised as Stage 3.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n199\n\n## W Whhoolleessaallee\n\n## Early problem identification\n\nEach segment and sector have defined early warning indicators to identify customers experiencing financial difficulty, and to increase monitoring if needed. Early warning indicators may be internal, such as a customer's bank account activity, or external, such as a publicly-listed customer's share price. If early warning indicators show a customer is experiencing potential or actual difficulty, or if relationship managers or credit officers identify other signs of financial difficulty, they may decide to classify the customer within the Risk of Credit Loss framework.\n\n## Risk of Credit Loss framework\n\nThe framework focuses on Wholesale customers whose credit profiles have deteriorated materially since origination. Expert judgment is applied by experienced credit risk officers to classify cases into categories that reflect progressively deteriorating credit risk to NatWest Group. There are two classifications in the framework that apply to non-defaulted customers - Heightened Monitoring and Risk of Credit Loss. For the purposes of provisioning, all exposures subject to the framework are categorised as Stage 2 and subject to a lifetime loss assessment. The framework also applies to those customers that have met NatWest Group's default criteria (AQ10 exposures). Defaulted exposures are categorised as Stage 3 impaired for provisioning purposes.\n\nHeightened Monitoring customers are performing customers that have met certain characteristics, which have led to significant credit deterioration. Collectively, characteristics reflect circumstances that may affect the customer's ability to meet repayment obligations. Characteristics include trading issues, covenant breaches, material PD downgrades and past due facilities.\n\nHeightened Monitoring customers require pre-emptive actions (outside the customer's normal trading patterns) to return or maintain their facilities within NatWest Group's current risk appetite prior to maturity.\n\nRisk of Credit Loss customers are performing customers that have met the criteria for Heightened Monitoring and also pose a risk of credit loss to NatWest Group in the next 12 months should mitigating action not be taken or not be successful.\n\nOnce classified as either Heightened Monitoring or Risk of Credit Loss, a number of mandatory actions are taken in accordance with policies. Actions include a review of the customer's credit grade, facility and security documentation and the valuation of security. Depending on the severity of the financial difficulty and the size of the exposure, the customer relationship strategy is reassessed by credit officers, by specialist credit risk or relationship management units in the relevant business, or by Restructuring.\n\nAgreed customer management strategies are regularly monitored by both the business and credit teams. The largest Risk of Credit Loss exposures are regularly reviewed by a Risk of Credit Loss forum. The forum members are experienced credit, business and restructuring specialists. The purpose of the forum is to review and challenge the strategies undertaken for customers that pose the largest risk of credit loss to NatWest Group.\n\nRisk and capital management",

        "page_content": "## Credit risk continued\n\nAppropriate corrective action is taken when circumstances emerge that may affect the customer's ability to service its debt (refer to Heightened Monitoring characteristics). Corrective actions may include granting a customer various types of concessions. Any decision to approve a concession will be a function of specific appetite, the credit quality of the customer, the market environment and the loan structure and security. All customers granted forbearance are classified Heightened Monitoring as a minimum.\n\nOther potential outcomes of the relationship review are to: remove the customer from the Risk of Credit Loss framework, offer additional lending and continue monitoring, transfer the relationship to Restructuring if appropriate, or exit the relationship.\n\nThe Risk of Credit Loss framework does not apply to problem debt management for business banking customers. These customers are, where necessary, managed by specialist problem debt management teams, depending on the size of exposure or by the business banking recoveries team where a loan has been impaired.\n\n## Restructuring\n\nWhere customers are categorised as Risk of Credit Loss and the lending exposure is above \u00a31 million, relationships are supported by the Restructuring team. The objective of Restructuring is to protect NatWest Group's capital. Restructuring does this by working with corporate and commercial customers in financial difficulty to help them understand their options and how their restructuring or repayment strategies can be delivered. Helping the customer return to financial health and restoring a normal banking relationship is always the preferred outcome, however, where a solvent outcome is not possible, insolvency may be considered as a last resort.\n\nRestructuring will always aim to recover capital fairly and efficiently.  Throughout Restructuring's involvement, the mainstream relationship manager will remain an integral part of the customer relationship. Restructuring's work helps NatWest Group remain safe and sustainable, contributing to its ability to champion potential.\n\n## Forbearance (audited)\n\nForbearance takes place when a concession is made on the contractual terms of a loan/debt in response to a customer's financial difficulties.\n\nThe aim of forbearance is to support and restore the customer to financial health while minimising risk. To ensure that forbearance is appropriate for the needs of the customer, minimum standards are applied when assessing, recording, monitoring and reporting forbearance.\n\nA credit exposure may be forborne more than once, generally where a temporary concession has been granted and circumstances warrant another temporary or permanent revision of the loan's terms.\n\nLoans are reported as forborne until they meet the exit criteria as detailed in the appropriate regulatory guidance. These include being classified as performing for two years since the last forbearance event, making regular repayments and the loan/debt being less than 30 days past due.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n200\n\n## T Tyyppeess  ooff  ffoorrbbeeaarraannccee\n\n## Personal\n\nIn the Personal portfolio, forbearance may involve payment concessions and loan rescheduling (including extensions in contractual maturity), capitalisation of arrears and, in the Republic of Ireland only, temporary interest-only or partial capital and interest arrangements. Forbearance support is provided for both mortgages and unsecured lending.\n\n## Wholesale\n\nIn the Wholesale portfolio, forbearance may involve covenant waivers, amendments to margins, payment concessions and loan rescheduling (including extensions in contractual maturity), capitalisation of arrears, and debt forgiveness or debt-forequity swaps.\n\n## M Moonniittoorriinngg  ooff  ffoorrbbeeaarraannccee\n\nPersonal\n\nFor Personal portfolios, forborne loans are separated and regularly monitored and reported while the forbearance strategy is implemented, until they exit forbearance.\n\n## Wholesale\n\nIn the Wholesale portfolio, customer PDs and facility LGDs are reassessed prior to finalising any forbearance arrangement. The ultimate outcome of a forbearance strategy is highly dependent on the co-operation of the borrower and a viable business or repayment outcome. Where forbearance is no longer appropriate, NatWest Group will consider other options such as the enforcement of security, insolvency proceedings or both, although these are options of last resort.\n\nProvisioning requirements on forbearance are detailed in the Provisioning for forbearance section.\n\n## C Crreeddiitt  ggrraaddiinngg  mmooddeellss\n\nCredit grading models is the collective term used to describe all models, frameworks and methodologies used to calculate PD, exposure at default (EAD), LGD, maturity and the production of credit grades.\n\nCredit grading models are designed to provide:\n\n- \uf02d An assessment of customer and transaction characteristics.\n- \uf02d A meaningful differentiation of credit risk.\n- \uf02d Accurate internal default rate, loss and exposure estimates that are used in the capital calculation or wider risk management purposes.\n\n## Impairment, provisioning and write-offs (audited)\n\nIn the overall assessment of credit risk, impairment provisioning and write-offs are used as key indicators of credit quality.\n\nNatWest Group's IFRS 9 provisioning models, which use existing Basel models as a starting point, incorporate term structures and forward-looking information. Regulatory conservatism within the Basel models has been removed as appropriate to comply with the IFRS 9 requirement for unbiased ECL estimates.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Credit risk continued\n\nFive key areas may materially influence the measurement of credit impairment under IFRS 9 - two of these relate to model build and three relate to model application:\n\n## Model build:\n\n- \uf02d The determination of economic indicators that have most influence on credit loss for each portfolio and the severity of impact (this leverages existing stress testing models which are reviewed annually).\n- \uf02d The build of term structures to extend the determination of the risk of loss beyond 12 months that will influence the impact of lifetime loss for exposures in Stage 2.\n\n## Model application:\n\n- \uf02d The assessment of the SICR and the formation of a framework capable of consistent application.\n- \uf02d The choice of forward-looking economic scenarios and their respective probability weights.\n- \uf02d The determination of asset lifetimes that reflect behavioural characteristics while also representing management actions and processes (using historical data and experience).\n\nRefer to Accounting policy 11 for further details.\n\n## I IFFRRSS  99  EECCLL  mmooddeell  ddeessiiggnn  pprriinncciipplleess (audited)\n\nModelling of ECL for IFRS 9 follows the conventional approach to divide the estimation of credit losses into its component parts of PD, LGD and EAD.\n\nTo meet IFRS 9 requirements, the PD, LGD and EAD parameters differ from their Pillar 1 internal ratings based counterparts in the following aspects:\n\n- \uf02d Unbiased - material regulatory conservatism has been removed from IFRS 9 parameters to produce unbiased estimates.\n- \uf02d Forward-looking - IFRS 9 PD estimates and, where appropriate, EAD and LGD estimates reflect forwardlooking economic conditions.\n- \uf02d Point-in-time - IFRS 9 parameters reflect actual economic conditions at the reporting date instead of long-run average or downturn conditions.\n- \uf02d Lifetime measurement - IFRS 9 PD, LGD and EAD are provided as multi-period term structures up to exposure lifetimes instead of over a fixed one-year horizon.\n\nIFRS 9 requires that at each reporting date, an entity shall assess whether the credit risk on an account has increased significantly since initial recognition. Part of this assessment requires a comparison to be made between the current lifetime PD (i.e. the PD over the remaining lifetime at the reporting date) and the equivalent lifetime PD as determined at the date of initial recognition.\n\nFor assets originated before IFRS 9 was introduced, comparable lifetime origination PDs did not exist. These have been retrospectively created using the relevant model inputs applicable at initial recognition.\n\n## P PDD  eessttiimmaatteess\n\n## Personal models\n\nPersonal PD models use the Exogenous, Maturity and Vintage (EMV) approach to model default rates. The EMV approach separates portfolio default risk trends into three components: vintage effects (quality of new business over time), maturity effects (changes in risk relating to time on book) and exogenous effects (changes in risk relating to changes in\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n201\n\nmacro-economic conditions). The EMV methodology has been widely adopted across the industry because it enables forwardlooking economic information to be systematically incorporated into PD estimates.\n\n## Wholesale models\n\nWholesale PD models use a point-in-time/through-the-cycle framework to convert one-year regulatory PDs into point-intime estimates that reflect economic conditions at the reporting date. The framework utilises credit cycle indices (CCIs) for a comprehensive set of region/industry segments. Further detail on CCIs is provided in the Economic loss drivers section.\n\nOne year point-in-time PDs are extended to forward-looking lifetime PDs using a conditional transition matrix approach and a set of econometric forecasting models.\n\n## L LGGDD  eessttiimmaatteess\n\nThe general approach for the IFRS 9 LGD models is to leverage corresponding Basel LGD models with bespoke adjustments to ensure estimates are unbiased and, where relevant, forwardlooking.\n\n## Personal\n\nForward-looking information has only been incorporated for the secured portfolios, where changes in property prices can be readily accommodated. Analysis has shown minimal impact of economic conditions on LGDs for the other Personal portfolios.\n\n## Wholesale\n\nForward-looking economic information is incorporated into LGD estimates using the existing CCI framework. For low default portfolios, including sovereigns and banks, loss data is too scarce to substantiate estimates that vary with economic conditions. Consequently, for these portfolios, LGD estimates are assumed to be constant throughout the projection horizon.\n\n## E EAADD  eessttiimmaatteess\n\n## Personal\n\nThe IFRS 9 Personal modelling approach for EAD is dependent on product type.\n\n- \uf02d Revolving products use the existing Basel models as a basis, with appropriate adjustments incorporating a term structure based on time to default.\n- \uf02d There is no EAD model for Personal loans. Instead, debt flow (i.e. combined PD x EAD) is modelled directly.\n- \uf02d Amortising products use an amortising schedule, where a formula is used to calculate the expected balance based on remaining terms and interest rates.\n\nAnalysis has indicated that there is minimal impact on EAD arising from changes in the economy for all Personal portfolios except mortgages. Therefore, forward-looking information is only incorporated in the mortgage EAD model (through forecast changes in interest rates).\n\n## Wholesale\n\nFor Wholesale, EAD values are projected using product specific credit conversion factors (CCFs), closely following the product segmentation and approach of the respective Basel model. However, the CCFs are estimated over multi-year time horizons and contain no regulatory conservatism or downturn assumptions.\n\nNo explicit forward-looking information is incorporated, on the basis of analysis showing the temporal variation in CCFs is mainly attributable to changes in exposure management practices rather than economic conditions.\n\nRisk and capital management",

This reflected management's continued judgment that the implied ECL decreases that continued to manifest themselves through the standard PD model monitoring process during the year, were not fully supportable. Management retained this view on the basis that underlying portfolio performance is believed to be underpinned by government support schemes and further outcome data is required on the level of default suppression.\n\n- \uf02d Economic uncertainty - ECL adjustments primarily arising from uncertainties associated with multiple economic scenarios (also for 2020) and credit outcomes as a result of the effect of COVID-19 and the consequences of government support schemes. In both cases, management judged that additional ECL was required until further credit performance data became available on the behavioural and loss consequences of COVID-19.\n- \uf02d Other adjustments - ECL adjustments where it was judged that the modelled ECL required to be amended.\n\nPost model adjustments will remain a key focus area of NatWest Group's ongoing ECL adequacy assessment process. A holistic framework has been established including reviewing a range of economic data, external benchmark information and portfolio performance trends, particularly with more observable outcomes from the unwinding of COVID-19 support schemes. A key part of the assessment is also understanding the current levels of ECL coverage (portfolio by portfolio) against preCOVID-19 levels, recognising changes in franchise portfolio/sector mix.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Credit risk continued\n\nThe post model adjustment for economic uncertainty remained elevated at \u00a3159 million.

In addition, NatWest Group continued to retain a holdback of a modelled ECL release of \u00a369 million, again due to the delayed default emergence reflective of the various customer support schemes (\u00a315 million related to mortgages and \u00a354 million related to unsecured lending). The year end overlay position also included an ECL uplift on buy-tolet mortgages of \u00a312 million to mitigate the risk of a disproportionate credit deterioration in challenging economic circumstances.\n\nOther judgmental overlays increased due to the introduction of a new post model adjustment of \u00a314 million to capture the impact of potential cladding risk in the portfolio.\n\nCommercial Banking - The post model adjustment for economic uncertainty reduced from \u00a3526 million to \u00a3373 million during the year. It included an overlay of \u00a3328 million (\u00a3360 million across NatWest Group's Wholesale portfolio) reflecting continued concern that the unprecedented nature of COVID-19 might indicate that default level may be higher in future periods above that currently expected. In addition, it reflected a risk that government support schemes during COVID-19 could have suppressed defaults that may materialise in future periods above expected default levels. The reduction during the year was mainly due to a sustained improvement in underlying credit metrics which resulted in a decrease in Stage 2 assets and reduced levels of uncertainty around economic outcome. The post model adjustment also included an overlay of \u00a37 million in respect of elevated concerns around borrowers' ability to refinance facilities at the end of the contractual term.\n\nThe post model adjustment for deferred model calibrations on the business banking portfolio increased to \u00a362 million during the year. This reflected management's judgment that the continued beneficial modelling impact, and implied ECL decrease, remained unsupportable while portfolio performance was being underpinned by the various support schemes.\n\nOther adjustments included an overlay of \u00a32 million to mitigate the effect of operational timing delays in the identification and flagging of a SICR. This reduced from \u00a319 million at 31 December 2020, mainly as a result of a significantly reduced Stage 2 population and lower defaults across the portfolio.\n\nUlster Bank RoI - Similar to Commercial Banking, the post model adjustment for economic uncertainty included an adjustment of \u00a312 million reflecting concerns that the unprecedented nature of COVID-19 could result in longer debt recovery periods and lower values than history suggested. It also included an adjustment of \u00a39 million deferring the benefits of improvements in economic forecasts given ongoing uncertainty as well as an adjustment of \u00a39 million in the SME portfolio, reflective of the elevated risk for this sector. Other judgmental overlays increased to \u00a3156 million from \u00a326 million reflected management opinion that continuing actions on the phased withdrawal of Ulster Bank RoI from the Irish market will lead to higher, and/or earlier, crystallisation of losses.\n\nOther - The post model adjustments held in other businesses were for similar reasons as those described above.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n203\n\n## Significant increase in credit risk (SICR) (audited)\n\nExposures that are considered significantly credit deteriorated since initial recognition are classified in Stage 2 and assessed for lifetime ECL measurement (exposures not considered deteriorated carry a 12 month ECL). NatWest Group has adopted a framework to identify deterioration based primarily on relative movements in lifetime PD supported by additional qualitative backstops. The principles applied are consistent across NatWest Group and align to credit risk management practices, where appropriate.\n\nThe framework comprises the following elements:\n\n- \uf02d IFRS 9 lifetime PD assessment (the primary driver) - on modelled portfolios, the assessment is based on the relative deterioration in forward-looking lifetime PD and is assessed monthly. To assess whether credit deterioration has occurred, the residual lifetime PD at balance sheet date (which PD is established at date of initial recognition (DOIR)) is compared to the current PD. If the current lifetime PD exceeds the residual origination PD by more than a threshold amount, deterioration is assumed to have occurred and the exposure transferred into Stage 2 for a lifetime loss assessment. For Wholesale, a doubling of PD would indicate a SICR subject to a minimum PD uplift of 0.1%. For Personal portfolios, the criteria vary by risk band, with lower risk exposures needing to deteriorate more than higher risk exposures, as outlined in the following table:\n\n| Personal  risk bands   | PD bandings (based  on residual lifetime PD calculated at  DOIR)   | PD deterioration  threshold criteria   |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Risk band A            | <0.762%                                                            | PD@DOIR + 1%                           |\n| Risk band B            | <4.306%                                                            | PD@DOIR + 3%                           |\n| Risk band C            | >=4.306%                                                           | 1.7 x PD@DOIR                          |\n\n- \uf02d Qualitative high-risk backstops - the PD assessment is complemented with the use of qualitative high-risk backstops to further inform whether significant deterioration in lifetime risk of default has occurred. The qualitative high-risk backstop assessment includes the use of the mandatory 30+ days past due backstop, as prescribed by IFRS 9 guidance, and other features such as forbearance support, Wholesale exposures managed within the Risk of Credit Loss framework, and adverse credit bureau results for Personal customers. Where a Personal customer was granted a payment holiday (also referred to as a payment deferral) in response to COVID-19, they were not automatically transferred into Stage 2. However, a subset of Personal customers who had accessed payment holiday support, and where their risk profile was identified as relatively high risk, were collectively migrated to Stage 2 (if not in Stage 2 already). Any support provided beyond completion of the second payment holiday was considered forbearance.\n- \uf02d Persistence (Personal and business banking customers only) - the persistence rule ensures that accounts which have met the criteria for PD driven deterioration are still considered to be significantly deteriorated for three months thereafter. This additional rule enhances the timeliness of capture in Stage 2. The persistence rule is applied to PD driven deterioration only.\n\nRisk and capital management",

        "page_content": "## Credit risk continued\n\nThe criteria are based on a significant amount of empirical analysis and seek to meet three key objectives:\n\n- \uf02d Criteria effectiveness - the criteria should be effective in identifying significant credit deterioration and prospective default population.\n- \uf02d Portfolio analysis - the criteria should produce results which are intuitive when reported as part of the wider credit portfolio.\n- \uf02d Stage 2 stability - the criteria should not introduce unnecessary volatility in the Stage 2 population.\n\n## Provisioning for forbearance (audited)\n\n## P Peerrssoonnaall\n\nThe methodology used for provisioning in respect of Personal forborne loans will differ depending on whether the loans are performing or non-performing and which business is managing them due to local market conditions.\n\nGranting forbearance will only change the arrears status of the loan in specific circumstances, which can include capitalisation of principal and interest in arrears, where the loan may be returned to the performing book if the customer has demonstrated an ability to meet regular payments and is likely to continue to do so.\n\nThe loan would continue to be reported as forborne until it meets the exit criteria set out by the appropriate regulatory guidance.\n\nAdditionally, for some forbearance types, a loan may be transferred to the performing book if a customer makes payments that reduce loan arrears below 90 days (Retail Banking collections function).\n\nFor ECL provisioning, all forborne but performing exposures are categorised as Stage 2 and are subject to a lifetime loss provisioning assessment. Where the forbearance treatment includes the cessation of interest on the customer balance (i.e. non-accrual), this will be treated as a Stage 3 default.\n\nFor non-performing forborne loans, the Stage 3 loss assessment process is the same as for non-forborne loans.\n\nIn the absence of any other forbearance or SICR triggers, customers granted COVID-19 related payment holidays were not considered forborne. However, any support provided beyond completion of a second payment holiday is considered forbearance.\n\n## W Whhoolleessaallee\n\nProvisions for forborne loans are assessed in accordance with normal provisioning policies. The customer's financial position and prospects - as well as the likely effect of the forbearance, including any concessions granted, and revised PD or LGD gradings - are considered in order to establish whether an impairment provision increase is required.\n\nWholesale loans granted forbearance are individually credit assessed in most cases. Performing loans subject to forbearance treatment are categorised as Stage 2 and subject to a lifetime loss assessment.\n\nForbearance may result in the value of the outstanding debt exceeding the present value of the estimated future cash flows. This difference will lead to a customer being classified as nonperforming.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n204\n\nIn the case of non-performing forborne loans, an individual loan impairment provision assessment generally takes place prior to forbearance being granted. The amount of the loan impairment provision may change once the terms of the forbearance are known, resulting in an additional provision charge or a release of the provision in the period the forbearance is granted.\n\nThe transfer of Wholesale loans from impaired to performing status follows assessment by relationship managers and credit. When no further losses are anticipated and the customer is expected to meet the loan's revised terms, any provision is written-off or released and the balance of the loan returned to performing status. This is not dependent on a specified time period and follows the credit risk manager's assessment.\n\nCustomers seeking COVID-19 related support, including payment holidays, who were not subject to any wider SICR triggers and who were assessed as having the ability in the medium term post-COVID-19 to be viable and meet credit appetite metrics, were not considered to have been granted forbearance.\n\n## Asset lifetimes (audited)\n\nThe choice of initial recognition and asset duration is another critical judgment in determining the quantum of lifetime losses that apply.\n\n- \uf02d For asset duration, the approach applied (in line with IFRS 9 requirements) is:\n- \uf02d The date of initial recognition reflects the date that a transaction (or account) was first recognised on the balance sheet; the PD recorded at that time provides the baseline used for subsequent determination of SICR as detailed above.\n- \uf02d Term lending - the contractual maturity date, reduced for behavioural trends where appropriate (such as, expected prepayment and amortisation).\n- \uf02d Revolving facilities - for Personal portfolios (except credit cards), asset duration is based on behavioural life and this is normally greater than contractual life (which would typically be overnight). For Wholesale portfolios, asset duration is based on annual customer review schedules and will be set to the next review date.\n\nIn the case of credit cards, the most significant judgment is to reflect the operational practice of card reissuance and the associated credit assessment as enabling a formal reorigination trigger. As a consequence, a capped lifetime approach of up to 36 months is used on credit card balances. If the approach was uncapped the ECL impact is estimated at approximately \u00a370 million (2020 - \u00a3110 million). However, credit card balances originated under the 0% balance transfer product, and representing approximately 13% of performing card balances, have their ECL calculated on a behavioural lifetime approach as opposed to being capped at a maximum of three years.\n\nThe capped approach reflects NatWest Group practice of a credit-based review of customers prior to credit card issuance and complies with IFRS 9. Benchmarking information indicates that peer UK banks use behavioural approaches in the main for credit card portfolios with average durations between three and ten years. Across Europe, durations are shorter and are, in some cases, as low as one year.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Credit risk continued\n\n## Economic loss drivers (audited)\n\n## I Innttrroodduuccttiioonn\n\nThe portfolio segmentation and selection of economic loss drivers for IFRS 9 follow closely the approach used in stress testing. To enable robust modelling the forecasting models for each portfolio segment (defined by product or asset class and where relevant, industry sector and region) are based on a selected, small number of economic factors, (typically three to four) that best explain the temporal variations in portfolio loss rates. The process to select economic loss drivers involves empirical analysis and expert judgment.\n\nThe most material economic loss drivers are shown in the table below.\n\n| Portfolio                  | Economic loss drivers                                                                         |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| UK retail  mortgages       | UK unemployment rate, sterling swap  rate, UK house price index, UK  household debt to income |\n| UK retail  unsecured       | UK unemployment rate, sterling swap  rate, UK household debt to income                        |\n| UK large  corporates       | World GDP, UK unemployment rate,  sterling swap rate, stock price index                       |\n| UK commercial              | UK GDP, UK unemployment rate, sterling  swap rate                                             |\n| UK commercial  real estate | UK GDP, UK commercial property price  index, sterling swap rate, stock price  index           |\n| RoI retail  mortgages      | RoI unemployment rate, European  Central Bank base rate, RoI house price  index               |\n\n## Economic scenarios\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the range of anticipated future economic conditions was defined by a set of four internally developed scenarios and their respective probabilities. In addition to the base case, they comprised upside, downside and extreme downside scenarios. The scenarios primarily reflected a range of outcomes for the path of COVID-19 as well as recovery, and the associated effects on labour and asset markets.\n\nThe four economic scenarios are translated into forward-looking projections of CCIs using a set of econometric models. Subsequently the CCI projections for the individual scenarios are averaged into a single central CCI projection according to the given scenario probabilities. The central CCI projection is then overlaid with an additional mean reversion assumption i.e. that after reaching their worst forecast position the CCIs start to gradually revert to their long-run average of zero.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n205\n\nUpside - This scenario assumes a very strong recovery through 2022 as consumers dip into excess savings built up over the last two years. The labour market remains resilient, with the unemployment rate falling below pre-COVID-19 levels. Inflation is higher than the base case but eventually comes back close to the target. The strong economic recovery enables tightening to be quicker than the base case. The housing market continues its recent strong performance.\n\nBase case - COVID-19 related risks remain contained. After a strong recovery in 2021, the growth moderates in 2022. Most of the furloughed workers can go back to their existing job or find a new job very quickly, with the unemployment rate reaching 4.1% by the end of 2022. Inflation initially increases but retreats over 2022. Interest rates are raised, starting in early 2022. There is a gradual cool down in the housing market but activity is still at healthy levels.\n\nDownside - This scenario assumes a reversal in recovery as inflation build up leads to a lessening of expectations. Interest rates are raised aggressively to counter the inflation risks. However, starting in 2023, the interest hikes are reversed to assist the recovery. Unemployment is higher than the base case and there is a modest decline in house prices.\n\nExtreme downside - This scenario assumes a resurgence of COVID-19 related risks. There is a renewed downturn with declines in consumer spending and business investment. Interest rates are reduced into negative territory to -0.5%. There is widespread job shedding in the labour market while asset prices see deep corrections, with housing market falls higher than those seen during previous episodes. The recovery is tepid throughout the five-year period, meaning only a gradual decline in joblessness.\n\nThe approach of using four scenarios is similar to that as at 31 December 2020. Previously, NatWest Group used five discrete scenarios to characterise the distribution of risks in the economic outlook. For 2021, the four scenarios were deemed appropriate in capturing the uncertainty in economic forecasts and the non-linearity in outcomes under different scenarios. These four scenarios were developed to provide sufficient coverage across potential rises in unemployment, inflation, asset price falls and the degree of permanent damage to the economy, around which there remains pronounced levels of uncertainty.\n\nRisk and capital management",

The scale of the economic impact of COVID-19 and the range of recovery paths necessitates a change of approach to assigning probability weights from that used in recent updates. Prior to 2020, GDP paths for NatWest Group's scenarios were compared against a set of 1,000 model runs, following which a percentile in the distribution was established that most closely corresponded to the scenario.\n\nInstead, NatWest Group has subjectively applied probability weights, reflecting expert views within NatWest Group. The probability weight assignment was judged to present good coverage to the central scenarios and the potential for a robust recovery on the upside and exceptionally challenging outcomes on the downside. A 30% weighting was applied to the upside scenario, a 45% weighting applied to the base case scenario, a 20% weighting applied to the downside scenario and a 5% weighting applied to the extreme downside scenario. NatWest Group assessed the downside risk posed by COVID-19 to be diminishing over the course of 2021, with the vaccination rollout and positive economic data being observed since the gradual relaxing of lockdown restrictions.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n206\n\nNatWest Group therefore judged it was appropriate to apply a higher probability to upside-biased scenarios than at 31 December 2020. However, compared to 31 December 2020, the base case has a higher weight reflecting reduction in uncertainty as the path of economy recovery became clearer.\n\nThe 25% weighting to the two downside scenarios gives appropriate consideration to the threats posed to the recovery, including inflation, supply and COVID-19-related risks. Balanced against that is the adaptability of the UK economy to successive waves of COVID-19, and the resilience of labour and asset markets. The potential for further better than expected outcomes is reflected in the 30% probability weighting applied to the upside scenario.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Credit risk continued Economic loss drivers\n\nUK gross domestic productBank of England base rate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n%\n\nN\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n207\n\nRisk and capital management",

The PD and LGD values for each discrete scenario are calculated using product specific econometric models. Each account has a PD and LGD calculated as probability weighted averages across the suite of economic scenarios.\n\n## Use of the scenarios in Wholesale lending\n\nThe Wholesale lending ECL methodology is based on the concept of credit cycle indices (CCIs). The CCIs represent, similar to the exogenous component in Personal, all relevant economic loss drivers for a region/industry segment aggregated into a single index value that describes the loss rate conditions in the respective segment relative to its long-run average. A CCI value of zero corresponds to loss rates at longrun average levels, a positive CCI value corresponds to loss rates below long run average levels and a negative CCI value corresponds to loss rates above long-run average levels.\n\nThe four economic scenarios are translated into forwardlooking projections of CCIs using a set of econometric models. Subsequently the CCI projections for the individual scenarios are averaged into a single central CCI projection according to the given scenario probabilities. The central CCI projection is then overlaid with an additional mean reversion assumption i.e. that after one to two years into the forecast horizon the CCIs start to gradually revert to their long-run average of zero.\n\nFinally, ECL is calculated using a Monte Carlo approach by averaging PD and LGD values arising from many CCI paths simulated around the central CCI projection.\n\nThe rationale for the Wholesale approach is the long-standing observation that loss rates in Wholesale portfolios tend to follow regular cycles. This allows NatWest Group to enrich the range and depth of future economic conditions embedded in the final ECL beyond what would be obtained from using the discrete macro-economic scenarios alone.\n\nBusiness banking, while part of the Wholesale segment, for reporting purposes, utilises the Personal lending rather than the Wholesale lending methodology.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n209\n\n## U UKK  eeccoonnoommiicc  uunncceerrttaaiinnttyy\n\n## Treatment of COVID-19 relief mechanisms\n\nUse of COVID-19 relief mechanisms (for example, payment holidays, CBILS and BBLS) does not automatically merit identification of a SICR and trigger a Stage 2 classification in isolation. However, a subset of Personal customers who had accessed payment holiday support, and where their risk profile was identified as relatively high risk continue to be collectively migrated into Stage 2 (if not already captured by other SICR criteria).\n\nFor Wholesale customers, NatWest Group continues to provide support, where appropriate, to existing customers. Those who are deemed either (a) to require a prolonged timescale to return to within NatWest Group's risk appetite, (b) not to have been viable pre-COVID-19, or (c) not to be able to sustain their debt once COVID-19 is over, will trigger a SICR and, if concessions are sought, be categorised as forborne, in line with regulatory guidance. Payment holiday extensions beyond an aggregate of 12 months in an 18 month period to cover continuing COVID-19 business interruption are categorised as forbearance, including for customers where no other SICR triggers are present.\n\nIn February 2021, the British Business Bank announced details of Pay As You Grow (PAYG) options for borrowers of BBLS. The scheme options include the extension of lending terms, periods of reduced repayments and six month payment holidays. PAYG options are a feature of BBLS rather than a concession granted by NatWest Group. It is therefore not automatically considered significant credit deterioration and a Stage 2 trigger. NatWest Group relies on both customer attestations and existing credit monitoring procedures to identify significant financial difficulty. Should signs of financial stress be identified, a review is performed. If credit deterioration is confirmed, existing problem debt management journeys are followed and forbearance (if a concession is granted) is marked in line with existing processes. This will result in Stage 2 transfer.\n\nRisk and capital management",

While most government support schemes have now been phased out and economic conditions are normalising, the effect of this disruption is still evident in model monitoring and accounted for in judgments applied to the use and recalibrations of models.\n\nMost significantly, latest PD model monitoring shows general overprediction across all key portfolios, i.e., observed default rates still at or even below pre-COVID-19 levels despite increased PD estimates from a deterioration in several key economic variables. Model recalibrations to adjust for this overprediction have been deferred based on the judgment that default rate actuals are distorted due to government support.\n\nIn addition, to account for residual model uncertainty and the risk of eventual default emergence hitherto supressed by government support, lag assumptions of up to 12 months are applied in the models. These assumptions are consistent with and unchanged from previous disclosures in 2021, although their effective impact gradually reduces over time.\n\n## Industry sector detail - Wholesale only\n\nThe economic impact of COVID-19 is highly differentiated by industry sector, with hospitality and other contact-based leisure, service, travel and passenger transport activities significantly more affected than the overall economy.

Consistent with CBILS and the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS), the government guarantee is 80%. NatWest Group recognises lower LGDs for these lending products as a result, with 0% applied to the government-guaranteed part of the exposure. NatWest Group does not directly adjust the measurement of PD due to the government guarantee and continues to move exposures into Stage 2 and Stage 3 where a significant deterioration in credit risk or a default is identified.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Credit risk continued\n\n## Economic loss drivers (audited)\n\n|                              | Gross Carrying Amount   | Gross Carrying Amount   | Gross Carrying Amount   | Gross Carrying Amount   | Gross Carrying Amount   | Gross Carrying Amount   |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                              |                         | Associated              | BBL and                 | Of which:               | Of which:               | Of which:               |\n| 31 December 2020             | BBL \u00a3m                  | debt \u00a3m                 | associated debt \u00a3m      | Stage 1 \u00a3m              | Stage 2 \u00a3m              | Stage 3 \u00a3m              |\n| Wholesale                    |                         |                         |                         |                         |                         |                         |\n| Property                     | 1,996                   | 1,801                   | 3,797                   | 2,603                   | 1,146                   | 48                      |\n| Financial institutions       | 49                      | 35                      | 84                      | 47                      | 37                      | -                       |\n| Soverign                     | 11                      | 2                       | 13                      | 12                      | 1                       | -                       |\n| Corporate                    | 6,242                   | 4,105                   | 10,347                  | 7,390                   | 2,861                   | 96                      |\n| Of which:                    |                         |                         |                         |                         |                         |                         |\n| Airlines and aerospace       | 7                       | 3                       | 10                      | 7                       | 3                       | -                       |\n| Automotive                   | 416                     | 177                     | 593                     | 472                     | 119                     | 2                       |\n| Health                       | 314                     | 510                     | 824                     | 470                     | 343                     | 11                      |\n| Land transport and logistics | 255                     | 112                     | 367                     | 275                     | 83                      | 9                       |\n| Leisure                      | 989                     | 712                     | 1,701                   | 1,191                   | 477                     | 33                      |\n| Oil and gas                  | 9                       | 4                       | 13                      | 11                      | 2                       | -                       |\n| Retail                       | 1,078                   | 512                     | 1,590                   | 1,207                   | 374                     | 9                       |\n| Total                        | 8,298                   | 5,943                   | 14,241                  | 10,052                  | 4,045                   | 144                     |\n\n## Measurement uncertainty and ECL sensitivity\n\n## analysis (audited)\n\nThe recognition and measurement of ECL is complex and involves the use of significant judgment and estimation, particularly in times of economic volatility and uncertainty. This includes the formulation and incorporation of multiple forwardlooking economic conditions into ECL to meet the measurement objective of IFRS 9. The ECL provision is sensitive to the model inputs and economic assumptions underlying the estimate.\n\nThe focus of the simulations is on ECL provisioning requirements on performing exposures in Stage 1 and Stage 2. The simulations are run on a stand-alone basis and are independent of each other; the potential ECL impacts reflect the simulated impact at 31 December 2021. Scenario impacts on SICR should be considered when evaluating the ECL movements of Stage 1 and Stage 2. In all scenarios the total exposure was the same but exposure by stage varied in each scenario.\n\nStage 3 provisions are not subject to the same level of measurement uncertainty - default is an observed event as at the balance sheet date. Stage 3 provisions therefore have not been considered in this analysis.\n\nThe impact arising from the base case, upside, downside and extreme downside scenarios has been simulated. These scenarios are three of the four discrete scenarios used in the methodology for Personal multiple economic scenarios as described in the Economic loss drivers section. In the simulations, NatWest Group has assumed that the economic macro variables associated with these scenarios replace the existing base case economic assumptions, giving them a 100% probability weighting and therefore serving as a single economic scenario.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n211\n\nThese scenarios have been applied to all modelled portfolios in the analysis below, with the simulation impacting both PDs and LGDs. Modelled post model adjustments present in the underlying ECL estimates are also sensitised in line with the modelled ECL movements, but those that were judgmental in nature, primarily those for deferred model calibrations and economic uncertainty, were not (refer to the Governance and post model adjustments section). As expected, the scenarios create differing impacts on ECL by portfolio and the impacts are deemed reasonable. In this simulation, it is assumed that existing modelled relationships between key economic variables and loss drivers hold, but in practice other factors would also have an impact, for example, potential customer behaviour changes and policy changes by lenders that might impact on the wider availability of credit.\n\nNatWest Group's core criterion to identify a SICR is founded on PD deterioration, as discussed above. Under the simulations, PDs change and result in exposures moving between Stage 1 and Stage 2 contributing to the ECL impact.\n\nRisk and capital management",

Judgmental ECL post model adjustments, although reduced, continued to reflect residual economic uncertainty with the expectation of increased defaults later in 2022 and beyond, now representing 26% of total ECL (2020 - 16%). These combined factors, in conjunction with a less severe suite of economics in the 2021 extreme downside scenario, contributed to a smaller range of ECL sensitivities at 31 December 2021 compared to the 2020 year end.\n- \uf02d If the economics were as negative as observed in the extreme downside, total Stage 1 and Stage 2 ECL was simulated to increase by \u00a30.7 billion (approximately 39%). In this scenario, Stage 2 exposure increased significantly and was the key driver of the simulated ECL rise. The movement in Stage 2 balances in the other simulations was less significant.\n- \uf02d In the Wholesale portfolios, the outcome range of scenarios, except for the extreme downside, was relatively narrow. This was due to the combined effect of the assumption that government support schemes will delay defaults, mean reversion of CCIs and that only in the extreme downside CCIs do deteriorate beyond their year-end starting point.\n- \uf02d The lower modelled ECL in the downside scenario for Wholesale compared to the actual central scenario reflected the net effect of the MES weightings towards the downside for ECL.\n\n## S Siinnggllee  ffaaccttoorr  sseennssiittiivviittyy\n\nIn addition to scenario sensitivity, NatWest Group uses single factor analysis to support its evaluation and governance. This covers changes such as the variation of an individual input parameter (economic or credit) or a change of scenario weightings. The application of single factor analysis recognises the limitation that it is not normal for one single factor to vary in isolation, but can help identify possible risks in the credit portfolios.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, NatWest Group considered the effect of moving the unemployment peak in the base case from 4.1% to 7.5% in 2022 but without changing expectations in subsequent years. This had the effect of increasing ECL requirement by approximately 4.5% and 2.5% for the UK Retail and Wholesale portfolios respectively.\n\n## M Moovveemmeenntt  iinn  EECCLL  pprroovviissiioonn**\n\nThe table below shows the main ECL provision movements.\n\n|                                                                                        | ECL provision \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| At 1 January 2021                                                                      | 6,186              |\n| Transfers to disposal groups                                                           | (166)              |\n| Changes in economic forecasts                                                          | (611)              |\n| Changes in risk metrics and exposure: Stage 1 and Stage 2                              | (931)              |\n| Changes in risk metrics and exposure: Stage 3                                          | 374                |\n| Judgmental changes: changes in post model adjustments for Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 | 6                  |\n| Write-offs and other                                                                   | (1,052)            |\n| At 31 December 2021                                                                    | 3,806              |\n| At 1 January 2020                                                                      | 3,792              |\n| 2020 movements                                                                         | 2,394              |\n| At 31 December 2020                                                                    | 6,186              |\n\n*Not within audit scope.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n213\n\nThe lower effect on the Wholesale portfolio reflected that unemployment is not a significant loss driver for property exposures nor some of NatWest Group's specialised lending areas.\n\nThe improvement in the economic outlook and scenarios used in the IFRS 9 MES framework in 2021 resulted in a release of modelled ECL. Given that continued uncertainty remains due to COVID-19 despite the improved economic outlook, NatWest Group utilised a framework of quantitative and qualitative measures to support the directional change and levels of ECL coverage, including economic data, credit performance insights and problem debt trends. This was particularly important for consideration of post model adjustments.\n\nAs government support schemes continued to conclude during 2021, NatWest Group anticipates further credit deterioration in the portfolios. However, the income statement effect of this will be mitigated by the forward-looking provisions retained on the balance sheet as at 31 December 2021.\n\nThere are a number of key factors that could drive further downside to impairments, through deteriorating economic and credit metrics and increased stage migration as credit risk increases for more customers. A key factor would be a more adverse deterioration in GDP and unemployment in the economies in which NatWest Group operates, but also, among others:\n\n- \uf02d The ongoing trajectory of lockdown restrictions within the UK and the Republic of Ireland, and any future repeated lockdown requirements.\n- \uf02d The progress of the COVID-19 vaccination roll-out and its effectiveness against new variants.\n- \uf02d The long-term efficacy of the various government support schemes in terms of their ability to defray customer defaults is yet to be proven over an extended period.\n- \uf02d The effect on customer affordability in the event of sustained inflationary pressures.\n- \uf02d The level of revenues lost by corporate clients and pace of recovery of those revenues may affect NatWest Group's clients' ability to service their borrowing, especially in those sectors most exposed to the effects of COVID-19.\n\nRisk and capital management",

Total contingent liabilities (including financial guarantees) and commitments within IFRS 9 ECL scope of \u00a3127.9 billion (2020 - \u00a3133.6 billion) comprised Stage 1 \u00a3119.5 billion (2020 - \u00a3107.4 billion); Stage 2 \u00a37.8 billion (2020 - \u00a325.2 billion); and Stage 3 \u00a30.6 billion (2020 - \u00a31.0 billion). The ECL relating to off balance sheet exposures is \u00a30.1 billion (2020 - \u00a30.2 billion). The total ECL in the remainder of the credit risk section of \u00a33.8 billion included ECL for both on and off balance sheet exposures for continuing operations.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Credit risk -

amortised cost and FVOCI. It is calculated on third party loans and total ECL provisions.\n\n- \uf02d Stage 1 and Stage 2 ECL reduced significantly during 2021, with sustained improvement in underlying risk metrics mainly due to the improved economic outlook and underpinned by various government support schemes.\n- \uf02d The Stage 2 population reduced reflecting lower underlying PDs, resulting in migration of cases back into Stage 1. However, the Stage 2 population remained above preCOVID-19 levels.\n- \uf02d Stage 3 loans and ECL balances reduced, mainly due to write-off, repayment of defaulted debt and portfolio sale of defaulted debt. To date, the various COVID-19 related government support schemes have mitigated new flows into default. It is expected that defaults will increase as the effect of the various government support schemes unwinds.\n\nThe table below shows Ulster Bank RoI disposal groups for Personal and Wholesale, by stage, for gross loans, off-balance sheet exposures and ECL.

Banking activities continued\n\n## Segmental loans and impairment metrics (audited)\n\n- \uf02d Retail Banking - Balance sheet growth during 2021 was mainly due to mortgages. In line with the market, mortgage demand was strong during the year, supported by the extension of the stamp duty holiday and overall improvements in economic conditions. The improved economic outlook captured in the updated MES scenarios, including a more positive forecast on unemployment levels, resulted in reduced account level PDs. Unsecured lending balances decreased as customer spend and demand for borrowing were subdued as a result of COVID-19 restrictions, particularly in the first quarter of 2021. Lending criteria were cautiously relaxed during 2021 to support growing demand as lockdown restrictions eased.\n- \uf02d ECL in Stage 2 decreased due to migrations back into Stage 1, following the effects of improving economic scenarios during 2021 and continued stable portfolio performance supporting improved risk metrics. However, the ECL coverage on remaining Stage 2 exposures increased simply due to the relative underlying risk profile of the remaining Stage 2 exposures. The various COVID-19 related customer support schemes (for example, loan repayment holidays, government job retention scheme) mitigated actual portfolio deterioration in the short-term, with the arrears levels and flows into Stage 3 yet to be materially affected. Total ECL coverage reduced further in the fourth quarter of 2021, overall mirroring the positive trajectory of the COVID-19 vaccinations, labour market trends and portfolio performance, whilst maintaining coverage for the key portfolios above pre-COVID-19 levels given the persisting sources of uncertainty, including the Omicron variant and inflationary pressures on customers.\n- \uf02d Portfolio performance remained stable, for further details refer to the Personal portfolio section. Arrears levels in both the mortgage and unsecured portfolios remained low overall. However, a small number of customers who utilised their full payment holiday, did migrate into late arrears during the second half of the year. With COVID-19 payment holidays complete, this trend stabilised by the year end and new inflows to arrears were below pre-COVID-19 levels.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n219\n\n- \uf02d Commercial Banking - Balance sheet reduction was mainly as a result of repayments of both COVID-19 government lending schemes and conventional borrowing where demand was lower, particularly in the second half of the year. Strategic reduction was achieved in high risk sectors.\n- \uf02d Reflecting the continued level of uncertainty caused by COVID-19, management judged that certain ECL post model adjustments remained necessary, refer to the Governance and post model adjustments section for further details. The increase in Stage 2 exposures that were past due greater than 30 days was mainly due to the commencement of repayments of government scheme debt with some borrowers failing to meet scheduled repayments. The lower coverage of this population was driven by the guaranteed nature of government support schemes. Conventional bank debt did not see a significant increase in past due balances.\n- \uf02d The improved economic outlook, including significant increases in GDP and commercial real estate valuations, resulted in lower IFRS 9 PDs. Consequently, compared to 2020, a smaller proportion of the exposures exhibited a SICR, which resulted in a migration of assets from Stage 2 into Stage 1. As a result, the ECL requirement reduced.\n- \uf02d The various COVID-19 related customer support schemes and economic recovery continued to mitigate against flows into default. The reduction in coverage in Stage 1 and Stage 2 was mainly due to the decrease in ECL during 2021, primarily as a result of the improved economic outlook. There was a reduction in Stage 3 coverage as balances reduced and were not replaced by new flows, write-offs of existing debt were also higher in the year. Coverage remained above pre-COVID-19 levels. The loss rate was significantly lower than in the prior year.\n- \uf02d Other - The reasons for the increased ECL requirement were similar to those described above.\n\nRisk and capital management",

Balance sheet growth during the year was mainly in mortgages. Unsecured lending balances were subdued as noted previously. In Wholesale, exposures were mainly in the UK. Balance sheet reduction was primarily due to repayments of both COVID-19 government lending schemes and conventional borrowing where demand was lower. Strategic reduction was achieved in high risk sectors.\n- \uf02d Loans - Past due analysis - The various COVID-19 related customer support schemes (capital repayment holidays, government job retention scheme, government supported lending schemes) are mitigating actual portfolio deterioration in the short-term, although there have been some small increases in past due exposures.\n- \uf02d Loans by stage - In both Wholesale and Personal, the improved economic outlook resulted in reduced IFRS 9 PDs compared to 2020. This, alongside continued benign credit performance of the portfolio, resulted in a smaller proportion of accounts exhibiting a SICR and thereby an associated migration of exposures from Stage 2 into Stage 1. In the absence of any other forbearance or SICR triggers, customers granted COVID-19 related payment holidays were not considered forborne and did not result in an automatic trigger into Stage 2. However, a subset of Personal customers who had accessed payment holiday support, and where their risk profile was identified as relatively high, continued to be collectively migrated into Stage 2. In Wholesale, BBLS customers granted PAYG options, including the extension of lending terms, periods of reduced repayments and six month payment holidays, were not automatically considered significantly credit deteriorated. PAYG options are a feature of BBLS rather than a concession granted by NatWest Group.\n- \uf02d Weighted average 12 months PDs - In Personal, the Basel II point-in-time PDs improved slightly during 2021. The forward-looking IFRS 9 PDs reduced significantly during 2021 reflecting the improved economics. PD reductions were most evident in Personal mortgages due to benign arrears performance (catalysed by COVID-19 support schemes) combined with the improved economic outlook, which is connected to the need for collective SICR migration and judgmental post model adjustments. In Wholesale, the Basel II PDs were based on a through-thecycle approach and decreased less than the forwardlooking IFRS 9 PDs which reduced, reflecting the improved economic outlook.  For further details refer to the Asset quality section.\n- \uf02d ECL provisions by stage - Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions reduced reflecting the improved economic outlook. As outlined above, Stage 3 provisions have yet to be materially affected, underpinned by the various customer support schemes noted previously.\n- \uf02d ECL provision by geography - In line with the point relating to loans by geography above, the vast majority of ECL related to exposures in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n225\n\n- \uf02d ECL provisions coverage - Overall provisions coverage reduced, mainly due to the improvement in economic outlook and scenario weightings. The base economic scenario improved reflecting the faster than expected vaccination roll-out, better than expected actual economic data and strong government support. Stage 2 coverage increased during the period for some portfolios and notably on certain Wholesale sectors due to the inclusion of the recovery risk overlay and lower Stage 2 balances.\n- \uf02d Loans by residual maturity - In mortgages, as expected, the vast majority of exposures were greater than five years. In unsecured lending - cards and other - exposures were concentrated in less than five years. In Wholesale, with the exception of financial institutions where lending was concentrated in less than one year, the majority of lending was for residual maturity of one to five years, with some greater than five years in line with lending under the government support schemes.\n- \uf02d The ECL charge and loss rate - Reflecting the improved economic outlook, the impairment charge was significantly lower, with a material reduction in the annualised loss rate.\n- \uf02d Other financial assets by asset quality - Consisting almost entirely of cash and balances at central banks and debt securities, held in the course of treasury related management activities, these assets were mainly within the AQ1-AQ4 bands.\n- \uf02d Wholesale forbearance - Customers seeking COVID-19 related support, including payment holidays, who were not subject to any wider SICR triggers and who were assessed as having the ability in the medium term post-COVID-19 to be viable and meet credit appetite metrics, were not considered to have been granted forbearance. Customers seeking a payment holiday extension beyond an aggregate of 12 months in an 18 month period were considered to have been granted forbearance and were classed as heightened monitoring. This classification did not apply to customers with BBLS taking a PAYG payment holiday option. For Wholesale, forbearance flow decreased in the second half of 2021 following the lifting of most COVID-19 restrictions. The leisure sector represented the largest share of forbearance flow throughout 2021 due to disruption caused by the periodic presence of COVID-19 restrictions and resultant consumer uncertainty. Payment holidays and covenant waivers were the most common forms of forbearance granted.\n- \uf02d Off-balance sheet exposures by asset quality - In Personal, undrawn exposures were reflective of available credit lines in credit cards and current accounts. Additionally, the mortgage portfolio had undrawn exposures, where a formal offer had been made to a customer but had not yet drawn down; the value increased in line with the pipeline of offers. There was also a legacy portfolio of flexible mortgages where a customer had the right and ability to draw down further funds. The asset quality was aligned to the wider portfolio. In Wholesale, undrawn exposures declined in line with muted credit demand, with customers repaying revolving credit and working capital facilities to optimise liquidity. In addition, sector appetite adjustments in high risk sectors reduced off-balance sheet exposures to these sectors.\n- \uf02d Heightened Monitoring and Risk of Credit Loss Inflows decreased during 2021 compared to 2020. The reduction in value was mainly due to the lower number of inflows as well as a small number of high value customers who moved out of the framework as economic conditions improved. While noting the reduced flows into Heightened Monitoring and Risk of Credit Loss and the improved stock position, the volume and value of cases remained higher than preCOVID-19 levels. The sector breakdown of exposures remained consistent with prior periods.\n\nRisk and capital management",

These included LTV ratios, buy-to-let concentrations, new-build concentrations and credit quality. Lending criteria were cautiously relaxed during the year as demand returned and economic conditions improved.\n- \uf02d Demand for mortgages was mostly within owner occupier mortgages, consequently there has been a reduction in the proportion of interest only and buy-to-let mortgages.\n- \uf02d In the Retail Banking mortgage portfolio, 37% of the stock of lending was in Greater London and the South East (2020 37%). The weighted average loan-to-value for these regions was 53% (2020 - 54%) compared to all regions 54%.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n227\n\n- \uf02d In the Retail Banking mortgage portfolio, 92% of customer balances were on fixed rates (62% of these on five-year deals). In addition, 97% of all new mortgage completions were fixed rate deals (56% of these on five-year deals).\n- \uf02d Forbearance flows and arrears levels remained low relative to historic norms, with customers able to utilise payment holidays during the first half of the year.\n- \uf02d Unsecured lending overall reduced during the year as demand was subdued with lower levels of consumer spending.\n- \uf02d As noted previously, the improved economic outlook including a more positive forecast on unemployment and house prices, resulted in reduced ECL.\n\nRisk and capital management",

LTV is not a meaningful measure for this type of lending activity.\n- \uf02d Overall - The majority of the CRE portfolio was located and managed in the UK. Business appetite and strategy was aligned across NatWest Group.\n- \uf02d 2021 trends - The continued reduction in the real estate exposure was a consequence of active portfolio management to rebalance the size and composition of the CRE portfolio. In addition, customer appetite to borrow was muted, particularly amongst larger customers. At a subsector level, the residential market had a positive out-turn over the year; the retail sector exhibited mixed performance in line with changing consumer habits; the industrial market performed very strongly; with uncertainty continuing in the office sub-sector as occupiers moved to a more flexible way of working.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n230\n\n- \uf02d Credit quality - NatWest Group entered the COVID-19 period with a conservatively positioned CRE portfolio, which helped to mitigate the effect of COVID-19. The majority of the defaults during 2021 were in the retail sector, particularly in the fashion-led shopping centre sub-sector. NatWest Group completed a strategic sale of a portfolio of these loans during 2021. Customers experienced reduced rent collections during COVID-19 albeit rental payments have now normalised. Outside of retail, there was limited distress as noted, uncertainty still remains, particularly in relation to the office sub-sector and the portfolio continues to be actively reviewed and managed.\n- \uf02d Risk appetite - Lending appetite was gradually and selectively increased by sub-sector, particularly towards the end of 2021, albeit these remain below pre-COVID-19 levels.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Credit risk - Banking activities continued\n\n## Flow statements (audited)\n\nThe flow statements that follow show the main ECL and related income statement movements. They also show the changes in ECL as well as the changes in related financial assets used in determining ECL. Due to differences in scope, exposures may differ from those reported in other tables, principally in relation to exposures in Stage 1 and Stage 2. These differences do not have a material ECL effect. Other points to note:\n\n- \uf02d Financial assets include treasury liquidity portfolios, comprising balances at central banks and debt securities, as well as loans. Both modelled and non-modelled portfolios are included.\n- \uf02d Changes in risk parameters shows the reassessment of the ECL within a given stage, including any ECL overlays and residual income statement gains or losses at the point of write-off or accounting write-down.\n- \uf02d Other (P&L only items) includes any subsequent changes in the value of written-down assets (for example, fortuitous recoveries) along with other direct write-off items such as direct recovery costs. Other (P&L only items) affects the income statement but does not affect balance sheet ECL movements.\n- \uf02d There were flows from Stage 1 into Stage 3 including transfers due to unexpected default events. The small number of write-offs in Stage 1 and Stage 2 reflect the effect of portfolio debt sales and also staging at the start of the analysis period.\n- \uf02d Amounts written-off represent the gross asset written-down against accounts with ECL, including the net asset writedown for any debt sale activity.\n- \uf02d The effect of any change in post model adjustments during the year is typically reported under changes in risk parameters, as are any effects arising from changes to the underlying models. Refer to the section on Governance and post model adjustments for further details.\n- \uf02d All movements are captured monthly and aggregated. Interest suspended post default is included within Stage 3 ECL with the movement in the value of suspended interest during the year reported under currency translation and other adjustments.\n\n|                                             | Stage 1          | Stage 1   | Stage 2          | Stage 2   | Stage 3          | Stage 3   | Total            | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------|------------------|-----------|------------------|-----------|------------------|---------|\n|                                             | Financial assets | ECL       | Financial assets | ECL       | Financial assets | ECL       | Financial assets | ECL     |\n| NatWest Group total                         | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m        | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m        | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m        | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m      |\n| At 1 January 2021                           | 446,666          | 519       | 81,667           | 3,081     | 6,524            | 2,586     | 534,857          | 6,186   |\n| Currency translation and other adjustments  | (4,111)          | (1)       | (246)            | (6)       | 48               | (89)      | (4,309)          | (96)    |\n| Transfers from Stage 1 to Stage 2           | (35,307)         | (160)     | 35,307           | 160       | -                | -         | -                | -       |\n| Transfers from Stage 2 to Stage 1           | 62,702           | 1,322     | (62,702)         | (1,322)   | -                | -         | -                | -       |\n| Transfers to Stage 3                        | (390)            | (2)       | (2,628)          | (285)     | 3,018            | 287       | -                | -       |\n| Transfers from Stage 3                      | 241              | 21        | 1,352            | 188       | (1,593)          | (209)     | -                | -       |\n| Net re-measurement of ECL on stage transfer |                  | (1,114)   |                  | 869       |                  | 310       |                  | 65      |\n| Changes in risk parameters                  |                  | (343)     |                  | (566)     |                  | 244       |                  | (665)   |\n| Other changes in net exposure               | 84,331           | 84        | (15,657)         | (496)     | (1,795)          | (148)     | 66,879           | (560)   |\n| Other (P&L only items)                      |                  | (3)       |                  | 5         |                  | (120)     |                  | (118)   |\n| Income statement (releases)/charges         |                  | (1,376)   |                  | (188)     |                  | 286       |                  | (1,278) |\n| Transfers to disposal groups                | (7,954)          | (24)      | (1,511)          | (120)     | (113)            | (22)      | (9,578)          | (166)   |\n| Amounts written-off                         | -                | -         | (25)             | (25)      | (851)            | (851)     | (876)            | (876)   |\n| Unwinding of discount                       |                  | -         |                  | -         |                  | (82)      |                  | (82)    |\n| At 31 December 2021                         | 546,178          | 302       | 35,557           | 1,478     | 5,238            | 2,026     | 586,973          | 3,806   |\n| Net carrying amount                         | 545,876          |           | 34,079           |           | 3,212            |           | 583,167          |         |\n| At 1 January 2020                           | 428,604          | 322       | 28,630           | 752       | 7,135            | 2,718     | 464,369          | 3,792   |\n| 2020 movements                              | 18,062           | 197       | 53,037           | 2,329     | (611)            | (132)     | 70,488           | 2,394   |\n| At 31 December 2020                         | 446,666          | 519       | 81,667           | 3,081     | 6,524            | 2,586     | 534,857          | 6,186   |\n| Net carrying amount                         | 446,147          |           | 78,586           |           | 3,938            |           | 528,671          |         |\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n231\n\n- \uf02d Stage transfers (for example, exposures moving from Stage 1 into Stage 2) are a key feature of the ECL movements, with the net re-measurement cost of transitioning to a worse stage being a primary driver of income statement charges.

The decrease in ECL was primarily a result of reduced PDs and LGDs reflecting the improved economic outlook and stable portfolio performance. This resulted in lower levels of SICR identification and ECL requirement.\n- \uf02d More specifically, the reduced PDs alongside muted portfolio deterioration resulted in a net migration of assets from Stage 2 into Stage 1, with an associated decrease from lifetime ECL to a 12 month ECL.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n232\n\n- \uf02d With various customer support schemes available and the revised economic outlook, Stage 3 ECL remained stable as new inflows remaining subdued. The relatively small ECL cost for net re-measurement on stage transfer included the effect of risk targeted ECL adjustments, when previously in Stage 2. Refer to the Governance and post model adjustments section for further details.\n- \uf02d Write-off occurs once the repossessed property has been sold and there is a residual shortfall balance remaining outstanding. This would typically be within five years from default but can be longer. Given the moratorium on repossession activity until later in 2021, write-offs remained at a subdued level.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Credit risk - Banking activities continued\n\n## Flow statements (audited)\n\n|                                             | Stage 1          | Stage 1   | Stage 2          | Stage 2   | Stage 3          | Stage 3   | Total            | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------|------------------|-----------|------------------|-----------|------------------|---------|\n|                                             | Financial assets | ECL       | Financial assets | ECL       | Financial assets | ECL       | Financial assets | ECL     |\n| Retail Banking - credit cards               | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m        | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m        | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m        | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m      |\n| At 1 January 2021                           | 2,250            | 52        | 1,384            | 220       | 114              | 75        | 3,748            | 347     |\n| Currency translation and other adjustments  | -                | -         | -                | -         | (1)              | (1)       | (1)              | (1)     |\n| Transfers from Stage 1 to Stage 2           | (951)            | (48)      | 951              | 48        | -                | -         | -                | -       |\n| Transfers from Stage 2 to Stage 1           | 1,119            | 143       | (1,119)          | (143)     | -                | -         | -                | -       |\n| Transfers to Stage 3                        | (17)             | -         | (84)             | (35)      | 101              | 35        | -                | -       |\n| Transfers from Stage 3                      | -                | -         | 9                | 5         | (9)              | (5)       | -                | -       |\n| Net re-measurement of ECL on stage transfer |                  | (88)      |                  | 184       |                  | 28        |                  | 124     |\n| Changes in risk parameters                  |                  | (19)      |                  | (65)      |                  | 8         |                  | (76)    |\n| Other changes in net exposure               | 339              | 18        | (194)            | (73)      | (41)             | (2)       | 104              | (57)    |\n| Other (P&L only items)                      |                  | -         |                  | -         |                  | (4)       |                  | (4)     |\n| Income statement (releases)/charges         |                  | (89)      |                  | 46        |                  | 30        |                  | (13)    |\n| Amounts written-off                         | -                | -         | -                | -         | (73)             | (73)      | (73)             | (73)    |\n| Unwinding of discount                       |                  | -         |                  | -         |                  | (5)       |                  | (5)     |\n| At 31 December 2021                         | 2,740            | 58        | 947              | 141       | 91               | 60        | 3,778            | 259     |\n| Net carrying amount                         | 2,682            |           | 806              |           | 31               |           | 3,519            |         |\n| At 1 January 2020                           | 2,804            | 38        | 1,246            | 131       | 127              | 88        | 4,177            | 257     |\n| 2020 movements                              | (554)            | 14        | 138              | 89        | (13)             | (13)      | (429)            | 90      |\n| At 31 December 2020                         | 2,250            | 52        | 1,384            | 220       | 114              | 75        | 3,748            | 347     |\n| Net carrying amount                         | 2,198            |           | 1,164            |           | 39               |           | 3,401            |         |\n\n- \uf02d The overall decrease in ECL was mainly due to the reduction in Stage 2 ECL reflecting the improved economic outlook and stable portfolio performance, causing PDs to decrease.

This resulted in reduced levels of SICR identification and ECL requirement.\n- \uf02d More specifically, the reduced PDs alongside muted portfolio deterioration resulted in a net migration of assets from Stage 2 into Stage 1, with an associated decrease from lifetime ECL to a 12 month ECL.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n234\n\n- \uf02d In line with industry trends in the UK, unsecured balances reduced, amplifying the ECL reductions within the portfolio. This has stabilised as UK lockdown restrictions have eased and borrowing demand increased.\n- \uf02d Write-off occurs once recovery activity with the customer has been concluded or there are no further recoveries expected, but no later than six years after default.\n- \uf02d With various customer support schemes available and the improved economic outlook, Stage 3 inflows remained subdued and therefore Stage 3 ECL movement was minimal.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Credit risk -

However, the transfer of exposure from Stage 1 into Stage 2 outweighed the positive migration and was largely related to customers with government scheme borrowing.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n236\n\n- \uf02d Flows of defaulted exposure into Stage 3 were mainly a result of government scheme lending rather than conventional debt. This was reflected in the lower ECL associated with the Stage 3 transfers.\n- \uf02d The portfolio continued to benefit from cash recoveries post write-off, which are reported as other (P&L only items). Write-off occurs once recovery activity with the customer has been concluded or there are no further recoveries expected, but no later than five years after default.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Credit risk -

Consequently, compared to 2020, a smaller proportion of accounts exhibited significant PD deterioration causing Stage 2 exposures to decrease significantly and increase the proportion of cases in Stage 2 for other reasons.\n- \uf02d During the year, a subset of customers who had accessed payment holiday support and where their risk profile was identified as relatively high risk, were collectively migrated into Stage 2. For mortgages, in Retail Banking, approximately \u00a30.8 billion of exposures were collectively migrated from Stage 1 into Stage 2. The impact of collective migrations on unsecured lending was much more limited.\n- \uf02d As expected, ECL coverage was higher in accounts that were more than 30 days past due than those in Stage 2 for other reasons.\n\n|                                        | Property   | Property   | Corporate   | Corporate   | Financial  institutions   | Financial  institutions   | Sovereign   | Sovereign   | Total    | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|-------------|----------|---------|\n| 2021                                   | Loans \u00a3m   | ECL \u00a3m     | Loans \u00a3m    | ECL \u00a3m      | Loans \u00a3m                  | ECL \u00a3m                    | Loans \u00a3m    | ECL \u00a3m      | Loans \u00a3m | ECL \u00a3m  |\n| Wholesale                              |            |            |             |             |                           |                           |             |             |          |         |\n| Currently >30 DPD                      | 239        | 3          | 390         | 8           | 19                        | -                         | -           | -           | 648      | 11      |\n| Currently <=30 DPD                     | 2,862      | 108        | 15,214      | 705         | 713                       | 39                        | 121         | 1           | 18,910   | 853     |\n| - PD deterioration                     | 896        | 57         | 10,391      | 549         | 595                       | 36                        | 84          | 1           | 11,966   | 643     |\n| - PD persistence                       | 139        | 8          | 552         | 32          | 6                         | -                         | 1           | -           | 698      | 40      |\n| - Other driver (forbearance, RoCL etc) | 1,827      | 43         | 4,271       | 124         | 112                       | 3                         | 36          | -           | 6,246    | 170     |\n| Total Stage 2                          | 3,101      | 111        | 15,604      | 713         | 732                       | 39                        | 121         | 1           | 19,558   | 864     |\n| 2020                                   |            |            |             |             |                           |                           |             |             |          |         |\n| Wholesale                              |            |            |             |             |                           |                           |             |             |          |         |\n| Currently >30 DPD                      | 136        | 6          | 215         | 28          | 110                       | -                         | -           | -           | 461      | 34      |\n| Currently <=30 DPD                     | 12,885     | 501        | 27,501      | 1,459       | 3,514                     | 90                        | 204         | 1           | 44,104   | 2,051   |\n| - PD deterioration                     | 11,765     | 450        | 23,268      | 1,229       | 3,182                     | 85                        | 97          |             | - 38,312 | 1,764   |\n| - PD persistence                       | 162        | 5          | 623         | 20          | 7                         | -                         | -           | -           | 792      | 25      |\n| - Other driver (forbearance, RoCL etc) | 958        | 46         | 3,610       | 210         | 325                       | 5                         | 107         | 1           | 5,000    | 262     |\n| Total Stage 2                          | 13,021     | 507        | 27,716      | 1,487       | 3,624                     | 90                        | 204         | 1           | 44,565   | 2,085   |\n\n- \uf02d The improved economic outlook, including upgrades in GDP and commercial real estate valuations, resulted in a reduction of IFRS 9 PDs.

Consequently, compared to 2020, a smaller proportion of accounts exhibited significant PD deterioration at 31 December 2021.\n- \uf02d Since the 2020 year end, large populations of Stage 2 were migrated into Stage 1 reflecting continued reductions in PDs as a result of the improved economic outlook alongside stable portfolio performance during the year.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n240\n\n- \uf02d However, a subset of customers who had accessed payment holiday support, and where their risk profile was identified as relatively high risk, were collectively migrated into Stage 2. In Retail Banking (primarily mortgages), approximately \u00a30.8 billion of exposures were collectively migrated from Stage 1 into Stage 2. The effect of collective migrations on unsecured lending was much more limited. PD movement made up a smaller proportion of Stage 2 for UK mortgages than at the 2020 year end, supporting the use of the collective SICR migration approach described above.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Credit risk - Banking activities continued\n\nStage 2 decomposition - by a significant increase in credit risk trigger continued\n\n|                                       | Property   | Property   | Corporate   | Corporate   | Financial  institutions   | Financial  institutions   | Sovereign   | Sovereign   | Total   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|-------------|---------|---------|\n| 2021                                  | \u00a3m         | %          | \u00a3m          | %           | \u00a3m                        | %                         | \u00a3m          | %           | \u00a3m      | %       |\n| Wholesale trigger (1)                 |            |            |             |             |                           |                           |             |             |         |         |\n| PD movement                           | 942        | 30.3       | 10,553      | 67.7        | 595                       | 81.3                      | 84          | 69.4        | 12,174  | 62.2    |\n| PD persistence                        | 139        | 4.5        | 553         | 3.5         | 6                         | 0.8                       | 1           | 0.8         | 699     | 3.6     |\n| Risk of Credit Loss                   | 962        | 31.0       | 2,626       | 16.8        | 71                        | 9.7                       | 34          | 28.1        | 3,693   | 18.9    |\n| Forbearance support provided          | 101        | 3.3        | 489         | 3.1         | 6                         | 0.8                       | -           | -           | 596     | 3.0     |\n| Customers in collections              | 27         | 0.9        | 88          | 0.6         | 1                         | 0.1                       | -           | -           | 116     | 0.6     |\n| Collective SICR and other reasons (2) | 762        | 24.6       | 1,189       | 7.6         | 35                        | 4.8                       | 2           | 1.7         | 1,988   | 10.2    |\n| Days past due >30                     | 168        | 5.4        | 106         | 0.7         | 18                        | 2.5                       | -           | -           | 292     | 1.5     |\n|                                       | 3,101      | 100        | 15,604      | 100         | 732                       | 100                       | 121         | 100         | 19,558  | 100     |\n\n2020\n\n| Wholesale trigger (1)                 |        |       |        |       |       |      |     |        |            |       |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|-------|--------|-------|-------|------|-----|--------|------------|-------|\n| PD movement                           | 11,849 |  91.1 | 23,403 |  84.3 | 3,183 | 87.9 | 97  | 47.6 - | 38,532 793 |  86.6 |\n| PD persistence                        | 162    |   1.2 | 624    |   2.3 | 7     | 0.2  | -   | 19.1   | 2,605      |   1.8 |\n| Risk of Credit Loss                   | 394    |   3   | 2,106  |   7.6 | 66    | 1.8  | 39  |        |            |   5.8 |\n| Forbearance support provided          | 73     |   0.6 | 133    |   0.5 | 27    | 0.7  | -   | -      | 233        |   0.5 |\n| Customers in collections              | 30     |   0.2 | 115    |   0.4 | 1     | -    | -   | -      | 146        |   0.3 |\n| Collective SICR and other reasons (2) | 462    |   3.5 | 1,262  |   4.6 | 231   | 6.4  | 68  | 33.3   | 2,023      |   4.5 |\n| Days past due >30                     | 51     |   0.4 | 73     |   0.3 | 109   | 3.0  | -   | -      | 233        |   0.5 |\n|                                       | 13,021 | 100   | 27,716 | 100   | 3,624 | 100  | 204 | 100    | 44,565     | 100   |\n\n- (1) The table is prepared on a hierarchical basis from top to bottom, for example, accounts with PD deterioration may also trigger backstop(s) but are only reported under PD deterioration.\n- (2) Includes customers where a PD assessment cannot be undertaken due to missing PDs.\n- \uf02d PD deterioration continued to be the primary trigger of migration of exposures from Stage 1 into Stage 2.

When customers continue to engage constructively with NatWest Group, making regular payments, NatWest Group continues to support them.\n- \uf02d Wholesale - The reduction in the proportion of loans in Stage 3 for less than one year was mainly due to lower flows into default during 2021 with customers supported by government support schemes and a positive economic recovery trajectory. Exposures which were in Stage 3 for in excess of five years, were mainly related to customers being in a protracted formal insolvency process or subject to litigation or a complaints process.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n241\n\n- \uf02d PD persistence related to the business banking portfolio only.\n\nRisk and capital management",

Overall, personal asset quality improved slightly with migration in assets from AQ4 to AQ5 in mortgages offset by migration from AQ9 into better quality bands. As expected, mortgage exposures had a higher proportion in AQ1-AQ4 than unsecured borrowing.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n243\n\n- \uf02d As noted previously, significant migration from Stage 2 into Stage 1 across all AQ bands was observed, as IFRS PDs reduced.\n- \uf02d In other personal, the relatively high level of exposures in AQ10 reflected that impaired assets can be held on the balance sheet, with commensurate ECL provision, for up to six years after default.\n\nRisk and capital management",

risk - Banking activities continued Asset quality (audited)\n\n- \uf02d Asset quality improvement was observed across most segments as the economy recovered from the effects of COVID-19.\n- \uf02d Across the Wholesale portfolio, the asset quality band distribution differed, reflective of the underlying quality of counterparties within each segment.\n- \uf02d The reduction in AQ10 exposure in property was largely due to a portfolio sale of commercial real estate.\n- \uf02d ECL provisions coverage showed the expected trend with increased coverage in the poorer asset quality bands, and also by stage.\n- \uf02d Within the Wholesale portfolio, customer credit grades were reassessed as and when a request for financing was made, a scheduled customer credit review was undertaken or a material event specific to that customer occurred.\n- \uf02d The low provision coverage for Stage 3 loans in financial institutions for 2021 reflected the secured nature of one exposure classified AQ10.\n\n##

The framework ensures the tools and capability are in place to facilitate the management and mitigation of risk ensuring NatWest Group operates within its regulatory requirements and risk appetite.\n\n## Definitions (audited)\n\nRegulatory capital consists of reserves and instruments issued that are available, have a degree of permanency and are capable of absorbing losses. A number of strict conditions set by regulators must be satisfied to be eligible as capital.\n\nCapital adequacy risk is the risk that there is or will be insufficient capital and other loss-absorbing debt instruments to operate effectively including meeting minimum regulatory requirements, operating within Board approved risk appetite and supporting its strategic goals.\n\nLiquidity consists of assets that can be readily converted to cash within a short timeframe at a reliable value. Liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet financial obligations as and when they fall due.\n\nFunding consists of on-balance sheet liabilities that are used to provide cash to finance assets. Funding risk is the risk of not maintaining a diversified, stable and cost-effective funding base.\n\nLiquidity and funding risks arise in a number of ways, including through the maturity transformation role that banks perform. The risks are dependent on factors such as:\n\n- \uf02d Maturity profile;\n- \uf02d The quality and size of the liquidity portfolio;\n- \uf02d Composition of sources and uses of funding;\n- \uf02d Wholesale market conditions; and\n- \uf02d Depositor and investor behaviour.\n\n## Sources of risk (audited)\n\n## C Caappiittaall\n\nThe eligibility of instruments and financial resources as regulatory capital is laid down by applicable regulation. Capital is categorised under two tiers (Tier 1 and Tier 2) according to the ability to absorb losses, degree of permanency and the ranking of absorbing losses on either a going or gone concern basis. There are three broad categories of capital across these two tiers:\n\n- \uf02d CET1 capital - CET1 capital must be perpetual and capable of unrestricted and immediate use to cover risks or losses as soon as these occur. This includes ordinary shares issued and retained earnings.\n- \uf02d Tier 2 capital - Tier 2 capital is supplementary capital and provides loss absorption on a gone concern basis. Tier 2 capital absorbs losses after Tier 1 capital. It typically consists of subordinated debt securities with a minimum maturity of five years at the point of issuance.\n- \uf02d Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital - This is the second type of loss absorbing capital and must be capable of absorbing losses on a going concern basis. These instruments are either written down or converted into CET1 capital when the CET1 ratio falls below a pre-specified level.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n249\n\n## M Miinniimmuumm  rreeqquuiirreemmeenntt  ffoorr  oowwnn  ffuunnddss  aanndd  eelliiggiibbllee  lliiaabbiilliittiieess ( (MMRREELL))\n\nIn addition to capital, other specific loss-absorbing instruments, including senior notes issued by NatWest Group, may be used to cover certain gone concern capital requirements, which is referred to as MREL. Gone concern refers to the situation in which resources must be available to enable an orderly resolution, in the event that the Bank of England (BoE) deems that NatWest Group has failed or is likely to fail.\n\n## L Liiqquuiiddiittyy\n\nNatWest Group maintains a prudent approach to the definition of liquidity resources. NatWest Group manages its liquidity to ensure it is always available when and where required, taking into account regulatory, legal and other constraints. Following ring-fencing legislation, liquidity is no longer considered fungible across NatWest Group. Principal liquidity portfolios are maintained in the UK Domestic Liquidity Sub-Group (UK DoLSub) (primarily in NatWest Bank Plc), UBIDAC, NatWest Markets Plc, RBS International Limited and NWM N.V.. Some disclosures in this section where relevant are presented, on a consolidated basis, for NatWest Group, the UK DoLSub and on a solo basis for NatWest Markets Plc.\n\nLiquidity resources are divided into primary and secondary liquidity as follows:\n\n- \uf02d Primary liquid assets include cash and balances at central banks, Treasury bills and other high quality government and supranational securities.\n- \uf02d Secondary liquid assets are eligible as collateral for local central bank liquidity facilities. These assets include ownissued securitisations or whole loans that are retained on balance sheet and pre-positioned with a central bank so that they may be converted into additional sources of liquidity at very short notice.\n\n## F Fuunnddiinngg\n\nNatWest Group maintains a diversified set of funding sources, including customer deposits, wholesale deposits and term debt issuance. NatWest Group also retains access to central bank funding facilities.\n\nFor further details on capital constituents and the regulatory framework covering capital, liquidity and funding requirements, please refer to the NatWest Group Pillar 3 Report 2021 Capital, liquidity and funding section.\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management",

Capital is managed within the organisation at the following levels; NatWest Group consolidated, NWH Group sub consolidated, NatWest Markets Plc, NatWest Markets N.V. and RBS International Limited. The banking subsidiaries within NWH Group are governed by the same principles, processes and management as NatWest Group. Note that although the aforementioned entities are regulated in line with Basel III principles, local implementation of the framework differs across geographies.\n\nCapital planning is integrated into NatWest Group's wider annual budgeting process and is assessed and updated at least monthly. Regular returns are submitted to the PRA which include a two-year rolling forecast view. Other elements of capital management, including risk appetite and stress testing, are set out on pages 192 and 193.\n\n## Produce capital plans\n\n## Assess capital adequacy\n\n## Inform capital actions\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n250\n\nCapital plans are produced for NatWest Group, its key operating entities and its businesses over a five year planning horizon under expected and stress conditions. Stressed capital plans are produced to support internal stress testing in the ICAAP for regulatory purposes.\n\nShorter term forecasts are developed frequently in response to actual performance, changes in internal and external business environment and to manage risks and opportunities.\n\nCapital plans are developed to maintain capital of sufficient quantity and quality to support NatWest Group's business, its subsidiaries and strategic plans over the planning horizon within approved risk appetite, as determined via stress testing, and minimum regulatory requirements.\n\nCapital resources and capital requirements are assessed across a defined planning horizon.\n\nImpact assessment captures input from across NatWest Group including from businesses.\n\nCapital planning informs potential capital actions including buy backs, redemptions, dividends and new issuance to external investors or via internal transactions.\n\nDecisions on capital actions will be influenced by strategic and regulatory requirements, risk appetite, costs and prevailing market conditions.\n\nAs part of capital planning, NatWest Group will monitor its portfolio of external capital securities and assess the optimal blend and most cost effective means of financing.\n\nCapital planning is one of the tools that NatWest Group uses to monitor and manage capital risk on a going and gone concern basis, including the risk of excessive leverage.\n\n## Liquidity risk management\n\nNatWest Group manages its liquidity risk taking into account regulatory, legal and other constraints to ensure sufficient liquidity is available where required to cover liquidity stresses. The principal levels at which liquidity risk is managed are:\n\n- \uf02d NatWest Group\n- \uf02d UK DoLSub\n- \uf02d NatWest Holdings Group\n- \uf02d UBIDAC\n- \uf02d NatWest Markets Securities Inc.\n- \uf02d NatWest Markets Plc\n- \uf02d RBS International Limited\n- \uf02d NWM N.V.\n\n2020 2019 The UK DoLSub is PRA regulated and comprises NatWest Group's four licensed deposit-taking UK banks: National Westminster Bank Plc (NWB Plc), The Royal Bank of Scotland plc (RBS plc), Coutts & Company and Ulster Bank Limited. On 3 May 2021, the Ulster Bank Limited business transferred to National Westminster Bank Plc. Ulster Bank Limited was removed from the UK DoLSub effective 1 January 2022. The planned removal of the Ulster Bank Limited license remains subject to regulatory applications and approvals.\n\nNatWest Group categorises its liquidity portfolio, including its locally managed liquidity portfolios, into primary and secondary liquid assets. The size of the liquidity portfolios are determined by referencing NatWest Group's liquidity risk appetite. NatWest Group retains a prudent approach to setting the composition of the liquidity portfolios, which is subject to internal policies applicable to all entities and limits over quality of counterparty, maturity mix and currency mix.\n\nRBS International Limited, NWM N.V. and UBIDAC hold locally managed portfolios that comply with local regulations that may differ from PRA rules.\n\nThe liquidity value of the portfolio is determined by taking current market prices and applying a discount or haircut, to give a liquidity value that represents the amount of cash that can be generated by the asset.\n\n## Funding risk management\n\nNatWest Group manages funding risk through a comprehensive framework which measures and monitors the funding risk on the balance sheet including quantitative and qualitative analysis of the behavioural aspects of its assets and liabilities as well as the funding concentration.\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Capital, liquidity and funding risk continued Key points\n\nCET1 ratio (CRR end-point)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 2 2002211                      1188..22%%   |                                     | The CET1 ratio decreased 30 basis points over the period, due to a \u00a32.9 billion  decrease in CET1 and a \u00a313.3 billion decrease in RWAs.

In practice, the behavioural profiles of many liabilities show greater stability and longer maturity than the contractual maturity. This is particularly true of many types of retail and corporate deposits which, despite being repayable on demand or at short notice, have demonstrated very stable characteristics even in periods of acute stress.\n\nIn its analysis to assess and manage asset and liability maturity gaps, NatWest Group determines the expected customer behaviour through qualitative and quantitative techniques. These incorporate observed customer behaviours over long periods of time. This analysis is subject to governance through NatWest Group ALCo Technical committee down to a segment level. The net behavioural funding surplus/(gap) and contractual maturity analysis is set out below.\n\n|                                 | Contractual maturity   | Contractual maturity   | Contractual maturity       | Contractual maturity   | Contractual maturity   | Contractual maturity   | Contractual maturity       | Contractual maturity   | Contractual maturity            | Contractual maturity   | Contractual maturity       | Contractual maturity   | Behavioural maturity   | Behavioural maturity   | Behavioural maturity       | Behavioural maturity   |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                 | Loans to customers     | Loans to customers     | Loans to customers         | Loans to customers     | Customer accounts      | Customer accounts      | Customer accounts          | Customer accounts      | Net surplus/(gap)               | Net surplus/(gap)      | Net surplus/(gap)          | Net surplus/(gap)      | Net surplus/(gap)      | Net surplus/(gap)      | Net surplus/(gap)          | Net surplus/(gap)      |\n| 2021                            | Less  than  1 year \u00a3bn | 1-5  years \u00a3bn         | Greater  than 5  years \u00a3bn | Total \u00a3bn              | Less  than 1  year \u00a3bn | 1-5  years \u00a3bn         | Greater  than 5  years \u00a3bn | Total \u00a3bn              | Less  than 1  year1-5 years \u00a3bn | \u00a3bn                    | Greater  than 5  years \u00a3bn | Total \u00a3bn              | Less  than 1  year \u00a3bn | 1-5  years \u00a3bn         | Greater  than 5  years \u00a3bn | Total \u00a3bn              |\n| Retail Banking                  | 12                     | 39                     | 131                        | 182                    | 188                    | 1                      | -

The typical characteristics that support encumbrance are an ability to pledge those assets to another counterparty or entity through operation of law without necessarily requiring prior notification, homogeneity, predictable and measurable cash flows, and a consistent and uniform underwriting and collection process. Retail assets including residential mortgages, credit card receivables and personal loans display many of these features.\n\nNatWest Group categorises its assets into four broad groups, those that are:\n\n- \uf02d Already encumbered and used to support funding currently in place through own-asset securitisations, covered bonds and securities repurchase agreements.\n- \uf02d Ring-fenced to meet regulatory requirements, where NatWest Group has in place an operational continuity in resolution (OCIR) investment mandate wherein the PRA requires critical service providers to hold segregated liquidity buffers covering at least 50% of their annual fixed overheads.\n- \uf02d Pre-positioned with central banks as part of funding schemes and those encumbered under such schemes.\n- \uf02d Not currently encumbered. In this category, NatWest Group has in place an enablement programme which seeks to identify assets capable of being encumbered and to identify the actions to facilitate such encumbrance whilst not affecting customer relationships or servicing.\n\nProgrammes to manage the use of assets to actively support funding are established within UK DoLSub, UBIDAC and NatWest Markets Plc.\n\n## Balance sheet encumbrance\n\nThe table shows the retained encumbrance assets of NatWest Group.\n\n|                                                                | Encumbered as a result of transactions with counterparties other than central banks   | Encumbered as a result of transactions with counterparties other than central banks   | Encumbered as a result of transactions with counterparties other than central banks   | Pre-positioned                      | Collateral ring-fenced         | Unencumbered assets not pre-positioned with central banks   | Unencumbered assets not pre-positioned with central banks   | Unencumbered assets not pre-positioned with central banks   | Unencumbered assets not pre-positioned with central banks   |                   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                                | Covered debts & securitisa-                                                           | SFT, derivatives and similar                                                          | Total                                                                                 | & encumbered assets held at central | to meet regulatory requirement | Readily available                                           | Other available                                             | Cannot be used                                              |                                                             | Total             |\n|                                                                | tions (1)                                                                             | (2,3)                                                                                 | (4)                                                                                   | banks (5)                           | (6)                            | (7)                                                         | (8)                                                         | (9)                                                         | Total                                                       | (10)              |\n| 2021                                                           | \u00a3bn                                                                                   | \u00a3bn                                                                                   | \u00a3bn                                                                                   | \u00a3bn                                 | \u00a3bn                            | \u00a3bn                                                         | \u00a3bn                                                         | \u00a3bn                                                         | \u00a3bn                                                         | \u00a3bn               |\n| Cash and balances at central                                   |                                                                                       |                                                                                       |                                                                                       |                                     |                                |                                                             |                                                             |                                                             |                                                             |                   |\n| banks                                                          | -

        "page_content": "## Market risk (audited)\n\nNatWest Group is exposed to non-traded market risk through its banking activities and to traded market risk through its trading activities. Non-traded and traded market risk exposures are managed and discussed separately. The non-traded market risk section begins below. The traded market risk section begins on page 274. Pension-related activities also give rise to market risk. Refer to page 278 for more information on risk related to pensions.\n\n## Non-traded market risk\n\n## Definition (audited)\n\nNon-traded market risk is the risk to the value of assets or liabilities outside the trading book, or the risk to income, that arises from changes in market prices such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices, or from changes in managed rates.\n\n## Sources of risk (audited)\n\nThe key sources of non-traded market risk are interest rate risk, credit spread risk, foreign exchange risk, equity risk and accounting volatility risk.\n\nFor detailed qualitative and quantitative information on each of these risk types, refer to the separate sub-sections following the VaR table below.\n\n## Key developments in 2021\n\n- \uf02d As inflationary pressures increased in 2021, market expectations regarding the future path of interest rates changed. The five-year sterling overnight index interest rate swap rate rose from -0.01% at 31 December 2020 to 1.05% at 31 December 2021. The corresponding ten-year rate rose from 0.16% to 0.95%. At 31 December 2021 market rates implied several increases in the UK base rate from 0.25%; at 31 December 2020 they had implied potential cuts to the rate from 0.1%.\n- \uf02d The sensitivity of net interest earnings to a 25 basis point upward shift in the market-implied yield curve was a cumulative \u00a31,183 million over three years at 31 December 2021, down from \u00a31,455 million at 31 December 2020. The decrease partly reflected the higher impact of central bank policy rates in the market-implied curve at 31 December 2021.\n- \uf02d NatWest Group's structural hedge of equity and deposits provides some protection against volatility in interest rates. Notably, the product structural hedge notional, which captures deposits in the Retail and Commercial Banking franchises, increased from \u00a3169 billion at 31 December 2020 to \u00a3206 billion at 31 December 2021 as more balances were included in the hedging programme. This increase mainly reflected the significant growth in customer deposits during the pandemic.\n- \uf02d Although swap rates began to rise in H2 2021, the yield on the structural hedge fell from 1.06% to 0.75%. This mainly resulted from maturing of swaps and increased hedging. Increased volumes are initially hedged at shorter dates to ensure an evenly amortising risk profile. The reduction in fixed yield also, in part, reflects the transition from LIBOR to the SONIA benchmark. New hedges are indexed against SONIA, which is a risk-free benchmark and therefore has a lower outright coupon.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n266\n\n- \uf02d Sterling strengthened against the euro, to 1.19 at 31 December 2021 compared to 1.11 at 31 December 2020. It weakened slightly against the US dollar, to 1.35 at 31 December 2021 compared to 1.37 at 31 December 2020. Structural foreign currency exposures decreased, in sterling equivalent terms, over the year, mainly driven by increased hedging of NatWest Holdings' investment in UBIDAC.\n\n## Governance (audited)\n\nResponsibility for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling market risk arising from non-trading activities lies with the relevant business. Oversight is provided by the independent Risk function.\n\nRisk positions are reported regularly to the Executive Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee, as well as to the Asset & Liability Management Committee. Non-traded market risk policy sets out the governance and risk management framework.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nNatWest Group's qualitative appetite is set out in the nontraded market risk appetite statement.\n\nIts quantitative appetite is expressed in terms of value-at-risk (VaR), stressed value-at-risk (SVaR), sensitivity and stress limits, and earnings-at-risk limits.\n\nThe limits are reviewed to reflect changes in risk appetite, business plans, portfolio composition and the market and economic environments. To ensure approved limits are not breached and that NatWest Group remains within its risk appetite, triggers have been set and are actively managed.

        "page_content": "## Non-traded market risk continued Interest rate risk\n\nNon-traded interest rate risk (NTIRR) arises from the provision to customers of a range of banking products with differing interest rate characteristics. When aggregated, these products form portfolios of assets and liabilities with varying degrees of sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Mismatches can give rise to volatility in net interest income as interest rates vary.\n\nNTIRR comprises the following three primary risk types:\n\n- \uf02d Gap risk: arises from the timing of rate changes in nontrading book instruments. The extent of gap risk depends on whether changes to the term structure of interest rates occur consistently across the yield curve (parallel risk) or differentially by period (non-parallel risk).\n- \uf02d Basis risk: captures the impact of relative changes in interest rates for financial instruments that have similar tenors but are priced using different interest rate indices, or on the same interest rate indices but with different tenors.\n- \uf02d Option risk: arises from option derivative positions or from optional elements embedded in assets, liabilities and/or offbalance sheet items, where NatWest Group or its customer can alter the level and timing of their cash flows. Option risk also includes pipeline risk.\n\nTo manage exposures within its risk appetite, NatWest Group aggregates interest rate positions and hedges its residual exposure, primarily with interest rate swaps.\n\nStructural hedging aims to reduce gap risk and the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate shocks. It also provides some protection against prolonged periods of falling rates. Structural hedging is explained in greater detail below, followed by information on how NatWest Group measures NTIRR from both an economic value-based and an earnings-based perspective.\n\n## S Sttrruuccttuurraall  hheeddggiinngg\n\nNatWest Group has a significant pool of stable, non and low interest-bearing liabilities, principally comprising equity and money transmission accounts. These balances are usually hedged, either by investing directly in longer-term fixed-rate assets (such as fixed-rate mortgages or UK government gilts) or by using interest rate swaps, which are generally booked as cash flow hedges of floating-rate assets, in order to provide a consistent and predictable revenue stream.\n\nAfter hedging the net interest rate exposure externally, NatWest Group allocates income to equity or products in structural hedges by reference to the relevant interest rate swap curve. Over time, this approach has provided a basis for stable income attribution to products and interest rate returns. The programme aims to track a time series of medium-term swap rates, but the yield will be affected by changes in product volumes and NatWest Group's capital composition.\n\nThe table below shows the total income and total yield, incremental income relative to short-term cash rates, and the period-end and average notional balances allocated to equity and products in respect of the structural hedges managed by NatWest Group.\n\n|                            | 2021                  | 2021            | 2021                    | 2021                 | 2021          | 2020                  | 2020            | 2020                    | 2020                 | 2020          |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|---------------|\n|                            | Incremental income \u00a3m | Total income \u00a3m | Period end notional \u00a3bn | Average notional \u00a3bn | Total yield % | Incremental income \u00a3m | Total income \u00a3m | Period end notional \u00a3bn | Average notional \u00a3bn | Total yield % |\n| Equity structural hedging  | 426                   | 448             | 21                      | 22                   | 2.05          | 478                   | 580             | 23                      | 24                   | 2.43          |\n| Product structural hedging | 744                   | 861             | 161                     | 145                  | 0.59          | 543                   | 958             | 125                     | 115                  | 0.83          |\n| Other structural hedges    | 139                   | 115             | 24                      | 23                   | 0.51          | 119                   | 150             | 21                      | 20                   | 0.73          |\n| Total                      | 1,309                 | 1,424           | 206                     | 190                  | 0.75          | 1,140                 | 1,688           | 169                     | 159                  | 1.06          |\n\nEquity structural hedges refer to income allocated primarily to equity and reserves.

Other structural hedges refer to hedges managed by UBIDAC, Private Banking, Ulster Bank Limited and RBS International. Hedges associated with Ulster Bank Limited were moved from other structural hedges to product hedges in H1 2021 as Ulster Bank Limited products migrated to NatWest Bank Plc.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, approximately 93% by notional of total structural hedges were sterling-denominated.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n268\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Non-traded market risk continued\n\nThe following table presents the incremental income associated with product structural hedges at segment level.\n\n|                    |   2021 \u00a3m |   2020 \u00a3m |\n|--------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Retail Banking     |       346 |       251 |\n| Commercial Banking |       398 |       292 |\n| Total              |       744 |       543 |\n\n- \uf02d The increase in hedge notional, on a period-end basis, mainly resulted from increased hedging of Personal and Commercial deposits. This reflected the increase in underlying customer deposit balances.\n- \uf02d The five-year sterling swap rate rose to 1.05% at the end of December 2021 from -0.01% at the end of December 2020. The ten-year sterling swap rate also rose, from 0.16% to 0.95%. Despite the swap rate rises, the yield of the structural hedge fell. This was partly due to the full-year impact of hedges booked in 2020 and the impact of hedging balance growth, where new hedges may be booked initially at shorter maturities than five or ten years and therefore attract a lower coupon than the five or ten-year swap rate.\n- \uf02d During 2021, sterling-denominated structural hedges were migrated from LIBOR to a SONIA index. US dollardenominated structural hedges were migrated from LIBOR to a SOFR index. Because SONIA and SOFR are risk-free benchmarks, as maturing hedges are replaced the yield going forward will increasingly reflect the lack of risk premium. Euro-denominated hedges remain indexed against EURIBOR.\n\nNTIRR can be measured using value-based or earnings-based approaches. Value-based approaches measure the change in value of the balance sheet assets and liabilities including all cash flows. Earnings-based approaches measure the potential impact on the income statement of changes in interest rates over a defined horizon, generally one to three years.\n\nNatWest Group uses VaR as its value-based approach and sensitivity of net interest earnings as its earnings-based approach.\n\nThese two approaches provide complementary views of the impact of interest rate risk on the balance sheet at a point in time. The scenarios employed in the net interest earnings sensitivity approach may incorporate assumptions about how NatWest Group and its customers will respond to a change in the level of interest rates. In contrast, the VaR approach measures the sensitivity of the balance sheet at a point in time. Capturing all cash flows, VaR also highlights the impact of duration and repricing risks beyond the one-to-three-year period shown in earnings sensitivity calculations.\n\n## V Vaalluuee--aatt--rriisskk\n\nVaR is a statistical estimate of the potential change in the market value of a portfolio (and, thus, the impact on the income statement) over a specified time horizon at a given confidence level.\n\nNatWest Group's standard VaR metrics - which assume a time horizon of one trading day and a confidence level of 99% - are based on interest rate repricing gaps at the reporting date. Daily rate moves are modelled using observations from the last 500 business days. These incorporate customer products plus associated funding and hedging transactions as well as non-financial assets and liabilities. Behavioural assumptions are applied as appropriate.\n\nThe non-traded interest rate risk VaR metrics for NatWest Group's retail and commercial banking activities are included in the banking book VaR table presented earlier in this section. The VaR captures the risk resulting from mismatches in the repricing dates of assets and liabilities.\n\nIt also includes any mismatch between the maturity profile of external hedges and NatWest Group's target maturity profile for the hedge.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n269\n\nRisk and capital management Risk and capital management Risk and capital management",

A simple scenario is shown that projects forward earnings based on the 31 December 2021 balance sheet, which is assumed to remain constant. An earnings projection is derived from the market-implied curve, which is then subject to interest rate shocks. The difference between the market-implied projection and the shock gives an indication of underlying sensitivity to interest rate movements.\n\nReported sensitivities should not be considered a forecast of future performance in these rate scenarios. Actions that could reduce interest earnings sensitivity include changes in pricing strategies on customer loans and deposits as well as hedging. Management action may also be taken to stabilise total income also taking into account non-interest income.\n\n## Three-year 25-basis-point sensitivity table\n\nThe table below shows the sensitivity of net interest earnings for both structural hedges and managed rate accounts - on a one, two and three-year forward-looking basis to an upward or downward interest rate shift of 25 basis points.\n\nIn the upward rate scenario, yield curves were assumed to move in parallel, at both year-ends.\n\nThe downward rate scenario at both year-ends allows interest rates to fall to negative rates.\n\n|                   | +25 basis points upward shift   | +25 basis points upward shift   | +25 basis points upward shift   | -25 basis points downward shift   | -25 basis points downward shift   | -25 basis points downward shift   |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| 2021              | Year 1 \u00a3m                       | Year 2 (1) \u00a3m                   | Year 3 (1) \u00a3m                   | Year 1 \u00a3m                         | Year 2 (1) \u00a3m                     | Year 3 (1) \u00a3m                     |\n| Structural hedges | 43                              | 144                             | 235                             | (43)                              | (144)                             | (235)                             |\n| Managed margin    | 282                             | 220                             | 255                             | (255)                             | (209)                             | (187)                             |\n| Other             | 4                               |                                 |                                 | (5)                               |                                   |                                   |\n| Total             | 329                             | 364                             | 490                             | (303)                             | (353)                             | (422)                             |\n| 2020              |                                 |                                 |                                 |                                   |                                   |                                   |\n| Structural hedges | 37                              | 118                             | 199                             | (37)                              | (118)                             | (199)                             |\n| Managed margin    | 319                             | 380                             | 387                             | (258)                             | (285)                             | (292)                             |\n| Other             | 15                              |                                 |                                 | (20)                              |                                   |                                   |\n| Total             | 371                             | 498                             | 586                             | (315)                             | (403)                             | (491)                             |\n\n- \uf02d The increase in structural hedge sensitivity at 31 December 2021 reflects the increase in the hedge notional since 31 December 2020.\n\n\uf02d\n\n- The reduction in managed margin sensitivity in the upward and downward 25-basis-point rate shifts as well as in the upward 100-basis-point shift partly reflects the higher level of interest rates at 31 December 2021 compared to 31 December 2020. In the market-implied projection, the UK base rate is projected to rise several times from 0.25% over the three years from 31 December 2021. The UK base rate had been projected to fall below 0.1% over the three years from 31 December 2020. When interest rates are higher, the pricing response to further unexpected shifts in rates differs from the response when rates are very low or negative.\n\n## One-year 25 and 100-basis-point sensitivity table\n\nThe following table analyses the one-year scenarios by currency and, in addition, shows the impact over one year of a 100-basispoint upward shift in all interest rates.\n\n|           | 2021 Shifts in yield curve   | 2021 Shifts in yield curve   | 2021 Shifts in yield curve   | 2020 Shifts in yield curve   | 2020 Shifts in yield curve   | 2020 Shifts in yield curve   |\n|-----------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n|           | +25                          | -25                          | +100                         | +25                          | -25                          | +100                         |\n|           | basis points                 | basis points                 | basis points                 | basis points                 | basis points                 | basis points                 |\n|           | \u00a3m                           | \u00a3m                           | \u00a3m                           | \u00a3m                           | \u00a3m                           | \u00a3m                           |\n| Euro      | 20                           | (3)                          | 129                          | 7                            | (6)                          | 99                           |\n| Sterling  | 267                          | (264)                        | 969                          | 336                          | (287)                        | 1,109                        |\n| US dollar | 40                           | (33)                         | 143                          | 26                           | (22)                         | 102                          |\n| Other     | 2                            | (3)                          | 10                           | 2                            | -                            | 7                            |\n| Total     | 329                          | (303)                        | 1,251                        | 371                          | (315)                        | 1,317                        |\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n270\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Non-traded market risk continued\n\n## S Seennssiittiivviittyy  ooff  ffaaiirr  vvaalluuee  tthhrroouugghh  ootthheerr  ccoommpprreehheennssiivvee  iinnccoommee  ((FFVVOOCCII))  aanndd  ccaasshh  ffllooww  hheeddggiinngg  rreesseerrvveess  ttoo  iinntteerreesstt  rraattee m moovveemmeennttss\n\nNatWest Group holds most of the bonds in its liquidity portfolio at fair value. Valuation changes that are not hedged (or not in effective hedge accounting relationships) are recognised in FVOCI reserves.\n\nInterest rate swaps are used to implement the structural hedging programme and also hedging of some personal and commercial lending portfolios, primarily fixed-rate mortgages. Generally, these swaps are booked in hedge accounting relationships. Changes in the valuation of swaps that are in effective cash flow hedge accounting relationships are recognised in cash flow hedge reserves.\n\nThe table below shows the sensitivity of FVOCI reserves and cash flow hedge reserves to a parallel shift in all rates. In this analysis, interest rates have not been floored at zero. Cash flow hedges are assumed to be fully effective and interest rate hedges of bonds in the liquidity portfolio are also assumed to be subject to fully effective hedge accounting. Hedge accounting ineffectiveness would result in some deviation from the results below, with some gains or losses recognised in P&L instead of reserves. Hedge ineffectiveness P&L is monitored, and the effectiveness of cash flow and fair value hedge relationships is regularly tested in accordance with IFRS requirements. Note that a movement in the FVOCI reserve would have an impact on CET1 capital but a movement in the cash flow hedge reserve would not be expected to do so. Volatility in both reserves affects tangible net asset value.\n\n|                          | 2021   | 2021   | 2021                                                                 | 2021   | 2020             | 2020   | 2020                                                | 2020   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|\n|                          |        |        | +25 basis points -25 basis points +100 basis points-100 basis points |        | +25 basis points |        | -25 basis points+100 basis points -100 basis points |        |\n|                          | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m                                                                   | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m                                                  | \u00a3m     |\n| FVOCI reserves           | (46)   | 45     | (187)                                                                | 174    | (50)             | 48     | (207)                                               | 181    |\n| Cash flow hedge reserves | (210)  | 214    | (820)                                                                | 877    | (108)            | 109    | (421)                                               | 447    |\n| Total                    | (256)  | 259    | (1,007)                                                              | 1,051  | (158)            | 157    | (628)                                               | 628    |\n\n- \uf02d The main driver of the increase in NatWest Group's cash flow hedge reserve sensitivity was the increase in interest rate swaps that form part of the structural hedge.

Additionally, other highquality bond portfolios are held for collateral purposes and to support payment systems.\n\nCredit spread risk is monitored daily through sensitivities and VaR measures. The dealing authorities in place for the bond portfolios further mitigate the risk by imposing constraints by duration, asset class and credit rating. Exposures and limit utilisations are reported to senior management on a daily basis.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nNon-traded foreign exchange risk arises from three main sources:\n\n- \uf02d Structural foreign exchange rate risk - arises from the capital deployed in foreign subsidiaries, branches and joint arrangements and related currency funding where it differs from sterling.\n- \uf02d Forecast earnings or costs in foreign currencies - NatWest Group assesses its potential exposure to forecast foreign currency income and expenses. NatWest Group hedges forward some forecast expenses.\n- \uf02d Non-trading book foreign exchange rate risk - arises from customer transactions and profits and losses that are in a currency other than the functional currency.\n\n## F Foorreeiiggnn  eexxcchhaannggee  rriisskk (audited)\n\nThe table below shows structural foreign currency exposures.\n\n| 2021               | Net investments in foreign operations \u00a3m   | Net investment hedges \u00a3m   | Structural foreign currency exposures pre-economic hedges \u00a3m   | Economic hedges (1) \u00a3m   | Residual Structural foreign currency exposures \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| US dollar          | 1,275                                      | (260)                      | 1,015                                                          | (1,015)                  | -                                                   |\n| Euro               | 6,222                                      | (2,669)                    | 3,553                                                          | -                        | 3,553                                               |\n| Other non-sterling | 990                                        | (421)                      | 569                                                            | -                        | 569                                                 |\n| Total              | 8,487                                      | (3,350)                    | 5,137                                                          | (1,015)                  | 4,122                                               |\n| 2020               |                                            |                            |                                                                |                          |                                                     |\n| US dollar          | 1,299                                      | (3)                        | 1,296                                                          | (1,296)                  | -                                                   |\n| Euro               | 6,485                                      | (829)                      | 5,656                                                          | -                        | 5,656                                               |\n| Other non-sterling | 1,077                                      | (350)                      | 727                                                            | -                        | 727                                                 |\n| Total              | 8,861                                      | (1,182)                    | 7,679                                                          | (1,296)                  | 6,383                                               |\n\n- \uf02d The decrease in net investments in foreign operations was partly driven by sterling strengthening against the euro.\n- \uf02d During the year, NatWest Group also increased net investment hedging in US dollar and other non-sterling currencies to reduce the potential impact on RWAs of changes to its regulatory foreign exchange hedging permission.\n- \uf02d The increase in the sterling value of net investment hedges was mainly driven by increased hedging of NatWest Holdings' investment in UBIDAC.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n272\n\n- \uf02d Changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect equity in proportion to structural foreign currency exposure. For example, a 5% strengthening or weakening in foreign currencies against sterling would result in a gain or loss of \u00a30.3 billion in equity respectively.\n\nThe most material non-traded open currency positions are the structural foreign exchange exposures arising from investments in foreign subsidiaries, branches and associates and their related currency funding. These exposures are assessed and managed to predefined risk appetite levels under delegated authority agreed by the CFO with support from the Asset & Liability Management Committee. NatWest Group seeks to limit the potential volatility impact on its CET1 ratio from exchange rate movements by maintaining a structural open currency position. Gains or losses arising from the retranslation of net investments in overseas operations are recognised in equity reserves and reduce the sensitivity of capital ratios to foreign exchange rate movements primarily arising from the retranslation of non-sterling denominated RWAs. Sensitivity is minimised where, for a given currency, the ratio of the structural open position to RWAs equals the CET1 ratio.\n\nThe sensitivity of this ratio to exchange rates is monitored monthly and reported to the Asset & Liability Management Committee at least quarterly. Foreign exchange exposures arising from customer transactions are sold down by businesses on a regular basis in line with NatWest Group policy.\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Non-traded market risk continued\n\n## Equity risk (audited)\n\nNon-traded equity risk is the potential variation in income and reserves arising from changes in equity valuations. Equity exposures may arise through strategic acquisitions, venture capital investments and restructuring arrangements.\n\nInvestments, acquisitions or disposals of a strategic nature are referred to the Acquisitions & Disposals Committee. Once approved by the CFO with support from the Acquisitions & Disposals Committee for execution, such transactions are referred for approval to the Board, the Executive Committee, the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer or as otherwise required. Decisions to acquire or hold equity positions in the non-trading book that are not of a strategic nature, such as customer restructurings, are taken by authorised persons with delegated authority.\n\nEquity positions are carried at fair value on the balance sheet based on market prices where available. If market prices are not available, fair value is based on appropriate valuation techniques or management estimates.\n\nThe table below shows the balance sheet carrying value of equity positions in the banking book.\n\n|                        |   2021 \u00a3m |   2020 \u00a3m |\n|------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Exchange-traded equity |        16 |        14 |\n| Private equity         |       160 |       160 |\n| Other                  |        66 |        78 |\n|                        |       242 |       252 |\n\nThe exposures may take the form of (i) equity shares listed on a recognised exchange, (ii) private equity shares defined as unlisted equity shares with no observable market parameters or (iii) other unlisted equity shares.\n\n|                                                       |   2021 \u00a3m | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Net realised gains arising from disposals             |         8 | (248)     |\n| Unrealised gains included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital |        88 | 82        |\n\n- \uf02d The losses on disposals in 2020 mainly reflected the disposal of SABB.\n\n## Accounting volatility risk\n\nAccounting volatility risk arises when an exposure is accounted for at amortised cost but economically hedged by a derivative that is accounted for at fair value. Although this is not an economic risk, the difference in accounting between the exposure and the hedge creates volatility in the income statement.\n\nAccounting volatility can be mitigated through hedge accounting. However, residual volatility will remain in cases where accounting rules mean that hedge accounting is not an option, or where there is some hedge ineffectiveness. Accounting volatility risk is reported to the Asset & Liability Management Committee monthly and capitalised as part of the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n273\n\nRisk and capital management Risk and capital management Risk and capital management",

These activities provide a range of financing, risk management and investment services to clients -including corporations and financial institutions -around the world. From a market risk perspective, activities are focused on rates; currencies; and traded credit. NatWest Group undertakes transactions in financial instruments including debt securities, as well as securities financing and derivatives.\n\nAll material traded market risk resides in NatWest Markets. The key categories are interest rate risk, credit spread risk and foreign currency price risk.\n\nTrading activities may also give rise to counterparty credit risk. For further detail refer to the Credit risk section.\n\n## Key developments in 2021\n\n- \uf02d The UK, US and eurozone economies rebounded strongly in 2021 following the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. However, inflation rose in H2 2021, in part due to global supply disruptions. This led to further market volatility, particularly in Rates, due to significant shifts in inflation expectations.\n- \uf02d Traded VaR remained within appetite, with an averagebasis year-on-year reduction driven by de-risking activity in line with the strategic focus on RWA reduction.\n\n## Governance (audited)\n\nMarket risk policy statements set out the governance and risk management framework. Responsibility for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling market risk arising from trading activities lies with the relevant trading business. The Market Risk function independently advises on, monitors and challenges the risk-taking activities undertaken by the trading business ensuring these are within the constraints of the market risk framework, policies, and risk appetite statements and measures.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nNatWest Group's qualitative appetite for traded market risk is set out in the traded market risk appetite statement. Quantitative appetite is expressed in terms of exposure limits. The limits at NatWest Group level comprise value-at-risk (VaR) and stressed value-at-risk (SVaR). More details on these are provided on the following pages.\n\nFor each trading business, a document known as a dealing authority compiles details of all applicable limits and trading restrictions. The desk-level mandates comprise qualitative limits related to the product types within the scope of each desk, as well as quantitative metrics specific to the desk's market risk exposures. These additional limits and metrics aim to control various risk dimensions such as exposure size, aged inventory, currency and tenor.\n\nThe limits are reviewed to reflect changes in risk appetite, business plans, portfolio composition and the market and economic environments and recalibrated to ensure that they remain aligned to NatWest Group RWA targets. Limit reviews focus on optimising the alignment between traded market risk exposure and capital usage.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n274\n\nTo ensure approved limits are not breached and that NatWest Group remains within its risk appetite, triggers have been set such that if exposures exceed a specified level, action plans are developed by the relevant business and the Market Risk function and implemented. For more detail on risk appetite and risk controls, refer to pages 192 and 193.\n\n## Monitoring and mitigation\n\nTraded market risk is identified and assessed by gathering, analysing, monitoring and reporting market risk information at desk, business, franchise and NatWest Group-wide levels. Industry expertise, continued system developments and techniques such as stress testing are also used to enhance the effectiveness of the identification and assessment of all material market risks.\n\nTraded market risk exposures are monitored against limits and analysed daily. A daily report summarising the position of exposures against limits at desk, business, franchise and NatWest Group levels is provided to senior management and market risk managers across the function. Limit reporting is supplemented with regulatory capital and stress testing information as well as ad-hoc reporting.\n\nA risk review of trading businesses is undertaken weekly with senior risk and front office staff. This includes a review of profit and loss drivers, notable position concentrations and other positions of concern.\n\nBusiness profit and loss performance is monitored automatically through loss triggers which, if breached, require a remedial action plan to be agreed between the Market Risk function and the business. The loss triggers are set using both a fall-from-peak approach and an absolute loss level. In addition, regular updates on traded market risk positions are provided to the Executive Risk Committee and Board Risk Committee.\n\n## Measurement\n\nNatWest Group uses VaR, SVaR and the incremental risk charge to measure traded market risk. Risks that are not adequately captured by VaR or SVaR are captured by the Risks Not In VaR (RNIV) framework to ensure that NatWest Group is adequately capitalised for market risk. In addition, stress testing is used to identify any vulnerabilities and potential losses.\n\nThe key inputs into these measurement methods are market data and risk factor sensitivities. Sensitivities refer to the changes in trade or portfolio value that result from small changes in market parameters that are subject to the market risk limit framework. Revaluation ladders are used in place of sensitivities to capture the impact of large moves in risk factors or the joint impact of two risk factors.\n\nThese methods have been designed to capture correlation effects and allow NatWest Group to form an aggregated view of its traded market risk across risk types, markets and business lines while also taking into account the characteristics of each risk type.\n\n## V Vaalluuee--aatt--rriisskk\n\nFor internal risk management purposes, VaR assumes a time horizon of one trading day and a confidence level of 99%.\n\nThe internal VaR model - which captures all trading book positions including those products approved by the regulator is based on a historical simulation, utilising market data from the previous 500 days on an equally-weighted basis.\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Traded market risk continued\n\nThe model also captures the potential impact of interest rate risk; credit spread risk; foreign currency price risk; equity price risk; and commodity price risk.\n\nWhen simulating potential movements in such risk factors, a combination of absolute, relative and rescaled returns is used.\n\nThe performance and adequacy of the VaR model are tested regularly through the following processes:\n\n- \uf02d Back-testing: Internal and regulatory back-testing is conducted on a daily basis. (Information on internal backtesting is provided in this section. Information on regulatory back-testing appears in the Pillar 3 Report).\n- \uf02d Model Risk Management review: As part of the model lifecycle, all risk models (including the VaR model) are independently reviewed to ensure the model is still fit for purpose given current market conditions and portfolio profile.

The extent of the diversification benefit depends on the correlation between the assets and risk factors in the portfolio at a particular time. The diversification factor is the sum of the VaR on individual risk types less the total portfolio VaR.\n- \uf02d Traded VaR increased in the first half of 2021 reflecting a rise in tenor basis risk in sterling flow trading.

SVaR is a VaR-based measure using historical data from a one-year period of stressed market conditions.\n\nA simulation of 99% VaR is run on the current portfolio for each 250-day period from 2005 to the current VaR date, moving forward one day at a time. The SVaR is the worst VaR outcome of the simulated results.\n\nThis is in contrast with VaR, which is based on a rolling 500-day historical data set. A time horizon of ten trading days is assumed with a confidence level of 99%.\n\nThe internal traded SVaR model captures all trading book positions.\n\n|                            | 2021       | 2021       | 2021       | 2021          | 2020       | 2020       | 2020       | 2020          |\n|----------------------------|------------|------------|------------|---------------|------------|------------|------------|---------------|\n|                            | Average \u00a3m | Maximum \u00a3m | Minimum \u00a3m | Period end \u00a3m | Average \u00a3m | Maximum \u00a3m | Minimum \u00a3m | Period end \u00a3m |\n| Total internal traded SVaR | 95         | 175        | 46         | 66            | 97         | 196        | 59         | 87            |\n\n- \uf02d Traded SVaR increased in the first half of 2021, reflecting a rise in tenor basis risk in sterling flow trading. This related to the transition from LIBOR to alternative risk-free rates.\n- \uf02d Traded SVaR subsequently decreased in the second half of the year following changes to the treatment of tenor basis risk in the VaR model.\n\n## R Riisskkss  NNoott  IInn  VVaaRR  ((RRNNIIVVss))\n\nThe RNIV framework is used to identify and quantify market risks that are not fully captured by the internal VaR and SVaR models.\n\nRNIV calculations form an integral part of ongoing model and data improvement efforts to capture all market risks in scope for model approval in VaR and SVaR.\n\nFor further qualitative and quantitative disclosures on RNIVs, refer to the Market risk section of the Pillar 3 Report.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n276\n\n## S Sttrreessss  tteessttiinngg\n\nFor information on stress testing, refer to page 193.\n\n## I Innccrreemmeennttaall  rriisskk  cchhaarrggee  ((IIRRCC))\n\nThe IRC model quantifies the impact of rating migration and default events on the market value of instruments with embedded credit risk (in particular, bonds and credit default swaps) held in the trading book.

        "page_content": "## Pension risk Definition\n\nPension risk is the risk to NatWest Group caused by its contractual or other liabilities to, or with respect to, a pension scheme (whether established for its employees or those of a related company or otherwise). It is also the risk that NatWest Group will make payments or other contributions to, or with respect to, a pension scheme because of a moral obligation or because NatWest Group considers that it needs to do so for some other reason.\n\n## Sources of risk\n\nNatWest Group has exposure to pension risk through its defined benefit schemes worldwide. The Main section of The NatWest Group Pension Fund (the Main section) is the largest source of pension risk with \u00a352.0 billion of assets and \u00a342.0 billion of liabilities at 31 December 2021 (2020 - \u00a351.3 billion of assets and \u00a343.9 billion of liabilities). Refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, for further details on NatWest Group's pension obligations, including sensitivities to the main risk factors.\n\nPension scheme liabilities vary with changes in long-term interest rates and inflation as well as with pensionable salaries, the longevity of scheme members and legislation. Pension scheme assets vary with changes in interest rates, inflation expectations, credit spreads, exchange rates, and equity and property prices. NatWest Group is exposed to the risk that the schemes' assets, together with future returns and additional future contributions, are estimated to be insufficient to meet liabilities as they fall due. In such circumstances, NatWest Group could be obliged (or might choose) to make additional contributions to the schemes or be required to hold additional capital to mitigate this risk.\n\n## Key developments in 2021\n\n- \uf02d There were no material changes to NatWest Group's exposure to pension risk during the year, and the overall position of the main defined benefit schemes that NatWest Group sponsors has improved.\n- \uf02d In line with the Memorandum of Understanding signed with the Trustee of the Main section in April 2018, a \u00a3500 million lump sum contribution was paid into the Main section, following the share buyback in 2021.\n- \uf02d The triennial actuarial valuation for the Main section, with an effective date of 31 December 2020, was completed on 14 December 2021. As the Main section was in surplus at this date, no deficit repair contributions were required, although there was a small increase in the level of contributions in relation to ongoing accrual of benefits.\n- \uf02d NatWest Group has exposure to a number of defined benefit pension schemes in the Republic of Ireland. Following the announcement to commence a phased withdrawal from the Republic of Ireland, an agreement was reached with each of the schemes' Trustees, on a timeframe for discussions on the future support arrangements for the schemes on completion of the phased withdrawal, with all parties sharing the objective of having new support arrangements in place by the end of 2022.\n- \uf02d As part of the transition of framework components to align to the requirements of the NatWest Group enterprise-wide risk management framework, an updated pension risk policy and risk appetite statement were developed in 2021.\n- \uf02d Following the changes to Ulster Bank Limited, it no longer participates in any of NatWest Group's defined benefit pension schemes. In particular, NatWest Bank Plc assumed responsibility as Principal Employer and the only participating employer in The Ulster Bank Pension Scheme in Northern Ireland. This will not affect NatWest Group's overall exposure to the Scheme.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n278\n\n## Governance\n\nChaired by the Chief Financial Officer, the Group Asset & Liability Management Committee is a key component of NatWest Group's approach to managing pension risk. It considers the pension impact of the capital plan for NatWest Group and reviews performance of NatWest Group's material pension funds and other issues material to NatWest Group's pension strategy. It also considers investment strategy proposals from the Trustee of the Main section.\n\nFor further information on governance, refer to page 190.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nNatWest Group maintains an independent view of the risk inherent in its pension funds. NatWest Group has an annually reviewed pension risk appetite statement incorporating defined metrics against which risk is measured.\n\nPolicies and standards are in place to provide formal controls for pension risk reporting, modelling, governance and stress testing. A pension risk policy, which sits within the NatWest Group enterprise-wide risk management framework, is also in place and is subject to associated framework controls.\n\n## Monitoring and measurement\n\nPension risk is monitored by the Executive Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee by way of the monthly Risk Management Report.\n\nNatWest Group also undertakes stress tests on its material defined benefit pension schemes each year. These tests are also used to satisfy the requests of regulatory bodies such as the Bank of England.\n\nThe stress testing framework includes pension risk capital calculations for the purposes of the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process as well as additional stress tests for a number of internal management purposes. The results of the stress tests and their consequential impact on NatWest Group's balance sheet, income statement and capital position are incorporated into the overall NatWest Group stress test results.\n\nNatWest Bank Plc (a subsidiary of NatWest Group) is the principal employer of the Main section and could be required to fund any deficit that arises.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nFollowing risk mitigation measures taken by the Trustee in recent years, the Main section is now well protected against interest rate and inflation risks and is being run on a low investment risk basis with relatively small equity risk exposure. The Main section also uses derivatives to manage the allocation of the portfolio to different asset classes and to manage risk within asset classes.\n\nThe potential impact of climate change is one of the factors considered in managing the assets of the Main section. The Trustee monitors the risk to its investments from changes in the global economy and invests, where return justifies the risk, in sectors that reduce the world's reliance on fossil fuels, or that may otherwise promote environmental benefits. Further details regarding the Main section Trustee's approach to managing climate change risk can be found in its Responsible Ownership Policy and its net zero commitment. The Trustee has reported in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures in its Annual Report and Accounts.\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Compliance & conduct risk Definition\n\nCompliance risk is the risk that the behaviour of NatWest Group towards customers fails to comply with laws, regulations, rules, standards and codes of conduct. Such a failure may lead to breaches of regulatory requirements, organisational standards or customer expectations and could result in legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or reputational damage.\n\nConduct risk is the risk that the conduct of NatWest Group and its subsidiaries and its staff towards customers - or in the markets in which it operates - leads to unfair or inappropriate customer outcomes and results in reputational damage, financial loss or both.\n\n## Sources of risk\n\nCompliance and conduct risks exist across all stages of NatWest Group's relationships with its customers and arise from a variety of activities including product design, marketing and sales, complaint handling, staff training, and handling of confidential inside information. As set out in Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements, members of NatWest Group are party to legal proceedings and are subject to investigation and other regulatory action in the UK, the US and other jurisdictions.\n\n## Key developments in 2021\n\n- \uf02d A new Ring-Fencing Hub was set up to provide an aggregated view of ring-fencing compliance and risk management. Oversight of the work to complete NatWest Group's attestation of compliance was also a key focus.\n- \uf02d Delivered a digital platform to facilitate risk-based rules mapping to regulatory obligations. This will enable more efficient management of regulatory compliance matters and support intelligent risk taking.\n- \uf02d Risk appetite statements and measures were updated with an enhanced focus to provide better visibility of key risks across NatWest Group.\n- \uf02d Continued collaboration across NatWest Group to deliver good customer outcomes with a focus on enhancing forbearance strategies.\n- \uf02d Oversight and management of major compliance programmes including work to upgrade NatWest Group's internal ratings based approach for credit risk in order to build better outcomes for customers.\n- \uf02d There was ongoing monitoring and mitigation of elevated conduct risks resulting from the phased withdrawal from the Republic of Ireland including data-driven risk profile reporting.\n- \uf02d Provided strategic oversight and advice to NatWest Group's LIBOR transition programme.\n\n## Governance\n\nNatWest Group defines appropriate standards of compliance and conduct and ensures adherence to those standards through its risk management framework. Relevant compliance and conduct matters are escalated through Executive Risk Committee and Board Risk Committee.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nRisk appetite for compliance and conduct risks is set at Board level. Risk appetite statements articulate the levels of risk that legal entities, businesses and functions work within when pursuing their strategic objectives and business plans. A range of controls is operated to ensure the business delivers good customer outcomes and is conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements. A suite of policies addressing compliance and conduct risks set appropriate standards across NatWest Group. Examples of these include the Complaints\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n279\n\nManagement Policy, Client Assets & Money Policy, and Product Lifecycle Policy as well as policies relating to customers in vulnerable situations, cross-border activities and market abuse. Continuous monitoring and targeted assurance is carried out as appropriate.\n\n## Monitoring and measurement\n\nCompliance and conduct risks are measured and managed through continuous assessment and reporting to NatWest Group's senior risk committees and at Board level. The compliance and conduct risk framework facilitates the consistent monitoring and measurement of compliance with laws and regulations and the delivery of consistently good customer outcomes. The first line of defence is responsible for effective risk identification, reporting and monitoring, with oversight, challenge and review by the second line. Compliance and conduct risk management is also integrated into NatWest Group's strategic planning cycle.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nActivity to mitigate the most-material compliance and conduct risks is carried out across NatWest Group with specific areas of focus in the customer-facing businesses and legal entities. Examples of mitigation include consideration of customer needs in business and product planning, targeted training, complaints management, as well as independent monitoring activity. Internal policies help support a strong customer focus across NatWest Group. Independent assessments of compliance with applicable regulations are also carried out at a legal entity level.\n\n## Financial crime risk Definition\n\nFinancial crime risk is presented by criminal activity in the form of money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery and corruption, sanctions and tax evasion, as well as fraud risk management.\n\n## Sources of risk\n\nFinancial crime risk may be presented if NatWest Group's customers, employees or third parties undertake or facilitate financial crime, or if NatWest Group's products or services are used to facilitate such crime. Financial crime risk is an inherent risk across all lines of business.\n\n## Key developments in 2021\n\n- \uf02d While work continues to enhance the control environment relating to financial crime risk, operational weaknesses between 2012 and 2016 resulted in the inadequate monitoring of a UK incorporated customer. NatWest Group co-operated fully with the regulator's investigation into this case and, in October 2021, NWB Plc pleaded guilty to three breaches of the Money Laundering Regulations 2007.\n- \uf02d Enhancements were made to technology and data analytics to improve the effectiveness of systems used to monitor customers and transactions.\n- \uf02d Significant investment continued to be made to support delivery of the multi-year transformation plan across financial crime risk management.\n- \uf02d A new financial crime and fraud goal was introduced for NatWest Group's most senior 150 employees to further embed financial crime risk management culture, behaviours, and accountabilities.\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management",

        "page_content": "## Financial crime risk continued\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Financial Crime Executive Steering Group, which is jointly chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Administrative Officer, is the core governance committee for financial crime (excluding fraud). It oversees financial crime risk management, operational performance, and transformation matters including decision-making and escalations to Executive Risk Committee, Board Risk Committee and NatWest Group Executive Committee.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nThere is no appetite to operate in an environment where systems and controls do not enable the identification, assessment, monitoring, management and mitigation of financial crime risk. NatWest Group's systems and controls must be comprehensive and proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of its businesses. There is no tolerance to systematically or repeatedly breach relevant financial crime regulations and laws.\n\nNatWest Group operates a framework of preventative and detective controls designed to mitigate the risk that it could facilitate financial crime. These controls are supported by a suite of policies, procedures and guidance to ensure they operate effectively.\n\n## Monitoring and measurement\n\nFinancial crime risks are identified and reported through continuous risk management and regular reporting to NatWest Group's senior risk committees and the NatWest Group Board. Quantitative and qualitative data is reviewed and assessed to measure whether financial crime risk is within risk appetite.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThrough the financial crime framework, relevant policies, systems, processes and controls are used to mitigate and manage financial crime risk. This includes the use of dedicated screening and monitoring systems and controls to identify people, organisations, transactions and behaviours that may require further investigation or other actions. Centralised expertise is available to detect and disrupt threats to NatWest Group and its customers. Intelligence is shared with law enforcement, regulators and government bodies to strengthen national and international defences against those who would misuse the financial system for criminal motives.\n\n## Climate risk\n\n## Definition\n\nClimate risk is the threat of financial loss or adverse nonfinancial impacts associated with climate change and the political, economic and environmental responses to it.\n\n## Sources of risk\n\nPhysical risks may arise from climate and weather-related events such as heatwaves, droughts, floods, storms and sea level rises. They can potentially result in financial losses, impairing asset values and the creditworthiness of borrowers. NatWest Group could be exposed to physical risks directly by the effects on its property portfolio and, indirectly, by the impacts on the wider economy as well as on the property and business interests of its customers.\n\nTransition risks may arise from the process of adjustment towards a low-carbon economy. Changes in policy, technology and sentiment could prompt reassessment of customers' financial risk and may lead to falls in the value of a large range of assets. NatWest Group could be exposed to transition risks\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n280\n\ndirectly through the costs of adaptation within economic sectors and markets as well as supply chain disruption leading to financial impacts on it and its customers. Potential indirect effects include the erosion of NatWest Group's competitiveness, profitability, or reputation damage.\n\n## Key developments in 2021\n\n- \uf02d A principles-based climate risk policy was approved by the Board Risk Committee and introduced in April 2021.\n- \uf02d NatWest Group participated in the Bank of England's Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES) exercise. In doing so, NatWest Group's capabilities regarding climate scenario analysis were strengthened in 2021 with increased coverage across the balance sheet.\n- \uf02d In December 2021, the Board approved a number of firstgeneration quantitative climate risk appetite measures. These will enable reporting of climate risk appetite and link business-as-usual risk management to NatWest Group's strategic goals and priorities.\n- \uf02d A new Climate Centre of Excellence was established to provide strategic horizon scanning, guidance and specialist climate expertise across NatWest Group.\n- \uf02d Personal credit risk: operational measures were developed. These will help to monitor the performance of the Personal mortgage portfolio.\n- \uf02d Wholesale credit risk: qualitative assessment of climate risk was made mandatory for the majority of the Wholesale portfolio. This was supported by enhancements to Transaction Acceptance Standards (TAS) criteria, with the inclusion of sector-specific climate considerations for the heightened risk sectors and generic climate considerations for all other TAS documents.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Board is responsible for monitoring and overseeing climate-related risk within NatWest Group's overall business strategy and risk appetite. The potential impact, likelihood and preparedness of climate-related risk is reported regularly to the Board Risk Committee and the Board.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer shares accountability with the CEO under the Senior Managers and Certification Regime for identifying and managing the financial risks arising from climate change. This includes ensuring that the financial risks from climate change are adequately reflected in risk management frameworks, and that NatWest Group can identify, measure, monitor, manage, and report on its exposure to these risks.\n\nThe Climate Change Executive Steering Group is responsible for overseeing the direction of and progress against NatWest Group's climate-related commitments. During 2021, the Executive Steering Group focused on overseeing the Group Climate Change Programme (GCCP), which was tasked with continuing to deliver both NatWest Group's climate strategy and the climate-related mandatory change agenda. The GCCP will close and transition activity into business-as-usual operations across NatWest Group's franchises and functions. The Executive Steering Group will continue to supervise strategic implementation and delivery, supported by the Climate Centre of Excellence.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nNatWest Group's ambition is to be a leading bank in the UK in helping to address climate change. The climate ambition is underpinned by activity to reduce the climate impact of financing activity by at least 50% by 2030 and to do what is necessary to achieve alignment with the 2015 Paris Agreement.\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Climate risk continued\n\nWork continued in 2021 to integrate climate-related risk into the risk management framework, including the development of appropriate risk appetite metrics. In December 2021, the NatWest Group Board approved the adoption of three firstgeneration climate risk appetite measures into the enterprisewide risk management framework, for integration into business-as-usual risk management.\n\nCombined with franchise specific operational limits, this suite of metrics will enable reporting of climate risk appetite to senior risk management forums and links risk management to NatWest Group's strategic goals and priorities.\n\n## Monitoring and measurement\n\nNatWest Group has focused on developing the capabilities to use scenario analysis to identify the most material climate risks and opportunities for its customers, seeking to harness insights to inform risk management practices and maximise the opportunities arising from a transition to a low carbon economy.\n\nScenario analysis allows NatWest Group to test a range of possible future climate pathways and understand the nature and magnitude of the risks they present. The purpose of scenario analysis is not to forecast the future but to understand and prepare to manage risks that could arise.\n\nIn 2021, activity was dominated by the Bank of England's CBES exercise. In accordance with Bank of England guidance, NatWest Group used three scenarios as the foundation for its analysis. These were broadly consistent with scenarios published by the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System:\n\nNo Additional Action: no new policy action takes place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This leads to more than 3\u00b0C of warming and severe physical risks. The frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as flooding and tropical cyclones increases, and there are chronic changes in labour and land productivity.\n\nEarly Action: global temperature increases are limited to 1.5\u00b0C by 2100 as a result of stringent climate policies and innovation starting in 2021. Carbon prices increase steadily between 20212050, which drives significant decarbonisation. Coal use falls by 98% between 2021 and 2050, and the share of low-carbon energy in the global energy mix increases from 17% to 73% over the same period. Global CO2 emissions reach net zero around 2050.\n\nLate Action: strong climate policies successfully limit warming to 1.8\u00b0C by 2100, but decisive policy action is delayed until 2031. Carbon prices increase rapidly between 2031-2050. Global greenhouse gas emissions fall by 80% between 2030 and 2050 leading to a higher level of transition risk during the period.\n\nIn 2021 for the CBES, NatWest Group applied these three climate scenarios to quantify climate risk across its balance sheet, including the full portfolio of wholesale customers and its entire UK commercial real estate and residential (retail) mortgage portfolio.\n\nTo ensure that climate risk is factored into the capital planning and budgeting process, NatWest Group is leveraging the CBES scenarios and analytics to support the business-as-usual scenario analysis processes, for example the base case is consistent with the Early Action CBES scenario. In addition, climate risks consistent with the Late Action CBES scenario have been integrated into one of the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process scenarios.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n281\n\nNatWest Group regularly considers existing and emerging regulatory requirements related to climate change. It continues to participate in several industry-wide initiatives to develop consistent risk measurement methodologies. NatWest Group is a founding signatory of the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative Principles for Responsible Banking, which aims to promote sustainable finance around the globe. In addition, NatWest Group is also represented on the Climate Financial Risk Forum established by the PRA and FCA to shape the financial service industry's response to the challenges posed by climate risk.\n\n## Operational risk\n\n## Definition\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or external events. It arises from day-to-day operations and is relevant to every aspect of the business.\n\n## Sources of risk\n\nOperational risk may arise from a failure to manage operations, systems, transactions and assets appropriately. This can take the form of human error, an inability to deliver change adequately or on time, the non-availability of technology services, or the loss of customer data. Systems failure, theft of NatWest Group property, information loss and the impact of natural, or man-made, disasters - as well as the threat of cyber attacks - are sources of operational risk. Operational risk can also arise from a failure to account for changes in law or regulations or to take appropriate measures to protect assets.\n\n## Key developments in 2021\n\n- \uf02d Aligned to the implementation of the enterprise-wide risk management framework, a new operational risk policy was approved in April 2021. The new policy sets out the qualitative expectations, guidance and standards that stipulate the nature and extent of permissible risk-taking for operational risk.\n- \uf02d Oversight of NatWest Group's transformation agenda particularly in relation to the second-order impacts of COVID-19 - remained a significant area of focus with activity being closely monitored and managed to protect key regulatory deliveries.\n- \uf02d Operational risk appetite was enhanced using a quantitative modelling approach to determine a meaningful quantitative expression of the maximum level of operational risk NatWest Group is willing to accept.\n- \uf02d There was also a continued focus on operational resilience to ensure planning, controls and operational activities remained robust and appropriate, with continuing attention on the potential operational risks arising from changes in working practices.\n- \uf02d There was sustained focus on reducing the risks associated with data use, particularly in terms of assuring data quality. This was aligned to the NatWest Group data strategy, designed to identify and implement enhancements to the effective use of data across NatWest Group.\n- \uf02d The security threat and the potential for cyber-attacks on NatWest Group and its supply chain continue to be closely monitored. During 2021, there was further investment in NatWest Group's defences in response to the evolving threat. There was also continuing focus on assuring the security of the supply chain.\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management",

Improved management of operational risk against defined appetite is vital for stability and reputational integrity.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nOperational risk appetite supports effective management of all operational risks. It expresses the level and types of operational risk NatWest Group is willing to accept to achieve its strategic objectives and business plans. NatWest Group's operational risk appetite statement encompasses the full range of operational risks faced by its legal entities, businesses and functions.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Control Environment Certification (CEC) process is a halfyearly self-assessment by the CEOs of NatWest Group's principal businesses, functions and legal entities. It provides a consistent and comparable view on the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control environment.\n\nCEC covers material risks and the underlying key controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls, as well as supporting risk management frameworks. The CEC outcomes, including forward-looking assessments for the next two half-yearly cycles and progress on control environment improvements, are reported to Group Audit Committee and Board Risk Committee. They are also shared with external auditors.\n\nThe CEC process helps to ensure compliance with the NatWest Group Policy Framework, Sarbanes-Oxley 404 requirements concerning internal control over financial reporting (as referenced in the Compliance report on page 181), and certain requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\nRisks are mitigated by applying key preventative and detective controls, an integral step in the risk assessment methodology which determines residual risk exposure. Control owners are accountable for the design, execution, performance and maintenance of key controls. Key controls are regularly assessed for adequacy and tested for effectiveness. The results are monitored and, where a material change in performance is identified, the associated risk is re-evaluated.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n282\n\n## Monitoring and measurement\n\nRisk and control assessments are used across all business areas and support functions to identify and assess material operational and conduct risks and key controls. All risks and controls are mapped to NatWest Group's Risk Directory. Risk assessments are refreshed at least annually to ensure they remain relevant and capture any emerging risks and also ensure risks are reassessed.\n\nThe process is designed to confirm that risks are effectively managed in line with risk appetite. Controls are tested at the appropriate frequency to verify that they remain fit-for-purpose and operate effectively to reduce identified risks.\n\nNatWest Group uses the standardised approach to calculate its Pillar 1 operational risk capital requirement. This is based on multiplying three years' average historical gross income by coefficients set by the regulator based on business line. As part of the wider Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process an operational risk economic capital model is used to assess Pillar 2A, which is a risk-sensitive add-on to Pillar 1. The model uses historical loss data (internal and external) and forward-looking scenario analysis to provide a risk-sensitive view of NatWest Group's Pillar 2A capital requirement.\n\nScenario analysis is used to assess how severe but plausible operational risks will affect NatWest Group. It provides a forward-looking basis for evaluating and managing operational risk exposures.\n\nRefer to the Capital, liquidity and funding risk section for operational risk capital requirement figures.\n\n## Operational resilience\n\nNatWest Group manages and monitors operational resilience through its risk and control assessment methodology. This is underpinned by setting and monitoring risk indicators and performance metrics for key business services. Progress continues on the response to regulator expectations on operational resilience, with involvement in a number of industry-wide operational resilience forums. This enables a more holistic view of the operational resilience risk profile and the pace of ongoing innovation and change, both internally and externally.\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Operational risk continued\n\n## E Evveenntt  aanndd  lloossss  ddaattaa  mmaannaaggeemmeenntt\n\nThe operational risk event and loss data management process ensures NatWest Group captures and records operational risk financial and non-financial events that meet defined criteria. Loss data is used for regulatory and industry reporting and is included in capital modelling when calculating economic capital for operational risk. The most serious events are escalated in a simple, standardised process to all senior management, by way of an Early Event Escalation Process.\n\nAll financial impacts and recoveries associated with an operational risk event are reported against the date they were recorded in NatWest Group's financial accounts. A single event can result in multiple losses (or recoveries) that may take time to crystallise. Losses and recoveries with a financial accounting date in 2021 may relate to events that occurred, or were identified in, prior years. NatWest Group purchases insurance against specific losses and to comply with statutory or contractual requirements.\n\n## P Peerrcceennttaaggee  aanndd  vvaalluuee  ooff  eevveennttss\n\nAt 31 December 2021, events aligned to the clients, products and business practices event category accounted for 80% of NatWest Group's operational risk losses, which reflected a significant increase on 2020. In 2020, several large provision releases were recorded (that is, previously recorded provisions were released back to cashflow as they were no longer required). The value of these outweighed the provisions taken for other conduct-related matters, hence a negative movement was recorded in the clients, products and business practices category.\n\n|                                            | Value of events   | Value of events   | Value of events   | Value of events   | Volume of events (1)   | Volume of events (1)   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                            | \u00a3m                | \u00a3m                | Proportion        | Proportion        | Proportion             | Proportion             |\n|                                            | 2021              | 2020              | 2021              | 2020              | 2021                   | 2020                   |\n| Fraud                                      | 74                | 85                | 17%               | 82%               | 87%                    | 81%                    |\n| Clients, products and business practices   | 341               | (68)              | 80%               | (66%)             | 3%                     | 7%                     |\n| Execution, delivery and process management | 8                 | 15                | 2%                | 15%               | 7%                     | 8%                     |\n| Employment practices and workplace safety  | 2                 | 2                 | -                 | 2%                | 2%                     | 2%                     |\n| Technology and infrastructure failures     | 3                 | 70                | 1%                | 68%               | 1%                     | 2%                     |\n| Disasters and public safety                | -                 | (1)               | -                 | (1%)              | -                      | -                      |\n|                                            | 428               | 103               | 100%              | 100%              | 100%                   | 100%                   |\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n283\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management",

NatWest Group defines a model as a quantitative method, system, or approach that applies statistical, economic, financial, accounting, mathematical or data science theories, techniques and assumptions to process input data into quantitative estimates.\n\n## Sources of risk\n\nNatWest Group uses a variety of models in the course of its business activities. Examples include the use of model outputs to support customer decisioning, measuring and assessing risk exposures (including credit, market, and climate risk), as well as calculating regulatory capital and liquidity requirements. Model applications may give rise to different risks depending on the franchise in which they are used. Model risk is therefore assessed separately for each franchise in addition to the overall assessment made for NatWest Group.\n\n## Key developments in 2021\n\n- \uf02d Improvements to models were made in 2021 resulting in a significant reduction of out-of-appetite models across NatWest Group. Enhancements to models will continue in 2022 to bring NatWest Group back within model risk appetite.\n- \uf02d Embedding and enhancement of the Model Risk frameworks.\n\n## Governance\n\nA governance framework is in place to ensure policies and processes relating to models are appropriate and effective. Two roles are key to this - Model Risk Owners and Model Risk Officers. Model Risk Owners are responsible for model approval and ongoing performance monitoring. Model Risk Officers, in the second line, are responsible for oversight, including ensuring that models are independently validated prior to use and on an ongoing basis aligned to the model's risk rating. Model risk matters are escalated to senior management in several ways. These include model risk oversight committees, as well as the relevant business and function model management committees. The Group Model Risk Oversight Committee provides a direct escalation route to the Group Executive Risk Committee and, where applicable, onwards to the Group Board Risk Committee.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nModel risk appetite is set in order to limit the level of model risk that NatWest Group is willing to accept in the course of its business activities. It is approved by relevant Executive Risk Committees. Business areas are responsible for monitoring performance against appetite and remediating models outside appetite.\n\n## Risk controls\n\nPolicies and procedures related to the development, validation, approval, implementation and use and ongoing monitoring of models are in place to ensure adequate control across the lifecycle of an individual model.\n\nValidation of material models is conducted by an independent risk function comprised of skilled, well-informed subject matter experts. This is completed for new models or amendments to existing models and as part of an ongoing periodic programme to assess model performance. The frequency of periodic validation is aligned to the risk rating of the model. The independent validation focuses on a variety of model features,\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n284\n\nincluding modelling approach, the nature of the assumptions used, the model's predictive ability and complexity, the data used in the model, its implementation and its compliance with regulation.\n\n## Risk monitoring and measurement\n\nThe level of risk relating to an individual model is assessed through a model risk rating. A quantitative approach is used to determine the risk rating of each model, based on the model's materiality and validation rating. This approach provides the basis for model risk appetite measures and enables model risk to be robustly monitored and managed across NatWest Group.\n\nOngoing performance monitoring is conducted by the first line and overseen by the second line to ensure parameter estimates and model constructs remain fit for purpose, model assumptions remain valid and that models are being used consistently with their intended purpose. This allows timely action to be taken to remediate poor model performance and/or any control gaps or weaknesses.\n\n## Risk mitigation\n\nBy their nature - as approximations of reality - model risk is inherent in the use of models. It is managed by refining or redeveloping models where appropriate - either due to changes in market conditions, business assumptions or processes - and by applying adjustments to model outputs (either quantitative or based on expert opinion). Enhancements may also be made to the process within which the model output is used in order to further limit risk levels.\n\n## Reputational risk Definition\n\nReputational Risk is defined as the risk of damage to stakeholder trust due to negative consequences arising from internal actions or external events.\n\n## Sources of risk\n\nReputational risks originate from internal actions and external events. The three primary drivers of reputational risk have been identified as: failure in internal execution; a conflict between NatWest Group's values and the public agenda; and contagion (when NatWest Group's reputation is damaged by failures in the wider financial sector).\n\n## Key developments in 2021\n\n- \uf02d Reputation risk registers were introduced at NatWest Group level in order to enhance monitoring of the most material reputational risks.\n- \uf02d The correlation between reputational risk and climate change issues remained a significant area of focus during 2021. Enhancements were made to the Environmental, Social & Ethical risk management framework to mitigate reputational risk arising from exposure to carbon-intensive sectors and to support the transition to a lower carbon economy.\n- \uf02d An updated reputational risk appetite statement was introduced with a specific focus on public trust.\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Reputational risk continued Governance\n\nA reputational risk policy supports reputational risk management across NatWest Group. Reputational risk committees review relevant issues at an individual business or entity level, while the Reputational Risk Committee - which has delegated authority from the Executive Risk Committee opines on cases, issues, sectors and themes that represent a material reputational risk. The Board Risk Committee oversees the identification and reporting of reputational risk. The Sustainable Banking Committee has a specific focus on environmental, social and ethical issues.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nNatWest Group manages and articulates its appetite for reputational risk through a qualitative reputational risk appetite statement and quantitative measures. NatWest Group seeks to identify, measure and manage risk exposures arising from internal actions and external events. This is designed to ensure that stakeholder trust is retained. However, reputational risk is inherent in NatWest Group's operating environment and public trust is a specific factor in setting reputational risk appetite.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n285\n\n## Monitoring and measurement\n\nRelevant internal and external factors are monitored through regular reporting to the reputational risk committees at business or entity level and escalated, where appropriate, to the Reputational Risk Committee, Board Risk Committee or the Sustainable Banking Committee.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nStandards of conduct are in place across NatWest Group requiring strict adherence to policies, procedures and ways of working to ensure business is transacted in a way that meets or exceeds - stakeholder expectations.\n\nExternal events that could cause reputational damage are identified and mitigated through NatWest Group's top and emerging risks process as well as through the NatWest Group and franchise-level risk registers.\n\nNatWest Group has in recent years been the subject of investigations and reviews by a number of regulators and governmental authorities, some of which have resulted in past fines, settlements and public censure.

Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- \uf02d We evaluated management's going concern assessment which included reviewing their evaluation of long-term business and strategic plans, capital adequacy, liquidity and funding positions. It also assessed these positions considering internal stress tests which included consideration of principal and emerging risks. The Group's risk profile and risk management practices were considered including credit risk, market risk, compliance and conduct risk, climate risk and operational risk;\n- \uf02d In conjunction with our walkthrough of the Group's financial close process, we confirmed our understanding of management's Going Concern assessment process and also engaged with management early to ensure all key factors were considered in their assessment;\n- \uf02d We evaluated management's assessment by considering the Group's ability to continue in operation and meets its liabilities under different scenarios including the impact of the Group's strategic plans and the continued economic impact of COVID-19. We used economic specialists in assessing the macroeconomic assumptions in the forecast through benchmarking to institutional forecasts, HMT consensus and peer comparative economic forecasts. We also considered other commitments of the Group including those in respect of its subsidiaries;\n- \uf02d We reviewed the Group's going concern disclosures included in the annual report in order to assess that the disclosures were appropriate and in conformity with the reporting standards.\n- \uf02d Considered the results of the Bank's stress testing and Bank of England 2021 solvency stress test, as well as the Group's results in the Bank of England Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES); and\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern over the twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn relation to the group and parent company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## An overview of the scope of the Parent Company and Group audits\n\n## Tailoring the scope\n\nOur assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each company within the Group.  Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account the size and risk profile of the component and its activities, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as recent internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each component.\n\nIn assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the five reporting components of the Group, we selected four components based on size and risk, which represent the principal reporting legal entities within the Group.\n\nThe scoping for the current year is as follows:\n\n| Component              | Scope    | Key locations    |        |         |     |\n|------------------------|----------|------------------|--------|---------|-----|\n| NatWest Holdings (NWH) | Full     | United Kingdom   |        |         |     |\n| NatWest Markets (NWM)  | Full     | United  Kingdom, | United | States, | and |\n|                        |          | Netherlands      |        |         |     |\n| RBS International      | Specific | Channel Islands  |        |         |     |\n| RBS AA Holdings        | Specific | United Kingdom   |        |         |     |\n\nThe table below illustrates the coverage obtained from the work performed by our audit teams. We considered total assets, total equity and total income to verify we had appropriate overall coverage.\n\n|              | Full scope (1)   | Specific scope (2)   | Other procedures (3)   | Total   |\n|--------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------------|---------|\n| Total assets | 95%              | 5%                   | -                      | 100%    |\n| Total equity | 89%              | 8%                   | 3%                     | 100%    |\n| Total income | 92%              | 7%                   | 1%                     | 100%    |\n\nThe audit scope of the specific scope components may not have included testing of all significant accounts within the components. However, the testing will have contributed to the total coverage of significant accounts tested for the overall Group.\n\nAs a result of the continued impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and resulting lockdown restrictions for part of the year in all of the countries where full or specific scope audit procedures have been performed, we have modified our audit strategy to allow for the audit to be performed remotely at both the Group and component locations. This approach was supported through remote user access to the Group's financial systems and the use of EY software collaboration platforms for the secure and timely delivery of requested audit evidence.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n288\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## I Innvvoollvveemmeenntt  wwiitthh  ccoommppoonneenntt  tteeaammss\n\nIn establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction.\n\nThe primary audit engagement team interacted regularly with the component audit teams where appropriate throughout the course of the audit, which included holding planning meetings, maintaining regular communications on the status of the audits, reviewing key working papers and taking responsibility for the scope and direction of the audit process. The primary audit team continued to follow a programme of oversight visits that has been designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor, or another Group audit partner, visits all full scope and specific scope locations outside the United Kingdom. During the current year's audit cycle, due to continued COVID-19 restrictions, the visits undertaken by the primary audit team were necessarily virtual visits. These visits involved video call meetings with local management, and discussions on the audit approach with the component team and any issues arising from their work. The primary team interacted regularly with the component teams and maintained a continuous and open dialogue with component teams, as well as holding formal closing meetings quarterly, to ensure that the primary team were fully aware of their progress and results of their procedures. The primary team also reviewed key working papers and were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. This, together with the additional procedures at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements\n\n## C Clliimmaattee  cchhaannggee\n\nThere has been increasing interest from stakeholders as to how climate change will impact companies. The Group has determined that the most significant future impacts from climate change on its operations will be from credit risk, operational risk, reputational risk, conduct risk and regulatory compliance risk. These are explained in the required Task Force for Climate related Financial Disclosures in the Strategic Report, and in the Climate Risk section within the Risk and capital management section, which form part of the 'Other information'. Our procedures on these disclosures consisted solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated.\n\nAs explained in the Accounting Policy note, the Group makes use of reasonable and supportable information to make accounting judgments and estimates, including the observable effect of the physical and transition risks of climate change on the current creditworthiness of borrowers, asset values and market indicators, as well as their effect on the Group's competitiveness and profitability. Many of the impacts arising will be longer term in nature, with an inherent level of uncertainty, and have limited effect on accounting judgments and estimates for the current period under the requirements of UK adopted international accounting standards, IFRS as adopted by the European Union and as issued by the IASB. In the Accounting Policy note, explanation of the impact of certain transition and physical risks were provided for the key assumptions and significant judgements and estimates.\n\nOur audit effort in considering climate change was focused on ensuring that the effects of material climate risks as disclosed in the Accounting Policy note have been appropriately reflected in the asset and liability valuations and the nature and timing of future cash flows. Details of our procedures and results on expected credit loss provisions and impairment of goodwill are included in our key audit matters below.  We also challenged the Directors' considerations of climate change in their assessment of going concern and viability and associated disclosures.\n\nWhilst the Group has stated its commitment to the aspirations of the Paris Agreement to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, as stated above the impacts arising will be longer term in nature, and there is an inherent level of uncertainty in determining the full future economic impact on their business model, operational plans and customers.\n\n## K Keeyy  aauuddiitt  mmaatttteerrss\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n289\n\nFinancial statements",

This included testing controls over the selection of macroeconomic assumptions in addition to controls over the preparation and review of the revenue and cost projections. In evaluating the governance processes we reviewed the Board meeting materials and minutes where forecasts were discussed and approved, and we observed the committee meetings where the value-in-use model and outcomes were discussed and approved.\n\nMacroeconomic and model assumptions: With the support of our internal economic specialists, we tested whether macroeconomic assumptions, including the continued impact of COVID-19 as at 31 December 2021, used in the Group's forecasts were reasonable by comparing these to other scenarios from a variety of external sources.  We evaluated how the discount rates and long-term growth rates used by management compared to our ranges which were developed using peer practice, external market data and calculations performed by our valuation specialists. We also assessed changes to valuation methodology and benchmarked this against industry practice with the assistance of our valuation specialists.\n\nRevenue forecasts: We evaluated the underlying business strategies, comparing to expected market trends and considering anticipated balance sheet growth. We obtained an understanding of the Group's strategy including their consideration of the impact of climate change, and considered its expected impact on the forecasts and the extent to which decisions had been factored into the forecasts, where appropriate, in accordance with the relevant accounting standards. We also inspected the findings from the review performed by management including their own sensitivity analysis of the forecasts.\n\nCost forecasts: We tested how previous management forecasts, including the impact of cost reduction programmes, compared to actual results to evaluate the accuracy of the forecasting process. We also tested the reasonableness of key performance indicators against peers with the help of our valuation specialists to assess the reasonableness of the Group's cost forecast.\n\nSensitivity analysis: We evaluated how management considered alternative assumptions and performed our own sensitivity and scenario analyses on certain assumptions such as cost and revenue forecasts, discount rate, long-term growth rate and other key performance indicators on both the detailed forecasts and on an overall basis.\n\nDisclosure: We evaluated the adequacy of disclosures in the financial statements including the appropriateness of assumptions and sensitivities disclosed.

The goodwill in the remaining retail and commercial CGUs remains recoverable as at 31 December 2021 and management have adequately disclosed reasonably possible alternative scenarios relating to the key assumptions that could result in an impairment.\n- \uf02d There is inherent uncertainty in predicting revenue and costs over the five-year forecast period, particularly with respect to the impact of COVID-19, the achievement of new strategic objectives, execution risk in the planned cost reductions, the impact of regulatory and climate change developments, and the impact of competition and disruption in banking business models over an extended period.\n- \uf02d Management impaired NatWest Group's investment in NWM, in addition they recognised a reversal in accumulated impairments in NWH due to the significant headroom as a result of the improved economic outlook. The sensitivity analyses we reviewed, and our independent procedures supported these assessments.\n- \uf02d We are satisfied that the disclosures appropriately reflect the sensitivity of the carrying value of investments in group undertakings and goodwill to certain reasonable alternative outcomes.  As there are a number of other possible outcomes and it would be impracticable to estimate the effect of all of them, the directors have disclosed the uncertainty that other possible outcomes within the next financial year could require an adjustment to the carrying amount of investments in group\n\nundertakings and goodwill.\n\n## R Reelleevvaanntt  rreeffeerreenncceess  iinn  tthhee  AAnnnnuuaall  RReeppoorrtt  aanndd  AAccccoouunnttss\n\nAccounting policies\n\nNote 17 to the Group financial statements and Note 9 to the Parent Company financial statements\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n292\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## R Riisskk\n\n## O Ouurr  rreessppoonnssee  ttoo  tthhee  rriisskk\n\n## Provisions for customer redress, litigation and other regulatory matters\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group has reported \u00a31.3 billion (2020: \u00a31.9 billion) of provisions for liabilities and charges, including \u00a30.8 billion (2020: \u00a31.1 billion) for customer redress, litigation and other regulatory matters as detailed in Note 21 of the financial statements.\n\nRegulatory scrutiny and the continued litigious environment give rise to a high level of management judgment in determining appropriate provisions and disclosures for specific customer redress, litigation and other regulatory matters. Management judgment is needed to determine whether a present obligation exists and a provision should be recorded at 31 December 2021 in accordance with the accounting criteria set out under IAS 37.\n\nThe most significant areas of judgment are:\n\n## \uf02d Judgment and risk of management bias\n\n- - Auditing the adequacy of these provisions is complex because judgment is involved in the selection and use of assumptions in the estimation of material provisions and there is a risk of management bias in the determination of whether an outflow in respect of identified material customer redress, litigation and other regulatory matters is probable and can be estimated reliably; and\n- \uf02d Disclosure - Judgment is required to assess the adequacy of disclosures of provision for contingent liabilities given the underlying estimation uncertainty in the provisions, and other uncertainties and assumptions.\n\nControls testing: We evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the identification, estimation, monitoring and disclosure of provisions and other uncertainties and assumptions related to customer redress, litigation and other regulatory matters considering the potential for management override of controls. The controls tested, among others, included those to identify and monitor claims, determine when a provision is required and to ensure the completeness and accuracy of data used to estimate provisions.\n\nExamination of regulatory correspondence: We examined the relevant regulatory and legal correspondence to assess developments in certain cases.  We also considered regulatory developments to identify actual or possible non-compliance with laws and regulations that might have a material effect on the financial statements.  For cases which were settled during the period, we compared the actual outflows with the provision that had been recorded, considered whether further risk existed, and evaluated the level of disclosures provided.\n\nInquiry of legal counsel: For significant legal matters, we received confirmations from the Group's external legal counsel to evaluate the likelihood of the obligation and management's estimate of the outflow at year-end. We also conducted inquiries with internal legal counsel over the existence of the legal obligations and related provision. We performed a test for unrecorded provisions to assess if there were cases not considered in the provision estimate by assessing against external legal confirmations and discussing with internal counsel.\n\nTesting of assumptions: Where appropriate, we involved our conduct risk and forensics specialists to assist us in evaluating the provision for specific customer redress, litigation and other regulatory matters. We tested the underlying data and assumptions used in the determination of the provisions recorded, including expected claim rates, legal costs, and the timing of settlement. We evaluated the accuracy of management's historical estimates by comparing the actual settlement to the provision and considered peer bank settlement in similar cases. We assessed the reasonableness of the assumptions used by management by comparing to the results of our independently performed benchmarking and sensitivity analysis. We also developed our own range of reasonable alternative estimates and compared them to management's provision. We tested utilisations of remaining provisions during the year and assessed the sufficiency of the remaining provisions yet to be paid for specific customer redress, litigation and other regulatory matters.\n\nDisclosure: We evaluated the disclosures provided on customer redress, litigation and other regulatory matters to assess whether they complied with accounting standards.\n\n## K Keeyy  oobbsseerrvvaattiioonnss  ccoommmmuunniiccaatteedd  ttoo  tthhee  GGrroouupp  AAuuddiitt  CCoommmmiitttteeee\n\nWe are satisfied that provisions for customer redress, litigation and other regulatory matters are reasonable and recognised in accordance with IFRS. We concurred with the recognition, measurement and level of disclosures of provisions relating to customer redress, litigation and other regulatory matters. We did not identify any material unrecorded provisions. We highlighted the following matters to the Group Audit Committee:\n\n- \uf02d The level of provisions by their nature incorporates significant judgments to be made and may change as a result of future developments.\n- \uf02d Continued vigilance in assessing conduct risks from the impact of COVID-19, which may not manifest until well after the pandemic has passed.\n\n## R Reelleevvaanntt  rreeffeerreenncceess  iinn  tthhee  AAnnnnuuaall  RReeppoorrtt  aanndd  AAccccoouunnttss\n\nReport of the Group Audit Committee Accounting policies Note 21 and 27 to the financial statements\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n293\n\nFinancial statements",

This included (but is not limited to) reported level 3 assets of \u00a32.0 billion (2020: \u00a31.7 billion) and level 3 liabilities of \u00a30.6 billion (2020: \u00a30.9 billion) whose value is dependent upon unobservable inputs.\n\nThe valuation of those financial instruments with higher risk characteristics can include both significant judgment and the risk of inappropriate revenue recognition through incorrect pricing as outlined below. The fair value of these instruments can involve complex valuation models and significant fair value adjustments, both of which may be reliant on inputs where there is limited market observability.\n\nManagement's estimates which required significant judgment include:\n\n- \uf02d Complex models - Complex modeldependent valuations of financial instruments, which include interest rate swaps linked to pre-payment behaviour and interest rate and foreign exchange options with exotic features;\n- \uf02d Illiquid inputs - Pricing inputs and calibrations for illiquid instruments, including debt securities and loans. Additionally, the valuation of derivative instruments is dependent on discount rates associated with complex collateral arrangements;\n- \uf02d Fair value adjustments - The appropriateness and completeness of fair value adjustments made to derivatives valuations including Funding Valuation Adjustments (FVA), Credit Valuation Adjustments (CVA), and material product and deal specific adjustments on long dated derivative portfolios; and\n\nControls testing: We evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to financial instrument valuation and related income statement measurement including independent price verification, valuation models governance, collateral management, income statement analysis, and the associated controls over relevant information technology systems. We also observed the Valuation Committees where valuation inputs, assumptions and adjustments were discussed and approved.\n\nWe involved our financial instrument valuation and modelling specialists to assist us in performing procedures including the following:\n\n- \uf02d Complex models: Testing complex model-dependent valuations by performing independent revaluation to assess the appropriateness of models and the adequacy of assumptions and inputs used by the Group;\n- \uf02d Illiquid inputs: Independently re-pricing instruments that had been valued using illiquid pricing inputs, using alternative pricing sources where available, to evaluate management's valuation;\n- \uf02d Fair value adjustments: Comparing fair value adjustment methodologies to current market practice and assessing the appropriateness and adequacy of the valuation adjustment framework in light of emerging market practice and changes in the risk profile of the underlying portfolio; and revaluing a sample of counterparty level FVA and CVA, comparing funding spreads to third party data, independently challenging illiquid CVA inputs, and testing material product and deal specific adjustments on long-dated derivative portfolio.\n\nThroughout our audit procedures we considered the appropriateness of modelling changes in relation to IBOR transition and impact of climate change on the valuation of financial instruments, particularly in relation to long-dated illiquid positions.\n\nIn addition, we assessed whether there were any indicators of aggregate bias in financial instrument marking and methodology assumptions.\n\nWe performed back-testing analysis of recent trade activity and asset disposals to evaluate the drivers of significant differences between book value and trade value and to assess the impact on the fair value of similar instruments within the portfolio. We performed an analysis of significant collateral discrepancies with counterparties to assess the potential impact on the fair value of the underlying (and similar) financial instruments.\n\n- \uf02d The manipulation of revenue recognition is most likely to arise through the inappropriate valuation of these instruments given the level of judgment involved.\n\n## K Keeyy  oobbsseerrvvaattiioonnss  ccoommmmuunniiccaatteedd  ttoo  tthhee  GGrroouupp  AAuuddiitt  CCoommmmiitttteeee\n\nWe are satisfied that the assumptions used by management to reflect the fair value of financial instruments with higher risk characteristics and the recognition of related income is reasonable and in accordance with IFRS. We highlighted the following matters to the Group Audit Committee:\n\n- \uf02d Complex-model dependent valuations were appropriate based on the output of our independent revaluations, analysis of trade activity, assessment of the output of the independent price verification process, inspection of collateral disagreements and peer benchmarking;\n- \uf02d The fair value estimates of hard-to-price financial instruments appropriately reflected pricing information available at 31 December 2021; and\n- \uf02d Valuation adjustments applied to derivative portfolios for credit, funding and other risks were recorded in accordance with the requirements of IFRS considering trade activity for positions with common risk characteristics, analysis of market data and peer benchmarking.\n\n## R Reelleevvaanntt  rreeffeerreenncceess  iinn  tthhee  AAnnnnuuaall  RReeppoorrtt  aanndd  AAccccoouunnttss\n\nReport of the Group Audit Committee Accounting policies Note 11 to the financial statements\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n294\n\nR\n\nRiisskk\n\n## O Ouurr  rreessppoonnssee  ttoo  tthhee  rriisskk\n\n## Pension valuation and net pension asset\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes which in aggregate are significant in the context of the overall balance sheet. At 31 December 2021, the Group reported a net pension asset of \u00a3488 million (2020: \u00a3602 million) comprising \u00a3602 million of schemes in surplus and \u00a3114 million of schemes in deficit (2020: \u00a3723 million and \u00a3121 million respectively). The net pension asset is sensitive to changes in the key judgments and estimates, which include:\n\n- \uf02d Assumptions Actuarial assumptions and inputs including discount rate, inflation, pension payment and longevity to determine the valuation of retirement benefit liabilities;\n- \uf02d Valuations Pricing inputs and calibrations for illiquid or complex model-dependent valuations of certain investments held by the schemes; and\n- \uf02d Augmentation cap Quantification of trustee's rights to unilaterally augment benefits (Augmentation cap) to determine the recognition of surplus.\n\nControls testing We evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the actuarial assumptions setting process, the data inputs used in the actuarial calculation and the measurement of the fair value of the schemes' assets.\n\nAssumptions We involved our actuarial specialists to evaluate the actuarial assumptions by comparing them to independently obtained third party sources and market practice. We assessed the impact on pension liabilities due to changes in financial, demographic and longevity assumptions over the year, including the continued effects of COVID-19, and whether these were supported by objective external evidence and rationales.\n\nValuations - We involved our valuation specialists to assess the appropriateness of management's valuation methodology including the judgments made in determining significant assumptions used in the valuation of complex and illiquid pension assets. We tested the fair value of scheme assets by independently calculating fair value for a sample of the assets held. Our sample included cash, equity and debt instruments, derivative financial instruments and illiquid assets.\n\nAugmentation cap and equalisation adjustments - We involved our actuarial specialists to test the estimation of the augmentation cap including the inputs used in the calculation. We also assessed the methodology and judgments made in calculating these estimates and the associated accounting treatment in accordance with IAS 19 and IFRIC 14.\n\nDisclosure We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures made in the financial statements, including the appropriateness of the assumptions and sensitivities disclosed.\n\n## K Keeyy  oobbsseerrvvaattiioonnss  ccoommmmuunniiccaatteedd  ttoo  tthhee  GGrroouupp  AAuuddiitt  CCoommmmiitttteeee\n\nWe are satisfied that the valuation and disclosure of the net pension balance are reasonable and in accordance with IFRS.

Appropriate IT controls are required to ensure that applications process data as expected and that changes are made in an appropriate manner. This risk is also impacted by the greater dependency on third parties, increasing use of cloud platforms, decommissioning of legacy systems, and migration to new systems. Such controls contribute to mitigating the risk of potential fraud or errors as a result of changes to applications and data.\n\nThe Group has implemented user access management controls across IT applications, databases and operating systems. We have identified user access-related deficiencies in the past and whilst the number of deficiencies has reduced year over year, the risk of inappropriate access remains.\n\nWe evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of IT general controls over the applications, operating systems and databases that are relevant to financial reporting. During our planning and test of design phases, we performed procedures to determine whether changes in restrictions in different global locations, as a result of the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic had caused material changes in IT processes or controls and observed no such changes that would result in an increased IT risk.\n\n## Controls testing\n\nWe tested user access by assessing the controls in place for in-scope applications, in particular testing the addition and periodic recertification of users' access. We continue to focus on key controls enforced by the Group's user access management tools, including the completeness of user data, automated identification of movers and leavers and the adequacy of the overall control environment. Our testing included the Group's additional attestation and leaver checks enhancing its identity and access control environment.\n\nA number of systems are outsourced to third party service providers. For these systems, we tested IT general controls through evaluating the relevant Service Organisation Controls reports (where available). This included assessing the timing of the reporting, the controls tested by the service auditor and whether they address relevant IT risks. We also tested required complementary user entity controls performed by management. Where a SOC report was not available we identified and reviewed compensating business controls to address this risk.  Several systems have been migrated to a cloud-hosted infrastructure model, access management processes and controls remain in-house which formed part of our testing.\n\nWhere control deficiencies were identified, we tested remediation activities performed by management and compensating controls in place and assessed what additional testing procedures were necessary to mitigate any residual risk. We also performed a further analysis of access management deficiencies identified by EY, Management and Internal Audit to revalidate our overall approach to access management testing.\n\n## K Keeyy  oobbsseerrvvaattiioonnss  ccoommmmuunniiccaatteedd  ttoo  tthhee  GGrroouupp  AAuuddiitt  CCoommmmiitttteeee\n\nWe are satisfied that IT controls impacting financial reporting are designed and operating effectively. The following matters were reported to the Group Audit Committee:\n\n- \uf02d We have seen an overall reduction in the number of discrete IT control deficiencies identified compared to prior year.\n- \uf02d Improvements were made to further standardise access management processes and controls across the Group, which was one of the drivers for the reduced number of deficiencies.\n- \uf02d Particular  attention  should  continue  to  be  paid  to  controls  over  user  access  management  including  ensuring  the completeness and accuracy of the data used to perform access controls. Where issues were noted in relation to access management, these were remediated by year end or mitigated by compensating controls. We performed additional testing in response to deficiencies identified, where required.\n\n## O Ouurr  aapppplliiccaattiioonn  ooff  mmaatteerriiaalliittyy\n\nWe apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.\n\n## M Maatteerriiaalliittyy\n\nThe magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Group to be \u00a3157 million (2020: \u00a3160 million), which is 5% (2020: 5%) of the profit before tax of the Group of \u00a34,032 million (2020: loss before tax of the Group including discontinued operations of \u00a3351 million) adjusted for loan impairment releases arising from COVID-19 economic recovery, normalised loan impairment charges, loss on redemption of own debt, non-recurring conduct and strategic costs and certain non-recurring transactions. We believe removing items that would otherwise have a disproportionate impact on materiality reflects the most useful measure for users of the financial statements and is consistent with the prior year. The 5% basis used for Group materiality is consistent with the wider industry, and is the standard for listed and regulated entities.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Parent Company to be \u00a3157 million (2020: \u00a3160 million) which is 0.3% (2020: 0.4%) of equity of the Parent Company and is consistent with the prior year. We believe this reflects the most useful measure for users of the financial statements as the Parent Company's primary purpose is to act as a holding company with investments in the Group's subsidiaries, not to generate operating profits and therefore a profit based measure is not relevant.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n296\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## P Peerrffoorrmmaannccee  mmaatteerriiaalliittyy\n\nThe application of materiality at the individual account or balance level.  It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group's overall control environment, our judgment was that performance materiality was 75% (2020: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely \u00a3118 million (2020: \u00a380 million). We have increased the percentage of performance materiality from the prior year considering that the number and amount of identified misstatements has decreased and to reflect the continued improvements in the effectiveness of the control environment and other factors affecting the entity and its financial reporting. Audit work at component teams for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component.  In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was \u00a335 million to \u00a3106 million (2020: \u00a330 million to \u00a372 million).\n\n## R Reeppoorrttiinngg  tthhrreesshhoolldd\n\nAn amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of \u00a38 million (2020: \u00a38 million), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nWe evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.\n\n## O Otthheerr  iinnffoorrmmaattiioonn\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report and Accounts, including the Strategic Report, Financial Review, Corporate Governance, Report of the Group Nominations and Governance Committee, Report of the Group Audit Committee, Report of the Group Board Risk Committee, Report of the Group Sustainable Banking Committee, Report of the Technology and Innovation Committee, Report of the directors,  Risk and capital management, Non-IFRS financial measures, Risk factors, Material contracts, and Additional information, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\n## E Exxppllaannaattiioonn  aass  ttoo  wwhhaatt  eexxtteenntt  tthhee  aauuddiitt  wwaass  ccoonnssiiddeerreedd  ccaappaabbllee  ooff  ddeetteeccttiinngg  iirrrreegguullaarriittiieess,,  iinncclluuddiinngg  ffrraauudd\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined below, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\nHowever, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the company and management.\n\n- \uf02d We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant are the regulations, licence conditions and supervisory requirements of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA); Companies Act 2006; and the Sarbanes Oxley Act (SOX).\n- \uf02d We assessed the susceptibility of the Group's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by considering the controls established to address risks identified to prevent or detect fraud. We also identified the risks of fraud in our key audit matters as described above and identified areas that we considered when performing our fraud procedures, such as cybersecurity, the impact of remote working, implementation of new government supported lending products, and the appropriateness of sources used when performing confirmation testing on accounts such as cash, loans and securities.\n- \uf02d We understood how the Group is complying with those frameworks by making inquiries of management, internal audit and those responsible for legal and compliance matters. We also reviewed correspondence between the Group and regulatory bodies; reviewed minutes of the Board and Risk Committees; and gained an understanding of the Group's governance framework.\n- \uf02d Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved inquiries of legal counsel, executive management, and internal audit. We also tested controls and performed procedures to respond to the fraud risks as identified in our key audit matters. These procedures were performed by both the primary team and component teams with oversight from the primary team.\n- \uf02d The Group operates in the banking industry which is a highly regulated environment. As such, the Senior Statutory Auditor considered the experience and expertise of the engagement team to ensure that the team had the appropriate competence and capabilities, involving specialists where appropriate.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

Further information is provided where judgment and estimation is applied to critical accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty.\n\nFuture accounting developments details new or amendments to existing accounting standards, when they are effective from and where the NatWest Group is assessing their impact on future financial statements.\n\n## 1 1..  PPrreesseennttaattiioonn  ooff  ffiinnaanncciiaall  ssttaatteemmeennttss\n\nNatWest Group plc is incorporated in the UK and registered in Scotland. The financial statements are presented in the functional currency, pounds sterling.\n\nNatWest Group plc's consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of NatWest Group plc and the entities it controls.  Control arises when NatWest Group plc has the power to direct the activities of an entity so as to affect the return from the entity. Control is assessed by reference to our ability to enforce our will on the other entity, typically through voting rights.

The directors have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis after assessing the principal risks, forecasts, projections and other relevant evidence over the twelve months from the date the financial statements are approved (see the Report of the directors, page 183) and in accordance with  UK adopted International Accounting Standards (IAS), International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and IFRS as adopted by the European Union.

Finance lease income is recognised at a constant periodic rate of return before tax on the net investment on the lease. Negative interest on financial assets is presented in interest payable and negative interest on financial liabilities is presented in interest receivable.\n\nOther interest relating to financial instruments measured at fair value is recognised as part of the movement in fair value and is reported in income from trading activities or other operating income as relevant. Fees in respect of services are recognised as the right to consideration accrues through the performance of each distinct service obligation to the customer. The arrangements are generally contractual and the cost of providing the service is incurred as the service is rendered. The price is usually fixed and always determinable.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n307\n\n## 3 3..

Employees may receive variable compensation in cash, in deferred cash or debt instruments of NatWest  Group or in ordinary shares of NatWest Group plc. NatWest Group operates a number of share-based compensation schemes under which it grants awards of NatWest Group plc shares and share options to its employees. Such awards are subject to vesting conditions.\n\nVariable compensation that is settled in cash or debt instruments is charged to the income statement on a straightline basis over the  period during which services are provided, taking account of forfeiture and clawback criteria. The value of employee services received in exchange for NatWest Group plc shares and share options is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, subject to deferral. clawback and forfeiture criteria with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value of the instruments granted is based on market prices at the grant date.\n\n## Defined contribution pension scheme\n\nA scheme where NatWest Group pays fixed contributions and there is no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions or benefits. Contributions are recognised in the income statement as employee service costs accrue.\n\n## Defined benefit pension scheme\n\nA scheme that defines the benefit an employee will receive on retirement and is dependent on one or more factors such as age, salary, and years of service. The net of the recognisable scheme assets and obligations is reported on the balance sheet in other assets or other liabilities. The defined benefit obligation is measured on an actuarial basis. The charge to the income statement for pension costs (mainly the service cost and the net interest on the net defined benefit asset or liability) is recognised in operating expenses.\n\nActuarial gains and losses (i.e. gains and/or losses on remeasuring the net defined benefit asset or liability due to changes in actuarial measurement assumptions) are recognised in other comprehensive income in full in the period in which they arise, and not subject to recycling to the income statement.\n\nFinancial statements",

The estimated useful economic lives are:\n\nComputer software\n\n3 to 12 years\n\nOther acquired intangibles\n\n5 to 10 years\n\nExpenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is charged to the income statement as incurred.\n\nDirect costs relating to the development of internal-use computer software are reported on the balance sheet after technical feasibility and economic viability have been established. These direct costs include payroll, the costs of materials and services, and directly attributable overheads. Capitalisation of costs ceases when the software can operate as intended.\n\nDuring and after development, accumulated costs are reviewed for impairment against the benefits that the software is expected to generate.\n\nCosts incurred prior to the establishment of technical feasibility and economic viability are expensed to the income statement as incurred, as are all training costs and general overheads. The costs of licences to use computer software that are expected to generate economic benefits beyond one year are also reported on the balance sheet\n\nGoodwill on the acquisition of a subsidiary is the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid, the fair value of any existing interest in the subsidiary and the amount of any noncontrolling interest measured either at fair value or at its share of the subsidiary's net assets over the net fair value of the subsidiary's identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities.\n\nGoodwill is measured at initial cost less any subsequent impairment losses.

Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset that does not generate cash flows that are independent from those of other assets or groups of assets, is determined as part of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to NatWest Group's cash-generating units or groups of cashgenerating units expected to benefit from the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell or its value in use. Value in use is the present value of future cash flows from the asset or cash-generating unit discounted at a rate that reflects market interest rates adjusted for risks specific to the asset or cash-generating unit that have not been considered in estimating future cash flows.\n\n## 7 7..

Translation differences are recognised in the income statement except for differences arising on nonmonetary financial assets classified as fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\nIncome and expenses of foreign subsidiaries and branches are translated into sterling at average exchange rates unless these do not approximate the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of a foreign operation are recognised in other comprehensive income.

An obligation exists when NatWest Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those affected either by starting to implement the plan or by announcing its main features.\n\nNatWest Group recognises any onerous cost of the present obligation under a contract as a provision. An onerous cost is the unavoidable cost of meeting its contractual obligations that exceed the expected economic benefits. When NatWest Group intends to vacate a leasehold property or right of use asset, the asset would be tested for impairment and a provision may be recognised for the ancillary contractual occupancy costs, such as rates.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations arising from past events, whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events, or present obligations arising from past events that are not recognised because either an outflow of economic benefits is not probable, or the amount of the obligation cannot be reliably measured. Contingent liabilities are not recognised but information about them is disclosed unless the possibility of any outflow of economic benefits in settlement is remote.\n\n## 9 9..

Tax consequences arising from servicing financial instruments classified as equity are recognised in the income statement in line with IAS 12.\n\nCurrent tax is tax payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or loss for the year arising in the income statement, other comprehensive income or equity. Provision is made for current tax at rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability for accounting purposes and the carrying amount for tax purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent their recovery is probable.\n\nDeferred tax is not recognised on temporary differences that arise from initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction (other than a business combination) that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates expected to apply in the periods when the assets will be realised or the liabilities settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where NatWest Group has a legally enforceable right to offset and where they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority either on an individual NatWest Group company or on NatWest Group companies in the same tax group that intend, in future periods, to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or on a gross basis simultaneously.\n\nAccounting for taxes is judgmental and carries a degree of uncertainty because tax law is subject to interpretation, which might be questioned by the relevant tax authority. NatWest Group recognises the most likely current and deferred tax liability or asset, assessed for uncertainty using consistent judgments and estimates. Current and deferred tax assets are only recognised where their recovery is deemed probable, and current and deferred tax liabilities are recognised at the amount that represents the best estimate of the probable outcome having regard to their acceptance by the tax authorities.\n\n## 1 100..

A business model assessment helps to ascertain the measurement approach depending on whether cash flows result from holding financial assets to collect the contractual cash flows, from selling those financial assets, or both.\n\nBusiness model assessment of assets is made at portfolio level, being the level at which they are managed to achieve a predefined business objective. This is expected to result in the most consistent classification of assets because it aligns with the stated objectives for the portfolio, its risk management, manager's remuneration and the ability to monitor sales of assets from a portfolio.\n\nThe contractual terms of a financial asset; any leverage features; prepayment and extension terms; and triggers that might reset the effective rate of interest; are considered in determining whether cash flows are  solely payments of principal and interest.\n\nCertain financial assets may be designated at fair value through profit or loss (DFV) upon initial recognition if such designation eliminates, or significantly reduces, accounting mismatch.\n\nEquity shares are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless specifically elected as at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).\n\nUpon disposal, the cumulative gains or losses in fair value through other comprehensive income reserve are recycled to the income statement for monetary assets and non-monetary assets (equity shares) the cumulative gains or losses are transferred directly to retained earnings.\n\nRegular way purchases of financial assets classified as amortised cost are recognised on the settlement date; all other regular way transactions in financial assets are recognised on the trade date.\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified into one of following measurement categories:\n\n- \uf02d amortised cost measured at cost using the effective interest rate method;\n- \uf02d designated at fair value through profit or loss measured at fair value and changes in fair value reported in the income statement except changes in fair value attributable to the credit risk component recognised in other comprehensive income when no accounting mismatch occurs.\n- \uf02d held for trading measured at fair value and changes in fair value reported in income statement; or\n\n## 1 111..

The probability is determined by the risk of default which is applied to the cash flow estimates. In the absence of a change in credit rating, allowances are recognised when there is a reduction in the net present value of expected cash flows. Following a significant increase in credit risk, ECL are adjusted from 12 months to lifetime. This will lead to a higher impairment charge.\n\nJudgment is exercised as follows:\n\n- \uf02d Models -in certain low default portfolios, Basel parameter estimates are also applied for IFRS 9.\n- \uf02d Multiple economic scenarios (MES) - the central, or base, scenario is most critical to the ECL calculation, independent of the method used to generate a range of alternative outcomes and their probabilities.\n- \uf02d Non-modelled portfolios , mainly in Private Banking, RBSI and Lombard, use a standardised capital requirement under Basel II. Under IFRS 9, they have bespoke treatments for the identification of significant increase in credit risk. Benchmark PDs, EADs and LGDs are reviewed annually for appropriateness. The ECL calculation is based on expected future cash flows, which is typically applied at a portfolio level.\n- \uf02d Significant increase in credit risk -IFRS 9 requires that at each reporting date, an entity shall assess whether the credit risk on an account has increased significantly since initial recognition. Part of this assessment requires a comparison to be made between the current lifetime PD (i.e. the current probability of default over the remaining lifetime) with the equivalent lifetime PD as determined at the date of initial recognition.\n\nOn restructuring where a financial asset is not derecognised, the revised cash flows are used in re-estimating the credit loss. Where restructuring causes derecognition of the original financial asset, the fair value of the replacement asset is used as the closing cash flow of the original asset.\n\nWhere in the course of the orderly realisation of a loan, it is exchanged for equity shares or property, the exchange is accounted for as the sale of the loan and the acquisition of equity securities or investment property. Where NatWest Group's acquired interest  is in equity shares, relevant policies for control, associates and joint ventures apply.\n\nImpaired financial assets are written off and therefore derecognised from the balance sheet when NatWest Group concludes that there is no longer any realistic prospect of recovery of part, or all, of the loan. For financial assets that are individually assessed for impairment, the timing of the write-off is determined on a case-by-case basis. Such financial assets are reviewed regularly and write-off will be prompted by bankruptcy, insolvency, re-negotiation, and similar events.\n\nThe typical time frames from initial impairment to write-off for NatWest Group's collectively assessed portfolios are:\n\n- \uf02d Retail mortgages: write-off usually occurs within five years, or earlier, when an account is closed, but can be longer where the customer engages constructively;\n- \uf02d Overdrafts and other unsecured loans: write-off occurs within six years;\n- \uf02d Credit cards: the irrecoverable amount is typically written off after twelve arrears cycles or at four years post default any remaining amounts outstanding are written off;\n- \uf02d Commercial loans: write-offs are determined in the light of individual circumstances; and Business loans are generally written off within five years.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n310\n\n## 1 122..

Incremental costs and related tax that are directly attributable to an equity transaction are deducted from equity.\n\nThe consideration for any ordinary shares of NatWest Group plc purchased by NatWest Group (known as treasury shares or own shares held) is deducted from equity. On the cancellation of treasury shares their nominal value is removed from equity and any excess of consideration over nominal value is treated in accordance with the capital maintenance provisions of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nOn the sale or re-issue of treasury shares the consideration received and related tax are credited to equity, net of any directly attributable incremental costs.\n\n## 1 155..

Hedge accounting relationships are designated and documented at inception in line with the requirements of IAS 39 Financial instruments - Recognition and Measurement. The documentation identifies the hedged item, the hedging instrument and details of the risk that is being\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nhedged and the way in which effectiveness will be assessed at inception and during the period of the hedge.\n\nFair value hedge - the gain or loss on the hedging instrument and the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognised in the income statement. Where the hedged item is measured at amortised cost, the balance sheet amount of the hedged item is also adjusted.\n\nCash flow hedge - the effective portion of the designated hedge relationship is recognised in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion in the income statement. When the hedged item (forecasted cash flows) results in the recognition of a financial asset or financial liability, the cumulative gain or loss is reclassified from equity to the income statement in the same periods in which the hedged forecasted cash flows affect the income statement.\n\n## Hedge of net investment in a foreign operation -In the\n\nhedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, the effective portion of the designated hedge relationship is recognised in other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss. Non-derivative financial liabilities as well as derivatives may be designated as a hedging instrument in a net investment hedge.\n\n## Discontinuation of hedge accounting\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued if the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting i.e. the hedge is not highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, consistent with the documented risk management strategy; the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; or if hedge designation is revoked.\n\nFor fair value hedging any cumulative adjustment is amortised to the income statement over the life of the hedged item. Where the hedge item is no longer on the balance sheet the adjustment to the hedged item is reported in the income statement.\n\nFor cash flow hedging the cumulative unrealised gain or loss is reclassified from equity to the income statement when the hedged cash flows occur or, if the forecast transaction results in the recognition of a financial asset or financial liability, when the hedged forecast cash flows affect the income statement. Where a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss is reclassified from equity to the income statement immediately.\n\nFor net investment hedging on disposal or partial disposal of a foreign operation, the amount accumulated in equity is reclassified from equity to the income statement.\n\n## 1 166..

The accounting standards used in the preparation of the financial statements (see presentation of financial statements  above) require the directors, in preparing NatWest Group's financial statements, to select suitable accounting policies, apply them consistently and make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent. In the absence of accounting guidance,   standards used in the preparation of the financial statements  require the directors to develop and apply an accounting policy that results in relevant and reliable information in the light of the requirements and guidance in IFRS dealing with similar and\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n311\n\nrelated issues and the IASB's 'Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting'.\n\nThe judgments and assumptions involved in NatWest Group's accounting policies that are considered by the Board to be the most important to the portrayal of its financial condition are noted below. The use of estimates, assumptions or models that differ from those adopted by NatWest Group would affect its reported results. Estimation uncertainty continues to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to cause significant economic and social disruption during 2021. Key financial estimates are based on management's latest five-year revenue and cost forecasts. Measurement of goodwill, deferred tax and expected credit losses are highly sensitive to reasonably possible changes in those anticipated conditions. Other reasonably possible assumptions about the future include a prolonged financial effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy of the UK and other countries or greater economic effect as countries and companies implement plans to counter climate risks.\n\n## How Climate risk affects our accounting judgments and estimates\n\nNatWest Group makes use of reasonable and supportable information to make accounting judgments and estimates. This includes information about the observable effects of the physical and transition risks of climate change on the current creditworthiness of borrowers, asset values and market indicators. It also includes the effect on NatWest Group's competitiveness and profitability. Many of the effects arising from climate change will be longer term in nature, with an inherent level of uncertainty ,, and have limited effect on accounting judgments and estimates for the current period .. Some physical and transition risks can manifest in the shorter term. The following items represent the most significant effects:\n\n- \uf02d The classification of financial instruments linked to climate, or other sustainability indicators: consideration is given to whether the effect of climate related terms prevent the instrument cashflows being solely payments of principal and interest.\n- \uf02d The assessment of asset impairment and deferred tax are based upon value in use. This represents the value of future cashflows and uses the Group's five-year forecast and the expectation of long term economic growth beyond this period. The five-year forecast takes account of management's current expectations on competitiveness and profitability, including near term effects of climate transition risk. The long term growth rate reflects external indicators which will include market expectations on climate risk. NatWest Group did not consider any additional adjustments to this indicator.\n- \uf02d The measurement of expected credit loss considers the ability of borrowers to make payments as they fall due. Future cashflows are discounted, so long dated cashflows are less likely to affect current expectations on credit loss. NatWest Group's assessment of sector specific risks, and whether additional adjustments are required, include expectations on the ability of those sectors to meet their financing needs in the market. Changes in credit stewardship and credit risk appetite that stem from climate considerations, such as oil and gas, will directly affect our positions.\n- \uf02d The use of market indicators as inputs to fair value is assumed to include current information and knowledge regarding the effect of climate risk.\n\nFinancial statements",

Calculation of the effective interest rate takes into account fees payable or receivable that are an integral part of the financial instrument's yield, premiums or discounts on acquisition or issue, early redemption fees and transaction costs. All contractual terms of a financial instrument are considered when estimating future cash flows. Negative interest on financial assets is presented in interest payable and negative interest on financial liabilities is presented in interest receivable.\n\nIncluded in interest receivable is finance lease income which is recognised at a constant periodic rate of return before tax on the net investment.\n\nFor accounting policy information see Accounting policies note 2.\n\n| Continuing operations                  | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 (1) \u00a3m   | 2019 (1) \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|\n| Balances at central banks              | 99        | 90            | 321           |\n| Loans to banks - amortised cost        | 346       | 246           | 405           |\n| Loans to customers - amortised cost    | 8,615     | 8,979         | 9,547         |\n| Other financial assets                 | 253       | 483           | 854           |\n| Interest receivable                    | 9,313     | 9,798         | 11,127        |\n| Balances with banks                    | 204       | 144           | 319           |\n| Customer deposits                      | 556       | 911           | 1,256         |\n| Other financial liabilities            | 670       | 846           | 1,102         |\n| Subordinated liabilities               | 267       | 402           | 483           |\n| Internal funding of trading businesses | 2         | 19            | 168           |\n| Interest payable                       | 1,699     | 2,322         | 3,328         |\n| Net interest income                    | 7,614     | 7,476         | 7,799         |\n\n- (1) Comparative results have been re-presented from those previously published to reclassify certain operations as discontinued operations as described in Note 8.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n313\n\nFinancial statements",

When estimating the fair value of the award, the number of shares granted, and the prevailing market price (as defined on pages 146-147) are used.  The fair value of the award is recognised as services are provided over the vesting period.\n\n| Sharesave      | 2021                     | 2021                          | 2020                     | 2020                          | 2019                     | 2019                          |\n|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                | Average exercise price \u00a3 | Shares under option (million) | Average exercise price \u00a3 | Shares under option (million) | Average exercise price \u00a3 | Shares under option (million) |\n| At 1 January   | 1.64                     | 96                            | 2.01                     | 84                            | 2.18                     | 75                            |\n| Granted        | 1.80                     | 24                            | 1.12                     | 35                            | 1.78                     | 25                            |\n| Exercised      | 1.76                     | (10)                          | 1.83                     | -                             | 2.83                     | (4)                           |\n| Cancelled      | 2.02                     | (15)                          | 2.20                     | (23)                          | 2.25                     | (12)                          |\n| At 31 December | 1.61                     | 95                            | 1.64                     | 96                            | 2.01                     | 84                            |\n\nOptions are exercisable within six months of vesting; 6.0 million options were exercisable at 31 December 2021 (2020 - 6.3 million; 2019 - 3.2 million).

Ulster Bank RoI is presented separately from the Go-forward group (refer to the split below) to reflect the strategic decision on the phased withdrawal from the Republic of Ireland announced in February 2021. This is consistent with internal financial reporting and how senior management assesses the performance of each operating segment.\n\nThe directors manage NatWest Group primarily by class of business and present the segmental analysis on that basis. This includes the review of net interest income for each class of business. Interest receivable and payable for all reportable segments is therefore presented net. Segments charge market prices for services rendered between each other; funding charges between segments are determined by NatWest Group Treasury, having regard to commercial demands.

The defined contribution schemes invest contributions in a choice of funds and the accumulated contributions and investment returns are used by the employee to provide benefits on retirement, there is no legal or constructive obligation for NatWest Group to pay any further contributions or benefits. The defined benefit schemes provide pensions in retirement based on employees' pensionable salary and service.\n\nNatWest Group's balance sheet includes any defined benefit pension scheme surplus or deficit as a retirement benefit asset or liability reported in other assets and other liabilities. The surplus or deficit is the difference between the liabilities to be paid from the defined benefit scheme, and the assets held by the scheme to meet these liabilities. The liabilities are calculated by external actuaries using a number of financial and demographic assumptions.\n\nFor some NatWest Group defined benefit schemes where there is a net defined benefit surplus which means any surplus in excess of present value of any economic benefits, the application of accounting standards means we don't recognise that surplus on the balance sheet as the trustees may have control over the use of the surplus.\n\nFor accounting policy information see Accounting policies note 4.\n\n## D Deeffiinneedd  ccoonnttrriibbuuttiioonn  sscchheemmeess\n\nNatWest Group sponsors several defined contribution schemes in different territories, which new employees are entitled to join. NatWest Group pays specific contributions into individual investment funds on employees' behalf. Once those contributions are paid, there is no further liability on the NatWest Group balance sheet relating to the defined contribution scheme.\n\n## D Deeffiinneedd  bbeenneeffiitt  sscchheemmeess\n\nNatWest Group sponsors a number of pension schemes in the UK and overseas, including the Main section of the NatWest Group Pension Fund (the 'Main section') which operates under UK trust law and is managed and administered on behalf of its members in accordance with the terms of the trust deed, the scheme rules and UK legislation.\n\nPension fund trustees are appointed to operate each fund and ensure benefits are paid in accordance with the scheme rules and national law. The trustees are the legal owner of a scheme's assets, and have a duty to act in the best interests of all scheme members.\n\nThe schemes generally provide a pension of one-sixtieth of final pensionable salary for each year of service prior to retirement up to a maximum of 40 years and are contributory for current members. These have been closed to new entrants for over ten years, although current members continue to build up additional pension benefits, currently subject to 2% maximum annual salary inflation, while they remain employed by NatWest Group.\n\nThe Main section corporate trustee is NatWest Pension Trustee Limited (the Trustee), a wholly owned subsidiary of NWB Plc, Principal Employer of the Main section. The Board of the Trustee comprises four member trustee directors selected from eligible active staff, deferred and pensioner members who apply and six appointed by NatWest Group. Under UK legislation, a defined benefit pension scheme is required to meet the statutory funding objective of having sufficient and appropriate assets to cover its liabilities (the pensions that have been promised to members).\n\nSimilar governance principles apply to NatWest Group's other defined benefit pension schemes.\n\n## I Innvveessttmmeenntt  ssttrraatteeggyy\n\nThe assets of the Main section, which is typical of other group schemes, represent 90% of all plan assets at 31 December 2021 (2020 - 90%) and are invested as shown below.\n\nThe Main section employs both physical and derivative instruments to achieve a desired asset class exposure and to reduce the section's interest rate, inflation, and currency risk. This means that the net funding position is considerably less sensitive to changes in market conditions than the value of the assets or liabilities in isolation. In particular, movements in interest rate and inflation are substantially hedged by the Trustee.\n\n| Major classes of plan assets as a percentage of   | 2021     | 2021       | 2021    | 2020     | 2020       | 2020    |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|---------|----------|------------|---------|\n| total plan assets of the Main section             | Quoted % | Unquoted % | Total % | Quoted % | Unquoted % | Total % |\n| Equities                                          | 3.7      | 4.7        | 8.4     | 3.9      | 4.6        | 8.5     |\n| Index linked bonds                                | 46.7     | -          | 46.7    | 49.4     | -          | 49.4    |\n| Government bonds                                  | 9.8      | -          | 9.8     | 6.2      | -          | 6.2     |\n| Corporate and other bonds                         | 10.7     | 4.4        | 15.1    | 11.8     | 5.0        | 16.8    |\n| Real estate                                       | -        | 4.4        | 4.4     | -        | 4.2        | 4.2     |\n| Derivatives                                       | -        | 8.8        | 8.8     | -        | 10.0       | 10.0    |\n| Cash and other assets                             | -        | 6.8        | 6.8     | -        | 4.9        | 4.9     |\n|                                                   | 70.9     | 29.1       | 100.0   | 71.3     | 28.7       | 100.0   |\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n322\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## 5 Pensions continued\n\nThe Main section's holdings of derivative instruments are summarised in the table below:\n\n|                              | 2021     | 2021       | 2021        | 2020     | 2020       | 2020        |\n|------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n|                              | Notional | Fair value | Fair value  | Notional | Fair value | Fair value  |\n|                              | amounts  | Assets     | Liabilities | amounts  | Assets     | Liabilities |\n|                              | \u00a3bn      | \u00a3m         | \u00a3m          | \u00a3bn      | \u00a3m         | \u00a3m          |\n| Inflation rate swaps         | 20       | 1,408      | 796         | 18       | 1,390      | 1,716       |\n| Interest rate swaps          | 172      | 8,385      | 4,421       | 68       | 11,197     | 6,215       |\n| Currency forwards            | 12       | 61         | 98          | 11       | 334        | 38          |\n| Equity and bond call options | -        | 1          | -           | 1        | 169        | 1           |\n| Equity and bond put options  | -        | 1          | 3           | 3        | 1          | 19          |\n| Other                        | 1        | 9          | 10          | 2        | 63         | 17          |\n\nSwaps have been executed at prevailing market rates and within standard market bid/offer spreads with a number of counterparties, including NWB Plc.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the gross notional value of the swaps was \u00a3192 billion (2020 - \u00a388 billion) and had a net positive fair value of \u00a34,573 million (2020 - \u00a34,706 million) against which the counterparties had posted approximately 95% collateral.\n\nThe schemes do not invest directly in NatWest Group but can have exposure to NatWest Group.

The trustees and the sponsor, with the support of the Scheme Actuary, agree the assumptions used to value the liabilities and to determine future contribution requirements. The funding assumptions incorporate a margin for prudence over and above the expected cost of providing the benefits promised to members, taking into account the sponsor's covenant and the investment strategy of the scheme. Similar arrangements apply in the other territories where NatWest Group sponsors defined benefit pension schemes.\n\nA full triennial funding valuation of the Main section, effective 31 December 2020, was completed during the year.\n\nThis triennial funding valuation determined the funding level to be 104%, pension liabilities to be \u00a349 billion and the surplus to be \u00a32 billion, all assessed on the agreed funding basis. The average cost of the future service of current members is 49% of salary before contributions from those members. In addition, the sponsor has agreed to meet administrative expenses. Following the ring-fencing agreement with the Trustee reached in 2018, additional contributions of up to \u00a3500 million p.a. are payable to the Main section should the Group make distributions to shareholders of an equal amount.  These\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n324\n\ncontributions are capped at \u00a31.5 billion in total; \u00a3500 million was made in 2021 (2020 - Nil).\n\nThe key assumptions used to determine the funding liabilities were the discount rate, which is determined based on fixed interest swap and gilt yields plus 0.64% per annum, and mortality assumptions, which result in life expectancies of 27.7/29.4 years for males/females who are currently age 60 and 28.9/30.7 years from age 60 for males/females who are currently aged 40.\n\nThe 2020 triennial valuation of the Group Pension Fund included an allowance for the estimated impact of guaranteed minimum pension equalisation, which is reflected in the IAS 19 valuation at 31 December 2021.  As such, no explicit allowance is required in the IAS 19 figures (2020: \u00a3169 million).\n\n## A Accccoouunnttiinngg  AAssssuummppttiioonnss\n\nPlacing a value on NatWest Group's defined benefit pension schemes' liabilities requires NatWest Group's management to make a number of assumptions, with the support of independent actuaries. The ultimate cost of the defined benefit obligations depends upon actual future events and the assumptions made are unlikely to be exactly borne out in practice, meaning the final cost may be higher or lower than expected.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## 5 Pensions continued\n\nThe most significant assumptions used for the Main section are shown below:\n\n|                                         | Principal IAS 19 actuarial assumptions   | Principal IAS 19 actuarial assumptions   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|                                         | 2021 %                                   | 2020 %                                   |\n| Discount rate                           | 1.8                                      | 1.4                                      |\n| Inflation assumption (RPI)              | 3.3                                      | 2.9                                      |\n| Rate of increase in salaries            | 1.8                                      | 1.8                                      |\n| Rate of increase in deferred pensions   | 3.7                                      | 3.0                                      |\n| Rate of increase in pensions in payment | 2.5                                      | 2.7                                      |\n| Lump sum conversion rate at retirement  | 18                                       | 20                                       |\n| Longevity at age 60:                    | years                                    | years                                    |\n| Current pensioners                      |                                          |                                          |\n| Males                                   | 27.3                                     | 27.1                                     |\n| Females                                 | 29.0                                     | 29.0                                     |\n| Future pensioners, currently aged 40    |                                          |                                          |\n| Males                                   | 28.2                                     | 28.3                                     |\n| Females                                 | 30.1                                     | 30.4                                     |\n\n## D Diissccoouunntt  rraattee\n\nThe IAS 19 valuation uses a single discount rate set by reference to the yield on a basket of 'high quality' sterling corporate bonds.\n\nSignificant judgment is required when setting the criteria for bonds to be included in the basket of bonds that is used to determine the discount rate used in the IAS 19 valuations.

The tax treatment of some transactions is uncertain and tax computations are yet to be agreed with the tax authorities in a number of jurisdictions. NatWest Group recognises anticipated tax liabilities based on all available evidence and, where appropriate, in the light of external advice. Any difference between the final outcome and the amounts provided will affect current and deferred income tax charges in the period when the matter is resolved.\n\n## D Deeffeerrrreedd  ttaaxx\n\nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in respect of temporary differences where the carrying amount of an asset or liability differs for accounting and tax purposes.

These include amounts recognised in respect of UK and overseas tax losses of \u00a3899 million (31 December 2020 - \u00a3905 million). Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be future taxable profits to recover them.\n\nJudgment -NatWest Group has considered the carrying value of deferred tax assets and concluded that, based on management's estimates, sufficient taxable profits will be generated in future years to recover recognised deferred tax assets.\n\nEstimate - These estimates are partly based on forecast performance beyond the horizon for management's detailed plans. They have regard to inherent uncertainties, such as climate change and the impact of COVID. The deferred tax assets in NWM Plc and UBIDAC are supported by way of future reversing taxable temporary differences on which deferred tax liabilities are recognised at 31 December 2021 .\n\n## U UKK  ttaaxx  lloosssseess\n\nUnder UK tax rules, tax losses can be carried forward indefinitely. As the recognised tax losses in NatWest Group arose prior to 1 April 2015, credit in future periods is given against 25% of profits at the main rate of UK corporation tax, excluding the Banking Surcharge 8% rate introduced by The Finance (No. 2) Act 2015.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n329\n\nIt was announced in the UK Government's budget on 3 March 2021 that the main UK corporation tax rate will increase from 19% to 25% from 1 April 2023. This legislative change was enacted on 10 June 2021. NatWest Group's closing deferred tax assets and liabilities have therefore been recalculated taking into account this change of rate and the applicable period the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to crystallise. As a result, the net deferred tax asset position in NatWest Group has increased by \u00a3163 million, with a \u00a3165 million tax credit included in the income statement (refer to reconciling item above), and a \u00a32 million tax charge included in other comprehensive income.\n\nIt was subsequently announced in the UK Government's budget on 27 October 2021 that the UK banking surcharge will decrease from 8% to 3% from 1 April 2023. This legislative change was substantively enacted on 2 February 2022. Had this rate reduction been substantively enacted as at the balance sheet date, the estimated rate change impact would not have been material.\n\nFinancial statements",

The movement in the current financial year reflects a \u00a313 million decrease in the carrying value of the deferred tax asset, offset by a \u00a37 million increase due to the UK tax rate change impact.\n\nNWB Plc - A deferred tax asset of \u00a3608 million (2020 - \u00a3592 million) has been recognised in respect of total losses of \u00a32,610 million. The losses arose principally as a result of significant impairment and conduct charges between 2009 and 2012 during challenging economic conditions in the UK banking sector. NWB Plc expects the deferred tax asset to be utilised against future taxable profits by the end of 2025.\n\nRBS plc - A deferred tax asset of \u00a3176 million (2020 - \u00a3200 million) has been recognised in respect of losses of \u00a3722 million of total losses of \u00a33,979 million carried forward at 31 December 2021.

The movement in the current financial year reflects a \u00a332 million reduction in the carrying value of the deferred tax asset following the announcement of the Group's withdrawal from the Republic of Ireland.\n\nNatWest Market N.V. (NWM N.V.) -A deferred tax asset of \u00a348 million has been recognised in respect of previously unrecognised tax losses and credits of \u00a3187 million of total tax losses and credits of \u00a32,785 million carried forward at 31 December 2021. NWM N.V. Group expects the deferred tax asset to be utilised against future taxable profits by the end of 2026.  NWM N.V. Group's Dutch fiscal unit has reported taxable profits in the period since the adoption of the new business model and repurposing of NWM N.V.'s banking license in 2019. In addition, NatWest Group strategic review of NWM Group has been largely completed in 2021, which has removed material uncertainties around the future business of NWM N.V.. As a result, NWM N.V. Group now considers it to be probable, based on its 5 year budget forecast, that future taxable profit will be available against which the tax losses and tax credits can be partially utilised.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n330\n\n## U Unnrreeccooggnniisseedd  ddeeffeerrrreedd  ttaaxx\n\nDeferred tax assets of \u00a35,437 million (2020 - \u00a34,965 million; 2019 - \u00a34,653 million) have not been recognised in respect of tax losses and other deductible temporary differences carried forward of \u00a324,699 million (2020 - \u00a325,091 million; 2019 \u00a323,555 million) in jurisdictions where doubt exists over the availability of future taxable profits.

Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the basic earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of dilutive share options and convertible securities.\n\n|                                                                                | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Earnings                                                                       |           |           |           |\n| Profit/(loss) from continuing operations attributable to ordinary shareholders | 2,674     | (874)     | 2,877     |\n| Profit from discontinued operations attributable to ordinary shareholders      | 276       | 121       | 256       |\n| Profit/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders                            | 2,950     | (753)     | 3,133     |\n| Weighted average number of shares (millions)                                   |           |           |           |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year         | 11,622    | 12,095    | 12,067    |\n| Effect of dilutive share options and convertible securities (1)                | 45        | -         | 35        |\n| Diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year | 11,667    | 12,095    | 12,102    |\n\n- (1) As there was a loss from continuing operations attributable to the parent company for the period to 31 December 2020, the effect of share options and convertible securities was not dilutive.\n\n## 10 Financial instruments - classification\n\nFinancial instruments are contracts that give rise to a financial asset of one entity and a corresponding financial liability or equity instrument of a counterparty entity, such as: cash; derivatives; loans; deposits; and settlement balances.

Information that is considered in determining the applicable business model includes the portfolio's policies and objectives, how the performance and risks of the portfolio are managed, evaluated and reported to management; and the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, sales expectation for future periods, and the reasons for sales.\n- \uf02d The contractual cash flow characteristics of financial assets are assessed with reference to whether the cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. A level of judgment is made in assessing terms that could change the contractual cash flows so that it would not meet the condition for solely payments of principal and interest, including contingent and leverage features, non-recourse arrangements and features that could modify the time value of money.\n\nFor accounting policy information see Accounting policies 10, 12, 13 and 15.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n332\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## 10 Financial instruments -

This encompasses loans, deposits, capital instruments and derivatives, which, have been converted using fallback provisions, switch provisions or as part of market-wide conversion events in the case of derivatives subject to clearing. These instruments will convert at the first repricing date post cessation.\n\nThe total amount of exposure for NatWest Group at 31 December 2021 subject to the above conversion provisions are \u00a322,056 million of assets, \u00a3426 million of liabilities, \u00a315,785 million of loan commitments and \u00a3557.7 billion of derivative notionals.\n\nDespite the significant conversion levels achieved, certain instruments remain in discussion with customers and counterparties to achieve consensual conversion. If consensual conversion is not achieved these instruments will default to synthetic LIBOR in line with relevant legislation.\n\nThe level of exposures without explicit or agreed conversion provisions as of 31 December 2021 is as follows:\n\n|                                     | Rates subject to IBOR reform   | Rates subject to IBOR reform   | Rates subject to IBOR reform   | Rates subject to IBOR reform   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                     | GBP LIBOR                      | USD IBOR (1) Other IBOR (2)    | USD IBOR (1) Other IBOR (2)    | Total                          |\n| 2021                                | \u00a3m                             | \u00a3m                             | \u00a3m                             | \u00a3m                             |\n| Trading assets                      | 62                             | 90                             | -                              | 152                            |\n| Loans to banks - amortised cost     | -                              | 11                             | -                              | 11                             |\n| Loans to customers - amortised cost | 4,788                          | 4,565                          | 267                            | 9,620                          |\n| Other financial assets              | 864                            | 768                            | -                              | 1,632                          |\n| Bank deposits                       | -                              | 37                             | -                              | 37                             |\n| Customer deposits                   | -                              | -                              | -                              | -                              |\n| Trading liabilities                 | 31                             | 166                            | -                              | 197                            |\n| Other financial liabilities         | 2,390                          | 7,023                          | 131                            | 9,544                          |\n| Subordinated liabilities            | -                              | 90                             | -                              | 90                             |\n| Loan commitments (3)                | 1,016                          | 6,366                          | 55                             | 7,437                          |\n| Derivatives notional (\u00a3bn)          | 3.6                            | 1,152.0                        |                                | - 1,155.6                      |\n\nAt December 2021 NatWest Group held certain currency swaps with both legs subject to IBOR reform, for which only the GBP LIBOR leg has an explicit or agreed conversion provisions as of 31 December 2021, but not the entire contract.

Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income as appropriate. This note presents information on the valuation of financial instruments.\n\nThe table below provides an overview of the various sections contained within the note.\n\n## C Crriittiiccaall  aaccccoouunnttiinngg  ppoolliiccyy::  FFaaiirr  vvaalluuee  --  ffiinnaanncciiaall  iinnssttrruummeennttss\n\nFinancial instruments classified as mandatory fair value through profit or loss; held-for-trading; designated fair value through profit or loss and fair value through other comprehensive income are recognised in the financial statements at fair value. All derivatives are measured at fair value.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value measurement considers the characteristics of the asset or liability and the assumptions that a market participant would consider when pricing the asset or liability.\n\nNatWest Group manages some portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities based on its net exposure to either market or credit risk. In these cases, the fair value is derived from the net risk exposure of that portfolio with portfolio level adjustments applied to incorporate bid-offer spreads, counterparty credit risk, and funding costs (see 'Valuation Adjustments').\n\nWhere the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair value is established using a valuation technique. These valuation techniques involve a degree of estimation, the extent of which depends on the instrument's complexity and the availability of market-based data. The complexity and uncertainty in the financial instrument's fair value is categorised using the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFor accounting policy information see Accounting policies notes 10 and 15.\n\n|                                                                                                                     | Page   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| F Fiinnaanncciiaall  iinnssttrruummeennttss                                                                         |        |\n| Critical accounting policy: Fair value                                                                              | 337    |\n| V Vaalluuaattiioonn                                                                                                 |        |\n| Fair value hierarchy (D)                                                                                            | 337    |\n| Valuation techniques (D)                                                                                            | 338    |\n| Inputs to valuation models (D)                                                                                      | 338    |\n| Valuation control (D)                                                                                               | 338    |\n| Key areas of judgment (D)                                                                                           | 339    |\n| Table of assets and liabilities split by fair value      hierarchy level (T)                                        | 340    |\n| V Vaalluuaattiioonn  aaddjjuussttmmeennttss                                                                         |        |\n| Table of fair value adjustments made (T)                                                                            | 341    |\n| Funding valuation adjustments (FVA) (D)                                                                             | 341    |\n| Credit valuation adjustments (CVA) (D)                                                                              | 341    |\n| Bid-offer (D)                                                                                                       | 341    |\n| Product and deal specific (D)                                                                                       | 341    |\n| Own credit (D)                                                                                                      | 341    |\n| L Leevveell  33  aaddddiittiioonnaall  iinnffoorrmmaattiioonn                                                       |        |\n| Level 3 ranges of unobservable inputs (D)                                                                           | 342    |\n| Table of level 3 instruments, valuation                                                                             |        |\n| techniques and inputs  ( (TT))                                                                                      | 342    |\n| Level 3 sensitivities (D)                                                                                           | 343    |\n| Alternative assumptions (D)                                                                                         | 343    |\n| Other considerations (D)                                                                                            | 343    |\n| Table of high and low range of fair value of                                                                        |        |\n| level 3 assets and liabilities  ( (TT))                                                                             | 343    |\n| Movement in level 3 assets and liabilities                                                                          |        |\n| over the reporting period (D)                                                                                       | 344    |\n| Table of the movement in level 3 assets and liabilities                                                             | 344    |\n| ( (TT)) F Faaiirr  vvaalluuee  ooff  ffiinnaanncciiaall  iinnssttrruummeennttss  mmeeaassuurreedd                   |        |\n| aatt  aammoorrttiisseedd  ccoosstt                                                                                  |        |\n| Table showing the fair value of financial instruments      measured at amortised cost on the balance sheet  ( (TT)) | 345    |\n| (D) = Descriptive; (T) = Table                                                                                      |        |\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n337\n\n## Valuation\n\n## F Faaiirr  vvaalluuee  hhiieerraarrcchhyy\n\nFinancial instruments carried at fair value have been classified under the fair value hierarchy. The classification ranges from level 1 to level 3, with more expert judgment and price uncertainly for those classified at level 3.\n\nThe determination of an instrument's level cannot be made at a global product level as a single product type can be in more than one level. For example, a single name corporate credit default swap could be in level 2 or level 3 depending on the level of market activity for the referenced entity .\n\nLevel 1 - instruments valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active and liquid markets, for identical financial instruments. Examples include government bonds, listed equity shares and certain exchange-traded derivatives.\n\nLevel 2 - instruments valued using valuation techniques that have observable inputs. Observable inputs are those that are readily available with limited adjustments required. Examples include most government agency securities, investment-grade corporate bonds, certain mortgage products - including CLOs, most bank loans, repos and reverse repos, state and municipal obligations, most notes issued, certain money market securities, loan commitments and most OTC derivatives.\n\nLevel 3 - instruments valued using a valuation technique where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instruments valuation, is not based on observable market data. Examples include non-derivative instruments which trade infrequently, certain syndicated and commercial mortgage loans, private equity, and derivatives with unobservable model inputs.\n\nFinancial statements",

Examples include equities and most debt securities.\n\nNon-modelled products can fall into any fair value levelling hierarchy depending on the observable market activity, liquidity, and assessment of valuation uncertainty of the instruments. The assessment of fair value and the classification of the instrument to a fair value level is subject to the valuation controls discussed in the Valuation control section.\n\nModelled products valued using a pricing model range in complexity from comparatively vanilla products such as interest rate swaps and options (e.g., interest rate caps and floors) through to more complex derivatives (e.g., balance guarantee swaps).\n\nFor modelled products the fair value is derived using the model and the appropriate model inputs or parameters, as opposed to a cash price equivalent. Model inputs are taken either directly or indirectly from available data, where some inputs are also modelled.\n\nFair value classification of modelled instruments is either level 2 or level 3, depending on the product/model combination, the observability and quality of input parameters and other factors. All these must be assessed to classify a position. The modelled product is assigned to the lowest fair value hierarchy level of any significant input used in that valuation.\n\nMost derivative instruments, for example vanilla interest rate swaps, foreign exchange swaps and liquid single name credit derivatives, are classified as level 2. This is because they are vanilla products valued using standard market models and with observable inputs. Level 2 products range from vanilla to more complex products, where more complex products remain classified as Level 2 due to the materiality of any unobservable inputs.\n\n## I Innppuuttss  ttoo  vvaalluuaattiioonn  mmooddeellss\n\nWhen using valuation techniques, the fair value can be significantly affected by the choice of valuation model and underlying assumptions. Factors considered include the cashflow amounts and timing of those cash flows, and application of appropriate discount rates, incorporating both funding and credit risk. Values between and beyond available data points are obtained by interpolation and extrapolation. The principal inputs to these valuation techniques are as follows:\n\nBond prices - quoted prices are generally available for government bonds, certain corporate securities, and some mortgage-related products.\n\nCredit spreads - these express the return required over a benchmark rate or index to compensate for the referenced credit risk. Where available, these are derived from the price of credit default swaps or other credit-based instruments, such as debt securities. When direct prices are not available; credit spreads are determined with reference to available prices of entities with similar characteristics.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n338\n\nInterest rates - these are principally based on interest rate swap prices referencing benchmark interest rates. Benchmark rates include Interbank Offered Rates (IBOR) and the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) rate, including SONIA (Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rate). Other quoted interest rates may also be used from both the bond, and futures markets.\n\nForeign currency exchange rates - there are observable prices both for spot and forward contracts and futures in the world's major currencies.\n\nEquity and equity index prices - quoted prices are generally readily available for equity shares listed on the world's major stock exchanges and for major indices on such shares.\n\nPrice volatilities and correlations - volatility is a measure of the tendency of a price to change with time. Correlation measures the degree which two or more prices or variables are observed to move together. Variables that move in the same direction show positive correlation; those that move in opposite directions are negatively correlated.\n\nPrepayment rates - rates used to reflect how fast a pool of assets prepay. The fair value of a financial instrument that can be prepaid by the issuer or borrower differs from that of an instrument that cannot be prepaid. When valuing prepayable instruments, the value of this prepayment option is considered.\n\nRecovery rates/loss given default - these are used as an input to valuation models and reserves for asset-backed securities and other credit products as an indicator of severity of losses on default. Recovery rates are primarily sourced from market data providers, the value of the underlying collateral, or inferred from observable credit spreads.\n\n## V Vaalluuaattiioonn  ccoonnttrrooll\n\nNatWest Group's control environment for the determination of the fair value of financial instruments includes formalised procedures for the review and validation of fair values. This review is performed by an independent price verification (IPV) team.\n\nIPV is a key element of the control environment. Valuations are first performed by the business which entered into the transaction. These valuations are then reviewed by the IPV team, independent of those trading the financial instruments, in light of available pricing evidence.\n\nIndependent pricing data is collated from a range of sources. Each source is reviewed for quality and the independent data applied in the IPV processes using a formalised input quality hierarchy. Consensus services are one source of independent data and encompass interest rate, currency, credit, and bond markets, providing comprehensive coverage of vanilla products and a wide selection of exotic products.\n\nWhere measurement differences are identified through the IPV process these are grouped by the quality hierarchy of the independent data. If the size of the difference exceeds defined thresholds, an adjustment is made to bring the valuation to within the independently calculated fair value range.\n\nIPV takes place at least monthly, for all fair value financial instruments. The IPV control includes formalised reporting and escalation of any valuation differences in breach of established thresholds.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## 11 Financial instruments - valuation\n\n## continued\n\nThe quality and completeness of the information gathered in the IPV process gives an indication as to the liquidity and valuation uncertainty of an instrument and forms part of the information considered when determining fair value hierarchy classifications.\n\nInitial fair value level classification of a financial instrument is carried out by the IPV team. These initial classifications are subject to senior management review. Particular attention is paid to instruments transferring from one level to another, new instrument classes or products, instruments where the transaction price is significantly different from the fair value and instruments where valuation uncertainty is high.\n\nValuation Committees are made up of valuation specialists and senior business representatives from various functions and oversees pricing, reserving and valuations issues. These committees meet monthly to review and ratify any methodology changes. The Executive Valuation Committee meets quarterly to address key material and subjective valuation issues, to review items escalated by Valuation Committees and to discuss other relevant industry matters.\n\nThe Group model risk policy sets the policy for model documentation, testing and review. Governance of the model risk policy is carried out by the Group model risk oversight committee, which comprises model risk owners and independent model experts. All models are required to be independently validated in accordance with the Model Risk Policy.\n\n## K Keeyy  aarreeaass  ooff  jjuuddggmmeenntt\n\nOver the years the business has simplified, with most products classified as level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. However, the diverse range of products historically traded by NatWest Group means some products remain classified as level 3. Level 3 indicates a significant level of pricing uncertainty, where expert judgment is used. As such, extra disclosures are required in respect of level 3 instruments .\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n339\n\nOver the years the business has simplified, with most products classified as level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. However, the diverse range of products historically traded by NatWest Group means some products remain classified as level 3. Level 3 indicates a significant level of pricing uncertainty, where expert judgment is used. As such, extra disclosures are required in respect of level 3 instruments .\n\nIn general, the degree of expert judgment used and hence valuation uncertainty depends on the degree of liquidity of an instrument or input.\n\nWhere markets are liquid, little judgment is required. However, when the information regarding the liquidity in a particular market is not clear, a judgment may need to be made. For example, for an equity traded on an exchange, daily volumes of trading can be seen, but for an over the counter (OTC) derivative, assessing the liquidity of the market with no central exchange is more challenging.\n\nA key related matter is where a market moves from liquid to illiquid or vice versa. Where this movement is considered temporary, the fair value level is not changed. For example, if there is little market trading in a product on a reporting date but at the previous reporting date and during the intervening period the market has been liquid. In this case, the instrument will continue to be classified at the same level in the hierarchy. This is to provide consistency so that transfers between levels are driven by genuine changes in market liquidity and do not reflect short term or seasonal effects. Material movements between levels are reviewed quarterly by the Business and IPV. The breadth and depth of the IPV data allows for a rules-based quality assessment to be made of market activity, liquidity, and pricing uncertainty, which assists with the process of allocation to an appropriate level. Where suitable independent pricing information is not readily available, the quality assessment will result in the instrument being assessed as level 3.\n\nFinancial statements",

These adjustments are presented in the table below:\n\n| Adjustment                | 2 2002211 \u00a3 \u00a3mm   |   2020 \u00a3m |\n|---------------------------|-------------------|-----------|\n| Funding - FVA             | 9 900             |       140 |\n| Credit - CVA              | 3 39900           |       390 |\n| Bid - Offer               | 1 11133           |       148 |\n| Product and deal specific | 1 11199           |       172 |\n|                           | 7 71122           |       850 |\n\nThere was a reallocation of FVA to CVA during the period following an update to the risk management of certain exposures. The net decrease across CVA and FVA was driven by reduced exposures, due to increases in interest rates and trade exit activity. The reduction in bid-offer and product and deal specific reserves followed reduced risk due to trade exit activity and LIBOR cessation.\n\n## F Fuunnddiinngg  vvaalluuaattiioonn  aaddjjuussttmmeennttss  ((FFVVAA))\n\nFVA represents an estimate of the adjustment that a market participant would make to incorporate funding costs and benefits that arise in relation to derivative exposures. FVA is calculated as a portfolio level adjustment and can result in either a funding charge (positive) or funding benefit (negative).\n\nFunding levels are applied to estimated potential future exposures. For uncollateralised derivatives, the exposure reflects the future valuation of the derivative. For collateralised derivatives, the exposure reflects the difference between the future valuation of the derivative and the level of collateral posted.\n\n## C Crreeddiitt  vvaalluuaattiioonn  aaddjjuussttmmeennttss  ((CCVVAA))\n\nCVA represents an estimate of the adjustment to fair value that is made to incorporate the counterparty credit risk inherent in derivative exposures. CVA is actively managed by a credit and market risk hedging process, and therefore movements in CVA are partially offset by trading revenue on the hedges.\n\nThe CVA is calculated on a portfolio basis reflecting an estimate of the amount a third party would charge to assume the credit risk.\n\nCollateral held under a credit support agreement is factored into the CVA calculation. In such cases where NatWest Group holds collateral against counterparty exposures, CVA is held to the extent that residual risk remains.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n341\n\n## B Biidd--ooffffeerr\n\nFair value positions are required to be marked to exit, represented by bid (long positions) or offer (short positions) levels. Non-derivative positions are typically marked directly to bid or offer prices. However derivative exposures are adjusted to exit levels by taking bid-offer reserves calculated on a portfolio basis. The bid-offer approach is based on current market spreads and standard market bucketing of risk.\n\nBid-offer spreads vary by maturity and risk type to reflect different spreads in the market. For positions where there is no observable quote, the bid-offer spreads are widened in comparison to proxies to reflect reduced liquidity or observability.\n\nNetting is applied on a portfolio basis to reflect the value at which NatWest Group believes it could exit the net risk of the portfolio, rather than the sum of exit costs for each of the portfolio's individual trades. This is applied where the asset and liability positions are managed as a portfolio for risk and reporting purposes.\n\n## P Prroodduucctt  aanndd  ddeeaall  ssppeecciiffiicc\n\nOn initial recognition of financial assets and liabilities valued using valuation techniques which have a significant dependence on information other than observable market data, any difference between the transaction price and that derived from the valuation technique is deferred. Such amounts are recognised in the income statement over the life of the transaction; when market data becomes observable; or when the transaction matures or is closed out as appropriate. On 31 December 2021, net gains of \u00a371 million (2020 - \u00a363 million) were carried forward. During the year, net gains of \u00a3103 million (2020 - \u00a375 million) were deferred and \u00a394 million (2020 - \u00a3100 million) were recognised in the income statement.\n\nWhere system generated valuations do not accurately recover market prices, manual valuation adjustments are applied either at a position or portfolio level. Manual adjustments are subject to the scrutiny of independent control teams and are subject to monthly review by senior management.\n\n## O Owwnn  CCrreeddiitt\n\nNatWest Group considers the effect of its own credit standing when valuing financial liabilities recorded at fair value. Own credit spread adjustments are made when valuing issued debt held at fair value, including issued structured notes. An own credit adjustment is applied to positions where it is believed that counterparties would consider NatWest Group's creditworthiness when pricing trades.\n\nFinancial statements",

valuation continued\n\n## L Leevveell  33  sseennssiittiivviittiieess\n\nThe level 3 sensitivities presented below are calculated at a trade or low-level portfolio basis rather than an overall portfolio basis. As individual sensitivities are aggregated with no reflection of the correlated nature between instruments, the overall portfolio sensitivity may not be accurately reflected. For example, some portfolios may be negatively correlated to others, where a downwards movement in one asset would produce an upwards movement in another. However, due to the additive presentation of the above figures this correlation impact cannot be displayed. As such, the actual potential downside sensitivity of the total portfolio may be less than the non-correlated sum of the additive figures as shown in the below table.\n\n## A Alltteerrnnaattiivvee  aassssuummppttiioonnss\n\nReasonably plausible alternative assumptions of unobservable inputs are determined based on a specified target level of certainty of 90%.\n\nAlternative assumptions are determined with reference to all available evidence including consideration of the following: quality of independent pricing information considering consistency between different sources, variation over time, perceived tradability or otherwise of available quotes; consensus service dispersion ranges; volume of trading activity and market bias (e.g. one-way inventory); day 1 profit or loss arising on new trades; number and nature of market participants; market conditions; modelling consistency in the market; size and nature of risk; length of holding of position; and market intelligence.\n\n## O Otthheerr  ccoonnssiiddeerraattiioonnss\n\nWhilst certain inputs used to calculate CVA, FVA and own credit adjustments are not based on observable market data, the uncertainty of these inputs is not considered to have a significant effect on the net valuation of the related derivative portfolios and issued debt.\n\nAs such, the fair value levelling of the derivative portfolios and issued debt is not determined by CVA, FVA or own credit inputs. In addition, any fair value sensitivity driven by these inputs is not included in the level 3 sensitivities presented.\n\nThe table below shows the high and low range of fair value of the level 3 assets and liabilities. This range incorporates the range of fair value inputs as described in the previous table.\n\n|                             | 2021       | 2021          | 2021            | 2020       | 2020          | 2020            |\n|-----------------------------|------------|---------------|-----------------|------------|---------------|-----------------|\n|                             | Level 3 \u00a3m | Favourable \u00a3m | Unfavourable \u00a3m | Level 3 \u00a3m | Favourable \u00a3m | Unfavourable \u00a3m |\n| Assets                      |            |               |                 |            |               |                 |\n| Trading assets              |            |               |                 |            |               |                 |\n| Loans                       | 721        | 10            | (10)            | 225        | 10            | -               |\n| Securities                  | 21         | -             | -               | 81         | -             | -               |\n| Derivatives                 | 917        | 60            | (70)            | 1,082      | 80            | (80)            |\n| Other financial assets      |            |               |                 |            |               |                 |\n| Loans                       | 207        | 10            | (10)            | 168        | 20            | (10)            |\n| Securities                  | 186        | 20            | (20)            | 167        | 30            | (20)            |\n|                             | 2,052      | 100           | (110)           | 1,723      | 140           | (110)           |\n| Liabilities                 |            |               |                 |            |               |                 |\n| Trading liabilities         |            |               |                 |            |               |                 |\n| Deposits                    | 2          | -             | -               | 7          | -             | -               |\n| Debt securities in issue    | -          | -             | -               | -          | -             | -               |\n| Short positions             | 1          | -             | -               | -          | -             | -               |\n| Derivatives                 | 606        | 30            | (30)            | 887        | 50            | (40)            |\n| Other financial liabilities | -          | -             | -               | -          | -             | -               |\n|                             | 609        | 30            | (30)            | 894        | 50            | (40)            |\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n343\n\nFinancial statements",

Two principal methods are used to estimate fair value:\n\n- (a) Contractual cash flows are discounted using a market discount rate that incorporates the current spread for the borrower or where this is not observable, the spread for borrowers of a similar credit standing. This method is used for portfolios where counterparties have external ratings: institutional and corporate lending.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n345\n\n- (b) Expected cash flows (unadjusted for credit losses) are discounted at the current offer rate for the same or similar products. The current methodology caps all loan values at par rather than modelling clients' option to repay loans early. This approach is adopted for lending portfolios in Retail Banking, Ulster Bank RoI, Commercial Banking (SME loans) and Private Banking in order to reflect the homogeneous nature of these portfolios.\n\n## D Deebbtt  sseeccuurriittiieess  aanndd  ssuubboorrddiinnaatteedd  lliiaabbiilliittiieess\n\nMost debt securities are valued using quoted prices in active markets or from quoted prices of similar financial instruments in active markets. Fair values of the remaining population are determined using market standard valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flows, adjusting for own credit spreads where appropriate.\n\n## B Baannkk  aanndd  ccuussttoommeerr  ddeeppoossiittss\n\nFair values of deposits are estimated using discounted cash flow valuation techniques.

The balances in the following tables do not agree directly with the consolidated balance sheet, as the tables include all cash flows relating to principal and future coupon payments, presented on an undiscounted basis. The tables have been prepared on the following basis:\n\nFinancial assets have been reflected in the time band of the latest date on which they could be repaid, unless earlier repayment can be demanded by NatWest Group. Financial liabilities are included at the earliest date on which the counterparty can require repayment, regardless of whether or not such early repayment results in a penalty. If the repayment of a financial instrument is triggered by, or is subject to, specific criteria such as market price hurdles being reached, the asset is included in the time band that contains the latest date on which it can be repaid, regardless of early repayment.\n\nThe liability is included in the time band that contains the earliest possible date on which the conditions could be fulfilled, without considering the probability of the conditions being met.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n346\n\nFor example, if a structured note is automatically prepaid when an equity index exceeds a certain level, the cash outflow will be included in the less than three months period, whatever the level of the index at the year end. The settlement date of debt securities in issue, issued by certain securitisation vehicles consolidated by NatWest Group, depends on when cash flows are received from the securitised assets. Where these assets are prepayable, the timing of the cash outflow relating to securities assumes that each asset will be prepaid at the earliest possible date. As the repayments of assets and liabilities are linked, the repayment of assets in securitisations is shown on the earliest date that the asset can be prepaid, as this is the basis used for liabilities.\n\nThe principal amounts of financial assets and liabilities that are repayable after 20 years or where the counterparty has no right to repayment of the principal are excluded from the table, as are interest payments after 20 years.\n\nThe maturity of guarantees and commitments is based on the earliest possible date they would be drawn in order to evaluate NatWest Group's liquidity position.\n\nMFVTPL assets of \u00a3165.6 billion (2020 - \u00a3235.9 billion) and HFT liabilities of \u00a3165.3 billion (2020 - \u00a3232.8 billion) have been excluded from the following tables.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## 12 Financial instruments -

NatWest Group uses derivatives as a part of its trading activities, to manage its own risks such as interest rate, foreign exchange, or credit risk and in certain customer transactions. This note shows contracted volumes of derivatives, how they are used for hedging purposes and more specifically the effects of the application of hedge accounting.\n\nFor accounting policy information see Accounting policies note 10 and 15.\n\n|                                | 2021         | 2021      | 2021           | 2020         | 2020      | 2020           |\n|--------------------------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|\n|                                | Notional \u00a3bn | Assets \u00a3m | Liabilities \u00a3m | Notional \u00a3bn | Assets \u00a3m | Liabilities \u00a3m |\n| Exchange rate contracts        | 3,167        | 38,517    | 39,286         | 3,328        | 52,239    | 55,107         |\n| Interest rate contracts        | 8,919        | 67,458    | 61,206         | 10,703       | 114,115   | 105,214        |\n| Credit derivatives             | 14           | 154       | 343            | 15           | 161       | 376            |\n| Equity and commodity contracts | -            | 10        | -              | 1            | 8         | 8              |\n|                                |              | 106,139   | 100,835        |              | 166,523   | 160,705        |\n\nNatWest Group applies hedge accounting to reduce the accounting mismatch caused in the income statement by using derivatives to hedge the following risks: interest rate, foreign exchange and net investment in foreign operations.\n\nNatWest Group's interest rate hedging relates to the management of NatWest Group's non-trading structural interest rate risk, caused by the mismatch between fixed interest rates and floating interest rates on its financial instruments. NatWest Group manages this risk within approved limits. Residual risk positions are hedged with derivatives, principally interest rate swaps.\n\nSuitable larger fixed rate financial instruments are subject to fair value hedging; the remaining exposure, where possible, is hedged by derivatives designated as cash flow hedges.\n\nCash flow hedges of interest rate risk relate to exposures to the variability in future interest payments and receipts due to the movement of benchmark interest rates on forecast transactions and on financial assets and financial liabilities. This variability in cash flows is hedged by interest rate swaps, which convert variable cash flows into fixed. For these cash flow hedge relationships, the hedged items are actual and forecast variable interest rate cash flows arising from financial assets and financial liabilities with interest rates linked to the relevant benchmark rates, most notably LIBOR, EURIBOR, SONIA and the Bank of England Official Bank Rate. The variability in cash flows due to movements in the relevant benchmark rate is hedged; this risk component is identified using the risk management systems of NatWest Group and encompasses the majority of cash flow variability risk.\n\nFair value hedges of interest rate risk involve interest rate swaps transforming the fixed interest rate risk in financial assets and financial liabilities to floating. The hedged risk is the risk of changes in the hedged item's fair value attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate risk component of the hedged item. The significant benchmarks identified as risk components are LIBOR, EURIBOR and SONIA. These risk components are identified using the risk management systems of NatWest Group and encompass the majority of the hedged item's fair value risk.\n\nNatWest Group hedges the exchange rate risk of its net investment in foreign currency denominated operations with currency borrowings and forward foreign exchange contracts. NatWest Group reviews the value of the investments' net assets, executing hedges where appropriate to reduce the\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n349\n\nsensitivity of capital ratios to foreign exchange rate movement. Hedge accounting relationships will be designated where required.\n\nExchange rate risk also arises in NatWest Group where payments are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Residual risk positions are hedged with forward foreign exchange contracts, fixing the exchange rate the payments will be settled in. The derivatives are documented as cash flow hedges.\n\nFor all cash flow hedging and fair value hedge relationships, and net investment hedging, NatWest Group determines that there is an adequate level of offsetting between the hedged item and hedging instrument at inception and on an ongoing basis.  This is achieved by comparing movements in the fair value of the expected highly probable forecast interest cash flows/fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk with movements in the fair value of the expected changes in cash flows from the hedging interest rate swap. Hedge effectiveness is assessed on a cumulative basis over a time period management determines to be appropriate. NatWest Group uses either the actual ratio between the hedged item and hedging instrument(s) or one that minimises hedge ineffectiveness to establish the hedge ratio for hedge accounting.  Hedge ineffectiveness is measured and recognised in the income statement as it arises.\n\nIBOR reform - NatWest Group in the year continued to apply, for relationships directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform, Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 issued September 2019 ('Phase 1 relief') and Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 issued August 2020 ('Phase 2 relief').\n\nSignificant transitions in the year were the GBP, JPY and CHF derivatives subject to cash flow and fair value hedging transitioned as part of the LCH 'big bang' conversion in December 2021. The swaps were restructured to reprice off the appropriate risk free rate from the next repricing date post 31 December 2021 plus a spread adjustment. All impacted hedge accounting relationships had their designations updated to reflect this transition.\n\nUSD cash flow and fair value hedges of interest rate risk that mature post 30 June 2023 continue to be directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nFinancial statements",

At 31 December 2021, customer loan impairment provisions amounted to \u00a33,806 million (2020 \u00a36,186 million). A loan is impaired when there is objective evidence that the cash flows will not occur in the manner expected when the loan was advanced. Such evidence includes, changes in the credit rating of a borrower, the failure to make payments in accordance with the loan agreement, significant reduction in the value of any security, breach of limits or covenants, and observable data about relevant macroeconomic measures.\n\nThe impairment loss is the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the present value of estimated future cash flows at the loan's original effective interest rate.\n\nThe measurement of credit impairment under the IFRS expected loss model depends on management's assessment of any potential deterioration in the creditworthiness of the borrower, its modelling of expected performance and the application of economic forecasts. All three elements require judgments that are potentially significant to the estimate of impairment losses.

This note presents the cost of the assets, which is the amount NatWest Group initially paid or incurred, additions and disposals during the year, and any amortisation or impairment. Amortisation is a charge that reflects the usage of the asset and impairment is a reduction in value arising from specific events identified during the year.\n\nFor accounting policy information see Accounting policies notes 5 and 6.\n\n|                                                   | 2021        | 2021         | 2021     | 2020        | 2020         | 2020     |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|----------|-------------|--------------|----------|\n| Cost                                              | Goodwill \u00a3m | Other (1) \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m | Goodwill \u00a3m | Other (1) \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| At 1 January                                      | 9,939       | 2,592        | 12,531   | 9,980       | 2,293        | 12,273   |\n| Currency translation and other adjustments        | -           | 29           | 29       | -           | (1)          | (1)      |\n| Additions                                         | -           | 479          | 479      | -           | 348          | 348      |\n| Disposals and write-off of fully amortised assets | -           | (50)         | (50)     | (41)        | (48)         | (89)     |\n| At 31 December                                    | 9,939       | 3,050        | 12,989   | 9,939       | 2,592        | 12,531   |\n| Accumulated amortisation and impairment           |             |              |          |             |              |          |\n| At 1 January                                      | 4,332       | 1,544        | 5,876    | 4,373       | 1,278        | 5,651    |\n| Currency translation and other adjustments        | -           | 31           | 31       | -           | 1            | 1        |\n| Disposals and write-off of fully amortised assets | -           | (28)         | (28)     | (41)        | (26)         | (67)     |\n| Impairment of intangible assets                   | 85          | 2            | 87       | -           | 9            | 9        |\n| Amortisation charge for the year                  | -           | 300          | 300      | -           | 282          | 282      |\n| At 31 December                                    | 4,417       | 1,849        | 6,266    | 4,332       | 1,544        | 5,876    |\n| Net book value at 31 December                     | 5,522       | 1,201        | 6,723    | 5,607       | 1,048        | 6,655    |\n\nIntangible assets and goodwill are reviewed for indicators of impairment. In 2021 \u00a385 million of goodwill was impaired due to a reduction in the recoverable value.\n\nNatWest Group's goodwill acquired in business combinations analysed by reportable segment is in Note 4 Segmental analysis. It is reviewed annually at 31 December for impairment. In 2021 goodwill in the Retail segment was impaired by \u00a385 million. No other impairment was indicated at 31 December 2021 or 2020.\n\nImpairment testing involves the comparison of the carrying value of each cash-generating unit (CGU) with its recoverable amount. The carrying values of the segments reflect the equity allocations made by management, which are consistent with NatWest Group's capital targets.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants. Value in use is the present value of expected future cash flows from the CGU.\n\nThe recoverable amounts for all CGUs at 31 December 2021 were based on value in use, using management's latest fiveyear revenue and cost forecasts. These are discounted cash flow projections over five years. The forecast is then extrapolated in perpetuity using a long-term growth rate to compute a terminal value, which comprises the majority of the value in use. The long-term growth rates have been based on expected growth of the CGUs. The pre-tax risk discount rates are based on those observed to be applied to businesses regarded as peers of the CGUs.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n357\n\n## Critical accounting policy: Goodwill\n\n## C Crriittiiccaall  eessttiimmaatteess\n\nImpairment testing involves a number of judgments.  The key judgments are the five-year cash flow forecast, the long-term growth rate used to derive the terminal value, and the discount rate. Future value in use is primarily affected by changes in profitability and changes in discount rate. Adverse changes could lead to value in use falling below carrying value. The most likely cause for this would be a failure to meet budgets, including cost targets, or external downgrades in the UK economy.\n\nFinancial statements",

There is often a high degree of uncertainty and judgment is based on the specific facts and circumstances relating to individual events in determining whether there is a present obligation. Judgment is also involved in estimation of the probability, timing and amount of any outflows. Where NatWest Group can look to another party such as an insurer to pay some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision, any reimbursement is recognised when, and only when, it is virtually certain that it will be received.\n\nEstimates - Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount and are recognised when there is a present obligation as a result of a past event, the outflow of economic benefit is probable and the outflow can be estimated reliably.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n360\n\nAny difference between the final outcome and the amounts provided will affect the reported results in the period when the matter is resolved.\n\n- \uf02d Customer redress: Provisions reflect the estimated cost of redress attributable to claims where it is determined that a present obligation exists.\n- \uf02d Property: This includes provision for contractual costs such as rates associated with vacant properties.\n- \uf02d Litigation and other regulatory: NatWest Group is engaged in various legal proceedings, both in the UK and in overseas jurisdictions, including the US.

At 31 December 2021, the directors had authority granted at the 2021 Annual General Meeting to issue up to \u00a3608,328,288 nominal of ordinary shares other than by preemption to existing shareholders. This figure was reduced to \u00a3578,791,771 to reflect the reduction in issued share capital resulting from the off-market buyback announced on 19 March 2021.\n\nOn 6 February 2019 the company held a General Meeting and shareholders approved a special resolution to give the company authority to make off-market purchases of its ordinary shares from HM Treasury (or its nominee) at such times as the directors may determine is appropriate. Full details of the proposal are set out in the Circular and Notice of General Meeting. This authority was renewed at the Annual General Meeting in 2021 and shareholders will be asked to renew the authority at the Annual General Meeting in 2022.\n\nThe company utilised the authority it obtained at the 2020 AGM to make an off-market purchase of 590,730,325 ordinary shares (nominal value \u00a3590,730,325) in the company from HMT on 19 March 2021, at a price of 190.50p per ordinary share for the total consideration of \u00a31,125,341,269, representing 4.86% of the company's issued ordinary share capital. The company cancelled 390,730,325 of the purchased ordinary shares and held the remaining 200,000,000 ordinary shares in treasury. The company has used a total of 19,062,290 treasury shares to satisfy the exercise of options and the vesting of share awards under the employee share plans.\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting in 2021 shareholders authorised the company to make market purchases of up to 1,216,656,575 ordinary shares in the company. The directors utilised the authority obtained at the 2021 AGM to conduct a share buyback programme (the Programme) of up to \u00a3750 million, as announced to the market on 30 July 2021. The Programme's purpose is to reduce the ordinary share capital of NatWest Group. Taking into account the reduction in issued ordinary share capital which occurred as a result of the off-market buyback announced on 19 March 2021, the maximum number of ordinary shares that could be purchased by the company under the Programme was 1,157,583,542. The Programme commenced on 2 August 2021 and, as at 31 December 2021, 310,802,416 ordinary shares (nominal value \u00a3310,802,416) had been purchased by the company at an average purchase price of 217.5796p per ordinary share for the total consideration of \u00a3676,242,656.\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n361\n\nA further 29,735,044 ordinary shares (nominal value \u00a329,735,044) were purchased by the company from 1 January to 18 January 2022 at an average purchase price of 245.5264p per ordinary share for the total consideration of \u00a373,007,375.

SEs are usually established for a specific, limited purpose. They do not carry out a business or trade and typically have no employees. They take a variety of legal forms - trusts, partnerships and companies and fulfil many different functions where these can be a medium for a single transaction or portfolio of similar transactions. SEs are established as investment or funding vehicles, within the NatWest Group and for client transactions.\n\n## C Coonnssoolliiddaatteedd  ssttrruuccttuurreedd  eennttiittiieess\n\n## Securitisations\n\nIn a securitisation, assets, or interests in a pool of assets, are transferred generally to an SE which then issues liabilities to third party investors. The majority of securitisations are supported through liquidity facilities or other credit enhancements. NatWest Group arranges securitisations to facilitate client transactions and undertakes own-asset securitisations to sell or to fund portfolios of financial assets. NatWest Group also acts as an underwriter and depositor in securitisation transactions in both client and proprietary transactions.\n\nNatWest Group involvement in client securitisations takes a number of forms. It may: sponsor or administer a securitisation programme; provide liquidity facilities or programme-wide credit enhancement; and purchase securities issued by the vehicle.\n\n## O Otthheerr  ccrreeddiitt  rriisskk  ttrraannssffeerr  sseeccuurriittiissaattiioonnss\n\nNatWest Group also transfers credit risk on originated loans and mortgages without the transfer of assets to a SE. As part of this, NatWest Group enters into credit derivative and financial guarantee contracts with consolidated SEs. At 31 December 2021, debt securities in issue by such SEs (and held by third parties) were \u00a3867 million (2020 - \u00a3772 million). The associated loans and mortgages at 31 December 2021 were \u00a37,137 million (2020 - \u00a310,027 million). At 31 December, ECL in relation to non-defaulted assets was reduced by \u00a328 million\n\n(2020 - \u00a3183 million) as a result of financial guarantee contracts with consolidated SEs.\n\n## C Coovveerreedd  ddeebbtt  pprrooggrraammmmee\n\nGroup companies have assigned loans to customers and debt investments to bankruptcy remote limited liability partnerships to provide security for issues of debt securities. NatWest Group retains all of the risks and rewards of these assets and continues to recognise them. The partnerships are consolidated by NatWest Group and the related covered bonds included within other financial liabilities. At 31 December 2021, \u00a38,965 million (2020 - \u00a310,758 million) of loans to customers and nil (2020 - \u00a3318 million) of debt investments provided security for debt securities in issue and other borrowing of \u00a33,512 million (2020 - \u00a34,105 million).\n\n## L Leennddiinngg  ooff  oowwnn  iissssuueedd  sseeccuurriittiieess\n\nNatWest Group has issued, retained, and lent debt securities under securities lending arrangements. Under standard terms in the UK and US markets, the recipient has an unrestricted right to sell or repledge collateral, subject to returning equivalent securities on maturity of the transaction. NatWest Group retains all of the risks and rewards of own issued liabilities lent under such arrangements and does not recognise them. At 31 December 2021, \u00a31,494 million (2020 - \u00a31,893 million) of secured own issued liabilities have been retained and lent under securities lending arrangements. At 31 December 2021, \u00a31,564 million (2020 - \u00a32,029 million) of loans and other debt instruments provided security for secured own issued liabilities that have been retained and lent under securities lending arrangements .\n\n## U Unnccoonnssoolliiddaatteedd  ssttrruuccttuurreedd  eennttiittiieess\n\nNatWest Group's interest in unconsolidated structured entities is analysed below.\n\n|                                       | 2021                                    | 2021                           | 2021     | 2020                                    | 2020                           | 2020     |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------|\n|                                       | Asset backed securitisation vehicles \u00a3m | Investment funds and others \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m | Asset backed securitisation vehicles \u00a3m | Investment funds and others \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| Trading assets and derivatives        |                                         |                                |          |                                         |                                |          |\n| Trading assets                        | 490                                     | 117                            | 607      | 319                                     | 46                             | 365      |\n| Derivative assets                     | 251                                     | 18                             | 269      | 441                                     | 16                             | 457      |\n| Derivative liabilities                | (170)                                   | (1)                            | (171)    | (319)                                   | (21)                           | (340)    |\n| Total                                 | 571                                     | 134                            | 705      | 441                                     | 41                             | 482      |\n| Non trading assets                    |                                         |                                |          |                                         |                                |          |\n| Loans to customers                    | 1,692                                   | 361                            | 2,053    | 1,400                                   | 497                            | 1,897    |\n| Other financial assets                | 3,645                                   | 379                            | 4,024    | 3,892                                   | 170                            | 4,062    |\n| Total                                 | 5,337                                   | 740                            | 6,077    | 5,292                                   | 667                            | 5,959    |\n| Liquidity facilities/loan commitments | 1,403                                   | 135                            | 1,538    | 1,482                                   | 204                            | 1,686    |\n| Maximum exposure                      | 7,311                                   | 1,009                          | 8,320    | 7,215                                   | 912                            | 8,127    |\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n365\n\nFinancial statements",

In carrying out this policy, NatWest Group has regard to the supervisory requirements of the PRA. The PRA uses capital ratios as a measure of capital adequacy in the UK banking sector, comparing a bank's capital resources with its risk-weighted assets (the assets and off-balance sheet exposures are weighted to reflect the inherent credit and other risks); by international agreement, the Pillar 1 capital ratios should be not less than 8% with a Common Equity Tier 1 component of not less than 4.5%. NatWest Group has complied with the PRA's capital requirements throughout the year.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n367\n\nA number of subsidiaries and sub-groups within NatWest Group, principally banking entities, are subject to various individual regulatory capital requirements in the UK and overseas. Furthermore, the payment of dividends by subsidiaries and the ability of members of NatWest Group to lend money to other members of NatWest Group may be subject to restrictions such as local regulatory or legal requirements, the availability of reserves and financial and operating performance.\n\nFinancial statements",

NatWest Group expects most guarantees it provides to expire unused.\n\nStandby facilities and credit lines - under a loan commitment, NatWest Group agrees to make funds available to a customer in the future. Loan commitments, which are usually for a specified term, may be unconditionally cancellable or may persist, provided all conditions in the loan facility are satisfied or waived. Commitments to lend include commercial standby facilities and credit lines, liquidity facilities to commercial paper conduits and unutilised overdraft facilities.\n\nOther commitments - these include documentary credits, which are commercial letters of credit providing for payment by NatWest Group to a named beneficiary against presentation of specified documents, forward asset purchases, forward deposits placed and undrawn note issuance and revolving underwriting facilities, and other short-term trade related transactions.\n\nOther contingent liabilities - these include standby letters of credit, supporting customer debt issues and contingent liabilities relating to customer trading activities such as those arising from performance and customs bonds, warranties and indemnities.\n\n## Contractual obligations for future expenditure not provided for in the accounts\n\nThe following table shows contractual obligations for future expenditure not provided for in the accounts at the year end.\n\n|                                                      |   2021 \u00a3m |   2020 \u00a3m |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment |        16 |        15 |\n| Contracts to purchase goods or services (1)          |       682 |       729 |\n|                                                      |       698 |       744 |\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n368\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## 27 Memorandum items continued\n\n## T Trruusstteeee  aanndd  ootthheerr  ffiidduucciiaarryy  aaccttiivviittiieess\n\nIn its capacity as trustee or other fiduciary role, NatWest Group may hold or place assets on behalf of individuals, trusts, companies, pension schemes and others. The assets and their income are not included in NatWest Group's financial statements. NatWest Group earned fee income of \u00a3280 million (2020 - \u00a3245 million; 2019 - \u00a3250 million) from these activities.\n\n## T Thhee  FFiinnaanncciiaall  SSeerrvviicceess  CCoommppeennssaattiioonn  SScchheemmee\n\nThe Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), the UK's statutory fund of last resort for customers of authorised financial services firms, pays compensation if a firm is unable to meet its obligations. The FSCS funds compensation for customers by raising management expenses levies and compensation levies on the industry. In relation to protected deposits, each deposit-taking institution contributes towards these levies in proportion to their share of total protected deposits on 31 December of the year preceding the scheme year (which runs from 1 April to 31 March), subject to annual maxima set by the Prudential Regulation Authority. In addition, the FSCS has the power to raise levies on a firm that has ceased to participate in the scheme and is in the process of ceasing to be authorised for the costs that it would have been liable to pay had the FSCS made a levy in the financial year it ceased to be a participant in the scheme.\n\n## L Liittiiggaattiioonn  aanndd  rreegguullaattoorryy  mmaatttteerrss\n\nNatWest Group plc and certain members of NatWest Group are party to legal proceedings and involved in regulatory matters, including as the subject of investigations and other regulatory and governmental action (Matters) in the United Kingdom (UK), the United States (US), the European Union (EU) and other jurisdictions.\n\nNatWest Group recognises a provision for a liability in relation to these Matters when it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle an obligation resulting from past events, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nIn many of these Matters, it is not possible to determine whether any loss is probable, or to estimate reliably the amount of any loss, either as a direct consequence of the relevant proceedings and regulatory matters or as a result of adverse impacts or restrictions on NatWest Group's reputation, businesses and operations. Numerous legal and factual issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and document production exercises and determination of important factual matters, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings in question, before a liability can reasonably be estimated for any claim. NatWest Group cannot predict if, how, or when such claims will be resolved or what the eventual settlement, damages, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, may be, particularly for claims that are at an early stage in their development or where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages.\n\nThere are situations where NatWest Group may pursue an approach that in some instances leads to a settlement agreement. This may occur in order to avoid the expense, management distraction or reputational implications of continuing to contest liability, or in order to take account of the risks inherent in defending claims or regulatory matters, even for those Matters for which NatWest Group believes it has credible defences and should prevail on the merits. The uncertainties inherent in all such Matters affect the amount and timing of any potential outflows for both Matters with respect to which provisions have been established and other contingent liabilities.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n369\n\nIt is not practicable to provide an aggregate estimate of potential liability for our legal proceedings and regulatory matters as a class of contingent liabilities.\n\nThe future outflow of resources in respect of any Matter may ultimately prove to be substantially greater than or less than the aggregate provision that NatWest Group has recognised. Where (and as far as) liability cannot be reasonably estimated, no provision has been recognised. NatWest Group expects that in future periods, additional provisions, settlement amounts and customer redress payments will be necessary, in amounts that are expected to be substantial in some instances. Please refer to Note 21 for information on material provisions.\n\nMaterial Matters in which NatWest Group is currently involved are set out below. We have provided information on the procedural history of certain Matters, where we believe appropriate, to aid the understanding of the Matter.\n\nFor a discussion of certain risks associated with NatWest Group's litigation and regulatory matters, see the Risk factor relating to legal, regulatory and governmental actions and investigations set out on page 425.\n\n## L Liittiiggaattiioonn\n\n## Residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) litigation in the US\n\nNatWest Group companies continue to defend RMBS-related claims in the US in which the plaintiff, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), alleges that certain disclosures made in connection with the relevant offerings of RMBS contained materially false or misleading statements and/or omissions regarding the underwriting standards pursuant to which the mortgage loans underlying the RMBS were issued. In Q4 2021, NWMSI settled RMBS claims by the State of New Mexico for an amount that was covered by an existing provision. In addition, NWMSI previously agreed to settle a purported RMBS class action entitled New Jersey Carpenters Health Fund v. Novastar Mortgage Inc. et al. for US$55.3 million. This was paid into escrow pending court approval of the settlement, which was granted in March 2019, but which remains the subject of an appeal by a class member who does not want to participate in the settlement.\n\n## London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other rates litigation\n\nNWM Plc and certain other members of NatWest Group, including NatWest Group plc, are defendants in a number of class actions and individual claims pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) with respect to the setting of LIBOR and certain other benchmark interest rates. The complaints allege that certain members of NatWest Group and other panel banks violated various federal laws, including the US commodities and antitrust laws, and state statutory and common law, as well as contracts, by manipulating LIBOR and prices of LIBOR-based derivatives in various markets through various means.\n\nSeveral class actions relating to USD LIBOR, as well as more than two dozen non-class actions concerning USD LIBOR, are part of a co-ordinated proceeding in the SDNY. In December 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (US Court of Appeals), reversing a December 2016 decision of the SDNY, held that plaintiffs in these cases have adequately asserted the court's personal jurisdiction over NWM Plc and other non-US banks, including with respect to antitrust class action claims on behalf of over-the-counter plaintiffs and exchange-based purchaser plaintiffs.\n\nFinancial statements",

The appellate court remanded these matters to the SDNY for further proceedings in light of its rulings. A separate appeal concerning the SDNY's dismissal of a fraud class action on behalf of lender plaintiffs remains pending in the US Court of Appeals. In March 2020, NatWest Group companies finalised a settlement resolving the class action on behalf of bondholder plaintiffs (those who held bonds issued by non-defendants on which interest was paid from 2007 to 2010 at a rate expressly tied to USD LIBOR). The amount of the settlement (which was covered by an existing provision) has been paid into escrow pending court approval of the settlement.\n\nThe non-class claims filed in the SDNY include claims that the FDIC is asserting on behalf of certain failed US banks. In July 2017, the FDIC, on behalf of 39 of those failed US banks, commenced substantially similar claims against NatWest Group companies and others in the High Court of Justice of England and Wales. The action alleges collusion with regard to the setting of USD LIBOR and that the defendants breached UK and European competition law, as well as asserting common law claims of fraud under US law. The defendant banks consented to a request by the FDIC for discontinuance of the claim in respect of 20 failed US banks, leaving 19 failed US banks as claimants. The UK proceedings are at the disclosure stage.\n\nIn addition, there are two class actions relating to JPY LIBOR and Euroyen TIBOR. The first class action, which relates to Euroyen TIBOR futures contracts, was dismissed by the SDNY in September 2020 on jurisdictional and other grounds, and the plaintiffs have commenced an appeal to the US Court of Appeals. The second class action, which relates to other derivatives allegedly tied to JPY LIBOR and Euroyen TIBOR, was dismissed by the SDNY in relation to NWM Plc and other NatWest Group companies in September 2021. That dismissal may be the subject of a future appeal .\n\nIn addition to the above, five other class action complaints were filed against NatWest Group companies in the SDNY, each relating to a different reference rate. In February 2017, the SDNY dismissed the case relating to Euribor for lack of personal jurisdiction and in August 2019, the SDNY dismissed the case relating to Pound Sterling for various reasons. Plaintiffs' appeals in both cases remain pending. In July 2019, the SDNY dismissed the case relating to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and Singapore Swap Offer Rate ('SIBOR / SOR') but in March 2021, the US Court of Appeals reversed the SDNY's decision, such that the case has returned to the SDNY, where it is the subject of a further motion to dismiss. In the class action relating to the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate, the SDNY in February 2020 declined to dismiss the amended complaint as against NWM Plc and certain other defendants, but dismissed it as to other members of NatWest Group (including NatWest Group plc). The claims against nondismissed defendants (including NWM Plc) are now proceeding in discovery. In June 2021, NWM Plc and the plaintiffs in the Swiss Franc LIBOR class action finalised a settlement resolving that case.  The amount of the settlement (which was covered by an existing provision) has been paid into escrow pending court approval of the settlement.\n\nNWM Plc is also named as a defendant in a motion to certify a class action relating to LIBOR in the Tel Aviv District Court in Israel. NWM Plc filed a motion for cancellation of service outside the jurisdiction, which was granted in July 2020.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n370\n\nThe claimants appealed that decision and in November 2020 the appeal was refused and the claim dismissed by the Appellate Court. The claim could in future be recommenced depending on the outcome of an appeal to Israel's Supreme Court in respect of dismissal of the substantive case against banks that had a presence in Israel.\n\nIn January 2019, a class action antitrust complaint was filed in the SDNY alleging that the defendants (USD ICE LIBOR panel banks and affiliates) have conspired to suppress USD ICE LIBOR from 2014 to the present by submitting incorrect information to ICE about their borrowing costs. The NatWest Group defendants are NatWest Group plc, NWM Plc, NWMSI and NWB Plc. The defendants made a motion to dismiss this case, which was granted by the court in March 2020. One plaintiff sought to appeal the dismissal, but on 14 February 2022, the US Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal because that plaintiff lacks standing to maintain the appeal.\n\nIn August 2020, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by several United States consumer borrowers against the USD ICE LIBOR panel banks and their affiliates, alleging that the normal process of setting USD ICE LIBOR amounts to illegal pricefixing, and also that banks in the United States have illegally agreed to use LIBOR as a component of price in variable consumer loans. The NatWest Group defendants are NatWest Group plc, NWM Plc, NWMSI and NWB Plc. The plaintiffs seek damages and to prevent the enforcement of LIBOR-based instruments through injunction. Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss, which remains pending.\n\n## FX litigation\n\nNWM Plc, NWMSI and/or NatWest Group plc are defendants in several cases relating to NWM Plc's foreign exchange (FX) business. In 2015, NWM Plc paid US$255 million to settle the consolidated antitrust class action filed in the SDNY on behalf of persons who entered into over-the-counter FX transactions with defendants or who traded FX instruments on exchanges. In 2018, some members of the settlement class who opted out of that class action settlement filed their own non-class complaint in the SDNY asserting antitrust claims against NWM Plc, NWMSI and other banks. Those opt-out claims are proceeding in discovery.\n\nIn April 2019, some of the same claimants in the opt-out case described above, as well as others, served proceedings (which are ongoing) in the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, asserting competition claims against NWM Plc and several other banks. The claim was transferred from the High Court of Justice of England and Wales in December 2021 and registered in the Competition Appeal Tribunal in January 2022.\n\nAn FX-related class action, on behalf of 'consumers and enduser businesses', is proceeding in the SDNY against NWM Plc and others. Plaintiffs have filed a motion for class certification, which defendants are opposing.\n\nIn May 2019, a cartel class action was filed in the Federal Court of Australia against NWM Plc and four other banks on behalf of persons who bought or sold currency through FX spots or forwards between 1 January 2008 and 15 October 2013 with a total transaction value exceeding AUD $0.5 million. The claimant has alleged that the banks, including NWM Plc, contravened Australian competition law by sharing information, coordinating conduct, widening spreads and manipulating FX rates for certain currency pairs during this period. NatWest Group plc and NWMSI have been named in the action as 'other cartel participants', but are not respondents. The claim was served in June 2019 and, after a number of interlocutory\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## 27 Memorandum items continued\n\n## L Liittiiggaattiioonn  aanndd  rreegguullaattoorryy  mmaatttteerrss\n\npleading disputes, NWM Plc is preparing its defence.\n\nIn July and December 2019, two separate applications seeking opt-out collective proceedings orders were filed in the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal against NatWest Group plc, NWM Plc and other banks. Both applications have been brought on behalf of persons who, between 18 December 2007 and 31 January 2013, entered into a relevant FX spot or outright forward transaction in the EEA with a relevant financial institution or on an electronic communications network. A hearing to determine class certification and which of the applications should be permitted to represent the class took place in July 2021 and judgment is awaited.\n\nIn November 2020, proceedings were issued in the High Court of Justice of England and Wales against NWM Plc by a claimant who sought an account of profits and/or damages in respect of alleged historical FX trading misconduct. The claim was served on NWM Plc in March 2021 and discontinued in December 2021.\n\nTwo motions to certify FX-related class actions were filed in the Tel Aviv District Court in Israel in September and October 2018, and were subsequently consolidated into one motion. The consolidated motion to certify, which names The Royal Bank of Scotland plc (now NWM Plc) and several other banks as defendants, was served on NWM Plc in May 2020. NWM Plc has filed a motion challenging the permission to serve the consolidated motion outside the Israeli jurisdiction, which remains pending.\n\nIn December 2021, a claim was issued in the Netherlands against NatWest Group plc, NWM Plc and NWM N.V. by Stichting FX Claims, seeking a declaration from the court that anti-competitive FX market conduct described in decisions of the European Commission of 16 May 2019 is unlawful, along with unspecified damages. The claimant has indicated that it may seek to amend its claim to also refer to the December 2021 decision by the EC (described below under 'Foreign exchange related investigations'). A hearing is scheduled for June 2022.\n\nCertain other foreign exchange transaction related claims have been or may be threatened. NatWest Group cannot predict whether all or any of these claims will be pursued.\n\n## Government securities antitrust litigation\n\nNWMSI and certain other US broker-dealers are defendants in a consolidated antitrust class action pending in the SDNY on behalf of persons who transacted in US Treasury securities or derivatives based on such instruments, including futures and options. The plaintiffs allege that defendants rigged the US Treasury securities auction bidding process to deflate prices at which they bought such securities and colluded to increase the prices at which they sold such securities to plaintiffs. The complaint was dismissed in March 2021. Plaintiffs have filed an amended complaint, which defendants are again seeking to have dismissed .\n\nClass action antitrust claims commenced in March 2019 are pending in the SDNY against NWM Plc, NWMSI and other banks in respect of Euro-denominated bonds issued by European central banks (EGBs). The complaint alleges a conspiracy among dealers of EGBs to widen the bid-ask spreads they quoted to customers, thereby increasing the prices customers paid for the EGBs or decreasing the prices at which customers sold the bonds. The class consists of those who purchased or sold EGBs in the US between 2007 and 2012. The defendants\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n371\n\nfiled a motion to dismiss this matter, which was granted by the court in respect of NWM Plc and NWMSI in July 2020. Plaintiffs have filed an amended complaint which defendants are seeking to have dismissed.\n\n## Swaps antitrust litigation\n\nNWM Plc and other members of NatWest Group, including NatWest Group plc, as well as a number of other interest rate swap dealers, are defendants in several cases pending in the SDNY alleging violations of the US antitrust laws in the market for interest rate swaps. There is a consolidated class action complaint on behalf of persons who entered into interest rate swaps with the defendants, as well as non-class action claims by three swap execution facilities (TeraExchange, Javelin, and trueEx). The plaintiffs allege that the swap execution facilities would have successfully established exchange-like trading of interest rate swaps if the defendants had not unlawfully conspired to prevent that from happening through boycotts and other means. Discovery in these cases is complete, and the plaintiffs' motion for class certification remains pending.\n\nIn June 2021, a class action antitrust complaint was filed against a number of credit default swap dealers in New Mexico federal court on behalf of persons who, from 2005 onwards, settled credit default swaps in the United States by reference to the ISDA credit default swap auction protocol. The complaint alleges that the defendants conspired to manipulate that benchmark through various means in violation of the antitrust laws and the Commodity Exchange Act. The defendants include several NatWest Group companies, including NatWest Group plc. Defendants are seeking dismissal.\n\n## Odd lot corporate bond trading antitrust litigation\n\nIn October 2021, the SDNY granted defendants' motion to dismiss the class action antitrust complaint alleging that from August 2006 onwards various securities dealers, including NWMSI, conspired artificially to widen spreads for odd lots of corporate bonds bought or sold in the United States secondary market and to boycott electronic trading platforms that would have allegedly promoted pricing competition in the market for such bonds. Plaintiffs have commenced an appeal of the dismissal.\n\n## Spoofing litigation\n\nIn December 2021, three substantially similar class actions complaints were filed in federal court in the United States against NWM Plc and NWMSI alleging Commodity Exchange Act and common law unjust enrichment claims arising from manipulative trading known as spoofing. The complaints refer to NWM Plc's December 2021 spoofing-related guilty plea (described below under 'US investigations relating to fixedincome securities') and purport to assert claims on behalf of those who transacted in US Treasury securities and futures and options on US Treasury securities between 2008 and 2018. The three complaints are pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.\n\n## Madoff\n\nNWM N.V. is a defendant in two actions filed by the trustee for the bankruptcy estates of Bernard L. Madoff and Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, in bankruptcy court in New York, which together seek to clawback more than US$298 million that NWM N.V. allegedly received from certain Madoff feeder funds and certain swap counterparties. The claims were previously dismissed, but as a result of an August 2021 decision by the US Court of Appeals, they will now proceed in the bankruptcy court subject to NWM N.V.'s legal and factual defences.\n\nFinancial statements",

The Liquidated Companies previously traded in European Union Allowances (EUAs) in 2009 and were alleged to be VAT defaulting traders within (or otherwise connected to) EUA supply chains of which NWM Plc was a party. In March 2020, the court held that NWM Plc and Mercuria Energy Europe Trading Limited ('Mercuria') were liable for dishonestly assisting and knowingly being a party to fraudulent trading during a seven business day period in 2009.\n\nIn October 2020, the High Court quantified total damages against NWM Plc and Mercuria at \u00a345 million plus interest and costs, and permitted the defendants to appeal to the Court of Appeal. In May 2021 the Court of Appeal set aside the High Court's judgment and ordered that a retrial take place before a different High Court judge. The claimants have sought permission from the Supreme Court to appeal. The Court of Appeal also dismissed an appeal by Mercuria against the finding by the High Court that NWM Plc and Mercuria were both vicariously liable. Mercuria has sought permission from the Supreme Court to appeal that decision.\n\n## Offshoring VAT assessments\n\nHMRC issued protective tax assessments in 2018 against NatWest Group plc totalling \u00a3143 million relating to unpaid VAT in respect of the UK branches of two NatWest Group companies registered in India. NatWest Group formally requested reconsideration by HMRC of their assessments, and this process was completed in November 2020. HMRC upheld their original decision and, as a result, NatWest Group plc lodged an appeal with the Tax Tribunal and an application for judicial review with the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, both in December 2020. In order to lodge the appeal with the Tax Tribunal, NatWest Group plc was required to pay the \u00a3143 million to HMRC, and payment was made in December 2020. The appeal and the application for judicial review have both been stayed pending resolution of a separate case involving another bank.\n\n## US Anti-Terrorism Act litigation\n\nNWB Plc is a defendant in lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York by a number of US nationals (or their estates, survivors, or heirs) who were victims of terrorist attacks in Israel. The plaintiffs allege that NWB Plc is liable for damages arising from those attacks pursuant to the US Anti-Terrorism Act because NWB Plc previously maintained bank accounts and transferred funds for the Palestine Relief & Development Fund, an organisation which plaintiffs allege solicited funds for Hamas, the alleged perpetrator of the attacks.\n\nIn March 2019, the trial court granted summary judgment in favour of NWB Plc. In April 2021, the US Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment in favour of NWB Plc. In September 2021, the plaintiffs filed a petition seeking discretionary review by the United States Supreme Court, and that petition remains pending.\n\nNWM N.V. and certain other financial institutions are defendants in several actions filed by a number of US nationals (or their estates, survivors, or heirs), most of whom are or were US military personnel, who were killed or injured in attacks in Iraq between 2003 and 2011. NWM Plc is also a defendant in some of these cases.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n372\n\nAccording to the plaintiffs' allegations, the defendants are liable for damages arising from the attacks because they allegedly conspired with Iran and certain Iranian banks to assist Iran in transferring money to Hezbollah and the Iraqi terror cells that committed the attacks, in violation of the US Anti-Terrorism Act, by agreeing to engage in 'stripping' of transactions initiated by the Iranian banks so that the Iranian nexus to the transactions would not be detected.\n\nThe first of these actions was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in November 2014. In September 2019, the district court dismissed the case, finding that the claims were deficient for several reasons, including lack of sufficient allegations as to the alleged conspiracy and causation. The plaintiffs are appealing the decision to the US Court of Appeals. Another action, filed in the SDNY in 2017, was dismissed in March 2019 on similar grounds, but remains subject to appeal to the US Court of Appeals. Other follow-on actions that are substantially similar to the two that have now been dismissed are pending in the same courts.\n\n## Securities underwriting litigation\n\nNWMSI is an underwriter defendant in securities class actions in the US in which plaintiffs generally allege that an issuer of public securities, as well as the underwriters of the securities (including NWMSI), are liable to purchasers for misrepresentations and omissions made in connection with the offering of such securities.\n\n## 1MDB litigation\n\nA claim for a material sum has been issued, but not served, recently in Malaysia by 1MDB against Coutts & Co Ltd for alleged losses in connection with the 1MDB fund. Coutts & Co Ltd is a company registered in Switzerland and is in wind-down following the announced sale of its business assets in 2015.\n\n## R Reegguullaattoorryy  mmaatttteerrss  ((iinncclluuddiinngg  iinnvveessttiiggaattiioonnss  aanndd  ccuussttoommeerr r reeddrreessss  pprrooggrraammmmeess))\n\nNatWest Group's businesses and financial condition can be affected by the actions of various governmental and regulatory authorities in the UK, the US, the EU and elsewhere. NatWest Group has engaged, and will continue to engage, in discussions with relevant governmental and regulatory authorities, including in the UK, the US, the EU and elsewhere, on an ongoing and regular basis, and in response to informal and formal inquiries or investigations, regarding operational, systems and control evaluations and issues including those related to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including consumer protection, investment advice, business conduct, competition/anti-trust, VAT recovery, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and sanctions regimes.\n\nNWM Group in particular has been providing information regarding a variety of matters, including, for example, offering of securities, the setting of benchmark rates and related derivatives trading, conduct in the foreign exchange market, product mis-selling and various issues relating to the issuance, underwriting, and sales and trading of fixed-income securities, including structured products and government securities, some of which have resulted, and others of which may result, in investigations or proceedings.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## 27 Memorandum items continued\n\n## L Liittiiggaattiioonn  aanndd  rreegguullaattoorryy  mmaatttteerrss\n\nAny matters discussed or identified during such discussions and inquiries may result in, among other things, further inquiry or investigation, other action being taken by governmental and regulatory authorities, increased costs being incurred by NatWest Group, remediation of systems and controls, public or private censure, restriction of NatWest Group's business activities and/or fines. Any of the events or circumstances mentioned in this paragraph or below could have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group, its business, authorisations and licences, reputation, results of operations or the price of securities issued by it, or lead to material additional provisions being taken.\n\nNatWest Group is co-operating fully with the matters described below.\n\n## I Innvveessttiiggaattiioonnss\n\n## US investigations relating to fixed-income securities\n\nIn December 2021, NWM Plc pled guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut to one count of wire fraud and one count of securities fraud in connection with historical spoofing conduct by former employees in US Treasuries markets between January 2008 and May 2014 and, separately, during approximately three months in 2018.\n\nThe 2018 trading occurred during the term of a nonprosecution agreement (NPA) between NWMSI and the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut (USAO CT), under which non-prosecution was conditioned on NWMSI and affiliated companies not engaging in criminal conduct during the term of the NPA. The relevant trading in 2018 was conducted by two NWM traders in Singapore and breached that NPA.\n\nThe plea agreement reached with the US Department of Justice and the USAO CT resolves both the spoofing conduct and the breach of the NPA.\n\nAs required by the resolution and sentence imposed by the court, NWM Plc is subject to a three-year period of probation and has paid a US$25.2 million criminal fine, approximately US$2.8 million in criminal forfeiture and approximately US$6.8 million in restitution out of existing provisions. The plea agreement also imposes an independent corporate monitor. In addition, NWM Plc has committed to compliance programme reviews and improvements and agreed to reporting and cooperation obligations.\n\nOther material adverse collateral consequences may occur as a result of this matter, as further described in the Risk factor relating to legal, regulatory and governmental actions and investigations set out on page 425.\n\n## Foreign exchange related investigations\n\nIn recent years, NWM Plc paid significant penalties to resolve investigations into its FX business by the FCA, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US Department of Justice, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the European Commission (EC) and others. In December 2021, the EC announced that a settlement had been reached with NatWest Group plc, NWM Plc and other banks in relation to its investigation into past breaches of competition law regarding spot foreign exchange trading. NatWest Group plc and NWM Plc were fined EUR 32.5 million in total relating to conduct that took place between 2011 and 2012. The fine was covered by existing provisions. This concludes the EC's investigations into NatWest Group's past spot foreign exchange trading activity.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n373\n\n## FCA investigation into NatWest Group's compliance with the Money Laundering Regulations 2007\n\nFollowing an FCA investigation, commenced in 2017, into potential breaches of the UK Money Laundering Regulations 2007 ('MLR 2007'), NWB Plc pled guilty in October 2021 to three offences under regulation 45(1) of the MLR 2007 for failure to comply with regulation 8(1) between 7 November 2013 and 23 June 2016, and regulations 8(3) and 14(1) between 8 November 2012 and 23 June 2016. These regulations required the firm to determine, conduct and demonstrate risk sensitive due diligence and ongoing monitoring of its relationships with its customers for the purposes of preventing money laundering. The offences relate to operational weaknesses between 2012 and 2016, during which period NWB Plc did not adequately monitor the accounts of a UK incorporated customer. In December 2021, NWB Plc was fined \u00a3264.8 million, incurred a confiscation order and was ordered to pay costs. This was met by NWB Plc from existing provisions, with a small additional provision taken in Q4 2021.\n\nOther material adverse collateral consequences may occur as a result of this matter, as further described in the Risk factor relating to legal, regulatory and governmental actions and investigations set out on page 425.\n\n## Systematic Anti-Money Laundering Programme assessment\n\nIn December 2018, the FCA commenced a Systematic AntiMoney Laundering Programme assessment of NatWest Group. In August 2019, the FCA instructed NatWest Group to appoint a Skilled Person under section 166 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to provide assurance on financial crime governance arrangements in relation to two financial crime change programmes. The Skilled Person's final report was received in January 2022.\n\n## C Cuussttoommeerr  rreeddrreessss  pprrooggrraammmmeess\n\n## FCA review of NatWest Group's treatment of SMEs\n\nIn 2014, the FCA appointed an independent Skilled Person under section 166 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to review NatWest Group's treatment of SME customers whose relationship was managed by NatWest Group's Global Restructuring Group (GRG) in the period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2013. In response to the Skilled Person's final report and update in 2016, NatWest Group announced redress steps for SME customers in the UK and the Republic of Ireland that were in GRG between 2008 and 2013. These steps were (i) an automatic refund of certain complex fees; and (ii) a new complaints process, overseen by an independent third party. Both processes have now been completed. Accordingly, NatWest Group retains only a small residual provision at December 2021.\n\n## Investment advice review\n\nIn October 2019, the FCA notified NatWest Group of its intention to appoint a Skilled Person under section 166 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to conduct a review of whether NatWest Group's past business review of investment advice provided during 2010 to 2015 was subject to appropriate governance and accountability and led to appropriate customer outcomes. The Skilled Person's review has concluded and, after discussion with the FCA, NatWest Group is now conducting additional review / remediation work.\n\nFinancial statements",

The redress and compensation phase has concluded, although an appeals process is currently anticipated to run until the end of 2022. NatWest Group has made provisions totalling \u20ac358 million (\u00a3300 million), of which \u20ac335 million (\u00a3281 million) had been utilised by 31 December 2021.\n\nUBIDAC customers have lodged tracker mortgage complaints with the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). UBIDAC is challenging three FSPO adjudications in the Irish High Court. The outcome and impact of that challenge on those and related complaints is uncertain but may be material.\n\nUBIDAC has identified further legacy business issues and these remediation programmes are ongoing. NatWest Group has made provisions of \u20ac188 million (\u00a3158 million), of which \u20ac156 million (\u00a3131 million) had been utilised by 31 December 2021 for these programmes.\n\n## 28 Analysis of the net investment in business interests and intangible assets\n\nThis note shows cash flows relating to obtaining or losing control of associates or subsidiaries and net assets and liabilities purchased and sold.

Recognised financial assets and financial liabilities of fair value hedges are adjusted for changes in fair value in respect of the risk that is hedged.\n\nThe accounting policies that are applicable to the parent company are included in NatWest Group plc's accounting policies which are set out on pages 307 to 312 of the consolidated financial statements, except that it has no policy regarding consolidation.\n\n## 2. Critical accounting policies and sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe reported results of the parent company are sensitive to the accounting policies, assumptions and estimates that underlie the preparation of its financial statements. The judgments and assumptions involved in the parent company's accounting policies that are considered by the Board to be the most important to the portrayal of its financial condition are those involved in assessing the impairment, if any, in its investments in group undertakings, refer to Note 9.\n\n## F Fuuttuurree  aaccccoouunnttiinngg  ddeevveellooppmmeennttss\n\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards\n\nA number of IFRSs and amendments to IFRS were in issue at 31 December 2021. The parent company is assessing the effect of adopting these standards and amendments on its financial statements but does not expect the effect to be material.\n\n## 3 Derivatives with subsidiaries - designated hedges\n\nFair value hedging is used to hedge loans and other financial liabilities, and cash flow hedging is used to hedge other financial liabilities and subordinated liabilities.\n\nFor accounting policy information see accounting policies notes 10 and 15.\n\nDerivatives held for hedging purposes are as follows:\n\n|                                              | 2021         | 2021   | 2021           | 2020     | 2020   | 2020        |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------|--------|----------------|----------|--------|-------------|\n|                                              | Notional \u00a3bn | Assets | Liabilities \u00a3m | Notional | Assets | Liabilities |\n|                                              |              | \u00a3m     |                | \u00a3bn      | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m          |\n| Fair value hedging - interest rate contracts | 22.2         | 825    | 167            | 25.0     | 1,537  | 359         |\n| Cash flow hedging - exchange rate contracts  | 4.9          | 8      | -              | 5.8      | 7      | 3           |\n| Total                                        |              | 833    | 167            |          | 1,544  | 362         |\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n381\n\nFinancial statements",

        "page_content": "## 9 Investments in Group undertakings\n\n## Critical accounting policy: Investments in Group undertakings\n\nAt each reporting date, the company assesses whether there is any indication that its investment in its Group undertakings is impaired. If any such indication exists, the company undertakes an impairment test by comparing the carrying value of the investment in its Group undertakings with its estimated recoverable amount. The key judgment is in determining the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an investment in its Group undertakings is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value in use, being an assessment of the discounted future cash flows of the entity. Impairment testing inherently involves a number of judgments: the five-year cash flow forecast, the choice of appropriate discount and growth rates, and the estimation of fair value.\n\nFor accounting policy information see Accouting policies note 16.\n\nInvestments in Group undertakings are carried at cost less impairment losses. Movements during the year were as follows:\n\n|                                                | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                                   | 46,229    | 55,808    |\n| Additional investments in Group undertakings   | 940       | 27        |\n| Disposals of investments in Group undertakings | (934)     | -         |\n| Impairment of investments (1)                  | 2,600     | (9,606)   |\n| At 31 December                                 | 48,835    | 46,229    |\n\nThe recoverable amount of investments in Group undertakings is the higher of net asset value as a proxy for fair value less cost to sell or value in use. Where recoverable value is based on net asset value, the fair value measurement is categorised as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value of Investments in Group undertakings at 31 December 2021 is supported by the respective recoverable values of the entities.\n\nIn August 2021 the company issued \u00a3941 million of contingent convertible AT1 notes to NWH Ltd and redeemed \u00a3934 million of contingent convertible AT1 notes issued to NWH Ltd. In 2020 the company invested additional capital of \u00a327 million in its subsidiaries, NWM Plc and RBS AA Holdings.\n\nIn 2021, Impairment of investments includes a \u00a35,250 million reversal of an earlier impairment of the company's investment in NatWest Holdings Limited as improved five-year cash flow forecasts increased the value in use and a \u00a32,650 million impairment of the company's investment in NatWest Markets Plc due to a decline in its net asset value mainly driven by dividends paid during the year and losses incurred by the business. The impairment in 2020 was mainly related to NatWest Holdings Limited.\n\nThe impact of reasonably possible changes to the more significant variables in the value in use calculations for Natwest Holdings Limited are presented below. This reflects the sensitivity of the value in use to each variable on its own. It is possible that more than one change may occur at the same time.

This document contains a number of adjusted or alternative performance measures, also known as non-GAAP or non-IFRS performance measures. These measures are adjusted for notable and other defined items which management believe are not representative of the underlying performance of the business and which distort period-on-period comparison. The non-IFRS measures provide users of the financial statements with a consistent basis for comparing business performance between financial periods and information on elements of performance that are one-off in nature. The non-IFRS measures also include the calculation of metrics that are used throughout the banking industry. These non-IFRS measures are not measures within the scope of IFRS and are not a substitute for IFRS measures.\n\n## N Noonn--IIFFRRSS  ffiinnaanncciiaall  mmeeaassuurreess\n\n## 1.

These amounts are included in staff, premises and equipment and other administrative expenses in the statutory analysis.\n\nOther expenses excludes strategic costs and litigation and conduct costs, which are more volatile and may distort comparisons with prior periods.\n\nRefer to page 300 for further details.\n\n## Non-statutory analysis\n\n|                               | Year ended 31 December 2021   | Year ended 31 December 2021   | Year ended 31 December 2021   | Year ended 31 December 2021   |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                               | Strategic                     | Litigation and conduct        | Other                         | Statutory operating expenses  |\n| Operating expenses            | costs                         | costs                         | expenses                      |                               |\n| Continuing operations         |                               |                               |                               |                               |\n| Staff expenses                | 411                           | -                             | 3,265                         | 3,676                         |\n| Premises and equipment        | 103                           | -                             | 1,030                         | 1,133                         |\n| Other administrative expenses | 133                           | 466                           | 1,427                         | 2,026                         |\n| Depreciation and amortisation | 140                           | -                             | 783                           | 923                           |\n| Total                         | 787                           | 466                           | 6,505                         | 7,758                         |\n\n|                               | 31 December 2020 (1)   | 31 December 2020 (1)         | 31 December 2020 (1)   | 31 December 2020 (1)         |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Operating expenses            | Strategic costs        | Litigation and conduct costs | Other expenses         | Statutory operating expenses |\n| Continuing operations         |                        |                              |                        |                              |\n| Staff expenses                | 462                    | -                            | 3,416                  | 3,878                        |\n| Premises and equipment        | 233                    | -                            | 989                    | 1,222                        |\n| Other administrative expenses | 197                    | 113                          | 1,535                  | 1,845                        |\n| Depreciation and amortisation | 121                    | -                            | 792                    | 913                          |\n| Total                         | 1,013                  | 113                          | 6,732                  | 7,858                        |\n\n|                               | 31 December 2019 (1)   | 31 December 2019 (1)         | 31 December 2019 (1)   | 31 December 2019 (1)         |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Operating expenses            | Strategic costs        | Litigation and conduct costs | Other expenses         | Statutory operating expenses |\n| Continuing operations         |                        |                              |                        |                              |\n| Staff expenses                | 451                    | -                            | 3,525                  | 3,976                        |\n| Premises and equipment        | 239                    | -                            | 1,019                  | 1,258                        |\n| Other administrative expenses | 295                    | 895                          | 1,638                  | 2,828                        |\n| Depreciation and amortisation | 396                    | -                            | 822                    | 1,218                        |\n| Total                         | 1,381                  | 895                          | 7,004                  | 9,280                        |\n\n- (1) Comparative results have been re-presented from those previously published to reclassify certain operations as discontinued operations as described in Note 8.\n\n## 4.

NatWest Group return on tangible equity\n\nReturn on tangible equity comprises annualised profit or loss for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by average tangible equity. Average tangible equity is average total equity excluding non-controlling interests (NCI) less average intangible assets and average other owners' equity.\n\nGo-forward group return on tangible equity is calculated as annualised profit or loss for the period less Ulster Bank RoI loss from continuing operations and less profit from discontinued operations divided by go-forward group total tangible equity.\n\nThis measure shows the return NatWest Group generates on tangible equity deployed. It is used to determine relative performance of banks and used widely across the sector.\n\nRefer to pages 83 and 87 for further details.\n\n|                                                                           | Year ended or as at   | Year ended or as at   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| NatWest Group return on tangible equity                                   | 31 December 2021      | 31 December 2020      |\n| Profit/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders (\u00a3m)                  | 2,950                 | (753)                 |\n| Average total equity (\u00a3m)                                                 | 42,727                | 43,774                |\n| Adjustment for other owners equity and intangibles (\u00a3m)                   | (11,395)              | (11,872)              |\n| Adjusted total tangible equity (\u00a3m)                                       | 31,332                | 31,902                |\n| Return on tangible equity (%)                                             | 9.4%                  | (2.4%)                |\n| Go-forward group return on tangible equity                                |                       |                       |\n| Profit/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders (\u00a3m)                  | 2,950                 | (753)                 |\n| Less Ulster Bank RoI loss from continuing operations (\u00a3m)                 | 255                   | 495                   |\n| Less profit from discontinued operations (\u00a3m)                             | (276)                 | (121)                 |\n| Go-forward group profit/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders (\u00a3m) | 2,929                 | (379)                 |\n| Average total equity (\u00a3m)                                                 | 42,727                | 43,774                |\n| Adjustment for other owners equity and intangibles (\u00a3m)                   | (11,395)              | (11,872)              |\n| Adjusted total tangible equity (\u00a3m)                                       | 31,332                | 31,902                |\n| Go-forward group RWAe applying factor (%)                                 | 93%                   | 93%                   |\n| Go-forward group total tangible equity (\u00a3m)                               | 29,139                | 29,669                |\n| Return on tangible equity (%)                                             | 10.0%                 | (1.3%)                |\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n398\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## 7.

Net interest margin\n\nBank net interest margin is defined as net interest income of the banking business of the Go-forward group less NatWest Markets (NWM) element and excluding liquid asset buffer, as a percentage of bank average interest-earning assets. Bank average interest earning assets are the average interest earning assets of the banking business of the Go-forward group less NWM element and excluding liquid asset buffer.\n\nThe exclusion of the NWM element aims to eliminate the impact of distorting volatility in NWM. The exclusion of the Ulster Bank RoI from the aims to align the basis of calculation with prior periods.\n\nLiquid asset buffer consists of assets held by NatWest Group, such as cash and balances at central banks and debt securities in issue, that can be used to ensure repayment of financial obligations as they fall due.\n\nThe exclusion of liquid asset buffer has been introduced as a way to present net interest margin on a basis more comparable with UK peers and exclude the impact of regulatory driven factors.\n\nRefer to pages 83 and 88 to 91 for further details.\n\n|                                          | Year ended          | Year ended          | Year ended          |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                          | 31 December 2021 \u00a3m | 31 December 2020 \u00a3m | 31 December 2019 \u00a3m |\n| Continuing operations                    |                     |                     |                     |\n| NatWest Group net interest income (1)    | 7,614               | 7,476               | 7,799               |\n| Less NWM net interest income             | (9)                 | 57                  | 188                 |\n| Less Ulster Bank RoI net interest income | (100)               | (122)               | (152)               |\n| Bank net interest income                 | 7,505               | 7,411               | 7,835               |\n| Average interest earning assets (IEA)    | 524,886             | 483,719             | 439,994             |\n| Less NWM average IEA                     | (32,730)            | (37,929)            | (35,444)            |\n| Less Ulster Bank RoI average IEA         | (15,854)            | (16,600)            | (16,538)            |\n| Less liquid asset buffer average IEA (1) | (162,195)           | (127,945)           | (106,925)           |\n| Bank average IEA                         | 314,107             | 301,245             | 281,087             |\n| Bank net interest margin                 | 2.39%               | 2.46%               | 2.79%               |\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n400\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## 10.

The data is consolidated for all the subsidiaries and branches allocated to each country.\n\n## Income and profit/(loss) before tax\n\nIncome and profit/(loss) totals are reported in Note 4 within the Geographical segments table.\n\n## Tax paid/(received)\n\nTax paid/(received) disclosed under CRD IV relates to corporation tax.\n\nCorporation tax paid represents net cash taxes paid to/(received) from the tax authorities in each jurisdiction.\n\nCorporation tax paid is reported on a cash basis as opposed to an accounting basis and therefore does not necessarily have a direct correlation to the reported profits or losses arising in the year. For example, in certain jurisdictions taxable profits may be reduced as a result of the offset of tax losses brought forward from prior years; or tax payments may be calculated with reference to prior year profits.\n\n## Full time equivalent employees (FTEs)\n\nFTEs are allocated to the country in which they are primarily based for the performance of their employment duties. The figures disclosed represent the average number of FTEs, including temporary staff, in each country during the period. The FTEs, including temporary staff, at 31 December 2021, have been added for completeness.\n\n## Public subsidies received\n\nNo public subsidies were received during the period .\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n403\n\nFinancial statements",

        "page_content": "## Risk factors\n\n## Principal Risks and Uncertainties\n\nSet out below are certain risk factors that could adversely affect NatWest Group's future results, its financial condition and prospects and cause them to be materially different from what is forecast or expected, and directly or indirectly impact the value of its securities in issue. These risk factors are broadly categorised and should be read in conjunction with other sections of this annual report, including the forwardlooking statements section, the strategic report and the risk and capital management section. They should not be regarded as a complete and comprehensive statement of all potential risks and uncertainties facing NatWest Group. The COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate any of the risks described below.\n\n## E Eccoonnoommiicc  aanndd  ppoolliittiiccaall  rriisskk\n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related uncertainties continue to affect the UK, global economies and financial markets and NatWest Group's customers, as well as its competitive environment, which may continue to have an adverse effect on NatWest Group.\n\nIn many countries, including the UK (NatWest Group's most significant market), the COVID-19 pandemic has, at times, resulted in the imposition of strict social distancing measures, restrictions on non-essential activities and travel quarantines, in an attempt to slow the spread and reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has also, at times, caused significant reductions in levels of consumer and commercial activity, reductions in consumer spending, increased levels of corporate debt and, for some customers, personal debt, increased unemployment and significant market volatility in asset prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. It has also, at times, caused physical disruption to global supply chains and working practices, all of which have affected NatWest Group's customers. NatWest Group has significant exposures to many of the commercial sectors economically impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including property, retail, leisure and travel.\n\nDespite widespread COVID-19 vaccination within the geographical regions in which NatWest Group operates, the proliferation of COVID-19 variants continues to affect the UK and global economies. Further waves of infection or the spread of new strains may result in renewed restrictions in affected countries and regions. As a result, significant uncertainties remain as to how long the impact of the COVID-19\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n406\n\npandemic will last, and how it will continue to affect the global economy.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, central banks, governments, regulators and legislatures in the UK and elsewhere have offered unprecedented levels of support and various schemes to assist impacted businesses and individuals. This has included forms of financial assistance and legal and regulatory initiatives. Many of these support schemes have now been curtailed. However, uncertainty remains as to the impact of the ending or tapering of these schemes and the repayment of the loans involved on customers, the economic environment and NatWest Group. Moreover, it is unclear as to how any further measures, such as rising interest rates and inflation, may affect NatWest Group's business and performance.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has prompted many changes that may prove to be permanent shifts in customer behaviour and economic activity, such as changes in spending patterns and significantly more people working from home. These changes may have long lasting impacts on asset prices, the economic environment and its customers financial needs.\n\nUncertainties relating to the COVID-19 pandemic has made reliance on analytical models and planning and forecasting for NatWest Group more complex, and may result in uncertainty impacting the risk profile of NatWest Group and/or that of the wider banking industry. The medium and long-term implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for NatWest Group customers, the UK housing market, and the UK and global economies and financial markets remain uncertain.\n\nAny of the above may have a negative impact on NatWest Group.\n\nNatWest Group faces continued economic and political risks and uncertainty in the UK and global markets.\n\nThe outlook for the global economy over the medium-term remains uncertain due to a number of factors including: the COVID-19 pandemic, societal inequalities and changes, trade barriers and the increased possibility of and/or continuation of trade wars, widespread political instability (including as a result of populism and nationalism, which may lead to protectionist policies, state and privately sponsored cyber and terrorist acts or threats, efforts to destabilise regimes or armed conflict), changes in inflation and interest rates (including negative interest rates), supply chain disruption, climate, environmental, social and other sustainability-related risks and\n\nglobal regional variations in the impact and responses to these factors.\n\nThese conditions could be worsened by a number of factors including macroeconomic deterioration, increased instability in the global financial system and concerns relating to further financial shocks or contagion (for example, due to economic concerns in emerging markets), market volatility or fluctuations in the value of the pound sterling, new or extended economic sanctions, volatility in commodity prices or concerns regarding sovereign debt. This may be compounded by the changing demographics of the populations in the markets that NatWest Group serves, increasing social and other inequalities, or rapid change to the economic environment due to the adoption of technology and artificial intelligence. Any of the above developments could adversely impact NatWest Group directly (for example, as a result of credit losses) or indirectly (for example, by impacting global economic growth and financial markets and NatWest Group's customers and their banking needs).\n\nIn addition, NatWest Group is exposed to risks arising out of geopolitical events or political developments, such as exchange controls and other measures taken by sovereign governments that may hinder economic or financial activity levels. Furthermore, unfavourable political, military or diplomatic events, including secession movements or the exit of other member states from the EU, armed conflict, pandemics and widespread public health crises (including the current COVID-19 pandemic and any future epidemics or pandemics), state and privately sponsored cyber and terrorist acts or threats, and the responses to them by governments and markets, could negatively affect the business and performance of NatWest Group, including as a result of the indirect effect on regional or global trade and/or NatWest Group's customers.\n\nNatWest Group faces political uncertainty in Scotland, as a result of a possible second Scottish independence referendum. Independence may adversely impact NatWest Group since NatWest Group plc and other NatWest Group entities (including NWM Plc) are incorporated in Scotland. Any changes to Scotland's relationship with the UK or the EU would impact the environment in which NatWest Group and its subsidiaries operate, and may require further changes to NatWest Group's structure, independently or in conjunction with other mandatory or strategic structural and organisational changes which, any of which could adversely impact NatWest Group.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Risk factors continued\n\nThe value of NatWest Group's financial instruments may be materially affected by market risk, including as a result of market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain of NatWest Group's financial instruments, particularly during periods of market displacement. This could cause a decline in the value of NatWest Group's financial instruments, which may have an adverse effect on NatWest Group's results of operations in future periods, or inaccurate carrying values for certain financial instruments.\n\nIn addition, financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values, which may be accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. Under these conditions, hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at mitigating trading losses as they would be under more normal market conditions. Moreover, under these conditions, market participants are particularly exposed to trading strategies employed by many market participants simultaneously and on a large scale, increasing NatWest Group's counterparty risk. NatWest Group's risk management and monitoring processes seek to quantify and mitigate NatWest Group's exposure to more extreme market moves. However, severe market events have historically been difficult to predict and NatWest Group could realise significant losses if extreme market events were to occur.\n\nAny of the above may have a negative effect on NatWest Group.\n\nContinuing uncertainty regarding the effects and extent of the UK's post Brexit divergence from EU laws and regulation, and NatWest Group's post Brexit EU operating model may continue to adversely affect NatWest Group and its operating environment.\n\nThe UK ceased to be a member of the EU and the European Economic Area ('EEA') on 31 January 2020 ('Brexit') and the 2020 EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement ('TCA') ended the transition period on 31 December 2020. The TCA provides for free trade between the UK and EU with zero tariffs and quotas on all goods that comply with the appropriate rules of origin, with minimal coverage. However, for financial services, UK-incorporated financial services providers no longer have EU passporting rights and there is no mutual recognition regime. Financial services may largely be subject to individual equivalence decisions by relevant regulators. A number of temporary equivalence decisions have been made that cover certain services offered by\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n407\n\nNatWest Group. The EU's equivalence regime does not cover most lending and deposit taking, and determinations in respect of third countries have not, to date, covered the provision of most investment services. In addition, equivalence determinations do not guarantee permanent access rights and can be withdrawn with short notice. The TCA is accompanied by a Joint Declaration on financial services which sets out an intention for the EU and UK to cooperate on matters of financial regulation and to agree a Memorandum of Understanding, which has yet to be signed. In late 2021 the European Commission proposed legislation that would require non-EU firms to establish a branch or subsidiary in the EU before providing 'banking services' in the EU. If these proposals become law all 'banking services' will be licensable activities in each EU member state and member states will not be permitted to offer bilateral permissions to financial institutions outside the EU allowing them to provide 'banking services' in the EU. Uncertainty remains as to whether 'banking services' will also include investment products.\n\nNatWest Group continues to evaluate its post Brexit EU operating model, making adaptations as necessary. NatWest Group also continues to assess where NatWest Group companies can obtain bilateral regulatory permissions to facilitate intragroup transactions and/or to permit business to continue from its UK entities, transferring what cannot be continued to be rendered from the UK to an EEA subsidiary or branch where permitted. Where these regulatory permissions are temporary or are withdrawn, a different approach may need to be taken or may result in a change in operating model or some business being ceased. Not all NatWest Group entities have applied for bilateral regulatory permissions and instead intend to move EEA business to an EEA licensed subsidiary or branch. There is a risk that these EEA licenses may not be granted, or may be withdrawn, and where these permissions are not obtained, further changes to NatWest Group's operating model may be required or some business may need to be ceased. In addition, failure to obtain required regulatory permissions or licences in one part of NatWest Group may impact other parts of NatWest Group adversely. Certain permissions are required in order to maintain the ability to clear euro payments. Other permissions, including the ability to have two intermediate EU parent undertakings, would allow NatWest Group to continue to serve EEA customers from both the ring-fenced and non-ring-fenced banking entities.\n\nFurthermore, transferring business to an EEA based subsidiary is a complex exercise and involves legal, regulatory and execution risks, and could result in a loss of business and/or customers or greater than expected costs. The changes to NatWest Group's operating model have been costly and further changes to its business operations, product offering and customer engagement could result in further costs.\n\nThe long-term effects of Brexit and the uncertainty regarding NatWest Group's EU operating model may have a negative impact on NatWest Group's business. These may be exacerbated by wider global macro-economic trends and events, particularly COVID-19 pandemic related uncertainties, which may significantly impact NatWest Group and its customers and counterparties who are themselves dependent on trading with the EU or personnel from the EU. They may exacerbate the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the UK, the Republic of Ireland ('ROI') and the rest of the EU/EEA.\n\nSignificant uncertainties remain as to the extent to which EU/EEA laws will diverge from UK law (including bank regulation), whether and what equivalence determinations will be made by the various regulators, whether the proposed EEA licensed subsidiary is granted a banking licence, whether banking services will be harmonised across the EEA and, therefore, what the respective legal and regulatory arrangements will be, under which NatWest Group and its subsidiaries will operate. This divergence could lead to further market fragmentation. These risks and uncertainties may require costly changes to NatWest Group's EU operating model. The legal and political uncertainty, and any actions taken as a result of this uncertainty, as well as the approach taken by regulators and new or amended rules, could have a significant adverse impact on NatWest Group's businesses, non-UK operations and/or legal entity structure, including attendant operating, compliance and restructuring costs, level of impairments, capital requirements, changes to intragroup arrangements, increased complexity, regulatory environment and tax implications and as a result may adversely impact NatWest Group's profitability, competitive position, business model and product offering.\n\nChanges in interest rates have significantly affected and will continue to affect NatWest Group's business and results.\n\nInterest rate risk is significant for NatWest Group. Monetary policy has been accommodative in recent years including initiatives implemented by the\n\nFinancial statements",

        "page_content": "Bank of England and HM Treasury, such as the Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs ('TFSME'), which have helped to support demand at a time of pronounced fiscal tightening and balance sheet repair. However, market expectations are currently that benchmark interest rates such as UK base rate, could begin to rise further and faster than had been anticipated previously and that this could be accompanied by other measures to reverse accommodative policy, such as quantitative tightening.\n\nWhile increases in interest rates may support NatWest Group's interest income, sharp rises could have macroeconomic effects that lead to adverse outcomes for the business. For example, they could lead to generally weaker than expected growth, or even contracting GDP, reduced business confidence, higher default rates on customer loans, higher levels of unemployment or underemployment, and falling property prices in the markets in which NatWest Group operates, all of which could adversely affect the business and performance of NatWest Group. Conversely, decreases in interest rates and/or continued sustained low or negative interest rates would be expected to continue to put further pressure on NatWest Group's interest income and profitability.\n\nUnexpected moves in interest rates will also affect valuations of assets and liabilities that are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet. Changes in these valuations may be adverse. Unexpected movements in spreads between key benchmark rates could have adverse impacts and also adversely affect NatWest Group's financial position.\n\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates may affect NatWest Group's results and financial position.\n\nDecisions of major central banks (including the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve) and political or market events, which are outside NatWest Group's control, may lead to sharp and sudden variations in foreign exchange rates.\n\nAlthough NatWest Group is principally a UK focused banking group, it is subject to foreign exchange risk from capital deployed in NatWest Group's foreign subsidiaries, branches and joint arrangements and customer transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of NatWest Group. NatWest Group also relies on issuing securities in foreign currencies that assist in meeting NatWest Group's minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities ('MREL') and NWM\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n408\n\nPlc deals foreign exchange instruments. NatWest Group maintains policies and procedures designed to manage the impact of exposures to fluctuations in currency rates. Nevertheless, changes in currency rates, particularly in the sterling-US dollar and euro-sterling rates, can adversely affect the value of assets, liabilities (including the total amount MREL-eligible instruments), foreign exchange dealing activity, income and expenses, RWAs and hence the reported earnings and financial condition of NatWest Group.\n\nHM Treasury (or UKGI on its behalf) could exercise a significant degree of influence over NatWest Group and further offers or sales of NatWest Group's shares held by HM Treasury may affect the price of NatWest Group securities.\n\nIn its March 2021 Budget, the UK Government announced its intention to continue the process of privatisation of NatWest Group plc and to carry out a programme of sales of NatWest Group plc ordinary shares with the objective of selling all of its remaining shares in NatWest Group plc by 2025-2026. As a result of a directed buyback of NatWest Group plc shares by NatWest Group plc from UK Government Investments Limited ('UKGI') in March 2021, sales of NatWest Group plc shares by UKGI by accelerated bookbuild in May 2021 and purchases made under NatWest Group plc's on-market buyback programme announced in July 2021, as at 11 February 2022, the UK Government held 50.94% of the issued share capital with voting rights of NatWest Group plc. In addition to the \u00a3750 million on-market buyback announced on 18 February 2022, NatWest Group may participate in further directed or on-market buybacks in the future. The timing, extent and continuation of UKGI's sell-downs is uncertain, which could result in a prolonged period of increased price volatility on NatWest Group plc's ordinary shares.\n\nAny offers or sales of a substantial number of ordinary shares by UKGI, market expectations about these sales and any associated directed, on or off market buyback activity by NatWest Group, could affect the prevailing market price for the outstanding ordinary shares of NatWest Group plc.\n\nHM Treasury has indicated that it intends to respect the commercial decisions of NatWest Group and that NatWest Group will continue to have its own independent board of directors and management team determining its own strategy. However, for as long as HM Treasury remains the NatWest Group plc's largest single shareholder, HM Treasury and UKGI (as manager of HM\n\nTreasury's shareholding) could exercise a significant degree of influence over the election of directors and appointment of senior management, NatWest Group's capital strategy, dividend policy, remuneration policy or the conduct of NatWest Group's operations, amongst others. HM Treasury or UKGI's approach depends on government policy, which could change. The manner in which HM Treasury or UKGI exercises HM Treasury's rights as the largest single shareholder could give rise to conflicts between the interests of HM Treasury and the interests of other shareholders, including as a result of a change in government policy.\n\n## S Sttrraatteeggiicc  rriisskk\n\nNatWest Group continues to implement its purpose-led strategy, which carries significant execution and operational risks and may not achieve its stated aims and targeted outcomes.\n\nIn February 2020, NatWest Group announced a new strategy, focused on becoming a purpose-led business, designed to champion potential and to help individuals, families and businesses to thrive. This strategy is intended to reflect the rapidly shifting environment and backdrop of unprecedented disruption in society driven by technology and changing customer expectations, as accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose-led strategy has required an internal cultural shift across NatWest Group as to how performance is perceived and how NatWest Group conducts its business. These changes are substantial and will take many years to fully embed. These changes may not result in the expected outcome within the timeline and in the manner currently contemplated.\n\nAs part of its purpose-led strategy, NatWest Group has set a number of financial, capital and operational targets and expectations, both for the short term and throughout the implementation period. Meeting these targets and expectations requires further significant reductions to NatWest Group's cost base. Realising these cost reductions may result in material strategic costs, which may be more than currently expected. The continued focus on meeting cost reduction targets may also mean limited investment in other areas, which could affect NatWest Group's long-term prospects, product offering or competitive position, its ability to meet its other targets and commitments (including those related to customer satisfaction) and its capacity to respond to climate-related risks.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nNatWest Group's ability to meet its planned reductions in its annual underlying costs may vary considerably from year to year. Any of the factors above could jeopardise NatWest Group's ability to achieve its associated financial targets and generate sustainable returns.\n\nThe financial services industry is currently experiencing a trend towards consolidation and technological advancement and disruption. In pursuing its purpose-led strategy, NatWest Group may decide to undertake divestments, restructurings or reorganisations of certain of its customer segments. Conversely, it may decide to grow its business through acquisitions, joint ventures, investments and/or strategic partnerships as well as other transactions and initiatives, in certain customer segments and including to: (i) enhance capabilities that may lead to better productivity or cost efficiencies; (ii) acquire talent; (iii) pursue new products or expand existing products; or (iv) enter new markets or enhance its presence in existing markets. There are risks that NatWest Group may not fully realise the expected benefits and value from these transactions and initiatives. In particular, NatWest Group may: (i) fail to realise the business rationale for the transaction or initiative, or assumptions underlying the business plans supporting the valuation of a target business may prove inaccurate, for example, synergies and expected commercial demand; (ii) fail to successfully integrate any acquired businesses (including in respect of technologies, existing strategies, products and human capital); (iii) fail to retain key employees, customers and suppliers of any acquired business; (iv) be required or wish to terminate preexisting contractual relationships, which could prove costly and/or be executed at unfavourable terms and conditions; (v) fail to discover certain contingent or undisclosed liabilities in businesses that it acquires, or its due diligence to discover any such liabilities may be inadequate; and (vi) not obtain necessary regulatory and other approvals or onerous conditions may be attached to such approvals. Accordingly, NatWest Group may not be successful in growing its business through these types of transactions and initiatives and any particular transaction may not succeed, may be limited in scope or scale (including due to NatWest Group's current ownership structure) and may not conclude on the terms contemplated, or at all. Any of the above may materially and adversely affect NatWest Group's results of operations, financial condition or prospects.\n\nNatWest Group's phased withdrawal from ROI continues to present significant\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n409\n\ncommercial, operational, legal and execution risks. In particular, the phased withdrawal from ROI involves transfers of business, assets and liabilities to third parties, and entails many risks, the most significant of which include: (i) anticipated reductions in net income, total lending and RWAs; (ii) potential trapped or stranded capital; (iii) the diversion of management resources and attention away from day-to-day management; (iv) the recognition of disposal losses as part of the orderly rundown of certain loan portfolios which may be higher than anticipated; (v) execution risks arising from the significant uncertainties of a phased withdrawal, including the additional IT and operational expense and resource required to mitigate manual and limited customer switching and handling processes of Ulster Bank Ireland DAC, potential counterparties and other banks; (vi) customer action or inaction, or the inability to obtain necessary approvals and/or support from governmental authorities, regulators, trade unions and/or other stakeholders resulting in additional cost, resource and delays; (vii) potential loss of customers, resulting in retail and commercial deposit outflows (or a failure to attract deposit inflows) and reduced revenues and liquidity; (viii) increased people risk through the potential loss of key colleagues and institutional knowledge and increased challenges of attracting and retaining colleagues; (ix) regulatory risk, including in relation to prudential, conduct and other regulatory requirements; (x) no or limited access to Euro system funding arrangements; and (xi) brand and reputational risks due to press speculation and stakeholder scrutiny about the phased withdrawal from ROI. Any of these risks and uncertainties may cost more, be more complex or harder to mitigate than currently estimated and may adversely affect NatWest Group's ability to execute a phased withdrawal from ROI, or may affect the financial performance of NatWest Group.\n\nOn 27 January 2022, NatWest Group announced that, in order to further support its customers' growth ambitions and deliver on the next phase of its strategy, it is evolving its Commercial, NatWest Markets and RBS International businesses to form a single franchise to best support its customers across the full non-personal customer lifecycle. The transition is expected to begin over the coming months and be effective from July 2022.\n\nIn pursuing its strategy, NatWest Group may not be able to successfully: (i) implement all aspects of its strategy; (ii) reach any or all of the related targets or expectations of its strategy; or (iii) realise\n\nthe intended strategic objectives of any other future strategic or growth initiative. The scale and scope of its strategy and the intended changes continue to present material business, operational (including compliance with the UK ringfencing regime), legal, execution, IT system, internal culture, conduct and people risks to NatWest Group. Implementing many changes and strategic actions concurrently, including in respect of any growth initiatives, will require application of robust governance and controls frameworks and robust IT systems; there is a risk that NatWest Group may not be successful in these respects. The implementation of the purpose-led strategy and any other strategic initiatives could result in materially higher costs than initially contemplated (including due to material uncertainties and factors outside of NatWest Group's control) and may not be completed as planned, or at all, or could be phased or could progress in a manner other than currently expected. This could lead to additional management actions by NatWest Group.\n\nChanges in the economic, political and regulatory environment in which NatWest Group operates, or regulatory uncertainty and changes, strong market competition and industry disruption or economic volatility may require NatWest Group to adjust aspects of its strategy or the timeframe for its implementation including in relation to its financial, capital and operational targets and expectations. As certain initiatives depend on achieving growth in new ventures and opportunities for NatWest Group, its strategy is vulnerable to an economic downturn. NatWest Group's strategy also requires ongoing confidence from customers and the wider market, without which customer activity and related income levels may fall or NatWest Group's reputation may be adversely affected.\n\nEach of these risks, and others identified in these Risk Factors, individually or collectively could jeopardise the implementation and delivery of the purpose-led strategy and other strategic initiatives, result in higher than expected costs, impact NatWest Group's products and services offering, its reputation with customers or business model and adversely impact NatWest Group's ability to deliver its strategy and meet its targets and guidance, each of which could have a negative impact on NatWest Group.\n\nAdd\n\nit\n\nion\n\nal i\n\nnform\n\na\n\ntio\n\nn\n\nFinancial statements",

NWM Group has also directed resources to emphasising and growing product capability in the areas of importance to NatWest Group's corporate and institutional customers, including the Fixed Income and Capital Markets businesses, and has refocused its Rates business to best serve its core customers.\n\nIn addition, to improve efficiencies and best serve customers following Brexit, NatWest Group expects that certain assets, liabilities, transactions and activities of its Western European corporate portfolio (principally including term funding and revolving credit facilities), will be transferred from the ring-fenced subgroup of NatWest Group to NWM Group on a rolling basis, subject to certain regulatory and customer requirements. The timing and quantum of these transfers remain uncertain as is the impact of these transactions on its go-forward results of operations. As a result, NatWest Group's business, results of operations, financial position and prospects could be adversely affected.\n\nNatWest Group's ability to serve its customers may be diminished by the changed business strategy, as a result of the NWM Refocusing. In addition, customer reactions to the changed nature of NWM Group's business model may be more adverse than expected and previously anticipated revenue and profitability levels may not be achieved in the timescale envisaged or at all. An adverse macroeconomic environment (including due to the COVID-19 pandemic, heightened inflation and rising interest rates), continued political and regulatory uncertainty, market volatility and/or strong market competition may also pose significant challenges to the achievement of the anticipated targets and goals of the NWM Refocusing.\n\nThe implementation of the NWM Refocusing has been a complex process and although substantial progress has\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n410\n\nbeen made, the risk remains that this strategy may not result in the contemplated business outcome and there continue to be material execution, commercial and operational risks in connection with the NWM Refocusing. There may continue to be material execution, commercial and operational risks for NWM Group and NWM Group may continue to be subject to significant structural and other change. There can be no certainty that the NWM Refocusing will be successful or that NWM Group will be a viable, competitive or profitable business. The intended benefits for NatWest Group may not be realised within the timeline and in the manner currently contemplated.\n\nTrends relating to the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect NatWest Group's strategy and impair its ability to meet its targets and strategic objectives.\n\nThe trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the UK and global economy and NatWest Group remains uncertain. If trends relating to the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impact the UK and global economy, NatWest Group's may be unable to meet its financial, capital and operational targets and expectations. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has, at times, caused significant market volatility, which could cause RWA inflation for NatWest Group. This could impair NatWest Group's ability to timely deliver on certain aspects of its purpose-led strategy, which may have an adverse effect on NatWest Group's business, results of operations and outlook. See also, ' NatWest Group continues to implement its purpose-led strategy, which carries significant execution and operational risks and may not achieve its stated aims and targeted outcomes '.\n\nIt is uncertain as to how the broader macroeconomic business environment and societal norms may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, causing significant wider societal changes. For example, one of the most notable effects of the COVID-19 pandemic has been its disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable groups of society and concerns about systemic racial biases and social inequalities.\n\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated existing economic trends that may radically change the way businesses are run and people live their lives. These trends include digitalisation, decarbonisation, automation, ecommerce and agile working, each of which has resulted in significant market volatility in asset prices. There is also increased investor, regulatory and customer scrutiny regarding how businesses address these changes and related climate, environmental, social,\n\ngovernance and other sustainability issues, including tackling inequality, working conditions, workplace health, safety and wellbeing, diversity and inclusion, data protection and management, workforce management, human rights and supply chain management. Any failure or delay by NatWest Group to successfully adapt its business strategy and to establish and maintain effective governance, procedures, systems and controls in response to these changes, and to manage emerging climate, environmental, social, governance and other sustainability-related risks and opportunities, may have a material adverse impact on NatWest Group's reputation, business, results of operations, outlook and the value of NatWest Group's securities. See also, ' Any failure by NatWest Group to implement effective and compliant climate change resilient systems, controls and procedures could adversely affect NatWest Group's ability to manage climate-related risks ' and ' A failure to adapt NatWest Group's business strategy, governance, procedures, systems and controls to manage emerging sustainability-related risks and opportunities may have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group, its reputation, business, results of operations and outlook '.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also result in unexpected developments or changes in financial markets, the fiscal, tax and regulatory frameworks and consumer customer and corporate client behaviour, which could intensify competition in the financial services industry. This could negatively impact NatWest Group if it is not able to adapt or compete effectively.\n\n## FFiinnaanncciiaall  rreessiilliieennccee  rriisskk\n\nNatWest Group may not meet the targets it communicates or be in a position to continue to make discretionary capital distributions (including dividends to shareholders).\n\nAs part of NatWest Group's strategy, NatWest Group has set a number of financial, capital and operational targets for NatWest Group including in respect of: CET1 ratio targets, MREL targets, return on tangible equity ('ROTE'), funding plans and requirements, employee engagement, diversity and inclusion as well as ESG (including climate and sustainable funding and financing targets) and customer satisfaction targets and discretionary capital distributions (including dividends to shareholders).\n\nSee also, ' NatWest Group continues to implement its purpose-led strategy, which carries significant execution and\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\noperational risks and may not achieve its stated aims and targeted outcomes '.\n\nNatWest Group's ability to meet its targets and to successfully meet its strategy is subject to various internal and external factors and risks. These include but are not limited to: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, market, regulatory, macroeconomic and political uncertainties, operational risks and risks relating to NatWest Group's business model and strategy (including risks associated with climate, environmental, social, governance and other sustainability-related issues) and litigation, governmental actions, investigations and regulatory matters.\n\nA number of factors, including the economic and other effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, may impact NatWest Group's ability to maintain its CET1 ratio target and make discretionary capital distributions. See also, ' NatWest Group may not meet the prudential regulatory requirements for capital and MREL, or manage its capital effectively, which could trigger the execution of certain management actions or recovery options '.\n\nThere is a risk that NatWest Group may not meet its targets and expectations or be in a position to continue to distribute capital, or that NatWest Group will be a viable, competitive or profitable banking business.\n\nNatWest Group operates in markets that are highly competitive, with increasing competitive pressures and technology disruption.\n\nThe markets within which NatWest Group operates are highly competitive. NatWest Group expects such competition to continue and intensify in response to various changes. These include: evolving customer behaviour, technological changes (including digital currencies, stablecoins and the growth of digital banking, such as from fintech entrants), competitor behaviour, new entrants to the market (including non-traditional financial services providers such as large retail or technology conglomerates, who may have competitive advantages in scale, technology and customer engagement), competitive foreignexchange offerings, industry trends resulting in increased disaggregation or unbundling of financial services or conversely the re-intermediation of traditional banking services, and the impact of regulatory actions and other factors. In particular, developments in the financial sector resulting from new banking, lending and payment solutions offered by rapidly evolving incumbents, challengers and new entrants, notably with respect to payment services and products, and the introduction of\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n411\n\ndisruptive technology may impede NatWest Group's ability to grow or retain its share and impact its revenues and profitability, particularly in its key UK retail and commercial banking segments. Moreover, innovations such as biometrics, artificial intelligence, the cloud, blockchain, cryptocurrencies and quantum computing may rapidly facilitate industry transformation.\n\nThese trends have accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic and may be catalysed by various regulatory and competition policy interventions, including the UK initiative on Open Banking (PSD2), Open Finance and other remedies imposed by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) which are designed to further promote competition within retail banking. The competition enhancing measures under NatWest Group's independently administered Alternative Remedies Package ('ARP') benefits grant recipients and eligible competitors. The ARP may be more costly than anticipated and may adversely impact customer service for NatWest Group's own customers, its competitive position and reputation. Failure to comply with the terms of the scheme could result in the imposition of additional measures or limitations on NatWest Group's operations, additional supervision by NatWest Group's regulators, and loss of investor confidence.\n\nIncreasingly many of the products and services offered by NatWest Group are, and will become, more technology intensive. For example, NatWest Group recently invested in a number of fintech ventures, including Mettle, FreeAgent, Tyl, Rapid Cash and Rooster Money. See also, ' NatWest Group continues to implement its purpose-led strategy, which carries significant execution and operational risks and may not achieve its stated aims and targeted outcomes '. NatWest Group's ability to develop such digital solutions (which also need to comply with applicable and evolving regulations) has become increasingly important to retaining and growing NatWest Group's customer business in the UK. There can be no certainty that NatWest Group's innovation strategy (which includes investment in its IT capability intended to address the material increase in customer use of online and mobile technology for banking as well as selective acquisitions, which carry associated risks) will be successful or that it will allow NatWest Group to continue to grow such services in the future. Certain of NatWest Group's current or future competitors may be more successful in implementing innovative technologies for delivering products or services to their customers.\n\nNatWest Group may also fail to identify future opportunities or derive benefits from disruptive technologies in the context of rapid technological innovation, changing customer behaviour and growing regulatory demands, resulting in increased competition from traditional banking businesses as well as new providers of financial services, including technology companies with strong brand recognition, that may be able to develop financial services at a lower cost base.\n\nNatWest Group's competitors may also be better able to attract and retain customers and key employees, may have better IT systems, and may have access to lower cost funding and/or be able to attract deposits on more favourable terms than NatWest Group. Although NatWest Group invests in new technologies and participates in industry and research led initiatives aimed at developing new technologies, such investments may be insufficient or ineffective, especially given NatWest Group's focus on its cost savings targets. This may limit additional investment in areas such as financial innovation and could therefore affect NatWest Group's offering of innovative products or technologies for delivering products or services to customers and its competitive position. Furthermore, the development of innovative products depends on NatWest Group's ability to produce underlying high-quality data, failing which its ability to offer innovative products may be compromised.\n\nIf NatWest Group is unable to offer competitive, attractive and innovative products that are also profitable and timely, it will lose share, incur losses on some or all of its activities and lose opportunities for growth. In this context, NatWest Group is investing in the automation of certain solutions and interactions within its customer-facing businesses, including through artificial intelligence. Such initiatives may result in operational, reputational and conduct risks if the technology used is defective, inadequate or is not fully integrated into NatWest Group's current solutions. There can be no certainty that such initiatives will deliver the expected cost savings and investment in automated processes will likely also result in increased shortterm costs for NatWest Group.\n\nIn addition, the implementation of its purpose-led strategy (including in relation to acquisitions, reorganisations and/or partnerships), delivery on its climate ambition, cost-reduction measures, as well as employee remuneration constraints, may also have an impact on its ability to compete effectively and intensified competition from incumbents, challengers and new entrants could affect NatWest Group's\n\nFinancial statements",

Moreover, activist investors have increasingly become engaged and interventionist in recent years, which may pose a threat to NatWest Group's strategic initiatives. Furthermore, continued consolidation or technological or other developments in certain sectors of the financial services industry could result in NatWest Group's remaining competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, including the ability to offer a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity, or the emergence of new competitors.\n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the credit quality of NatWest Group's counterparties may negatively impact NatWest Group.\n\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected the credit quality of some of NatWest Group's borrowers and other counterparties, and government support schemes may delay the effects of defaults by such counterparties. As government support schemes reduce, defaults are expected to rise with more customers moving from IFRS 9 Stage 2 to Stage 3. As a result, NatWest Group continues to experience elevated exposure to credit risk and demands on its funding, and the longterm effects remain uncertain. If borrowers or other counterparties face increasing levels of debt and default or suffer deterioration in credit, this would increase impairment charges, writedowns, regulatory expected loss and impact credit reserves. See also, ' NatWest Group has significant exposure to counterparty and borrower risk ' and 'NatWest Group's financial statements are sensitive to the underlying accounting policies, judgments, estimates and assumptions'.\n\nIn line with certain mandated COVID-19 pandemic support schemes, NatWest Group has sought to assist affected customers with a number of initiatives including NatWest Group's participation in BBLS, CBILS and CLBILS products. NatWest Group has sought to manage the risks of fraud and money laundering against the need for the fast and efficient release of funds to customers and businesses. NatWest Group may be exposed to fraud, conduct and litigation risks arising from inappropriate approval (or denial) of BBLS or CBILS or the enforcing or pursuing repayment of BBLS and CBILS (or a failure to exercise forbearance), which may have an adverse effect on NatWest Group's reputation and results of operations. The implementation of the initiatives and efforts mentioned above may result in litigation, regulatory and government actions and proceedings. These actions\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n412\n\nmay result in judgments, settlements, penalties or fines.\n\nAny of the above may have a negative impact on NatWest Group.\n\n## NatWest Group has significant exposure to counterparty and borrower risk.\n\nNatWest Group has exposure to many different industries, customers and counterparties, and risks arising from actual or perceived changes in credit quality and the recoverability of monies due from borrowers and other counterparties are inherent in a wide range of NatWest Group's businesses. NatWest Group's lending strategy and associated processes may fail to identify or anticipate weaknesses or risks in a particular sector, market or borrower, or fail to adequately value physical or financial collateral. This may result in increased default rates or a higher loss given default for loans, which may, in turn, impact NatWest Group's profitability. See also, ' Risk and capital management - Credit Risk '.\n\nThe credit quality of NatWest Group's borrowers and other counterparties may be affected by a deterioration in prevailing economic and market conditions (including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic) and by the legal and regulatory landscape in the UK and countries where NatWest Group is exposed to credit risk and any deterioration in such conditions or changes to legal or regulatory landscapes (including the extent of the UK's post-Brexit divergence from EU laws and regulation). These could worsen borrower and counterparty credit quality or impact the enforcement of contractual rights over security, increasing credit risk.\n\nAn increase in drawings upon committed credit facilities may also increase NatWest Group's RWAs. In addition, the level of household indebtedness in the UK remains high. The ability of households to service their debts could be worsened by a period of high unemployment (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), increasing interest rates and higher inflation, particularly if prolonged. NatWest Group may be affected by volatility in property prices (including as a result of the general UK political or economic climate or the COVID-19 pandemic) given that NatWest Group's mortgage loan and wholesale property loan portfolios as at 31 December 2021, amounted to \u00a3226.5 billion, representing 61% of NatWest Group's total customer loan exposure. If property prices were to weaken this could lead to higher impairment charges, particularly if default rates also increase. In addition, NatWest Group's credit risk may be exacerbated if the collateral that\n\nit holds cannot be realised as a result of market conditions or regulatory intervention or if it is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the net amount after accounting for any IFRS 9 provisions already made. This is most likely to occur during periods of illiquidity or depressed asset valuations.\n\nConcerns about, or a default by, a financial institution could lead to significant liquidity problems and losses or defaults by other financial institutions, since the commercial and financial soundness of many financial institutions is closely related and interdependent as a result of credit, trading, clearing and other relationships. Any perceived lack of creditworthiness of a counterparty may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses for NatWest Group. This systemic risk may also adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges with which NatWest Group interacts on a daily basis. See also, ' NatWest Group may not be able to adequately access sources of liquidity and funding '.\n\nAs a result, adverse changes in borrower and counterparty credit risk may cause accelerated impairment charges under IFRS 9, increased repurchase demands, higher costs, additional write-downs and losses for NatWest Group and an inability to engage in routine funding transactions.\n\nNatWest Group has applied an internal analysis of multiple economic scenarios (MES) together with the determination of specific overlay adjustments to inform its IFRS 9 ECL (Expected Credit Loss). The recognition and measurement of ECL is complex and involves the use of significant judgment and estimation. This includes the formulation and incorporation of multiple forward-looking economic scenarios into ECL to meet the measurement objective of IFRS 9. The ECL provision is sensitive to the model inputs and economic assumptions underlying the estimate. Going forward, NatWest Group anticipates observable credit deterioration of a proportion of assets resulting in a systematic uplift in defaults, which is mitigated by those economic assumption scenarios being reflected in the Stage 2 ECL across portfolios, along with a combination of post model overlays in both wholesale and retail portfolios reflecting the uncertainty of credit outcomes. See also, ' Risk and capital management '. A credit deterioration would also lead to RWA increases. Furthermore, the assumptions and judgments used in the MES and ECL assessment at 31 December 2021 may not prove to be adequate resulting in incremental ECL provisions for NatWest Group. As government support schemes\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nreduce, defaults are expected to rise with more ECLs cases moving from Stage 2 to Stage 3.\n\nNatWest Group is exposed to the financial industry, including sovereign debt securities, banks, financial intermediation providers (including providing facilities to financial sponsors and funds, backed by assets or investor commitments) and securitised products (typically senior lending to special purpose vehicles backed by pools of financial assets). Due to NatWest Group's exposure to the financial industry, it also has exposure to shadow banking entities (i.e., entities which carry out banking activities outside a regulated framework). NatWest Group is required to identify and monitor its exposure to shadow banking entities, implement and maintain an internal framework for the identification, management, control and mitigation of the risks associated with exposure to shadow banking entities, and ensure effective reporting and governance in respect of such exposure. If NatWest Group is unable to properly identify and monitor its shadow banking exposure, maintain an adequate framework, or ensure effective reporting and governance in respect of shadow banking exposure, this may adversely affect the business, results of operations and outlook of NatWest Group.\n\nIf NatWest Group experiences losses and a reduction in future profitability, this is likely to affect the recoverable value of fixed assets, including goodwill and deferred taxes, which may lead to further write-downs.\n\nNatWest Group may not meet the prudential regulatory requirements for capital and MREL, or manage its capital effectively, which could trigger the execution of certain management actions or recovery options . .\n\nNatWest Group is required by regulators in the UK, the EU and other jurisdictions in which it undertakes regulated activities to maintain adequate financial resources. Adequate capital provides NatWest Group with financial flexibility in the face of turbulence and uncertainty in the global economy and specifically in its core UK operations. It also permits NatWest Group plc to make discretionary capital distributions (including dividends to shareholders).\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, NatWest Group plc's CET1 ratio was 18.2% and NatWest Group plc currently targets a CET1 ratio of 13-14% by the end of 2023. NatWest Group plc's target capital ratio is based on a combination of its expected regulatory requirements and internal modelling, including stress scenarios and management's and/or the Prudential Regulatory Authority's ('PRA') views on\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n413\n\nappropriate buffers above minimum operating levels.\n\nNatWest Group plc's current capital strategy is based on the expected accumulation of additional capital through the accrual of profits over time, planned capital actions (including issuances, redemptions, and discretionary capital distributions), RWA growth in the form of regulatory uplifts and lending growth and other capital management initiatives which focus on improving capital efficiency and ensuring NatWest Group meets its medium to long term targets.\n\nA number of factors may impact NatWest Group plc's ability to maintain its current CET1 ratio target and achieve its capital strategy. These include, amongst other things:\n\n- \uf02d an increase in the quantum of RWAs in excess of that expected, including due to regulatory changes, or a failure in internal controls or procedures to accurately measure and report RWAs;\n- \uf02d a depletion of its capital resources through increased costs or liabilities or reduced profits;\n- \uf02d changes in prudential regulatory requirements including NatWest Group plc's Total Capital Requirement set by the PRA, including Pillar 2 requirements and regulatory buffers as well as any applicable scalars;\n- \uf02d reduced dividends from NatWest Group's subsidiaries because of changes in their financial performance and/or the extent to which local capital requirements exceed NatWest Group plc's target ratio; and limitations on the use of double leverage, i.e. NatWest Group plc's use of debt to invest in the equity of its subsidiaries, as a result of the Bank of England's and/or NatWest Group's evolving views on distribution of capital within groups.\n\nA shortage of capital could in turn affect NatWest Group plc's capital ratio, and/or its ability to make capital distributions.\n\nA minimum level of capital adequacy is required to be met by NatWest Group plc for it to be entitled to make certain discretionary payments, and institutions which fail to meet the combined buffer requirement are subject to restricted discretionary payments. The resulting restrictions are scaled according to the extent of the breach of the combined buffer requirement and calculated as a percentage of the profits of the institution since the last distribution of profits or discretionary payment which gives rise to a maximum distributable amount (MDA) (if any) that the financial institution can distribute through\n\ndiscretionary payments. Any breach of the combined buffer requirement, may necessitate for NatWest Group plc reducing or ceasing discretionary payments (including payments of dividends to shareholders) to the extent of the breach.\n\nNatWest Group is required to maintain a set quantum of MREL set as the higher of its RWAs or leverage requirement. The Bank of England has identified single point-of-entry as the preferred resolution strategy for NatWest Group. As a result, NatWest Group plc is the only entity that can externally issue securities that count towards its MREL requirements, the proceeds of which can then be downstreamed to meet the internal MREL issuance requirements of its operating entities and intermediate holding companies.\n\nIf NatWest Group plc is unable to raise the requisite amount of regulatory capital or MREL, downstream the proceeds of MREL to subsidiaries as required, or to otherwise meet its regulatory capital, MREL and leverage requirements, it may be exposed to increased regulatory supervision or sanctions, loss of investor confidence, constrained or more expensive funding and be unable to make dividend payments on its ordinary shares or maintain discretionary payments on capital instruments.\n\nIf, under a stress scenario, the level of capital or MREL falls outside of risk appetite, there are a range of recovery management actions (focused on risk reduction and mitigation) that NatWest Group could take to manage its capital levels, but any such actions may not be sufficient to restore adequate capital levels. Under the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directives I and II ('BRRD'), as implemented in the UK, NatWest Group must maintain a recovery plan acceptable to its regulator, such that a breach of NatWest Group's applicable capital or leverage requirements may trigger the application of NatWest Group's recovery plan to remediate a deficient capital position. NatWest Group's regulator may request that NatWest Group carry out certain capital management actions or, if NatWest Group plc's CET1 ratio falls below 7%, certain regulatory capital instruments issued by NatWest Group will be writtendown or converted into equity and there may be an issue of additional equity by NatWest Group plc, which could result in the dilution of the holdings of NatWest Group plc's existing shareholders. The success of such issuances will also be dependent on favourable market conditions and NatWest Group may not be able to raise the amount of capital required on acceptable terms or at all.\n\nFinancial statements",

These actions may, in turn, affect, among other things, NatWest Group's product offering, credit ratings, ability to operate its businesses, pursue its current strategies and pursue strategic opportunities, any of which may affect the underlying profitability of NatWest Group and future growth potential. See also, ' NatWest Group may become subject to the application of UK statutory stabilisation or resolution powers which may result in, among other actions, the cancellation, transfer or dilution of ordinary shares, or the write-down or conversion of certain other of NatWest Group's securities '.\n\nNatWest Group is subject to Bank of England and PRA oversight in respect of resolution, and NatWest Group could be adversely affected should the Bank of England deem NatWest Group's preparations to be inadequate.\n\nNatWest Group is subject to regulatory oversight by the Bank of England and the PRA, and is required (under the PRA rulebook) to carry out an assessment of its preparations for resolution, submit a report of the assessment to the PRA, and disclose a summary of this report. The initial report was submitted to the PRA on 30 September 2021 and the Bank of England's assessment of NatWest Group's preparations is scheduled to be released on 10 June 2022 although the Bank of England may provide feedback before then.\n\nNatWest Group has dedicated significant resources towards the preparation of NatWest Group for a potential resolution scenario. However, if the Bank of England assessment identifies a significant gap in NatWest Group's ability to achieve the resolvability outcomes, or reveals that NatWest Group is not adequately prepared to be resolved, or did not have adequate plans in place to meet resolvability requirements which came into effect on 1 January 2022, NatWest Group may be required to take action to enhance its preparations to be resolvable, resulting in additional costs and the dedication of additional resources. Such a scenario may have an impact on NatWest Group as, depending on the Bank of England's assessment, potential action may include, but is not limited to, restrictions on NatWest Group's maximum individual and aggregate exposures, a requirement to dispose of specified assets, a requirement to change legal or operational structure, a requirement to cease carrying out certain activities and/or maintaining a specified amount of MREL, consequently impacting NatWest\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n414\n\nGroup's strategic plans and having an adverse effect on the financial position and/or reputation of NatWest Group or a loss of investor confidence.\n\n## NatWest Group may not be able to adequately access sources of liquidity and funding.\n\nNatWest Group is required to access sources of liquidity and funding through retail and wholesale deposits, as well as through the debt capital markets. As at 31 December 2021, NatWest Group plc held \u00a3506.1 billion in deposits. The level of deposits may fluctuate due to factors outside NatWest Group's control, such as a loss of investor confidence (including in individual NatWest Group entities), sustained low or negative interest rates, government support, increasing competitive pressures for retail and corporate customer deposits or the reduction or cessation of deposits by wholesale depositors, which could result in a significant outflow of deposits within a short period of time. An inability to grow or any material decrease in NatWest Group's deposits could, particularly if accompanied by one of the other factors described above, materially affect NatWest Group's ability to satisfy its liquidity or funding needs. In turn, this could require NatWest Group to adapt its funding plans.\n\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, current economic uncertainties and any significant market volatility could affect NatWest Group's ability to access sources of liquidity and funding, which may result in higher funding costs and failure to comply with regulatory capital, funding and leverage requirements. As a result, NatWest Group and its subsidiaries could be required to adapt their funding plans. This could exacerbate funding and liquidity risk, which could have a negative effect on NatWest Group.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, NatWest Group plc's liquidity coverage ratio was 172%. If its liquidity position were to come under stress, and if NatWest Group plc were unable to raise funds through deposits or in the debt capital markets on acceptable terms or at all, its liquidity position could be adversely affected and it might be unable to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at their contractual maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature, to meet its obligations under committed financing facilities, to comply with regulatory funding requirements, to undertake certain capital and/or debt management activities, or to fund new loans, investments and businesses. NatWest Group may need to liquidate unencumbered assets to meet its liabilities, including disposals of assets not previously identified for disposal to\n\nreduce its funding commitments or trigger the execution of certain management actions or recovery options. In a time of reduced liquidity, NatWest Group may be unable to sell some of its assets, or may need to sell assets at depressed prices, which in either case could negatively affect NatWest Group's results.\n\nAny reduction in the credit rating and/or outlooks assigned to NatWest Group plc, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective debt securities could adversely affect the availability of funding for NatWest Group, reduce NatWest Group's liquidity position and increase the cost of funding.\n\nRating agencies regularly review NatWest Group plc and other NatWest Group entity credit ratings and outlooks, which could be negatively affected by a number of factors that can change over time, including: the credit rating agency's assessment of NatWest Group's strategy and management's capability; its financial condition including in respect of profitability, asset quality, capital, funding and liquidity; the level of political support for the industries in which NatWest Group operates; the implementation of structural reform; the legal and regulatory frameworks applicable to NatWest Group's legal structure; business activities and the rights of its creditors; changes in rating methodologies; changes in the relative size of the loss-absorbing buffers protecting bondholders and depositors; the competitive environment, political and economic conditions in NatWest Group's key markets (including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and any further Scottish independence referendum); any reduction of the UK's sovereign credit rating and market uncertainty.\n\nIn addition, credit ratings agencies are increasingly taking into account sustainability-related factors, including climate, environmental, social and governance related risk, as part of the credit ratings analysis, as are investors in their investment decisions.\n\nAny reductions in the credit ratings of NatWest Group plc or of certain other NatWest Group entities, including, in particular, downgrades below investment grade, or a deterioration in the capital markets' perception of NatWest Group's financial resilience could significantly affect NatWest Group's access to money markets, reduce the size of its deposit base and trigger additional collateral or other requirements in derivatives contracts and other secured funding arrangements or the need to amend such arrangements, which could adversely affect NatWest Group's (and, in particular, NatWest Group plc's) cost\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nof funding and its access to capital markets and could limit the range of counterparties willing to enter into transactions with NatWest Group (and, in particular, with NatWest Group plc). This could in turn adversely impact NatWest Group's competitive position and threaten its prospects in the short to medium-term.\n\n## NatWest Group may be adversely affected if it fails to meet the requirements of regulatory stress tests.\n\nNatWest Group is subject to annual stress tests by its regulator in the UK and is also subject to stress tests by European regulators with respect to NWM N.V. and Ulster Bank Ireland DAC. Stress tests are designed to assess the resilience of banks to potential adverse economic or financial developments and ensure that they have robust, forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for the risks associated with their business profile. If the stress tests reveal that a bank's existing regulatory capital buffers are not sufficient to absorb the impact of the stress, then it is possible that the bank will need to take action to strengthen its capital position.\n\nFailure by NatWest Group to meet the quantitative and qualitative requirements of the stress tests as set forth by its UK regulator or those elsewhere may result in: NatWest Group's regulators requiring NatWest Group to generate additional capital, reputational damage, increased supervision and/or regulatory sanctions, restrictions on capital distributions and loss of investor confidence.\n\nNatWest Group's results could be adversely affected if an event triggers the recognition of a goodwill impairment. NatWest Group capitalises goodwill, which is calculated as the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Acquired goodwill is recognised at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. As required by IFRS, NatWest Group tests goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.\n\nAn impairment test compares the recoverable amount (the higher of the value in use and fair value less cost to sell) of an individual cash generating unit with its carrying value. At 31 December 2021, NatWest Group plc carried goodwill of \u00a35.5 billion on its balance sheet. The value in use and fair value of NatWest Group's cash-generating units are affected by market conditions, the economies in which NatWest Group operates and may also be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n415\n\nThe goodwill held by NatWest Group plc relies on management's assumptions on future profitability. Goodwill is particularly sensitive to changes in assumed future profitability. If actual performance were to fall below management's forecasts, then there is a risk that an impairment of goodwill would become necessary.\n\nWhere NatWest Group is required to recognise a goodwill impairment, it is recorded in NatWest Group's income statement, but it has no effect on NatWest Group's regulatory capital position. Changes in such assumptions may result in the carrying balance being impaired, which could have a negative impact on NatWest Group.\n\nNatWest Group could incur losses or be required to maintain higher levels of capital as a result of limitations or failure of various models.\n\nGiven the complexity of NatWest Group's business, strategy and capital requirements, NatWest Group relies on analytical and other models for a wide range of purposes, including to manage its business, assess the value of its assets and its risk exposure, as well as to anticipate capital and funding requirements (including to facilitate NatWest Group's mandated stress testing). In addition, NatWest Group utilises models for valuations, credit approvals, calculation of loan impairment charges on an IFRS 9 basis, financial reporting and for financial crime (criminal activities in the form of money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery and corruption, tax evasion and sanctions as well as fraud risk management (collectively, 'financial crime')). NatWest Group's models, and the parameters and assumptions on which they are based, are periodically reviewed and updated to maximise their accuracy.\n\nAs models analyse scenarios based on assumed inputs and a conceptual approach, model outputs therefore remain uncertain. Failure of models (including due to errors in model design) or new data inputs (including nonrepresentative data sets), for example, to accurately reflect changes in the micro and macroeconomic environment in which NatWest Group operates (for example to account for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic), to capture risks and exposures at the subsidiary level and to update for changes to NatWest Group's current business model or operations, or for findings of deficiencies by NatWest Group's regulators (including as part of NatWest Group's mandated stress testing), may render some business lines uneconomic, result in increased capital requirements, may require management action or may\n\nsubject NatWest Group to regulatory sanction. NatWest Group may also face adverse consequences as a result of actions based on models that are poorly developed, implemented or used, models that are based on inaccurate or compromised data or as a result of the modelled outcome being misunderstood, or by such information being used for purposes for which it was not designed.\n\nNatWest Group's financial statements are sensitive to the underlying accounting policies, judgments, estimates and assumptions.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses, exposures and RWAs. While estimates, judgments and assumptions take into account historical experience and other factors, (including market practice and expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances), actual results may differ due to the inherent uncertainty in making estimates, judgments and assumptions (particularly those involving the use of complex models).\n\nThe accounting policies deemed critical to NatWest Group's results and financial position, based upon materiality and significant judgments and estimates, which include loan impairment provisions, are set out in 'Critical accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty '. New accounting standards and interpretations that have been issued by the International\n\nAccounting Standards Board but which have not yet been adopted by NatWest Group are discussed in ' Future accounting developments '.\n\n## Changes in accounting standards may materially impact NatWest Group's financial results.\n\nChanges in accounting standards or guidance by accounting bodies or in the timing of their implementation, whether immediate or foreseeable, could result in NatWest Group having to recognise additional liabilities on its balance sheet, or in further write-downs or impairments to its assets and could also significantly impact the financial results, condition and prospects of NatWest Group.\n\nThe valuation of financial instruments, including derivatives, measured at fair value can be subjective, in particular where models are used which include unobservable inputs. Generally, to establish the fair value of these instruments, NatWest Group relies on quoted market prices or, where the market for a financial instrument is not sufficiently credible, internal valuation\n\nFinancial statements",

In certain circumstances, the data for individual financial instruments or classes of financial instruments utilised by such valuation models may not be available or may become unavailable due to prevailing market conditions. In these circumstances, NatWest Group's internal valuation models require NatWest Group to make assumptions, judgments and estimates to establish fair value, which are complex and often relate to matters that are inherently uncertain.\n\nThe value or effectiveness of any credit protection that NatWest Group has purchased depends on the value of the underlying assets and the financial condition of the insurers and counterparties.\n\nNatWest Group has some remaining credit exposure arising from over-thecounter derivative contracts, mainly credit default swaps (CDSs), and other credit derivatives, each of which are carried at fair value. The fair value of these CDSs, as well as NatWest Group's exposure to the risk of default by the underlying counterparties, depends on the valuation and the perceived credit risk of the instrument against which protection has been bought. Many market counterparties have been adversely affected by their exposure to residential mortgage-linked and corporate credit products, whether synthetic or otherwise, and their actual and perceived creditworthiness may deteriorate rapidly. If the financial condition of these counterparties or their actual or perceived creditworthiness deteriorates, NatWest Group may record further credit valuation adjustments on the credit protection bought from these counterparties under the CDSs. NatWest Group also recognises any fluctuations in the fair value of other credit derivatives. Any such adjustments or fair value changes may have a negative impact on NatWest Group's results.\n\nNatWest Group may become subject to the application of UK statutory stabilisation or resolution powers which may result in, among other actions, the cancellation, transfer or dilution of ordinary shares, or the write-down or conversion of certain other of NatWest Group's securities.\n\nHM Treasury, the Bank of England and the PRA and FCA (together, the 'Authorities') are granted substantial powers to resolve and stabilise UKincorporated financial institutions. Five stabilisation options exist: (i) transfer of all of the business of a relevant entity or the shares of the relevant entity to a private sector purchaser; (ii) transfer of all or part of the business of the relevant entity to a 'bridge bank' wholly-owned\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n416\n\nby the Bank of England; (iii) transfer of part of the assets, rights or liabilities of the relevant entity to one or more asset management vehicles for management of the transferor's assets, rights or liabilities; (iv) the write-down, conversion, transfer, modification, or suspension of the relevant entity's equity, capital instruments and liabilities; and (v) temporary public ownership of the relevant entity. These tools may be applied to NatWest Group plc as the parent company or an affiliate where certain conditions are met (such as, whether the firm is failing or likely to fail, or whether it is reasonably likely that action will be taken (outside of resolution) that will result in the firm no longer failing or being likely to fail). Moreover, there are modified insolvency and administration procedures for relevant entities, and the Authorities have the power to modify or override certain contractual arrangements in certain circumstances and amend the law for the purpose of enabling their powers to be used effectively and may promulgate provisions with retrospective applicability.\n\nUnder the UK Banking Act, the Authorities are generally required to have regard to specified objectives in exercising the powers provided for by the Banking Act. One of the objectives (which is required to be balanced as appropriate with the other specified objectives) refers to the protection and enhancement of the stability of the financial system of the UK. Moreover, the 'no creditor worse off' safeguard contained in the Banking Act may not apply in relation to an application of the separate write-down and conversion power relating to capital instruments under the Banking Act, in circumstances where a stabilisation power is not also used. Holders of debt instruments which are subject to the power may, however, have ordinary shares transferred to or issued to them by way of compensation.\n\nUncertainty exists as to how the Authorities may exercise their powers including the determination of actions undertaken in relation to the ordinary shares and other securities of NatWest Group, which may depend on factors outside of NatWest Group's control. Moreover, the Banking Act provisions remain untested in practice.\n\nIf NatWest Group is at or is approaching the point of non-viability such that regulatory intervention is required, any exercise of the resolution regime powers by the Authorities may adversely affect holders of NatWest Group plc's ordinary shares or other NatWest Group securities. This may result in various actions being undertaken in relation to NatWest Group and any securities of\n\nNatWest Group, including cancellation, transfer, dilution, write-down or conversion (as applicable). There may also be a corresponding adverse effect on the market price of such securities.\n\nC Clliimmaattee  aanndd  ssuussttaaiinnaabbiilliittyy--rreellaatteedd  rriisskkss NatWest Group and its customers face significant climate-related risks, including in transitioning to a net zero economy, which may adversely impact NatWest Group.\n\nClimate-related risks and uncertainties are continuing to receive increasing regulatory, judicial, political and societal scrutiny.\n\nFinancial and non-financial risks from climate change arise through physical and transition risks. Furthermore, NatWest Group may also face a variety of climate-related legal risks, both physical and transition, from potential litigation and conduct liability. See also, ' NatWest Group may be subject to potential climate, environmental and other sustainability-related litigation, enforcement proceedings, investigations and conduct risk' .\n\nThere are significant uncertainties as to the extent and timing of the manifestation of the physical risks of climate change, such as more severe and frequent extreme weather events (flooding, subsidence, heat waves and long-lasting wildfires), rising sea levels, biodiversity loss and resource scarcity. Damage to NatWest Group customers' properties and operations could disrupt business, impair asset values and negatively impact the creditworthiness of customers leading to increased default rates, delinquencies, write-offs and impairment charges in NatWest Group's portfolios. In addition, NatWest Group premises and operations, or those of its critical outsourced functions may experience damage or disruption leading to increased costs and negatively affecting NatWest Group's business continuity and reputation.\n\nIn October 2021, the UK Government published its Net Zero Strategy which sets out how the UK will deliver on its commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The timing, content and implementation of the specific policies and proposals remain uncertain. Widespread transition to a net zero economy across all sectors of the economy and markets in which NatWest Group operates will be required to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement, the UK's Net Zero Strategy and the Glasgow Climate Pact of 2021. The impact of the extensive commercial, technological, policy and regulatory changes required to achieve transition remains uncertain, but it is expected to be significant and may be disruptive\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nacross the global economy and markets, especially if these changes do not occur in an orderly or timely manner or are not effective in reducing emissions sufficiently. Some sectors such as property, energy (including oil and gas), mining, infrastructure, transport (including automotive and aviation) and agriculture are expected to be particularly impacted. The timing and pace of the transition to a net zero economy is also uncertain and may be near term, gradual and orderly or delayed, rapid and disorderly, or the combination of these.\n\nClimate-related risks may be drivers of several different risk categories simultaneously and may exacerbate existing risks, including credit risk, operational risk (business continuity), market risk (both traded and nontraded), liquidity and funding risk (for example, net cash outflows or depletion of liquidity buffers).\n\nIf NatWest Group fails to adapt its business and operating model in a timely manner to the climate-related risks and opportunities and changing regulatory and market expectations, or to appropriately identify, measure, manage and mitigate climate change related physical, transition and legal risks and opportunities that NatWest Group, its customers and value chain face, NatWest Group's reputation, business, operations or value chain and results of operations and outlook may be impacted adversely.\n\nNatWest Group's purpose-led strategy includes climate change as one of its three areas of focus. This is likely to require material changes to the business and operating model of NatWest Group which entails significant execution risk.\n\nIn February 2020, NatWest Group announced its ambition to become a leading bank on climate in the UK, helping to address the climate challenge by setting itself the challenge to at least halve the climate impact of its financing activity by 2030 and intending to do what is necessary to achieve alignment with the 2015 Paris Agreement. In addition, in April 2021, NatWest Group by joining the Net Zero Banking Alliance 'Business Ambition to 1.5C', stated its ambition to reach net zero by 2050. Furthermore, as part of its efforts to support the transition to a net zero economy, NatWest Group has also announced its ambitions to phase out of coal for UK and non UK customers who have UK coal production, coal fired generation and coal related infrastructure by 1 October 2024, with a full global phase out by 1 January 2030; to plan to stop financing new customer relationships with corporate customers who explore for, extract or produce coal\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n417\n\nor operate unabated coal powered plants; and that it would not provide services to existing customers who are increasing coal mining activity by exploring for new coal, developing new coal mines or increasing thermal coal production.\n\nTo achieve its 2030 and 2050 ambitions, NatWest Group has also announced other climate ambitions, targets and commitments, and going-forward it may also announce other climate ambitions, targets and commitments, including science-based targets to be validated by the Science Based Target Initiative.\n\nMaking the changes necessary to achieving these ambitions may materially affect NatWest Group's business and operations and will require significant reductions to its financed emissions and to its exposure to customers that do not align with a transition to a net zero economy or do not have a credible transition plan. Increases in lending and financing activities may wholly or partially offset some or all of these reductions, which may increase the extent of changes and reductions necessary. It is anticipated that achieving these reductions, together with the active management of climate-related risks and other regulatory, policy and market changes, are likely to necessitate material and accelerated changes to NatWest Group's business, operating model and existing exposures (potentially on accelerated timescales and outside of risk appetite) which may have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group's ability to achieve its financial targets and generate sustainable returns.\n\nNatWest Group's ability to achieve theses ambitions, targets and commitments will depend to a large extent on many factors and uncertainties beyond NatWest Group's control. These include the macroeconomic environment, the extent and pace of climate change, including the timing and manifestation of physical and transition risks, the effectiveness of actions of governments, legislators, regulators, businesses, investors, customers and other stakeholders to adapt and/or mitigate the impact of climate-related risks, changes in customer behaviour and demand, the challenges related with the implementation and integration of adoption policy tools, changes in the available technology for mitigation and adaptation, the availability of accurate, verifiable, reliable, consistent and comparable data. See also, 'NatWest Group continues to implement its purpose-led strategy, which carries significant execution and operational risks and may not achieve its stated aims and targeted outcomes ' and ' There are significant challenges in relation to\n\nclimate-related data due to quality and other limitations, lack of standardisation, consistency and incompleteness which amongst other factors contribute to the significant uncertainties inherent in accurately modelling the impact of climate-related risks '.\n\nThese internal and external factors and uncertainties will make it challenging for NatWest Group to meet its climate ambitions, targets and commitments and there is a significant risk that all or some of them will not be achieved.\n\nAny delay or failure in setting, making progress against or meeting NatWest Group's climate-related ambitions, targets and commitments may have a material adverse impact on NatWest Group, its reputation, business, results of operations, outlook, market and competitive position and may increase the climate-related risks NatWest Group faces.\n\nAny failure by NatWest Group to implement effective and compliant climate change resilient systems, controls and procedures could adversely affect NatWest Group's ability to manage climate-related risks.\n\nThe prudential regulation of climaterelated risks is an important driver in how NatWest Group develops its risk appetite for financing activities or engaging with counterparties that do not align with a transition to a net zero economy or do not have a credible transition plan.\n\nLegislative and regulatory authorities are publishing expectations as to how banks should prudently manage and transparently disclose climate-related and environmental risks under prudential rules.\n\nIn April 2019, the PRA published a supervisory statement (the 'SS 3/19') with particular focus on the management of financial risks from climate change with respect to governance, risk management, scenario analysis and disclosures.\n\nFollowing the submission of initial plans by UK banks in October 2019, in July 2020 the PRA issued a 'Dear CEO' letter requiring firms to embed fully their approaches to managing climate-related financial risks by the end of 2021. In response, on 8 October 2020, NatWest Group provided the PRA with an update to its original plan noting that the COVID-19 pandemic had disrupted some elements of NatWest Group's original plan and, as a result, the updated plan would require additional operating cycles reaching into 2022 and beyond to prove embedding. Subsequently the PRA issued its 'Climate Change Adaptation Report' in October 2021 advising firms of the\n\nFinancial statements",

In January 2022, NatWest Group provided the PRA with an update on how it has addressed the commitments made in its October 2020 plan, noting the delivery of a 1st generation, largely qualitative in nature, approach to supervisory requirements.\n\nIn June 2021, the Bank of England launched its 2021 Biennial Exploratory Scenario ('CBES') to stress test the resilience of the current business models of the largest banks, insurers and the financial system to the physical and transition risks from climate change under three climate scenarios. NatWest Group delivered its CBES submission to the PRA in October 2021. The Bank of England has since announced that the CBES is likely to include a second round over February and March 2022, which is likely to be largely qualitative in nature.\n\nThe Bank of England guidance for the CBES confirmed that it is exploratory in nature and not intended to be used to set capital requirements. In the aforementioned 'Climate Change Adaptation Report 2021', the Bank of England confirmed that over the coming year it will undertake further analysis to explore enhancements to the regulatory capital frameworks as they relate to climate related financial risk. To support this work, the Bank of England will put out a 'Call for Papers' and host a Research Conference on the interaction between climate change and capital in Q4 2022. Informed by these steps and internal analysis, the Bank of England is expected to publish a follow-up report on the use of capital including on the role of any future scenario exercises by the end of 2022. It is therefore likely that in the coming years financial institutions, including NatWest Group, may be required to hold additional capital to enhance their resilience against systemic and/or institution specific vulnerabilities to climate-related financial risks, which could, in turn, negatively impact NatWest Group.\n\nAny failure of NatWest Group to fully and timely embed climate-related risks into its risk management practices and framework to appropriately identify, measure, manage and mitigate the various climate-related physical and transition risks and apply the appropriate product governance in line with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and expectations, may\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n418\n\nhave a material and adverse impact on NatWest Group's regulatory compliance, prudential capital requirements, liquidity position, reputation, business, results of operations and outlook.\n\nThere are significant challenges in relation to climate-related data due to quality and other limitations, lack of standardisation, consistency and incompleteness which amongst other factors contribute to the significant uncertainties inherent in accurately modelling the impact of climate-related risks.\n\nMeaningful reporting of climate-related risks and opportunities and their potential impacts and related metrics depend on access to accurate, reliable, consistent and comparable climaterelated data from counterparties or customers. These may not be generally available or, if available, may not be accurate, verifiable, reliable, consistent, or comparable. Any failure of NatWest Group to incorporate climate-related factors into its counterparty and customer data sourcing and accompanying analytics, or to develop accurate, reliable, consistent and comparable counterparty and customer data, may have a material adverse impact on NatWest Group's ability to prepare meaningful reporting of climaterelated risks and opportunities, its regulatory compliance, reputation, business and its competitive position.\n\nIn the absence of other sources, reporting of financed emissions by financial institutions, including NatWest Group, is necessarily based therefore on aggregated information developed by third parties that may be prepared in an inconsistent way using different methodologies, interpretations, or assumptions. Accordingly, our climaterelated disclosures use a greater number and level of assumptions and estimates than many of our financial disclosures. These assumptions and estimates are highly likely to change over time, and, when coupled with the longer time frames used in these climate related disclosures, make any assessment of materiality inherently uncertain. In particular, in the absence of actual emissions monitoring and measurement, emissions estimates are based on industry and other assumptions that may not be accurate for a given counterparty or customer. There may also be data gaps, particularly for private companies, that are filled using proxy data, such as sectoral averages, again developed in different ways. As a result, our climate related disclosures may be amended, updated or restated in the future as the quality and completeness of our data and methodologies continue to improve. These data quality challenges, gaps and\n\nlimitations could have a material impact on NatWest Group's ability to make effective business decisions about climate risks and opportunities, including risk management decisions, comply with disclosure requirements and our ability to monitor and report our progress in meeting our ambitions, targets and commitments.\n\nSignificant risks, uncertainties and variables are inherent in the assessment, measurement and mitigation of climaterelated risks. These include data quality gaps and limitations mentioned above, the pace at which climate science, greenhouse gas accounting standards and various emissions reduction solutions develop. In addition, there is a significant uncertainty about how climate change and the transition to a net zero economy will unfold over the coming decades and affect how and when climate-related risks will manifest. These timeframes are considerably longer than NatWest Group's historical strategic, financial, resilience and investment planning horizons.\n\nAs a result, it is very difficult to predict and model the impact of climate-related risks into precise financial and economic outcomes and impacts. Climate-related risks present significant methodological challenges due to their forward-looking nature, the lack and/or quality of historical testing capabilities, lack of standardisation and incompleteness of emissions and other climate and subsector related data and the immature nature of risk measurement and modelling methodologies. The evaluation of climate-related risk exposure and the development of associated potential risk mitigation techniques largely depend on the choice of climate scenario modelling methodology and the assumptions made which involves a number of risks and uncertainties, for example\n\n- \uf02d climate scenarios are not predictions of what is likely to happen or what NatWest Group would like to happen, they rather explore the possible implications of different judgments and assumptions by considering a series of scenarios;\n- \uf02d it requires a special skill set that banks traditionally do not have and therefore NatWest Group needs to rely on third party advice, modelling, and data which is also subject to many limitations and uncertainties;\n- \uf02d climate scenarios do not provide a comprehensive description of all possible future outcomes;\n- \uf02d modelling approaches and data on climate-related risks on financial assets is immature in nature and it is expected that techniques and understanding will evolve rapidly in the coming years;\n\nA\n\nd\n\nd\n\ni\n\nt\n\ni\n\no\n\nn\n\na\n\nl\n\ni\n\nn\n\nf\n\no\n\nr\n\nm\n\na\n\nt\n\ni\n\no\n\nn\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n- \uf02d it is challenging to benchmark or back test the climate scenarios given their forward-looking nature and the multiple possible outcomes;\n- \uf02d the assumptions will be continually evolving with more data/information which may affect the baselines for comparability across reporting periods and impact internal and external verification processes; and\n- \uf02d there is a significant uncertainty as to how the climate will evolve over time, how and when governments, regulators, businesses, investors and customers respond and how those responses impact the economy, asset valuations, land systems, energy systems, technology, policy and wider society;\n- \uf02d the pace of the development of the methodologies across different sectors may be different and therefore it may be challenging to report on the whole balance sheet with regard to emissions.\n\nAccordingly, these risks and uncertainties coupled with significantly longer timeframes make the outputs of climate-related risk modelling, including emissions reductions targets and pathways, inherently more uncertain than outputs modelled for traditional financial planning cycles based on historical financial information.\n\nCapabilities within NatWest Group to appropriately assess, model and manage climate-related risks and the suitability of the assumptions required to model and manage climate-related risks appropriately are developing. Even when those capabilities are developed, the high level of uncertainty regarding any assumptions modelled, the highly subjective nature of risk measurement and mitigation techniques, incorrect or inadequate assumptions and judgments and data quality gaps and limitations may lead to inadequate risk management information and frameworks, or ineffective business adaptation or mitigation strategies, which may have a material adverse impact on NatWest Group's regulatory compliance, reputation, business, results of operations and outlook.\n\nA failure to adapt NatWest Group's business strategy, governance, procedures, systems and controls to manage emerging sustainability-related risks and opportunities may have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group, its reputation, business, results of operations and outlook.\n\nInvestors, customers, international organisations, regulators and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on identification, measurement, management and mitigation of 'sustainability-related' risks and\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n419\n\nopportunities such as environmental (including biodiversity and loss of natural capital); social (including diversity and inclusion, the living wage, fair taxation and value chains); and governance (including board diversity, ethics, executive compensation and management structure) related risks and opportunities and on long term sustainable value creation.\n\nFinancial institutions, including NatWest Group, are directly and indirectly exposed to multiple types of environmental and biodiversity-related risk through their activities, including risk of default by clients. Additionally, there is a growing need to move from safeguards and interventions that focus on reducing negative impacts on environment and biodiversity towards those that focus on increasing positive impact on environment and biodiversity and nature-based solutions. In 2021, NatWest Group accordingly classified 'Biodiversity and Nature Loss' as an emerging risk for NatWest Group within its Risk Management Framework. This is an evolving and complex area which requires collaborative approaches with partners, stakeholders and peers to help measure and mitigate negative impacts of financing activities on the environment, biodiversity and nature as well as supporting the growing sector of nature-based solutions, habitat restoration and biodiversity markets. NatWest Group is in the early stages of developing its approach and NatWest Group recognises the need for more progress.\n\nThere is also increased investor, regulatory and customer scrutiny regarding how businesses address social issues, including tackling inequality, working conditions, workplace health, safety and wellbeing, diversity and inclusion, data protection and management, workforce management, human rights and supply chain management which may impact NatWest Group's employees, customers, and their business activities or the communities in which they operate. There is also growing attention on the need for a 'just transition' and 'energy justice' - in recognition that the transition to a net zero economy should not disproportionally affect the most disadvantaged members of society. The increased focus on these issues may create reputational and other risks for financial institutions, including NatWest Group.\n\nIn addition to climate-related risks, sustainability-related risks (i) may also adversely affect economic activity, asset pricing and valuations of issuers' securities and, in turn, the wider financial system; (ii) may impact economic\n\nactivities directly (for example through lower corporate profitability or the devaluation of assets) or indirectly (for example through macro-financial changes); (iii) may also affect the viability or resilience of business models over the medium to longer term, particularly those business models most vulnerable to sustainability-related risks; (iv) can trigger further losses stemming directly or indirectly from legal claims (liability risks) and reputational damage as a result of the public, customers, counterparties and/or investors associating NatWest Group or its customers with adverse sustainabilityrelated issues; and (v) intersect with and further complexity and challenge to achieving our purpose-led strategy including climate ambitions, targets and commitments.\n\nTogether with climate-related risks, these risks may combine to generate even greater adverse effects on our business.\n\nFurthermore, sustainability-related risks may be drivers of several different risk categories simultaneously and may exacerbate the risks described herein, including credit risk, operational risk (business continuity), market risk (both traded and non-traded), liquidity and funding risk (for example, net cash outflows or depletion of liquidity buffers).\n\nAccordingly, any failure or delay by NatWest Group to successfully adapt its business strategy and to establish and maintain effective governance, procedures, systems and controls in response to these issues, and to manage these emerging sustainability-related risks and opportunities may have a material adverse impact NatWest Group's reputation, liquidity position, business, results of operations, outlook and the value of NatWest Group's securities.\n\nAny reduction in the ESG ratings of NatWest Group could have a negative impact on NatWest Group's reputation and on investors' risk appetite and customers' willingness to deal with NatWest Group.\n\nESG ratings from agencies and data providers which rate how NatWest Group manages environmental, social and governance risks are increasingly influencing investment decisions or being used as a basis to label financial products and services as green or sustainable. ESG ratings are (i) unsolicited; (ii) subject to the assessment and interpretation by the ESG rating agencies; (iii) provided without warranty; (iv) not a sponsorship, endorsement, or promotion of NatWest Group by the relevant rating agency; and (v) may depend on many factors some of which\n\nFinancial statements",

Any reduction in the ESG ratings of NatWest Group could have a negative impact on NatWest Group's reputation and could influence investors' risk appetite for NatWest Group's and/or its subsidiaries' securities, particularly ESG securities and could affect a customer's willingness to deal with NatWest Group.\n\nIncreasing levels of climate, environmental and sustainability-related laws, regulation and oversight may adversely affect NatWest Group's business and expose NatWest Group to increased costs of compliance, regulatory sanction and reputational damage.\n\nThere are an increasing number of EU, UK and other regulatory and legislative initiatives to address issues around climate, environmental and sustainability risks and opportunities and to promote the transition to a net zero economy. As a result, an increasing number of laws, regulations, legislative actions are likely to affect the financial sector and the real economy, including proposals, guidance, policy and regulatory initiatives many of which have been introduced or amended recently and are subject to further changes.\n\nMany of these initiatives are focused on developing standardized definitions for green and sustainable criteria of assets and liabilities, integrating climate change and sustainability into decision-making and customers access to green and sustainable financial products and services which may have a significant impact on the services provided by NatWest Group and its subsidiaries, especially mortgage lending, and its associated credit, market and financial risk profile. They could also impact NatWest Group's recognition of its climate and sustainable funding and financing activity and may adversely affect NatWest Group's ability to achieve its climate strategy and climate and sustainable funding and financing ambitions.\n\nIn addition, NatWest Group and its subsidiaries are and will be subject to increasing entity wide climate-related and other non-financial disclosure requirements pursuant to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure ('TCFD') and under other regimes. From February 2022, NatWest Group will be required to provide enhanced climaterelated disclosures consistent with the TCFD recommendations to comply with the FCA Policy Statement on the new Listing Rules (PS 20/17) that require commercial companies with a UK premium listing - such as NatWest Group - to make climate related disclosures,\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n420\n\nconsistent with TCFD, on a 'comply or explain' basis. The FCA is proposing to expand this requirement to a wider scope of listed issuers which would include NatWest Group' subsidiaries as it moves towards mandatory TCFD reporting across the UK economy by 2025. See also, ' There are significant challenges in relation to climate-related data due to quality and other limitations, lack of standardisation, consistency and incompleteness which amongst other factors contribute to the significant uncertainties inherent in accurately modelling the impact of climate-related risks '.\n\nIn addition, NatWest Group's EU subsidiaries and branches are and will continue to be subject to an increasing array of the EU/EEA climate and sustainability-related legal and regulatory requirements. These requirements may be used as the basis for UK laws and regulations (such as the UK Green Taxonomy) or regarded by investors and regulators as best practice standards whether or not they apply to UK businesses. Any divergence between UK, EU/EEA and US climate and sustainability-related legal and regulatory requirements may result in NatWest Group not meeting investors' expectations, may increase the cost of doing business and may restrict access of NatWest Group's UK business to the EU/EEA market.\n\nNatWest Group is also participating in various voluntary carbon reporting and other standard setting initiatives for disclosing climate and sustainabilityrelated information, many of which have differing objectives and methodologies and are at different stages of development in terms of how they apply to financial institutions.\n\nCompliance with these developing and evolving climate and sustainabilityrelated requirements is likely to require NatWest Group to implement significant changes to its business models, product and other governance, internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, modelling capability and risk management systems, which may increase the cost of doing business, entail additional change risk and compliance costs.\n\nFailure to implement and comply with these legal and regulatory requirements or emerging best practice expectations may have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group's regulatory compliance and may result in regulatory sanction, reputational damage and investor disapproval each of which could have an adverse effect on NatWest Group's business, results of operations and outlook.\n\nNatWest Group may be subject to potential climate, environmental and other sustainability-related litigation, enforcement proceedings, investigations and conduct risk.\n\nDue to increasing new climate and sustainability-related jurisprudence, laws and regulations in the UK and other jurisdictions, growing demand from investors and customers for environmentally sustainable products and services, and regulatory scrutiny, financial institutions, including NatWest Group, may through their business activities face increasing litigation, conduct, enforcement and contract liability risks related to climate change, environmental degradation and other social, governance and sustainabilityrelated issues.\n\nThese risks may arise, for example, from claims pertaining to : (i) failures to meet obligations, targets or commitments relating to, or to disclose accurately, or provide updates on material climate and/or sustainability related risks, or otherwise provide appropriate disclosure to investors, customers, counterparties and other stakeholders; (ii) conduct, misselling and other customer protection type claims; (iii) marketing that portrays products, securities, activities or policies as producing positive climate, environmental or sustainable outcomes to an extent that may not the case; (iv) damages claims under various tort theories, including common law public nuisance claims, or negligent mismanagement of physical and/or transition risks; (v) alleged violations of officers', directors' and other fiduciaries' fiduciary duties, for example by financing various carbon-intensive, environmentally harmful or otherwise highly exposed assets, companies, and industries; (vi) changes in understanding of what constitutes positive climate, environmental or sustainable outcomes as a result of developing climate science, leading to discrepancy between current product offerings and investor and/or market and/or broader stakeholder expectations; (vi) any weaknesses or failures in specific systems or processes associated particularly with climate, environmental or sustainability linked products, including any failure in timely implementation, onboarding and/or updating of such systems or processes; or (vii) counterparties, collaborators and third parties in NatWest Group's value chain action who act, or fail to act, or undertake due diligence, or apply appropriate risk management and product governance in a manner that impacts Natwest Group's reputation or sustainability credentials.\n\nFurthermore, there is a risk that shareholders, campaign groups,\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\ncustomers and special interest groups could seek to take legal action against NatWest Group for financing or contributing to climate change and environmental degradation and for not supporting the principles of 'just transition' (i.e. maximising the social benefits of the transition, mitigating the social risks of the transition, empowering those affected by the change, anticipating future shifts to address issues up front and mobilising investments from the public and private sectors).\n\nThere is a risk that as climate science develops and societal understanding of climate science increases and deepens, courts, regulators and enforcement authorities may apply the then current understandings of climate related matters retrospectively when assessing claims about historic conduct or dealings of financial institutions, including NatWest Group.\n\nThese potential litigation, conduct, enforcement and contract liability risks may have a material adverse effect on NatWest Group's ability to achieve its strategy, including its climate ambition, and they could have an adverse effect on NatWest Group's reputation, business, financial results, position and prospects, results of operations and outlook.\n\n## O Oppeerraattiioonnaall  aanndd  IITT  rreessiilliieennccee  rriisskk\n\nOperational risks (including reliance on third party suppliers and outsourcing of certain activities) are inherent in NatWest Group's businesses.\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, procedures, people or systems, or from external events, including legal risks. NatWest Group operates in a number of countries, offering a diverse range of products and services supported directly or indirectly by third party suppliers. As a result, operational risks or losses can arise from a number of internal or external factors (including financial crime and fraud), for which there may now be a risk of greater scrutiny by third parties on NatWest Group's compliance with financial crime requirements; see ' NatWest Group is exposed to the risks of various litigation matters, regulatory and governmental actions and investigations as well as remedial undertakings, including conduct-related reviews, antimoney laundering and redress projects, the outcomes of which are inherently difficult to predict, and which could have an adverse effect on NatWest Group '). These risks are also present when NatWest Group relies on third-party suppliers or vendors to provide services to it or its customers, as is increasingly the case as NatWest Group outsources\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n421\n\ncertain activities, including with respect to the implementation of new technologies, innovation and responding to regulatory and market changes.\n\nOperational risks continue to be heightened as a result of the implementation of NatWest Group's purpose-led strategy, including NatWest Group's phased withdrawal from ROI, NatWest Group's current cost-reduction measures and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally (including the COVID-19 pandemic and other geo-political developments) as well as the legal and regulatory uncertainty resulting therefrom. It is unclear as to how the future ways of working may evolve, including in respect of how working practices may develop, or how NatWest Group will evolve to best serve its customers. Any of the above may place significant pressure on NatWest Group's ability to maintain effective internal controls and governance frameworks.\n\nThe effective management of operational risks is critical to meeting customer service expectations and retaining and attracting customer business. Although NatWest Group has implemented risk controls and mitigation actions, with resources and planning having been devoted to mitigate operational risk, such measures may not be effective in controlling each of the operational risks faced by NatWest Group. Ineffective management of such risks could adversely affect NatWest Group.\n\n## NatWest Group is subject to increasingly sophisticated and frequent cyberattacks.\n\nNatWest Group experiences a constant threat from cyberattacks across the entire NatWest Group and against NatWest Group's supply chain, reinforcing the importance of due diligence of and close working relationship with the third parties on which NatWest Group relies. NatWest Group is reliant on technology, against which there is a constantly evolving series of attacks that are increasing in terms of frequency, sophistication, impact and severity. As cyberattacks evolve and become more sophisticated, NatWest Group is required to continue to invest in additional capability designed to defend against the emerging threats. In 2021, NatWest Group and its supply chain were subjected to a small number of Distributed Denial of Service ('DDOS') and ransomware attacks, which are a pervasive and significant threat to the global financial services industry. The focus is to manage the impact of the attacks and sustain availability of services for NatWest Group's customers. NatWest Group continues to invest significant resources in the development and evolution of cyber security controls\n\nthat are designed to minimise the potential effect of such attacks.\n\nHostile attempts are made by third parties to gain access to, introduce malware (including ransomware) into and exploit vulnerabilities of, NatWest Group's IT systems. NatWest Group has information and cyber security controls in place to minimise the impact of any attack, which are subject to review on a continuing basis but given the nature of the threat, there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent all attacks in the future. See also, ' NatWest Group's operations are highly dependent on its complex IT systems (including those that enable remote working) and any IT failure could adversely affect NatWest Group' .\n\nAny failure in NatWest Group's cybersecurity policies, procedures or controls, may result in significant financial losses, major business disruption, inability to deliver customer services, or loss of data or other sensitive information (including as a result of an outage) and may cause associated reputational damage. Any of these factors could increase costs (including costs relating to notification of, or compensation for customers, credit monitoring or card reissuance), result in regulatory investigations or sanctions being imposed or may affect NatWest Group's ability to retain and attract customers. Regulators in the UK, US, Europe and Asia continue to recognise cybersecurity as an important systemic risk to the financial sector and have highlighted the need for financial institutions to improve their monitoring and control of, and resilience (particularly of critical services) to cyberattacks, and to provide timely notification of them, as appropriate.\n\nAdditionally, third parties may also fraudulently attempt to induce employees, customers, third-party providers or other users who have access to NatWest Group's systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to NatWest Group's data or that of NatWest Group's customers or employees. Cybersecurity and information security events can derive from groups or factors such as: internal or external threat actors, human error, fraud or malice on the part of NatWest Group's employees or third parties, including third party providers, or may result from accidental technological failure.\n\nNatWest Group expects greater regulatory engagement, supervision and enforcement to continue at a high level in relation to its overall resilience to withstand IT and related disruption, either through a cyberattack or some\n\nAdd\n\nit\n\nion\n\nal i\n\nnform\n\na\n\ntio\n\nn\n\nFinancial statements",

Such increased regulatory engagement, supervision and enforcement is uncertain in relation to the scope, cost, consequence and the pace of change, which could negatively impact NatWest Group. Due to NatWest Group's reliance on technology and the increasing sophistication, frequency and impact of cyberattacks, such attacks may have a material adverse impact on NatWest Group.\n\nIn accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 and the European Union Withdrawal Act 2018, the Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments Etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, as amended by the Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments Etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 ('UK Data Protection Framework') and European Banking Authority ('EBA') Guidelines on ICT and Security Risk Management, NatWest Group is required to ensure it implements timely, appropriate and effective organisational and technological safeguards against unauthorised or unlawful access to the data of NatWest Group, its customers and its employees. In order to meet this requirement, NatWest Group relies on the effectiveness of its internal policies, controls and procedures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information held on its IT systems, networks and devices as well as with third parties with whom NatWest Group interacts. A failure to monitor and manage data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Framework and EBA requirements of the applicable legislation may result in financial losses, regulatory fines and investigations and associated reputational damage.\n\n## NatWest Group operations and strategy are highly dependent on the accuracy and effective use of data.\n\nNatWest Group relies on the effective use of accurate data to support, monitor, evaluate, manage and enhance its operations and deliver its strategy. The availability of current, complete, detailed, accurate and, wherever possible, machine-readable customer segment and sub-sector data, together with appropriate governance and accountability for data, is fast becoming a critical strategic asset, which is subject to increased regulatory focus. Failure to have that data or the ineffective use or governance of that data could result in a failure to manage and report important risks and opportunities or satisfy customers' expectations including the inability to deliver innovative products and services. This could also result in a failure to deliver NatWest Group's strategy and could place NatWest Group at a competitive disadvantage by\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n422\n\nincreasing its costs, inhibiting its efforts to reduce costs or its ability to improve its systems, controls and processes, which could result in a failure to deliver NatWest Group's strategy. These data limitations, or the unethical or inappropriate use of data, and/or noncompliance with customer data protection laws could give rise to conduct and litigation risks and may increase the risk of operational events, losses or other adverse consequences due to inappropriate models, systems, processes, decisions or other actions.\n\n## NatWest Group's operations are highly dependent on its complex IT systems (including those that enable remote working) and any IT failure could adversely affect NatWest Group.\n\nNatWest Group's operations are highly dependent on the ability to process a very large number of transactions efficiently and accurately while complying with applicable laws and regulations. The proper functioning of NatWest Group's payment systems, financial crime, fraud systems and controls, risk management, credit analysis and reporting, accounting, customer service and other IT systems, as well as the communication networks between its branches and main data processing centres, is critical to NatWest Group's operations.\n\nIndividually or collectively, any critical system failure, material loss of service availability or material breach of data security could cause serious damage to NatWest Group's ability to provide services to its customers, which could result in reputational damage, significant compensation costs or regulatory sanctions (including fines resulting from regulatory investigations) or a breach of applicable regulations and could affect its regulatory approvals, competitive position, business and brands, which could undermine its ability to attract and retain customers. This risk is heightened as most of NatWest Group's employees continue to work remotely, as it outsources certain functions and as it continues to innovate and offer new digital solutions to its customers as a result of the trend towards online and mobile banking.\n\nIn 2021, NatWest Group continued to make considerable investments to further simplify, upgrade and improve its IT and technology capabilities (including migration of certain services to cloud platforms). NatWest Group also continues to develop and enhance digital services for its customers and seeks to improve its competitive position through enhancing controls and procedures and strengthening the resilience of services including cyber security. Any failure of these investment and rationalisation\n\ninitiatives to achieve the expected results, due to cost challenges or otherwise, could negatively affect NatWest Group's operations, its reputation and ability to retain or grow its customer business or adversely impact its competitive position, thereby negatively impacting NatWest Group.\n\n## Remote working may adversely affect NatWest Group's ability to maintain effective internal controls.\n\nFrom March 2020 to September 2021, many of NatWest Group's employees worked exclusively on a remote basis. Following the lifting of government restrictions, NatWest Group will implement a new hybrid working policy whereby many employees may work remotely the majority of the time in the ordinary course of their roles.\n\nRemote working arrangements for\n\nNatWest Group employees continues to\n\nplace heavy reliance on the IT systems\n\nthat enable remote working and\n\nincreased exposure to fraud, conduct,\n\noperational and other risks and may\n\nplace additional pressure on NatWest\n\nGroup's ability to maintain effective\n\ninternal controls and governance\n\nframeworks. Remote working\n\narrangements are also subject to\n\nregulatory scrutiny to ensure adequate\n\nrecording, surveillance and supervision\n\nof regulated activities, and compliance\n\nwith regulatory requirements and\n\nexpectations, including requirements to:\n\nmeet threshold conditions for regulated\n\nactivities; ensure the ability to oversee\n\nfunctions (including any outsourced\n\nfunctions); ensure no detriment is caused\n\nto customers; and ensure no increased\n\nrisk of financial crime. See also, '\n\nA failure\n\nin NatWest Group's risk management\n\nframework could adversely affect\n\nNatWest Group, including its ability to\n\nachieve its strategic objectives\n\n.'\n\nMoreover, the IT systems that enable\n\nremote working interface with third-\n\nparty systems, and NatWest Group could\n\nexperience service denials or disruptions\n\nif such systems exceed capacity or if a\n\nthird-party system fails or experiences\n\nany interruptions, all of which could\n\nresult in business and customer\n\ninterruption and related reputational\n\ndamage, significant compensation costs,\n\nregulatory sanctions and/or a breach of\n\napplicable regulations.

Whilst NatWest Group has taken measures seeking to maintain the health, wellbeing and safety of its employees, these measures may be ineffective. Any\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\nof the above could impair NatWest Group's ability to hire, retain and engage well-qualified employees, especially at a senior level, which in turn may adversely impact NatWest Group's ability to serve its customers efficiently and impact productivity across NatWest Group. This could also adversely affect NatWest Group's reputation and competitive position and its ability to grow its business.\n\nNatWest Group relies on attracting, retaining and developing diverse senior management and skilled personnel, and is required to maintain good employee relations.\n\nNatWest Group's success depends on its ability to attract, retain through creating an inclusive environment, and develop highly skilled and qualified diverse personnel, including senior management, directors and key employees especially for technology and data focused roles, in a highly competitive market and under internal cost reduction pressures.\n\nNatWest Group's ability to do this may be more difficult due to the cost reduction pressures, heightened regulatory oversight of banks and the increasing scrutiny of, and (in some cases) restrictions placed upon, employee compensation arrangements (in particular those of banks in receipt of government support such as NatWest Group). This increases the cost of hiring, training and retaining diverse skilled personnel. In addition, certain economic, market and regulatory conditions and political developments may reduce the pool of diverse candidates for key management and non-executive roles, including non-executive directors with the right skills, knowledge and experience, or increase the number of departures of existing employees. Moreover, a failure to foster a diverse and inclusive workforce may have an adverse impact on NatWest Group's employee engagement and the formulation and execution of its strategy, and could also have a negative effect on its reputation with customers, investors and regulators.\n\nThe inability to compensate employees competitively and/or any reduction of compensation, as a result of negative economic developments or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on NatWest Group's ability to hire, retain and engage well qualified employees, especially at a senior level, which may have a negative impact on the financial position and prospects of NatWest Group.\n\nMany of NatWest Group's employees in the UK, the ROI and continental Europe are represented by employee representative bodies, including trade unions and works councils. Engagement\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n423\n\nwith its employees and such bodies is important to NatWest Group in maintaining good employee relations. Any failure to do so could impact NatWest Group's ability to operate its business effectively.\n\n## A failure in NatWest Group's risk management framework could adversely affect NatWest Group, including its ability to achieve its strategic objectives.\n\nRisk management is an integral part of all of NatWest Group's activities and includes the definition and monitoring of NatWest Group's risk appetite and reporting on NatWest Group's risk exposure and the potential impact thereof on NatWest Group's financial condition. Financial risk management is highly dependent on the use and effectiveness of internal stress tests and models.\n\nIn addition, financial crime risk management is dependent on the use and effectiveness of financial crime assessment, systems and controls. Weak or ineffective financial crime processes and controls may risk NatWest Group inadvertently facilitating financial crime which may result in regulatory investigation, sanction, litigation and reputational damage. Financial crime continues to evolve, whether through fraud, scams, cyber-attacks or other criminal activity. NatWest Group has made and continues to make significant, multi-year investments to strengthen and improve its overall financial crime control framework with prevention systems and capabilities. As part of its ongoing programme of investment, there is current and future investment planned to further strengthen financial crime controls over the coming years, including investment in new technologies and capabilities to further enhance customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, sanctions and anti-bribery and corruption systems.\n\nIneffective risk management may arise from a wide variety of factors, including lack of transparency or incomplete risk reporting, unidentified conflicts or misaligned incentives, lack of accountability control and governance, incomplete risk monitoring and management or insufficient challenges or assurance processes. Failure to manage risks effectively could adversely impact NatWest Group's reputation or its relationship with its regulators, customers, shareholders or other stakeholders.\n\nNatWest Group's operations are inherently exposed to conduct risks, which include business decisions, actions or reward mechanisms that are not responsive to or aligned with NatWest Group's regulatory obligations,\n\ncustomers' needs or do not reflect NatWest Group's customer-focused strategy, ineffective product management, unethical or inappropriate use of data, information asymmetry, implementation and utilisation of new technologies, outsourcing of customer service and product delivery, the possibility of mis-selling of financial products and mishandling of customer complaints. Some of these risks have materialised in the past and ineffective management and oversight of conduct risks may lead to further remediation and regulatory intervention or enforcement.\n\nNatWest Group's businesses are also exposed to risks from employee misconduct including non-compliance with policies and regulations, negligence or fraud (including financial crimes and fraud), any of which could result in regulatory fines or sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm to NatWest Group. These risks may be exacerbated as most of NatWest Group's employees continue to work remotely, which places additional pressure on NatWest Group's ability to maintain effective internal controls and governance frameworks.\n\nNatWest Group has been seeking to embed a strong risk culture across the organisation and has implemented policies and allocated new resources across all levels of the organisation to manage and mitigate conduct risk and expects to continue to invest in its risk management framework. However, such efforts may not insulate NatWest Group from future instances of misconduct and no assurance can be given that NatWest Group's strategy and control framework will be effective. Any failure in NatWest Group's risk management framework could negatively affect NatWest Group and its financial condition through reputational and financial harm and may result in the inability to achieve its strategic objectives for its customers, employees and wider stakeholders.\n\n## NatWest Group's operations are subject to inherent reputational risk.\n\nReputational risk relates to stakeholder and public perceptions of NatWest Group arising from an actual or perceived failure to meet stakeholder expectations, including with respect to NatWest Group's purpose-led strategy and related targets, due to any events, behaviour, action or inaction by NatWest Group, its employees or those with whom NatWest Group is associated.

In particular, NatWest Group's ability to attract and retain customers (particularly, corporate and retail depositors) may be adversely affected by, amongst others: negative public opinion resulting from the actual or perceived manner in which NatWest Group conducts or modifies its business activities and operations, media coverage (whether accurate or otherwise), employee misconduct, NatWest Group's financial performance, IT systems failures or cyberattacks, data breaches, financial crime and fraud, the level of direct and indirect government support, or the actual or perceived practices in the banking and financial industry in general, or a wide variety of other factors.\n\nModern technologies, in particular online social networks and other broadcast tools that facilitate communication with large audiences in short timeframes and with minimal costs, may also significantly increase and accelerate the impact of damaging information and allegations.\n\nAlthough NatWest Group has implemented a Reputational Risk Policy to improve the identification, assessment and management of customers, transactions, products and issues, which represent a reputational risk, NatWest Group cannot be certain that it will be successful in avoiding damage to its business from reputational risk.\n\n## L Leeggaall,,  rreegguullaattoorryy  aanndd  ccoonndduucctt  rriisskk\n\nNatWest Group's businesses are subject to substantial regulation and oversight, which are constantly evolving and may adversely affect NatWest Group.\n\nNatWest Group is subject to extensive laws, regulations, corporate governance practice and disclosure requirements, administrative actions and policies in each jurisdiction in which it operates. Many of these have been introduced or amended recently and are subject to further material changes, which may increase compliance and conduct risks, particularly if EU/EEA and UK laws diverge as a result of Brexit. NatWest Group expects government and regulatory intervention in the financial services industry to remain high for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn recent years, regulators and governments have focused on reforming the prudential regulation of the financial\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n424\n\nservices industry and the manner in which the business of financial services is conducted. Amongst others, measures have included: enhanced capital, liquidity and funding requirements, implementation of the UK ring-fencing regime, implementation and strengthening of the recovery and resolution framework applicable to financial institutions in the UK, the EU and the US, financial industry reforms (including in respect of MiFID II), corporate governance requirements, restrictions on the compensation of senior management and other employees, enhanced data protection and IT resilience requirements, financial market infrastructure reforms (including enhanced data protection and IT resilience requirements, enhanced regulations in respect of the provision of 'investment services and activities'), and increased regulatory focus in certain areas, including conduct, consumer protection, competition, disputes regimes, payment systems, financial crime and fraud laws and regulations.\n\nOther areas in which, and examples of where, governmental policies, regulatory and accounting changes, and increased public and regulatory scrutiny could have an adverse impact (some of which could be material) on NatWest Group include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- \uf02d rules relating to foreign ownership, expropriation, nationalisation and confiscation of assets;\n- \uf02d general changes in government, central bank, regulatory or competition policy, or changes in regulatory regimes that may influence investor decisions in the jurisdictions in which NatWest Group operates;\n- \uf02d increased scrutiny from the CMA, FCA and Payment Systems Regulator ('PSR') for the protection and resilience of, and competition and innovation in, UK payment systems and retail banking developments relating to the UK initiative on Open Banking, Open Finance and the European directive on payment services;\n- \uf02d ongoing competition litigation in the English courts around payment card interchange fees, combined with increased regulatory scrutiny (from the PSR) of the Visa and Mastercard card schemes;\n- \uf02d the ongoing compliance by NatWest Group with CMA's Retail Banking Market Order 2017 (the 'Order') as well as the ongoing consultation by the UK Government to introduce penalties for breaches of the Order (in addition to the current customer remediation requirements);\n- \uf02d new or increased regulations relating to customer data protection as well as IT controls and resilience, including the UK Data Protection Framework and the impact of the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) decision (known as Schrems II), in which the CJEU ruled that the Privacy Shield (an EU/US data transfer mechanism) is now invalid, leading to more onerous due diligence requirements for the Group prior to sending personal data of its EU customers and employees to nonEEA countries, including the UK and the US;\n- \uf02d increased regulatory focus on customer protection (such as the FCA's consumer duty consultation paper (CP21/13)) in retail or other financial markets;\n- \uf02d the introduction of, and changes to, taxes, levies or fees applicable to NatWest Group's operations, such as the imposition of a financial transaction tax, introduction of global minimum tax rules, changes in tax rates, changes in the scope and administration of the Bank Levy, increases in the bank corporation tax surcharge in the UK, restrictions on the tax deductibility of interest payments or further restrictions imposed on the treatment of carryforward tax losses that reduce the value of deferred tax assets and require increased payments of tax;\n- \uf02d the potential introduction by the Bank of England of a Central Bank Digital Currency which could result in deposit outflows, higher funding costs, and/or other implications for UK banks including NatWest Group;

Any of these developments (including any failure to comply with new rules and regulations) could also have a significant impact on NatWest Group's authorisations and licences, the products and services that NatWest Group may offer, its reputation and the value of its assets, NatWest Group's operations or legal entity structure, and the manner in which NatWest Group conducts its business. Material consequences could arise should NatWest Group be found to be non-compliant with these regulatory requirements. Regulatory developments may also result in an increased number of regulatory investigations and proceedings and have increased the risks relating to NatWest Group's ability to comply with the applicable body of rules and regulations in the manner and within the time frames required.\n\nChanges in laws, rules or regulations, or in their interpretation or enforcement, or the implementation of new laws, rules or regulations, including contradictory or conflicting laws, rules or regulations by key regulators or policymakers in different jurisdictions, or failure by NatWest Group to comply with such laws, rules and regulations, may adversely affect NatWest Group's business, results of operations and outlook. In addition, uncertainty and insufficient international regulatory coordination as enhanced supervisory standards are developed and implemented may adversely affect NatWest Group's ability to engage in effective business, risk and capital management planning.\n\nNatWest Group is exposed to the risks of various litigation matters, regulatory and governmental actions and investigations as well as remedial undertakings, including conduct-related reviews, antimoney laundering and redress projects, the outcomes of which are inherently difficult to predict, and which could have an adverse effect on NatWest Group.\n\nNatWest Group's operations are diverse and complex and it operates in legal and regulatory environments that expose it to potentially significant legal proceedings, and civil and criminal regulatory and governmental actions. NatWest Group has resolved a number of legal and regulatory actions over the past several years but continues to be, and may in\n\nN NaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n425\n\nthe future be, involved in such actions in the US, the UK, Europe and other jurisdictions.\n\nNatWest Group is currently, has recently been and will likely be involved in a number of significant legal and regulatory actions, including investigations, proceedings and ongoing reviews (both formal and informal) by governmental law enforcement and other agencies and litigation proceedings, relating to, among other matters, the offering of securities, conduct in the foreign exchange market, the setting of benchmark rates such as LIBOR and related derivatives trading, the issuance, underwriting, and sales and trading of fixed-income securities (including government securities), product mis-selling, customer mistreatment, anti-money laundering, antitrust, VAT recovery and various other compliance issues. Legal and regulatory actions are subject to many uncertainties, and their outcomes, including the timing, amount of fines, damages or settlements or the form of any settlements, which may be material and in excess of any related provisions, are often difficult to predict, particularly in the early stages of a case or investigation. NatWest Group's expectation for resolution may change and substantial additional provisions and costs may be recognised in respect of any matter.\n\nThe resolution of significant investigations include: (a) NWM Plc's December 2021 spoofing-related guilty plea in the United States, which involves a three-year period of probation, an independent corporate monitor, and commitments to compliance programme reviews and improvements and reporting obligations, as well as approximately US$35 million in fines and restitution, and (b) National Westminster Bank Plc's October 2021 guilty plea for breaches of the UK Money Laundering Regulations 2007, which resulted in a fine of approximately \u00a3265 million. For additional information relating to these and other legal and regulatory proceedings and matters to which NatWest Group is currently exposed, see ' Litigation and regulatory matters ' at Note 27 to the consolidated accounts.\n\nThe recent guilty pleas, other recently resolved matters or adverse outcomes or resolution of current or future legal or regulatory actions could increase the risk of greater regulatory and third party scrutiny and could have material collateral consequences for NatWest Group's business and result in restrictions or limitations on NatWest Group's operations.\n\nThese may include the effective or actual disqualification from carrying on certain regulated activities and consequences resulting from the need to reapply for various important licences or obtain waivers to conduct certain existing activities of NatWest Group, particularly but not solely in the US, which may take a significant period of time and the results of which are uncertain. Disqualification from carrying on any activities, whether automatically as a result of the resolution of a particular matter or as a result of the failure to obtain such licences or waivers could adversely impact NatWest Group's business, in particular in the US. This in turn and/or any fines, settlement payments or penalties could adversely impact NatWest Group's reported financial results and condition, capital position or reputation.\n\nFailure to comply with undertakings made by NatWest Group to its regulators, or the conditions of probation resulting from the spoofing-related guilty plea, may result in additional measures or penalties being taken against NatWest Group. In addition, any failure to administer conduct redress processes adequately, or to handle individual complaints fairly or appropriately, could result in further claims as well as the imposition of additional measures or limitations on NatWest Group's operations, additional supervision by NatWest Group's regulators, and loss of investor confidence.\n\nNatWest Group may not effectively manage the transition of LIBOR and other IBOR rates to alternative risk-free rates.\n\nUK and international regulators are driving the transition from the use of interbank offer rates ('IBORs'), including LIBOR, to alternative rates, primarily risk free rates ('RFRs'). As of 31 December 2021, LIBOR, as currently determined, has ceased for all tenors of GBP, JPY, CHF, EUR, and for the 1 week and 2 month tenors for USD. The remaining USD LIBOR tenors, as currently determined, are due to cease after 30 June 2023. The FCA has used its powers under the UK Benchmarks Regulation ('UK BMR') to require, for a limited period of time after 31 December 2021, the ongoing publication of the 1, 3, and 6 month GBP and JPY LIBOR tenors using a changed methodology (i.e., 'Art23A LIBOR' on a synthetic basis). The UK has passed the Critical Benchmarks (References and Administrators' Liability) Act 2021 ('Critical Benchmarks Act') which establishes a framework that allows the ongoing use of Art23A LIBOR under certain circumstances where contracts have pro-actively transitioned onto alternative rates. However, the FCA\n\nFinancial statements",

        "page_content": "has been clear that the solutions provided under UK BMR and the Critical Benchmarks Act are not permanent and cannot be guaranteed after the end of 2022 (and for JPY the FCA has confirmed that Art23A LIBOR will no longer be available after the end of 2022). This framework and its lack of permanence may expose NatWest Group, its customers and the financial services industry more widely to various risks, including: (i) the FCA further restricting use of Art23A LIBOR resulting in proactive transition of contracts; and (ii) mis-matches between positions in cleared derivatives and the exposures they are hedging where those exposures are permitted to make use of Art23A LIBOR, as the FCA has chosen not to permit the use of Art23A LIBOR for cleared derivatives. Although the formal cessation date for the remaining USD LIBOR tenors (as currently determined) is not until the end of June 2023, US and UK regulators have been clear that this is only to support the rundown of back book USD LIBOR exposures, and that no new contracts should reference these USD LIBOR tenors after 31 December 2021, other than in a very limited range of circumstances. Natwest Group will continue to have ongoing exposure to the remaining USD LIBOR tenors until they cease at the end of June 2023.\n\nNatwest Group had significant exposures to IBORs and has actively sought to transition away from these during 2021 in accordance with regulatory expectations and milestones. Transition measures have included the pro-active development of new products on using alternative rates, primarily but not exclusively RFRs rather than LIBOR, proactively restructuring existing LIBOR exposures so that they cease to reference LIBOR and instead reference alternative rates, and embedding language into contracts that allows for the automatic conversion to alternative rates when LIBOR ceases to be available. The main Central Counterparty Clearing houses (CCPs) conducted mass conversion exercises in December 2021 covering GBP, JPY, CHF and EUR LIBOR cleared derivatives to fully transition all outstanding LIBOR exposure to the relevant RFR. Natwest Group entities, along with many of their major counterparties, have already adhered to the ISDA IBOR fall-backs supplement and protocol which establishes a clear, industry accepted, contractual process to manage the transition from IBORs to RFRs for non-cleared derivative products.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n426\n\nThese transition efforts have involved extensive engagement with customers, industry working groups and regulators to seek to deliver transition in a transparent and economically appropriate manner. Any economic impacts will be dependent on, amongst other things, the establishment of deep and liquid RFR markets, the establishment of clear and consistent market conventions for all replacement products, as well as counterparties' willingness to accept, and transition to, these conventions. Furthermore, certain IBOR obligations may not be able to be pro-actively changed which could, depending on any over-arching legislative transition frameworks, potentially result in fundamentally different economic outcomes than originally intended. The uncertainties around the manner of transition to RFRs, and the ongoing broader acceptance and use of RFRs across the market, expose NatWest Group, its clients and the financial services industry more widely to risks.\n\nExamples of these risks may include (i) legal (including litigation) risks relating to documentation for new and the majority of existing transactions (including, but not limited to, changes, lack of changes, unclear contractual provisions, and disputes in respect of these); (ii) financial risks from any changes in valuation of financial instruments linked to impacted IBORs that may impact NatWest Group's performance, including its cost of funds, and its risk management related financial models; (iii) pricing, interest rate or settlement risks such as changes to benchmark rates that could impact pricing, interest rate or settlement mechanisms in or on certain instruments; (iv) operational risks due to the requirement to adapt IT systems, trade reporting infrastructure and operational processes, as well as ensuring compliance with restrictions on new USD LIBOR usage after December 2021; (v) conduct and litigation risks arising from communication regarding the potential impact on customers, and engagement with customers during and after the transition period, or non-acceptance by customers of replacement rates; and (vi) different legislative provisions in different jurisdictions, for example, unlike certain US states and the EU, the UK has not provided a clear and robust safe harbour to protect against litigation and potential liability arising out of the switch to 'synthetic LIBOR'.\n\nNotwithstanding all efforts to date, until the transition away from LIBOR onto\n\nalternative rates has been fully completed and there is greater experience of how RFRs are adopted across different products and customer groups, it remains difficult to determine to what extent the changes will affect NatWest Group, or the costs of implementing any relevant remedial action. Uncertainty as to the nature and extent of such potential changes, the take up of alternative reference rates, or other reforms may adversely affect financial instruments originally referencing LIBOR as the benchmark. The implementation of any alternative RFRs may be impossible or impracticable under the existing terms of certain financial instruments and could have an adverse effect on the value of, return on, and trading market for, certain financial instruments and on NatWest Group's profitability.\n\nChanges in tax legislation or failure to generate future taxable profits may impact the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets recognised by NatWest Group.\n\nIn accordance with the accounting policies set out in 'Critical accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty ', NatWest Group has recognised deferred tax assets on losses available to relieve future profits from tax only to the extent it is probable that they will be recovered. The deferred tax assets are quantified on the basis of current tax legislation and accounting standards and are subject to change in respect of the future rates of tax or the rules for computing taxable profits and offsetting allowable losses.\n\nFailure to generate sufficient future taxable profits or further changes in tax legislation (including with respect to rates of tax) or accounting standards may reduce the recoverable amount of the recognised tax loss deferred tax assets, amounting to \u00a3899 million as at 31 December 2021. Changes to the treatment of certain deferred tax assets may impact NatWest Group's capital position. In addition, NatWest Group's interpretation or application of relevant tax laws may differ from those of the relevant tax authorities and provisions are made for potential tax liabilities that may arise on the basis of the amounts expected to be paid to tax authorities. The amounts ultimately paid may differ materially from the amounts provided depending on the ultimate resolution of such matters.\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## Material contracts\n\nThe company and its subsidiaries are party to various contracts in the ordinary course of business. Material contracts include the following:\n\n## B Share Acquisition and Contingent Capital Agreement\n\nOn 26 November 2009, the company and HM Treasury entered into the Acquisition and Contingent Capital Agreement pursuant to which HM Treasury subscribed for the initial B shares and the Dividend Access Share (the Acquisitions) and agreed the terms of HM Treasury's contingent subscription (the Contingent Subscription) for an additional \u00a38 billion in aggregate in the form of further B shares (the Contingent B shares), to be issued on the same terms as the initial B shares. The Acquisitions were subject to the satisfaction of various conditions, including the company having obtained the approval of its shareholders in relation to the Acquisitions.\n\nOn 16 December 2013, the company announced that, having received approval from the PRA, it had terminated the \u00a38 billion Contingent Subscription. The company was able to cancel the Contingent Subscription as a result of the actions announced in the second half of 2013 to further strengthen its capital position.\n\nOn 9 October 2015, the company announced that on 8 October 2015, it had received a valid conversion notice from HM Treasury in respect of all outstanding B shares held by HM Treasury. The new ordinary shares issued on conversion of the B shares were admitted to the official list of the UK Listing Authority (UKLA), and to trading on the London Stock Exchange plc, on 14 October 2015. Following such conversion, HM Treasury no longer holds any B shares.\n\nThe company gave certain representations and warranties to HM Treasury on the date of the Acquisition and Contingent Capital Agreement, on the date the circular was posted to shareholders, on the first date on which all of the conditions precedent were satisfied, or waived, and on the date of the Acquisitions. The company also agreed to a number of undertakings.\n\nThe company agreed to reimburse HM Treasury for its expenses incurred in connection with the Acquisitions.\n\nFor as long as it is a substantial shareholder of the company (within the meaning of the UKLA's Listing Rules), HM Treasury has undertaken not to vote on related party transaction resolutions at general meetings and to direct that its affiliates do not so vote.\n\nN\n\nNaattWWeesstt  GGrroouupp\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n427\n\n## Directed Buyback Contract\n\nOn 7 February 2019, the company and HM Treasury entered into the Directed Buyback Contract to help facilitate the return of the company to full private ownership through the use of any excess capital to buy back the company's ordinary shares held by HM Treasury.\n\nUnder the terms of the Directed Buyback Contract, the company may agree with HM Treasury to make off-market purchases from time to time of its ordinary shares held by HM Treasury, including by way of one or more standalone purchases, through a nondiscretionary, broker-managed directed trading programme, or in conjunction with any offer or sale by HM Treasury by way of an institutional placing. Neither the company nor HM Treasury would be under an obligation to agree to make such off-market purchases and would only do so subject to regulatory approval at the time.\n\nThe aggregate number of ordinary shares which the company may purchase from HM Treasury under the Directed Buyback Contract will not exceed 4.99%. of the company's issued share capital and the aggregate consideration to be paid will not exceed 4.99%. of the company's market capitalisation. The price to be paid for each ordinary share will be the market price at the time of purchase or, if the directed buyback is in conjunction with an institutional placing, the placing price.\n\n## Framework and State Aid Deed\n\nAs a result of the State Aid granted to the company, it was required to work with HM Treasury to submit a State Aid restructuring plan to the European Commission (EC), which was then approved by the EC under the State Aid rules on 14 December 2009. The company agreed a series of measures which supplemented the measures in the company's strategic plan.\n\nThe company entered into a State Aid Commitment Deed with HM Treasury at the time of the initial EC decision and, following the EC's approval of amendments to the restructuring plan in April 2014, the company entered into a revised State Aid Commitment Deed with HM Treasury. In September 2017, the revised State Aid Commitment Deed was amended by a Deed of Variation (as so amended, the 'Revised State Aid Commitment Deed') following the EC's approval of an alternative remedies package (the 'Alternative Remedies Package') to replace the company's final outstanding commitment under its State Aid obligations (to divest the business previously known as Williams & Glyn).\n\nOn 25 April 2018, the Revised State Aid Commitment Deed was replaced by the Framework and State Aid Deed between the company, HM Treasury and an independent body established to facilitate and oversee the delivery of the Alternative Remedies Package (the 'Independent Body'). Under the Framework and State Aid Deed, the company agrees to do all acts and things necessary to ensure that HM Treasury is able to comply with its obligations under any EC decision approving State Aid to the company, including under the Alternative Remedies Package.\n\nPursuant to the Framework and State Aid Deed, the company has committed: (i) \u00a3425 million into a fund for eligible bodies in the UK banking and financial technology sectors to develop and improve their capability to compete with the company in the provision of banking services to small and medium-sized enterprises ('SMEs') and develop and improve the financial products and services available to SMEs (the 'Capability and Innovation Fund'); and (ii) \u00a3275 million to eligible bodies to help them incentivise SME banking customers within the division of the company previously known as Williams & Glyn to switch their business current accounts and loans to the eligible bodies (the 'Incentivised Switching Scheme'). The company has also agreed to set aside up to a further \u00a375 million in funding to cover certain costs customers may incur as a result of switching under the Incentivised Switching Scheme. In addition, under the terms of the Alternative Remedies Package, should the uptake within the Incentivised Switching Scheme not be sufficient, the company may be required to make a further contribution, capped at \u00a350 million. The Independent Body will distribute funds from the Capability and Innovation Fund and implement the Incentivised Switching Scheme.\n\nUnder the Framework and State Aid Deed, the company also agreed to indemnify the Independent Body and HM Treasury, up to an amount of \u00a3320 million collectively to cover liabilities that may be incurred in implementing the Alternative Remedies Package. The provisions of the indemnity to the Independent Body are set out in the Framework and State Aid Deed and the provisions of the indemnity to HM Treasury are set out in a separate agreement between the company and HM Treasury, described under ' Deed of Indemnity ' below.\n\nFinancial statements",

The Relationship Deed covers the three independence provisions mandated by the Listing Rules: (i) that contracts between the company and HM Treasury (or any of its subsidiaries) will be arm's length and normal commercial arrangements, (ii) that neither HM Treasury nor any of its associates will take any action that would have the effect of preventing the company from complying with its obligations under the Listing Rules; and (iii) neither HM Treasury nor any of its associates will propose or procure the proposal of a shareholder resolution which is intended or appears to be intended to circumvent the proper application of the Listing Rules.\n\n## Memorandum of Understanding Relating to The Royal Bank of Scotland Group Pension Fund\n\nOn 16 April 2018 the company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the 'MoU') with the trustee of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group Pension Fund (the 'Group Fund'), which aimed to facilitate both the necessary changes to the Main Section of the Group Fund to align the employing entity structure with the requirements of the UK ring-fencing legislation and acceleration of the settlement framework for the 31 December 2017 triennial valuation of the Main Section of the Group Fund (brought forward from 31 December 2018).\n\nIn addition, the MoU also provided clarity on the additional related funding contributions required to be made by the company to the Main Section of the Group Fund as follows: (i) a pre-tax payment of \u00a32 billion that was made in the second half of 2018 and (ii) from 1 January 2020, further pre-tax contributions of up to \u00a31.5 billion in aggregate linked to the making of future distributions to RBS shareholders including ordinary and special dividends and/or share buy backs (subject to an annual cap on contributions of \u00a3500 million before tax).\n\nOn 28 September 2018, the implementation of the MoU was documented through a Framework Agreement entered into between the company and the trustee of the Group Fund .\n\nStrategic report\n\nFinancial review\n\nGovernance\n\nRisk and capital management\n\nFinancial statements\n\nAdditional information\n\n## 429 Additional information\n\n- 430 Financial calendar\n- 430 Shareholder enquiries\n- 431 Analysis of ordinary shareholders\n- 431 Important addresses\n- 432 Principal offices\n- 433 Forward-looking statements\n- 434 Presentation of information\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, this document includes forward-looking statements relating, but not limited to: the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on NatWest Group; planned cost reductions, disposal losses and strategic costs; implementation of NatWest Group's purpose-led strategy and other strategic priorities (including in relation to: its phased withdrawal from ROI, the NWM Refocusing and investment programmes relating to digital transformation of its operations and services and inorganic opportunities); the timing and outcome of litigation and government and regulatory investigations; direct and on-market buy-backs; funding plans and credit risk profile; managing its capital position; liquidity ratio; portfolios; net interest margin and drivers related thereto; lending and income growth, product share and growth in target segments; impairments and write-downs, including with respect to goodwill; restructuring and remediation costs and charges; NatWest Group's exposure to political risk, economic assumptions and risk, climate, environmental and sustainability risk, operational risk, conduct risk, financial crime risk, cyber, data and IT risk and credit rating risk and to various types of market risk, including interest rate risk, foreign exchange rate risk and commodity and equity price risk; customer experience, including our Net Promotor Score (NPS); employee engagement and gender balance in leadership positions.\n\n## L Liimmiittaattiioonnss  iinnhheerreenntt  ttoo  ffoorrwwaarrdd--llooookkiinngg  ssttaatteemmeennttss\n\nThese statements are based on current plans, expectations, estimates, targets and projections, and are subject to significant inherent risks, uncertainties and other factors, both external and relating to NatWest Group's strategy or operations, which may result in NatWest Group being unable to achieve the current plans, expectations, estimates, targets, projections and other anticipated outcomes expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. In addition, certain of these disclosures are dependent on choices relying on key model characteristics and assumptions and are subject to various limitations, including assumptions and estimates made by management. By their nature, certain of these disclosures are only estimates and, as a result, actual future results, gains or losses could differ materially from those that have been estimated. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on these statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this document speak only as of the date we make them and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, or otherwise, except to the extent legally required.\n\n## I Immppoorrttaanntt  ffaaccttoorrss  tthhaatt  ccoouulldd  aaffffeecctt  tthhee  aaccttuuaall  oouuttccoommee  ooff  tthhee  ffoorrwwaarrdd--llooookkiinngg  ssttaatteemmeennttss\n\nWe caution you that a large number of important factors could adversely affect our results or our ability to implement our strategy, cause us to fail to meet our targets, predictions, expectations and other anticipated outcomes or affect the accuracy of forward-looking statements described in this document. These factors include, but are not limited to, those set forth in the risk factors and the other uncertainties described in NatWest Group plc's Annual Report on Form 20-F and its other filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The principal risks and uncertainties that could adversely NatWest Group's future results, its financial condition and prospects and cause them to be materially different from what is forecast or expected, include, but are not limited to: economic and political risk (including in respect of: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on NatWest Group and its customers; political and economic risks and uncertainty in the UK and global markets; uncertainty regarding the effects of Brexit; changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; and HM Treasury's ownership of NatWest Group plc); strategic risk (including in respect of the implementation of NatWest Group's purpose-led Strategy; refocusing of its NWM franchise; and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on NatWest Group's strategic objectives and targets); financial resilience risk (including in respect of: NatWest Group's ability to meet targets and to make discretionary capital distributions; the competitive environment; impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the credit quality of NatWest Group's counterparties; counterparty and borrower risk; prudential regulatory requirements for capital and MREL; the adequacy of NatWest Group's resolution plans; liquidity and funding risks; changes in the credit ratings; the requirements of regulatory stress tests; goodwill impairment; model risk; sensitivity to accounting policies, judgments, assumptions and estimates; changes in applicable accounting standards; the value or effectiveness of credit protection; and the application of UK statutory stabilisation or resolution powers); climate and sustainability risk (including in respect of: risks relating to climate change and the transitioning to a net zero economy; the implementation of NatWest Group's climate change strategy and climate change resilient systems, controls and procedures; climate-related data and model risk; the failure to adapt to emerging climate, environmental and sustainability risks and opportunities; changes in ESG ratings; increasing levels of climate, environmental and sustainability related regulation and oversight; and climate, environmental and sustainability-related litigation, enforcement proceedings and investigations); operational and IT resilience risk (including in respect of: operational risks (including reliance on third party suppliers); cyberattacks; the accuracy and effective use of data; complex IT systems (including those that enable remote working); attracting, retaining and developing senior management and skilled personnel; NatWest Group's risk management framework; and reputational risk); and legal, regulatory and conduct risk (including in respect of: the impact of substantial regulation and oversight; compliance with regulatory requirements; the outcome of legal, regulatory and governmental actions and investigations; the transition of LIBOR other IBOR rates to alternative risk-free rates; and changes in tax legislation or failure to generate future taxable profits).\n\n## C Caauuttiioonn  aabboouutt  cclliimmaattee  aanndd  ssuussttaaiinnaabbllee  ffuunnddiinngg  aanndd  ffiinnaanncciinngg  ((CCSSFFFF))  iinnffoorrmmaattiioonn..\n\nClimate and ESG disclosures in this report use a greater number and level of judgments, assumptions and estimates, including with respect to the classification of climate and sustainable funding and financing activities, than our reporting of historical financial information. These judgments, assumptions and estimates are highly likely to change over time, and, when coupled with the longer time frames used in these disclosures, make any assessment of materiality inherently uncertain. In addition, our climate risk analysis and net zero strategy remain under development, and the data underlying our analysis and strategy remain subject to evolution over time. As a result, we expect that certain climate and ESG disclosures made in this report are likely to be amended, updated, recalculated or restated in the future.
