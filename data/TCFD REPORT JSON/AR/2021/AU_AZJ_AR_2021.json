Operating costs also reduced in line with lower volumes and reduced maintenance spend.\n- \u203a Bulk - strong financial performance continues with full-year benefit of recent contract wins and ongoing operational e/fficiency improvements. Bulk now accounts for 32% of above rail revenue 1 and 26% of above rail EBIT.\n- \u203a Coal - decline in EBITDA driven by 6% lower volumes, lower revenue quality and non-pass through of Take-or-Pay. Operating costs excluding access 4% lower with a reduction in fuel, traincrew and maintenance costs.\n- \u203a Three debt market capital issuances representing $1.075bn with terms from 7.0-years to 10.5-years (and coupons of 2.9% to 3.3%) including an inaugural issuance for Aurizon Operations - 7.0-year A$500.0m Medium Term Note at a coupon of 3.0%.\n\n## Outlook\n\nUnderlying EBITDA guidance for FY2022 of $1,425m to $1,500m and sustaining capital expenditure of $475m to $525m. Key assumptions:\n\n- \u203a Coal - ~5% volume growth and lower costs o/ffset by lower contracted rates.\n- \u203a Bulk - revenue growth from full year impact of recent contract wins and port acquisitions.\n- \u203a Network - non-recurrence of retrospective WIRP fees ($49.8m) and Maximum Allowance Revenue (MAR) reduction due to capital recoveries.\n- \u203a No material disruptions to commodity supply chains (such as adverse weather and/or impacts from COVID-19 related restrictions).",

        "page_content": "## Chairman's Report\n\n## A message from the Chairman\n\nDear fellow shareholders\n\nDespite another very challenging year for the Australian economy and our communities, I am pleased to report that a resilient Aurizon business has delivered a solid performance for shareholders in FY2021.\n\nAurizon delivered Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) of $903m in FY2021, which was within our guidance range of $870 - $910m. In FY2021, Aurizon also generated free cash flow of $734m. In a year where our above rail and network volumes were lower, these results highlight the strength and resilience of our business, with stable and consistent cash flows enabling Aurizon to increase dividends and undertake another share buyback.\n\nAurizon has decided to pay out 100% of Underlying Net Profit After Tax as dividends. The Board has declared a final dividend of 14.4 cents per share, 70% franked. This will take total dividends in respect of FY2021 to 28.8 cents per share, 70% franked, an increase of 5% from FY2020. With the completion of the $300m share buyback in FY2021, distributions to shareholders have totalled more than $4 billion over the past six years.\n\nAurizon continued to make good progress on key priorities during FY2021, including:\n\n- \u203a Continuing the successful execution of the Bulk business turnaround, with multiple paths for growth in volumes, revenue, EBITDA and EBIT. This includes the acquisitions of port and logistics businesses in Townsville (in FY2020) and Newcastle (FY2021) under the banner of Aurizon Port Services. Bulk now accounts for 32% of above rail revenue. We see a rebalancing of our portfolio in coming years as Bulk taps into the rapidly-expanding demand for Australian commodities as inputs for batteries, electric vehicles, telecommunications, solar panels and wind turbines; for urban and transport infrastructure; and high-quality Australian agricultural products, food and fertiliser.\n\n- \u203a In October 2020, Aurizon released its Climate Strategy and Action Plan. This includes a target of net-zero operational emissions (scope 1 and 2) by 2050; a $50m investment over 10 years in low-carbon technologies for our locomotive fleet; and, the use of more renewable energy for our electrified rail network. Work has started on a project to develop battery-powered heavy-haul locomotives, and Aurizon is also assessing the longer-term opportunity for hydrogen-powered freight trains.\n- \u203a The $205m sale of the Acacia Ridge Terminal in Queensland was completed in March 2021, following the High Court's dismissal of an application for special leave to appeal by the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission. This sale finalises Aurizon's staged exit from the loss-making Intermodal business that was commenced in 2017.\n- \u203a The Queensland Court of Appeal dismissed the customers' appeal on the payment of fees for the Wiggins Island Rail Project. This resulted in $60m of fees being recognised by Aurizon in FY2021 (including retrospective payments for the period FY2016-FY2020), and ongoing annual fees of ~$11m payable until 2035.\n\nAurizon continues to refine our business strategy in response to the changing external environment and based on detailed market analysis. Our strategic aim is to ensure Aurizon's core business is highly e/fficient and resilient in this changing market environment, while positioning to seize the higher-growth opportunities that are emerging for Aurizon Bulk.\n\nAurizon Bulk provides integrated supply chain services, including rail and road transportation, port services and material handling for a range of mining, metal, industrial and agricultural customers throughout Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia. We are also well-positioned in markets serving the global uptake of electric vehicles, telecommunications and renewable energy infrastructure that is driving demand for Australian resources such as cobalt, copper and lithium.\n\nWe are actively seeking further opportunities to grow our Bulk portfolio. This builds on the work in recent years to simplify our business and exit the non-profitable parts, so we can focus our core capabilities on delivering for customers. Transformation, productivity initiatives and continuing cost reduction in all of our businesses will also remain key drivers for Aurizon's financial and operational performance. Our teams are finding safer, simpler and more innovative solutions for our customers, particularly as we leverage the latest in information and operational technology.\n\nSafety is a value for Aurizon. This year, the Board requested a specific Board Safety Strategy Day to review with management a refined Safety Strategy. The objective is to support continuous improvement of safety.\n\nDuring FY2021 our Company Secretary, Dominic Smith, left Aurizon. Dominic worked with the Company through the ASX listing process in 2010 and has been the Company Secretary since that time. On behalf of the Board I would like to thank Dominic for his outstanding service and guidance and wish him well for the future.\n\nIn his report on the following page, our Managing Director & CEO Andrew Harding provides some detail on how we are supporting the nation's e/fforts in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the ongoing operation of freight supply chains that are vital for our communities, farmers, manufacturers and the resource sector. The Board acknowledges the work of Andrew and our leadership team in guiding Aurizon's response during the pandemic and the outstanding commitment of our teams in serving customers during these di/fficult times.\n\nFinally, I acknowledge the continued support of our shareholders. We have built solid foundations for our Company and are wellpositioned in existing and emerging markets for continued success. With a resilient business, a strong balance sheet and good cash flows, we look forward to continuing to reward you on your investment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTim Poole\n\nChairman\n\n9 August 2021",

        "page_content": "## Managing Director & CEO's Report\n\n## A message from the Managing Director & CEO\n\nDear fellow shareholders\n\nI begin my report to you on our business results by addressing operational safety performance and employee health and wellbeing during FY2021.\n\nWith the rapidly changing COVID-19 situation in Australia, Aurizon has maintained constant vigilance across our national footprint to protect the health of our employees together with the customers we serve in our freight supply chains. As an essential service, we have been fortunate to continue operating services throughout COVID-19 and have implemented additional health and hygiene protocols in our operations. We understand the responsibility that comes with continued operation, and the important role we play in delivering freight across Australia, as well as for export industries in the resource, manufacturing and agriculture sectors.\n\nWe have responded to the community COVID-19 outbreaks that have occurred, including imposing restrictions on non-essential travel and increasing preventative measures in workplaces, aligned with government advice. We have promoted flexible and remote working where it is possible and enhanced our IT and technical support to boost productivity and connectivity for employees. We are also fortunate that the vast majority of train services do not cross interstate borders and more than 80% of our employees live and work in regional communities of Australia which generally have been less impacted by COVID-19. Aurizon is actively encouraging employees to get vaccinated to protect themselves, work colleagues, their families and local communities.\n\nTurning now to operational safety performance. Our results have been flat across the safety metrics of Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR), Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) and Rail Process Safety (RPS).\n\nTRFIR has deteriorated 3% in comparison with last year's improvement of 10%. This deterioration has been the result of an increase in low-severity strain and sprain injuries. LTIFR has improved 8% year-on-year, which is a positive trend.\n\nRPS, a measure designed by Aurizon to improve rail safety operations, including derailments, signals passed at danger and rollingstock collisions, has been flat in recent years. RPS deteriorated 8% in FY2021. This has been caused by an increase in low severity yard derailments.\n\nDuring the year we continued the Safety Leadership program that equips operational leaders with skills to e/ffectively lead our Safety Strategy and continually improve safety in their team. We are also focussing on initiatives to accelerate safety improvement through targeting the main contributors to TRIFR and RPS, and a specific focus on identifying and learning from events that have the potential for Serious Injury and Fatality.\n\nIn respect to the operational and financial performance, the Company has performed well despite the economic uncertainty and social disruption of COVID-19 for our industry and the economy.\n\nThe Bulk business has delivered another strong result in FY2021, with EBIT increasing 25% to $112m. Revenue has been driven higher with new contracts and growth with existing customers, together with extended services such as the acquisition of the ConPorts business at the Port of Newcastle. After year's end, in August 2021, we were pleased to announce a longterm rail haulage and maintenance agreement with CBH in Western Australia covering all rail requirements for CBH's Western Australian grain harvests. This contract underlines the capability and the potential opportunity for our Bulk business in providing integrated supply chain services for a range of mining, metal, industrial and agricultural customers across a national footprint. This opportunity not only includes traditional products such as iron ore, bauxite, alumina, base metals, grains and fertiliser but also the inputs for rapidly expanding markets for batteries, telecommunications and electric vehicles.\n\nAbove rail coal tonnages were down 6% in FY2021 against the prior period primarily as a result of COVID-19 and China import restrictions. Consequently, EBIT for Coal was down 21% to $325m, compared to FY2020. We expect to see haulage volumes to grow by around ~5% in FY2022. During FY2021, the Coal business was successful in extending its long-term contract book with a number of contract wins, including Anglo American (renewed contract for Dawson and securing additional tonnages from the Moranbah North, Grosvenor and German Creek mines, commencing early 2022) and Glencore (renewed contract as primary hauler for Newlands, Blackwater and Goonyella, excluding Hail Creek).\n\nThe Network business had another solid EBIT result in FY2021 of $509m, a 9% increase on the prior period, despite an 8% decrease in volumes. During FY2021, we were successful in recovering outstanding fees of $60m (including retrospective payments) for the Wiggins Island Rail Project.\n\nAs well as delivering products and commodities, Aurizon is committed to supporting the communities in which our employees live and work. Since 2011, we have supported more than 430 community groups through our Community Giving Fund. In FY2021, we provided grants to 46 charities and community organisations in the areas of health and wellbeing, community safety, environment and education.\n\nDuring the year, we extended our reach into the community with two major partnerships. The first is a three-year partnership with Orange Sky Australia, which o/ffers free laundry and shower services for people experiencing homelessness while providing a safe environment to connect with the community. As well as financial support, Aurizon employees are volunteering, individually and in teams, to support Orange Sky services across Australia.\n\nAurizon also became the new Principal Partner of the Queensland Firebirds who compete in the national Super Netball competition. Aurizon is committed to building a more inclusive, diverse team across our national operations and having a pipeline of young women leaders to support our future success. We see great alignment with the Firebirds in their championing of success and excellence in sport, with an ever-growing participation of young women in netball.\n\nDuring FY2021, we had some changes to our senior leadership team. I would like to acknowledge the outstanding contribution of Group Executive Technical Services & Planning (TSP), Michael Carter who announced his retirement. Mike has been with the Company for 35 years and is highly regarded in the Australian rail industry. As a result of Mike leaving, we took the opportunity to streamline the Corporate and TSP areas under one executive and were pleased to appoint internal candidate Gareth Long as Group Executive Corporate.\n\nFinally, my thanks go to our employees across our national footprint who are at the heart of the continuing success of our Company. They have shown dedication and discipline in carrying out their jobs during a very challenging period for the Australian community. This has been the foundation for continued safe, reliable service delivery for our customers and in looking after the health and wellbeing of themselves and work colleagues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAndrew Harding\n\nManaging Director & CEO 9 August 2021",

Aurizon Board members possess skills and experience from a range of sectors such as transport and logistics, mining, finance, strategy, technology, government relations, safety, health, and environment, among others. As such, the Board is well-equipped to consider a range of sustainability-related issues. The Board provides oversight and strategic direction to sustainability and has ultimate responsibility for the Company's consideration of climate-related risk. It is guided by the Audit, Governance and Risk Management Committee and Safety, Health and Environment Committee as part of Aurizon's risk framework and broader corporate strategy and planning.\n\nAurizon understands that climate change is one of the key interests to stakeholders. Aurizon accepts the scientific consensus on climate change and supports the objective of finding a pathway to limit global warming to less than 2\u00b0C, aligned to the Paris Agreement. It also acknowledges the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5\u00b0C above preindustrial levels.\n\nDuring FY2021, Aurizon published its first Climate Strategy and Action Plan (CSAP). The CSAP establishes a target of net-zero operational emissions (scope 1 and 2) by 2050 and provides a foundation for Aurizon's longterm approach to climate change, underpinned by strategies and associated actions to mitigate climate risk and take advantage of climaterelated opportunities. The CSAP is built on three key pillars:\n\n- 1. Manage risk and build resilience.\n- 2.  Deliver decarbonisation.\n- 3.  Create carbon abatement opportunities.\n\nFollowing the launch of the CSAP, Aurizon has progressed laying the foundations for its climate resilience and decarbonisation roadmap. This has involved establishing a cross-functional CSAP Steering Committee, responsible for guiding the implementation of the CSAP and aligning initiatives under the three key pillars.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2020 Aurizon achieved a 20% emissions intensity reduction across its locomotive operations. To support its longterm goal of net-zero operational emissions by 2050, Aurizon is targeting a further 10% emissions intensity reduction across its entire operational portfolio by 2030 2 . This approach places an emphasis on direct abatement through supporting the development and adoption of low-carbon technology across Aurizon's operations and Australia's freight sector. Performance against the 2030 target will be reported annually via Aurizon's Sustainability Report.\n\nAurizon also continues to adopt the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's (FSB) Final Report: Recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), when considering climaterelated risks (see pages 46 and 47 of this Annual Report). Although Aurizon's business is exposed to transition and physical risks, it is also well positioned to take advantage of climate-related opportunities.\n\nClimate change risk is incorporated into Aurizon's Enterprise Risk Management Framework & Appetite and is therefore specifically considered when making investment decisions. The internal management process governing investment decisions, the Aurizon Investment Standard, has also been updated to ensure management considers climate change risk and carbon pricing on a materiality basis in decisions to recommend investment of capital.\n\nScenario analysis is conducted under the Strategy in Uncertainty framework, which takes climate-related transition risks into consideration. The Board is directly engaged in identifying the scenarios for consideration under this framework, as well as developing plans and initiatives to position the organisation to mitigate risks and take advantage of opportunities. This strategic process is repeated periodically to ensure that strategic priorities are continually updated to proactively respond to emerging market dynamics and opportunities. The key drivers used in scenario analysis are outlined in Aurizon's annual Sustainability Report.\n\nFor further information, refer to Aurizon's CSAP and Sustainability Report, available on the Aurizon website aurizon.com.au/sustainability .\n\n## Environmental regulation and performance\n\nAurizon is committed to managing its operational activities and services in an environmentally responsible manner to meet legal, social and moral obligations. To deliver on this commitment, Aurizon seeks to comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.\n\nIn 2019, the NSW government introduced legislation requiring Rolling Stock Operators (RSOs) to apply for an Environment Protection Licence (EPL). The mandatory EPLs were finalised in August 2020, and their requirements are being steadily integrated into operations. The NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA) administer the EPLs. The EPA's key areas of concern are diesel emissions and rail noise, and initial thresholds for both were set as conditions of the EPLs. The EPA has recognised past e/fforts of RSOs, led by Aurizon, to develop the 2018 Rail Industry Safety and Standards Board's Code of Practice - Management of Locomotive Exhaust Emissions.\n\nThe NSW EPLs stipulate a range of annual testing, monitoring and remedial regimes for both locomotives and wagons to meet noise thresholds, along with progressive improvements to address current rail noise generated through horns, braking and idling. These measures are available to the public and are used to validate the EPA's commitment to reducing complaints. Aurizon recently submitted its first Annual Rolling Stock Performance Report to the EPA, confirming all locomotives that had major engine overhauls in 2020 were compliant with required noise thresholds, and that all Aurizon freight wagons in operation comply with specifications for Angle of Attack (a key contributor to wheel squeal).\n\nThe National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 200 7 (NGER) (Cth) requires the Group to report its annual greenhouse gas emissions and energy use. The Group has implemented systems and processes for the collection and calculation of the data required and is registered under the NGER Act.\n\nAt the close of the fourth Emissions Reduction Fund Safeguard Mechanism (Safeguard) compliance period (ended on 30 June 2020), three of Aurizon's NGER facilities were captured. Through e/ffective management of the Company's emissions, Aurizon remained below its respective baselines and achieved full compliance with the Safeguard. Following amendments to the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Safeguard Mechanism) Rule 2015 in 2019, Aurizon is well positioned for a timely transition of its remaining reported baselines over the coming reporting period.\n\nFurther details of the Company's climate and environmental performance will be published in Aurizon's forthcoming Sustainability Report which will be published in October 2021.",

No Director or o/fficer of the Company has received benefits under an indemnity from the Company during or since the end of the year.\n\nThe Company has paid a premium for insurance for o/fficers of the Group. This insurance is against a liability for costs and expenses incurred by o/fficers in defending civil or criminal proceedings involving them as such o/fficers, with some exceptions. The contract of insurance prohibits disclosure of the nature of the liability insured against and the amount of the premium paid.\n\n## Proceedings against the Company\n\nThe Directors are not aware of any current civil litigation proceedings, arbitration proceedings, administration appeals, or criminal or governmental prosecutions of a material nature which are not set out in this report or note 31 of the Financial Report in which Aurizon Holdings is directly or indirectly concerned which are likely to have a material adverse e/ffect on the business or financial position of the Company.\n\n## Remuneration Report\n\nThe Remuneration Report is set out on pages 26 to 40 and forms part of the Directors' Report for the financial year ended 30 June 2021.\n\n## Rounding of amounts\n\nThe amounts contained in this report and in the financial statements have been rounded to the nearest $100,000 unless otherwise stated (where rounding is applicable) in accordance with ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191 . The Company is an entity to which the instrument applies.\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nDuring the year, the Company's auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), performed other services in addition to its audit responsibilities.\n\nThe Directors are satisfied that the provision of non-audit services by PwC during the reporting period did not compromise the auditor independence requirements set out in the Corporations Act 2001 .\n\nAll non-audit services were subject to the Company's Non-Audit Services Policy and do not undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence set out in APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants as they did not involve reviewing or auditing the auditor's own work, acting in a management or decision-making capacity for the Company, or jointly sharing risks and rewards.\n\nNo o/fficer of the Company was a former Partner or Director of PwC and a copy of the auditor's independence declaration as required under the Corporations Act 2001 is set out in, and forms part of, this Directors' Report.\n\nDetails of the amounts paid to the auditor of the Company and its related practices for non-audit services provided throughout the year are as set out below:\n\n|                                                   | 2021  $'000   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| OTHER ASSURANCE SERVICES                          |               |\n| Total remuneration for   other assurance services | 60            |\n| OTHER SERVICES                                    |               |\n| Total remuneration   for other services           | 80            |\n\n## External audit services\n\nPwC have been the Company's external auditor since December 2010.\n\nFollowing completion of a tender process, the Company intends to recommend the appointment of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (Deloitte) as the Company's external auditor commencing for the year ending 30 June 2022, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.\n\nMs Lewis, Chair of the Audit, Governance & Risk Management Committee, is a former partner of Deloitte, having retired in March 2014. She has no ongoing financial arrangements with Deloitte.\n\n## Auditor's Independence Declaration\n\nA copy of the Auditor's Independence Declaration, as required under section 307C of the Corporations Act 2001, is set out on page 41.

The increase in Network and Bulk more than o/ffset the decline in Coal EBITDA which was principally due to a 6% decrease in volumes and a 2% decrease in above rail revenue per NTK. The improvement in Other EBITDA is principally due to asset sales and lower project costs.\n\nThe increase in Network and Bulk revenue, combined with the reduction in net central costs (Other), more than o/ffset lower revenue in Coal.\n\nOperating costs decreased $59.9m or 4% with reductions in all Business Units due to transformation benefits and lower fuel and access costs more than o/ffsetting an increase in labour costs.\n\nDepreciation increased $20.5m or 4% primarily due to capital expenditure in Bulk to support growth and increased ballast and rail renewals in Network. With the increase in depreciation, EBIT declined $5.9m or 1%.\n\nROIC was 0.2ppts lower with the decreased EBIT and slightly higher invested capital.\n\n## Reconciliation to statutory earnings\n\nUnderlying earnings is a non-statutory measure and is the primary reporting measure used by management and the Group's chief operating decisionmaking bodies for managing and assessing the financial performance of the business. Underlying earnings is derived by adjusting statutory earnings for significant items as noted in the following table:\n\n| ($M)                                                     | FY2021   | FY2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Continuing operations                                    |          |          |\n| Underlying EBITDA                                        | 1,482.2  | 1,467.6  |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                            | 579.1    | 558.6    |\n| Underlying EBIT                                          | 903.1    | 909.0    |\n| Significant items                                        | 8.2      | 105.4    |\n| Net gain on sale of shares in Aquila                     | 8.2      | -        |\n| Net gain on sale of Rail Grinding business               | -        | 105.4    |\n| Statutory EBIT                                           | 911.3    | 1,014.4  |\n| Net finance costs                                        | (145.3)  | (148.5)  |\n| Statutory Profit before tax                              | 766.0    | 865.9    |\n| Income tax expense                                       | (159.3)  | (260.8)  |\n| Statutory NPAT - Continuing operations                   | 606.7    | 605.1    |\n| Significant items, net of tax                            | 5.7      | 73.8     |\n| Significant items - Aquila income tax benefit            | 67.8     | -        |\n| Underlying NPAT - Continuing operations                  | 533.2    | 531.3    |\n| Discontinued operations                                  |          |          |\n| Underlying EBIT                                          | 14.9     | 12.7     |\n| Significant items                                        | 161.1    | 2.5      |\n| Net gain on sale of Acacia Ridge Intermodal Terminal     | 161.1    | -        |\n| Intermodal closure benefit                               | -        | 2.5      |\n| Income tax expense                                       | (52.4)   | (4.4)    |\n| Statutory NPAT - Discontinued operations                 | 123.6    | 10.8     |\n| Significant items, net of tax                            | 112.8    | 1.8      |\n| Underlying NPAT - Discontinued operations                | 10.8     | 9.0      |\n| Statutory NPAT - Continuing and discontinued operations  | 730.3    | 615.9    |\n| Underlying NPAT - Continuing and discontinued operations | 544.0    | 540.3    |",

This was partly o/ffset by an increase in investments accounted for using the equity method of $23.4m due to the investment in Ox Mountain Limited.\n\nTotal current liabilities, excluding borrowings, decreased by $155.9m largely due to:\n\n- \u203a decrease in current tax liabilities of $83.4m, primarily due to tax associated with the sale of the Acacia Ridge Intermodal Terminal ($32.5m) and the Rail Grinding business ($38.7m)\n- \u203a decrease in trade and other payables of $53.9m due to a reduction in trade creditors\n- \u203a decrease in derivative financial instruments of $34.5m due to the settlement of interest rate swaps in June 2021.\n\nTotal borrowings increased by $130.8m due to the Company's strategy to increase leverage in the above rail business in order to create a more e/fficient balance sheet structure.\n\nOther non-current liabilities increased by $101.5m largely due to a $100.6m increase in net deferred tax liabilities.\n\nGearing (net debt/(net debt + equity)) was 45.6% as at 30 June 2021.",

In addition, FY2020 included $164.5m of proceeds from the sale of the Rail Grinding business.\n\nNet cash outflow from financing activities from continuing operations reduced by $101.6m (12%) to $770.3m due to an increase in net proceeds from borrowings of $25.0m and lower share buy-back expenditure of $97.6m, partly o/ffset by higher dividend payments of $15.0m.",

        "page_content": "## Funding\n\nThe Group continues to be committed to diversifying its debt investor base and increasing average debt tenor.\n\nDuring FY2021 Aurizon Network:\n\n- \u203a Issued a 10.0-year, $500.0 million A$ Medium Term Note (AMTN) in September 2020, at a coupon of 2.9%. The proceeds were used to repay a $525.0 million AMTN maturing in October 2020.\n- \u203a Cancelled $100.0 million from the existing $850.0 million bank debt bilateral facilities expiring in June 2023.\n- \u203a Issued a 10.5-year, $75.0m A$ Private Placement at a coupon of 3.3%.\n\nDuring FY2021, Aurizon Operations:\n\n- \u203a Added $175.0 million of bank debt to the existing $450.0m bilateral facilities expiring in 2023 and 2025\n- \u203a Issued a 7.0-year $500.0m AMTN in March 2021 at a coupon of 3.0%. This represented the debut capital markets issuance for Aurizon Finance (the financing entity for Aurizon Operations).\n\nIn respect of FY2021:\n\n- \u203a Weighted average debt maturity tenor was 4.4 years as at 30 June 2021. This was higher than FY2020 (3.8 years) due to replacing the existing AMTN expiring in October 2020 with the new 10.0-year AMTN, the issuance of a 10.5-year Private Placement in Network and the issuance of a 7.0-year AMTN in Operations, partly o/ffset by the debt portfolio's duration reducing by 12 months.\n- \u203a Group interest cost on drawn debt was 4.1% (FY2020 4.5%).\n- \u203a Available liquidity (undrawn facilities plus cash) as at 30 June 2021 was $1,618.2m.\n- \u203a Group gearing (net debt/(net debt + equity)) as at 30 June 2021 was 45.6% (FY2020 45.1%).\n- \u203a Aurizon Network's gearing (net debt/ Regulatory Asset Base (excluding Access Facilitation Deeds)) as at 30 June 2021 was 60.8% (FY2020 59.7%).\n- \u203a Aurizon Operations' gearing (net debt/(net debt + equity)) as at 30 June 2021 was 10.5% (FY2020 10.2%).\n- \u203a Aurizon Operations' and Aurizon Network's credit ratings have each been maintained at BBB+/Baa1.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe Board has declared a final dividend for FY2021 of 14.4cps (70% franked) based on a payout ratio of 100% in respect of underlying NPAT from continuing operations.\n\nThe relevant final dividend dates are:\n\n- \u203a 23 August 2021 - ex-dividend date\n- \u203a 24 August 2021 - record date\n- \u203a 22 September 2021 - payment date.\n\n## Share buy-back\n\nOn 10 August 2020, Aurizon announced its intention to undertake an on-market share buy-back of up to $300.0m during FY2021. During the year 73,938,850 shares at a total consideration of $300.0m were bought back and subsequently cancelled.\n\n## Tax\n\nUnderlying income tax expense from continuing operations was $224.6m and the statutory income tax expense was $159.3m due to a net income tax benefit of $65.3m recognised as a significant item as a result of the sale of the shares held in Aquila Resources Limited (Aquila). The net income tax benefit includes $67.8m relating to an unrecognised deferred tax asset associated with the impairment of the carrying amount of the shares held in Aquila in FY2016 partly o/ffset by the tax e/ffect of the net gain of sale of $2.5m. Statutory income tax expense for the Group (continuing and discontinued operations) was $211.7m. The Group underlying e/ffective tax rate 6 was 29.6% which is less than 30% due to the recognition of other previously unrecognised deferred tax assets and a prior year research and development tax incentive.\n\nThe Group underlying cash tax rate 7 was 19.3%, which is less than 30% primarily due to accelerated fixed asset related adjustments.\n\nThe underlying e/ffective tax rate for FY2022 is expected to be in the range of 29-31% and the underlying cash tax rate is expected to be less than 25% for the short to medium term.\n\nAurizon publishes additional tax information in accordance with the voluntary Tax Transparency Code in its Sustainability Report. See the Sustainability section of the Aurizon website for further detail.\n\n## Discontinued operations\n\nOn 26 March 2021, the Group completed the sale of the Acacia Ridge Intermodal Terminal to Pacific National.",

The coal transport operation connects mines in the Newlands, Goonyella, Blackwater, Moura and West Moreton systems in Queensland (QLD) and the Hunter Valley and Illawarra coal systems in New South Wales (NSW), with domestic customers and coal export terminals.\n\n## FINANCIAL SUMMARY\n\n| ($M)                          | FY2021   | FY2020   | VARIANCE   |\n|-------------------------------|----------|----------|------------|\n| Revenue                       |          |          |            |\n| Above Rail                    | 1,163.6  | 1,260.3  | (8%)       |\n| Track access                  | 445.1    | 512.8    | (13%)      |\n| Other                         | 3.4      | 2.2      | 55%        |\n| Total revenue                 | 1,612.1  | 1,775.3  | (9%)       |\n| Track access costs            | (451.0)  | (507.6)  | 11%        |\n| Operating costs               | (627.8)  | (651.3)  | 4%         |\n| EBITDA                        | 533.3    | 616.4    | (13%)      |\n| Depreciation and amortisation | (208.7)  | (205.8)  | (1%)       |\n| EBIT                          | 324.6    | 410.6    | (21%)      |\n\n## METRICS\n\n|                                                          | FY2021   | FY2020   | VARIANCE   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|------------|\n| Total tonnes hauled (m)                                  | 202.1    | 213.9    | (6%)       |\n| CQCN                                                     | 143.7    | 150.1    | (4%)       |\n| NSW & SEQ                                                | 58.4     | 63.8     | (8%)       |\n| Contract utilisation                                     | 83%      | 86%      | (3ppt)     |\n| Total NTK (bn)                                           | 47.1     | 50.0     | (6%)       |\n| CQCN                                                     | 35.8     | 37.8     | (5%)       |\n| NSW & SEQ                                                | 11.3     | 12.2     | (7%)       |\n| Average haul length (km)                                 | 233      | 234      | -          |\n| Total revenue/NTK ($/'000 NTK)                           | 34.2     | 35.5     | (4%)       |\n| Above Rail Revenue/NTK ($/'000 NTK)                      | 24.7     | 25.2     | (2%)       |\n| Operating ratio (%)                                      | 79.9%    | 76.9%    | (3.0ppt)   |\n| Opex/NTK ($/'000 NTK)                                    | 27.3     | 27.3     | -          |\n| Opex/NTK (excluding access costs) ($/'000 NTK)           | 17.8     | 1 7.1    | (4%)       |\n| Locomotive productivity ('000 NTK/Active locomotive day) | 390.5    | 405.5    | (4%)       |\n| Active locomotives (as at 30 June)                       | 329      | 332      | (1%)       |\n| Wagon productivity ('000 NTK/Active wagon day)           | 14.9     | 15.7     | (5%)       |\n| Active wagons (as at 30 June)                            | 8,723    | 8,721    | -          |\n| Payload (tonnes)                                         | 7,887    | 7,676    | 3%         |\n| Velocity (km/hr)                                         | 23.9     | 23.5     | 2%         |\n| Fuel consumption (l/d GTK)                               | 2.86     | 2.86     | -          |\n\n## Coal performance overview\n\nCoal EBITDA decreased $83.1m (13%) to $533.3m primarily due to a reduction in above rail and access revenue from lower volumes and a reduction in revenue quality. This was partly o/ffset by lower expenses primarily associated with lower access and fuel costs.\n\nVolumes decreased 11.8mt or 6% to 202.1mt with reductions in the Central Queensland Coal Network (CQCN), NSW and South-East Queensland (SEQ).\n\n- \u203a Across the CQCN, volumes decreased by 6.4mt (4%) to 143.7mt due to lower end-market demand impacted by COVID-19 and the challenging trade environment with China, end-of-contract impacts and customer-specific maintenance and production issues. This was partly o/ffset by increased railings for the new Peabody contract and small increases for a number of other mines\n- \u203a In NSW and SEQ, volumes decreased by 5.4mt (8%) to 58.4mt due to the ramp-down of the New Acland mine as it approaches end of mine life, customer maintenance and production issues and weather impacts. This was partly o/ffset by railings from the new BlueScope contract in the Illawarra.",

        "page_content": "Coal revenue decreased by $163.2m (9%) to $1,612.1m due to the 11.8mt reduction in volumes, lower revenue quality and lower fuel revenue resulting from a decrease in price. In addition, track access revenue decreased with the lower volumes, access rights being transferred to end users and tari/ff reductions partly o/ffset by higher Take-or-Pay revenue. Above rail revenue per NTK decreased by 2% due to reduced average rates per tonne including a reduced proportion of revenue from capacity charges.\n\nTotal operating costs decreased $80.1m (7%) to $1,078.8m with lower track access, fuel, traincrew and maintenance costs. The major drivers of these movements are:\n\n- \u203a Track access costs decreased by $56.6m (11%) due to the decrease in volumes, access rights being transferred to end users and tari/ff reductions partly o/ffset by higher Takeor-Pay expense.\n- \u203a Other operating costs decreased $23.5m (4%) due to lower fuel (largely price related), traincrew and maintenance costs. Traincrew costs reduced from lower overtime, FTEs and increased annual leave partly o/ffset by CPI impacts. Maintenance slightly reduced due to volume reductions and lower corrective maintenance partly o/ffset by CPI labour impacts.\n\nDepreciation increased $2.9m (1%) relating to the additional installed fleet and overhauls of existing rollingstock. Accordingly, EBIT decreased 21% compared to a 13% decrease in EBITDA.\n\nOperationally, key productivity metrics deteriorated with lower volumes and NTKs. However, average payloads and velocity have increased as a result of successful e/fficiency initiatives, including increasing train set lengths in the Hunter Valley and SEQ, implementing improved driver methodologies and a reduction in empty wagons on the CQCN.\n\n## Market update\n\nAustralia exported 363mt of coal in FY2021, down 7% against the prior year. Although import restrictions remain for Australian export volume into China, alternative markets continue to be found for Australian coal. For the June quarter, despite zero export volume to China, total Australian export volume was just 1% lower than the prior year.\n\nAustralia exported 171mt of metallurgical coal in FY2021, down 4% against the prior year. India remained Australia's largest metallurgical coal export market with record high export volume of 56mt (33% share), followed by Japan at 36mt (21% share) and South Korea at 20mt (12% share). In the six months to June, crude steel production in China increased by 11%, India increased by 31% and Japan increased by 14% against the same period of the prior year as economies recover from the impact of COVID-19 related restrictions. The average hard coking coal (Premium Low Vol) price in FY2021 fell by 15% (compared to the prior year) to US$122/t. At 30 June 2021, the hard coking coal (Premium Low Vol) price was US$194/t.\n\nAustralia exported 192mt of thermal coal in FY2021, down 10% against the prior year. Japan remained Australia's largest thermal coal export market with export volume of 73mt (38% share), followed by South Korea at 34mt (18% share) and Taiwan at 23mt (12% share). The average Newcastle benchmark thermal coal price in FY2021 increased by 20% (compared to the prior year) to US$78/t. At 30 June 2021, the thermal coal price was US$135/t.\n\n## Contract update\n\n- \u203a Glencore - existing agreement as primary hauler for Queensland mines extended for Newlands, Goonyella (excluding Hail Creek) and Blackwater mines.\n- \u203a Anglo: Goonyella - new agreement across various mines; Blackwater - new agreement for German Creek mine; Moura - extension of Dawson mine.\n- \u203a Stanwell - unsuccessful in retaining 3.2mtpa domestic contract (ended December 2020).\n- \u203a New Hope - New Acland contract ends December 2021 (end of mine life).",

Revenue increased $26.0m (4%) to $634.8m with:\n\n- \u203a the commencement of the Rio Tinto contract for the operation and maintenance of Rio Tinto's ballast cleaning machine on its WA Pilbara network in February 2020\n- \u203a the commencement of the Mineral Resources contract for the lease of rollingstock, provision of mainline crew and Esperance yard operations during 2HFY2020\n- \u203a a full year of contribution from the acquisition of Townsville Bulk Storage and Handling (Aurizon Port Services Pty Ltd) following the acquisition in 2HFY2020\n- \u203a the acquisition of ConPorts Pty Ltd (renamed Aurizon Port Services NSW Pty Ltd) on 31 December 2020\n- \u203a marginal revenue yield improvement despite lower CPI.\n\nPartly o/ffsetting this was lower access costs due to a customer transitioning to an to an end-user arrangement on the Mt Isa corridor during 2HFY2020 and lower average fuel prices compared to the prior year.\n\nIn Bulk East, volumes increased by 0.1mt driven by stronger grain volumes in NSW and QLD, partly o/ffset by lower livestock volumes. In Bulk West, iron ore volume was up 3.0mt driven by the ramp-up of Mineral Resources volumes partly o/ffset by lower Mt Gibson volumes due to end of mine life. Non-iron ore Bulk West volumes decreased by 0.1mt largely due to lower volumes on the Kalgoorlie freighter service.\n\nOperating costs decreased $3.8m (1%) despite increased costs associated with the new volumes from Rio Tinto and Mineral Resources and the Aurizon Port Services acquisitions. This was due to ongoing cost benefits from the Bulk transformation program, lower average fuel prices compared to the prior year and lower access costs due to a customer transitioning to an end-user agreement on the Mt Isa corridor during 2HFY2020.\n\nDepreciation increased $7.7m or 38% with increased capital expenditure supporting the growth in revenue and EBITDA. Therefore, EBIT increased 25% compared to a 27% increase in EBITDA.\n\n## Market update\n\nAurizon's Bulk business includes haulage of a range of bulk commodities such as iron ore, bauxite, alumina, base metals, grain and livestock across WA, NSW and QLD. In addition to commodities required to build infrastructure, opportunities are coming from new markets such as renewables and batteries, and growing food consumption. In terms of batteries, the global uptake of electric vehicles is expected to drive demand for commodities such as nickel, cobalt, copper and lithium. This is supported by increased exploration expenditure in Australia - in the March 2021 quarter, nickel (including cobalt) exploration expenditure rose by 24% (compared to the same period of the prior year) and copper exploration expenditure increased by 8% across the same period. Australian metal ore mining capital expenditure increased in the March quarter by 22% against the prior year to A$4.5bn, the 14th consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth for the sector.\n\n## Contract update\n\n- \u203a CBH - 10-year grain haulage contract commencing August 2021.\n- \u203a South32 Worsley - three-year contract extension for alumina and associated inputs.\n- \u203a Mineral Resources - expansion of services (beyond Esperance) with additional iron ore services into Kwinana.\n- \u203a BHP Nickel West - railing ceased in March 2021.",

Actual net tonnes were 208.3mt compared to the regulatory system forecast of 239.7mt. Total Access Revenue increased by $47.2m (4%):\n\n- \u203a Allowable Revenue was lower by $3.9m in FY2021.\n- \u203a Reduced volumes compared to the regulatory forecast resulted in an underrecovery after Take-or-Pay of $34.6m in FY2021 (Access Revenue in FY2021 included the recognition of $88.2m Take-or-Pay revenue in relation to the Blackwater, Goonyella, Moura and Newlands systems). This compares to an under-recovery of $22.6m in FY2020.\n\n- \u203a Customer-funded infrastructure rebates were also higher by $6.2m in FY2021 compared to FY2020, as a result of the true-up adjustment in FY2020 partly o/ffset by the impact of lower volumes in FY2021.\n- \u203a FY2021 Access Revenue benefited from favourable Revenue Cap movements of $13.0m. FY2020 included a repayment of $0.8m in relation to FY2018 and $12.2m in relation to FY2019.\n- \u203a Other Access Revenue was lower by $4.0m. This included lower pass-through Energy Costs (EC) revenue due to the lower volumes, o/ffset in lower expenses.\n- \u203a The above movements were more than o/ffset by the recognition of WIRP fees of $60.3m in FY2021, including recovery of historical fees following the successful Supreme Court decision in September 2020. No WIRP fees were recognised in FY2020.\n\nServices and other revenue was $10.8m (19%) lower in FY2021. This was primarily due to lower external construction revenue in FY2021 and insurance recoveries that were received in FY2020.\n\nOperating costs decreased by $14.3m (4%) primarily due to lower external construction costs associated with the lower revenue, reduced electric traction charges (o/ffset in Access Revenue and EC revenue) and lower maintenance costs partially o/ffset by expenditure incurred on the Precision railroading initiative.\n\nDepreciation increased $10.4m (3%) primarily due to historic rail renewal and ballast undercutting investment.\n\nNetwork's 2019-2020 Regulatory Asset Base (RAB) roll-forward is estimated to be $5.3bn 8 (excluding Access Facilitation Deeds of $0.4bn).",

The status of key aspects of UT5 are:\n\n- \u203a The Independent Expert (IE), Coal Network Capacity Co, continues the development of the Initial Capacity Assessment Report (ICAR) with the assistance of external consultants. The current expectation is that the ICAR will be completed at the end of Q1FY2022. Following delivery of the ICAR, should a capacity deficit be identified Aurizon Network has 20 business days to provide its initial views on potential transitional arrangements that could be implemented to address the deficit.\n- \u203a While the IE continues to progress the ICAR, Network's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) remains at 5.9%. The increase to 6.3% will apply upon the completion of specific milestones by both the IE and Network (Report Date).\n- \u203a Current QCA-approved reference tari/ffs continue to assume the 6.3% WACC from 1 March 2020. Future tari/ffs will be adjusted to reflect the actual Report Date.\n- \u203a The Performance Rebate mechanism was not applicable for FY2021. The rebate will come into e/ffect once the Report Date is reached. Transitional arrangements may be in e/ffect depending on the outcomes of the ICAR and any resulting remedial requirements.\n\nOn 14 February 2021, the Rail Industry Group (RIG) notified Network that End Users had elected to approve the Maintenance and Renewal Strategy and Budgets for each coal system except for:\n\n- \u203a The Maintenance Strategy and Budget for Newlands which was subsequently approved by the QCA on 26 May 2021; and\n- \u203a The Renewals Strategy and Budget for both Newlands and GAPE. As required under UT5, the draft renewals budget for Newlands and GAPE were incorporated into the FY2022 Annual Review of Reference Tari/ffs which were approved by the QCA on 22 June 2021. Renewals expenditure in Newlands and GAPE in FY2022 will be reviewed by the QCA for prudency and e/fficiency as part of the Annual Capital Claim process.\n\nNetwork's FY2020 Capital Expenditure Claim for $238m was approved by the QCA on 19 February 2021 and this amount was subsequently approved for entry into the RAB on 8 April 2021.\n\nThe QCA approved Network's FY2022 Annual Review of Reference Tari/ffs including FY2022 coal volumes for the CQCN at 226.9mt.\n\n## Operational update\n\nNetwork maintained strong operational performance during FY2021 despite challenges presented by wet weather and the COVID-19 related restrictions and disruptions.\n\n- \u203a As a result of lower end-market demand impacted by COVID-19 and the challenging trade environment with China, in addition to mine-specific maintenance and production issues, CQCN volumes declined by 8% to 208.3mt. Notwithstanding the reduced demand, all-time haulage records were achieved in the GAPE system.\n- \u203a Total System Availability was 84.1%. As FY2021 utilises a new capacity model, it is noted that the System Availability measure is not directly comparable to prior years.\n- \u203a Cancellations due to the Network rail infrastructure decreased from 2.5% to 1.6%.\n- \u203a Cycle velocity declined marginally from 23.3km/h to 23.0km/h.\n\nThe RM902, Network's new ballast cleaning machine, is completing in-service commissioning. It is expected that the machine will be fully operational in Q1FY2022.\n\n## Wiggins Island Rail Project (WIRP)\n\nOn 1 September 2020, the Queensland Court of Appeal a/ffirmed the Supreme Court decision in Network's favour and the WIRP customers did not seek leave to appeal that decision. As a result, Network is able to charge customers non-regulatory WIRP fees with e/ffect from March 2016 and commenced billing in November 2020.\n\nThe WIRP customers previously initiated other disputes under their respective WIRP Deeds which were the subject of an Expert Determination in February 2019. The Expert's Determination was issued on 4 June 2019 and found that the WIRP Fee should be partially reduced. Network lodged proceedings against the WIRP customers in the Supreme Court of Queensland on 18 December 2020 to appeal the Expert's Determination and the WIRP customers filed their defence on 1 March 2021.",

Through the Optimise and Excel levers, Aurizon is making targeted investments in technology on the journey to continuous improvement. Outlined below are the major initiatives being pursued in the business.\n\n## Precision railroading operations\n\nProject Precision is a multi-year supply chain e/fficiency program led by Network. The objective is to deliver more volume with existing capital for all users, through faster turnaround time and Disciplined Train Operations (DTO) - a process designed to remove the variability and improve schedule adherence and on-time running performance of all trains on the network.\n\nBuilt upon modern scheduling techniques, integrated planning determines the optimal distribution of trains on the Network. In periods of high demand, this approach can result in additional services compared to conventional techniques. In periods of low demand, modern scheduling optimises the train sets deployed in the system to maximise capital productivity while meeting customer demand.\n\nSupported by all rail operators in CQCN, a trial took place in FY2021 where Network undertook planning on behalf of all operators. This enabled Network to optimise planned throughput in line with the weekly train-ordering process. Taking into account the respective operators' access entitlements, an additional benefit of the integrated planning was the removal of contested access requests whereby two or more operators seek the same path on the Network.\n\nIn FY2021, DTO was implemented in all systems on the CQCN, with the following results 9 for Aurizon Above Rail:\n\n## In Newlands:\n\n- \u203a on time (or early) departure from origin improved from 90% to 97%\n- \u203a on time (or early) arrival at mine improved from 48% to 56%; and\n- \u203a on time (or early) arrival port improved from 26% to 48%.\n\n## In Goonyella:\n\n- \u203a on time (or early) departure from origin improved from 80% to 95%\n- \u203a on time (or early) arrival at mine improved from 41% to 57%; and\n- \u203a on time (or early) arrival port improved from 19% to 34%.\n\n## In Blackwater:\n\n- \u203a on time (or early) departure from origin improved from 87% to 99%\n- \u203a on time (or early) arrival at mine improved from 53% to 64%; and\n- \u203a on time (or early) arrival port improved from 22% to 46%.\n\n## In Moura:\n\n- \u203a on time (or early) departure from origin improved from 74% to 97%\n- \u203a on time (or early) arrival at mine improved from 22% to 61%; and\n- \u203a on time (or early) arrival port improved from 11% to 51%.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Report (continued) OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW\n\n## Automated Track Inspection System (ATIS)\n\nThe ATIS initiative seeks to measure track and overhead line alignment via locomotivemounted equipment using lasers to achieve precise measurements at line speed. Network currently uses a track-recording car to obtain these measurements, with the service provided by a third party and consuming paths that would otherwise be used by train services.\n\nIt is intended that ATIS will enable an increase in the timeliness of data allowing a move to a condition-based track resurfacing scope, tracking of defects and the ability to trend degradation to predict future fail points or intervention triggers. Other benefits of the system may include reduced cost and improved access by removing the requirement to utilise the track-recording car.\n\nDuring FY2021, the project team trialled the use of a Track Geometry Measurement System (TGMS) that was installed on a diesel locomotive based in Callemondah. The trial successfully proved that track geometry information could be captured via an autonomous device mounted to a locomotive at a quality level comparable to the trackrecording car. This unit continues to provide track geometry measurements across the Blackwater and Moura systems.\n\nNetwork is currently trialling an overhead Wire Geometry Measurement System (WGMS) and Pantograph Collision Detection System (PCDS). The trial seeks to confirm that overhead wire alignment information can also be captured via automated means.\n\nAssuming the WGMS and PCDS trials are successful, Network will look to roll out the technology into other systems subject to customer approval.\n\n## TrainGuard\n\nTrainGuard is a platform utilising ETCS (European Train Control System) technology to support driver decision-making, particularly in relation to speed control and signal enforcement. TrainGuard will support safer and more e/fficient train operations with reduced rail process safety issues and improved train handling. TrainGuard is also a pathway to expanding our driver-only operations in Central Queensland. Operational demonstration of TrainGuard was completed as planned in FY2020. Following this, the business decision to proceed with deployment of TrainGuard across Blackwater and Goonyella has been communicated to stakeholders. Preparations continue for TrainGuard's deployment on the Blackwater mainline (Callemondah to Blu/ff) which is now scheduled for 2HFY2022.\n\n## Asset maintenance\n\nAbove Rail Asset Management (ARAM) is a multi-year transformation project and has progressed with the dedicated project team working in close collaboration with the various business stakeholders.\n\nThe program of work has matured Aurizon supply chain and vendor management processes, standardised planning processes across the business, improved depot work execution e/fficiency and is now transitioning Aurizon's major rollingstock fleets from simple time-based to more mature condition-based maintenance strategies.\n\nFY2021 has seen the first of four major rollingstock fleets transition towards condition-based maintenance with the others planned from FY2022. In addition, traditional maintenance tasks are being removed by leveraging advances in condition monitoring technology such as Aurizon-owned Wayside Equipment and on-board locomotive monitoring equipment resulting from TrainHealth.\n\n## TrainHealth\n\nTrainHealth provides Aurizon with capability to monitor performance of locomotives and train handling/utilisation in real-time. This initiative enables access to real-time asset data that is being used to inform the health of the locomotive, enhance asset reliability and maintenance decisions for the fleet, in addition to providing greater visibility on driver variability and support business decisions for on-time running. With installation completed for 99% of the CQCN Siemens electric locomotive fleet, installation across the CQCN diesel fleet is scheduled to commence in August 2021.\n\n## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\n## Senior management changes\n\nGareth Long was appointed to the role of Group Executive Corporate in May 2021. Gareth's appointment follows the decision to amalgamate the majority of activities in Technical Services and Planning and Corporate under the leadership of one role. Accordingly, Mike Carter (previously Group Executive Technical Services and Planning) will leave the Company during FY2022.\n\n## Risk\n\nAurizon promotes a risk-aware culture with an emphasis on frontline accountability for e/ffective risk management. Aurizon's thinking is heavily informed by risk, from the framing of strategy through to informing decisionmaking. The Board approved Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Appetite encompasses consideration not only of risks related to operational, legal, financial, safety, health and environment but also strategy execution, climate change, reputational and culture and conduct-related risks, ensuring that Aurizon continues to consider and develop strategies to manage the full scope of risks faced by our business.\n\nRisk reporting provided both to our Board and supporting Committees, facilitates the early identification and proactive management of emerging risks where the impacts and opportunities are continually evolving. Risk management procedures and templates deployed throughout the business, further integrate the assessment of safety and nonsafety risks, as well as supporting a consistent approach to the management of risks in a manner which is comprehensive and userfriendly.\n\nRisks to the delivery of strategy have been categorised into the three strategic levers of Optimise, Excel and Extend.\n\n## Optimise strategic lever\n\n## Delivery of Optimise initiatives\n\nAurizon maintains a pipeline of e/fficiency initiatives that are expected to deliver a cost e/ffective and customer aligned model. Failure to be the lowest cost or highest service provider may occur due to a lack of definition in the target state or unsuccessful implementation of the associated action plans. Impacts of non-delivery include not achieving budget, failure to maximise volumes within customer contracts, and sub-optimal return on capital deployed.\n\n## Operational agility\n\nA lack of operational agility would result in Aurizon's inability to flex operations and support an alignment between costs and revenue. If operational agility is not achieved it may result in missed revenue during market upturns due to a lag in accessing the required resources, or static costs during downturns eroding financial performance.",

        "page_content": "## Business interruption\n\nAurizon may experience business interruption and consequential financial impacts from a range of circumstances including, but not limited to:\n\n- \u203a Road vehicle incident - death or injuries to our people from operating road vehicles.\n- \u203a Process safety incident - major process safety event leading to death or injuries to our people, significant distraction or loss of licence to operate.\n- \u203a Illegal protest activity - safety risks to employees and individuals due to anti-coal protesters illegally entering the rail corridor and danger zone to conduct blockades.\n- \u203a Cyber-security incidents from external penetration of Aurizon's corporate and operational systems.\n- \u203a Technology incidents - failure of technical infrastructure impacting technologydependent systems and operations.\n- \u203a Adverse weather events could impact Aurizon's operations, assets or customers.\n\n## Pandemic - COVID-19\n\nThe global Coronavirus pandemic exposes Aurizon to two primary risks:\n\n- \u203a Reduced demand - due to export markets requiring less of the commodities we haul which could reduce Aurizon's profitability.\n- \u203a Service delivery - employee health issues limiting our ability to provide services to customers. This risk extends to other supply chain participants such as mines and ports, and their ability to provide continuity of service.\n\n## Excel strategic lever\n\n## Competition in current markets\n\nAurizon may face competition from parties willing to compete at reduced margins and/or accept lower returns and greater risk positions than Aurizon. This may potentially negatively impact Aurizon's competitiveness. Most of Aurizon's significant customer contracts are secured on long-dated terms, however failure to win or retain customer contracts at acceptable rates will be a risk to future financial performance. Increased competition may be experienced from new entrants to Aurizon's core markets in both above and below rail and includes existing customers in-sourcing Aurizon's services. Competitors may also deploy technology or innovation more rapidly than Aurizon.\n\n## General regulatory risk\n\nAurizon's operations and financial performance are subject to legislative and regulatory oversight. Unfavourable changes may be experienced with respect to access regimes, safety accreditation, taxation, carbon reduction, environmental and industrial (including occupational health and safety) regulation, government policy, and approval processes. Implementation of these changes may have a material adverse impact on project investment, Aurizon's profitability and business in general, as well as Aurizon's customers.\n\nContinued delays in the implementation of the UT5 obligation to publish an ICAR may also result in adverse financial outcomes.\n\nAurizon is also exposed to the risk of material regulatory breaches resulting in the loss of operating licences and financial penalties. In the event of a loss of licence, critical business operations may not be supplied to customers, impacting profitability and reputation.\n\n## Counterparty risk\n\nAurizon's earnings are concentrated in commodity markets across a relatively small number of customers and may be impacted by deterioration in counterparty credit quality, mine sale to a lower-tier party, mine profitability, contract renewals, supply chain disruptions and/or macro-industry issues.\n\n## General economic conditions\n\nAurizon develops its own position regarding future coal demand through our Strategy in Uncertainty framework which includes a broad range of scenario analysis and portfolio stresstesting. This process considers both short-term impacts as well as risks that emerge over the medium to long term, where the timing and magnitude are less certain. In developing our own scenario analysis, we assess global seaborne demand for metallurgical and thermal coal, driven primarily by steel production and energy generation respectively. Based on this addressable market, Australian supply is assessed considering the risks and opportunities for both current and future coal production. Given our customers' exposure (almost entirely) to export markets, trade, netzero emission strategies and geopolitical risk may impact demand for Aurizon services.\n\n## Geopolitical risk\n\nRecent geopolitical developments, particularly in relation to Australia's trade relationship with China, have the potential to impact Australian coal and other bulk commodity exports to China. Prolonged uncertainty as to when Australian coal exports to China will resume could result in adverse financial impacts if export volumes cannot be reallocated to alternative markets.\n\n## Extend strategic lever\n\n## Growth strategy execution risk\n\nAurizon faces risks associated with the successful execution and delivery of the Enterprise Strategy and the ability to realise the future non-coal growth aspirations of the business. The recent non-coal investor day held in June 2021, signalled Aurizon's intent to double the size of the Bulk business by 2030, which will largely depend upon Aurizon's ability to identify and capitalise on suitable growth opportunities, both organic and inorganic, in an increasingly competitive environment.\n\n## Modern slavery risk\n\nAurizon understands that modern slavery and human tra/fficking can occur in many forms and recognises that we may be exposed to modern-day slavery risks in our supply chain that we may not be able to fully mitigate. The Company is committed to operating responsibly and ensuring that robust standards and processes are in place to minimise and address modern slavery risks. Aurizon is also committed to providing transparency on its modern slavery risks and how they are being addressed.\n\nIn October 2020, Aurizon published its first Modern Slavery Statement, which addresses the Company's obligations contained in the Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth). The purpose of the statement is to:\n\n- \u203a describe the risk of modern slavery in Aurizon's operations and supply chains\n- \u203a explain actions taken to address those risks\n- \u203a introduce the Company's continuous improvement framework, against which the e/ffectiveness of its actions will be assessed, and future commitments outlined.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Report (continued) OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW\n\n## Climate change risk\n\nAurizon acknowledges that climate change is a/ffecting a wide range of industries around the world, resulting in financial implications. Through our Climate Strategy and Action Plan (CSAP) we are focusing on specific targets, initiatives and investments to reduce our carbon footprint. Transition risks, related to energy policy, regulation, technology, and market shifts (that are necessary to achieve the transition to a low-carbon economy) will a/ffect the demand for the commodities that Aurizon hauls. Physical risks related to extreme weather events will also continue to a/ffect Aurizon through supply chain disruptions. Along with the transition and physical risks of climate change, Aurizon faces the risk of not delivering on our commitments under the CSAP.\n\nThe long-term implications of climate change may impact Aurizon on several fronts. For example:\n\n## Transition risks\n\n- \u203a demand for seaborne thermal coal is subject to energy policy and fuel-mix decisions driven by energy costs, energy security, and regulation of GHG emissions (including carbon pricing mechanisms) in coal import nations\n- \u203a demand for seaborne metallurgical coal is subject to factors such as economic development, steel-intensive growth, method of steel production (including emerging lower-carbon processes), import reliance, and regulation of GHG emissions (including carbonpricing mechanisms) in coal import nations\n- \u203a Australia's supply of both metallurgical and thermal coal to seaborne export markets is subject to factors such as global competitiveness, operating coal mine production, and domestic climate policies\n- \u203a investor concern over climate-related risks may result in an inability for our business and customers to gain licences, funding or insurance for coal mining and transport and/ or an increased risk of litigation/social action against our business and customers\n- \u203a carbon liability under the Safeguard Mechanism Rule and potential penalties for inappropriate carbon reporting under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) Act 2007 (Cth).\n\n## Physical risks\n\n- \u203a current and future disruption arising from increased severity and/or frequency of extreme weather events (higher temperatures, strong winds, flooding and associated erosion, bushfires, and others).\n\nSince 2017, Aurizon has incorporated recommendations from the Financial Stability Board's Final Report: Recommendation of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), in the Company's annual Sustainability Report. In October 2020, Aurizon published its first CSAP, outlining the Company's position on climate change, underpinned by long-term strategies and associated actions to mitigate climate risk and take advantage of climate-related opportunities, including a target of net-zero operational emissions by 2050.\n\nProgress towards Aurizon's CSAP initiatives will be made available through the annual Sustainability Report.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nAurizon takes a direct approach to reporting Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) disclosures to stakeholders with the publication of its annual Sustainability Report. This Report is prepared with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative's (GRI) standards to provide investors with comparable information relating to ESG performance.\n\nIn May 2021, Aurizon maintained a 'Leading' rating for the seventh consecutive year by the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI) for Corporate Sustainability Reporting in Australia. Having received this rating for five or more consecutive years, Aurizon has again been considered a 'Leader' by ACSI. Further information on Aurizon's approach to sustainability is included on page 8.",

        "page_content": "## Safety\n\nAt Aurizon, we are committed to protecting ourselves, each other, and our communities. We are determined to focus on managing what matters, with a specific focus on identifying and learning from events that have the potential for Serious Injury and Fatality (SIF).\n\nDuring FY2021, we have continued to embed an operational Critical Control Management (CCM) framework. CCM forms part of our enterprise approach to risk management. Combined with other safety, leadership and technical processes, it ensures we apply an e/ffective and integrated approach.\n\nIn FY2021, we have retained two primary safety metrics to measure safety outcomes across the enterprise including Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) and Rail Process Safety (RPS).\n\nRPS, which measures operational safety including derailments, signals passed at danger and rollingstock collisions deteriorated 8% against the prior year to 5.13. Aurizon continues to progress several initiatives, including TrainGuard, to strengthen RPS, along with improving yard safety interfaces to reduce the number of yard incidents, a major contributor to RPS in FY2021.\n\nTRIFR was 10.21 injuries per million hours worked, which was a 3% deterioration against the prior period. This deterioration has been the result of an increase in low-severity strain and sprain injuries. These injuries are commonly caused by a high number of lower body strains and sprains while walking on uneven surfaces in the rail corridor, and an increase in upper body manual handling strains caused by lifting equipment, setting points, applying handbrakes and accessing/egressing locomotives. Aurizon is committed to a reduction in these types of injuries. We will be delivering a program using technology to review high-risk body stressing tasks, developing approaches to reduce risk exposure, and in FY2022 reviewing our injury management program holistically to improve our proactive and reactive injury management strategies. Lost time injuries continue to show improvements, with an 8% decrease in the frequency of these type of injuries (LTIFR) against the prior period.\n\nIn FY2022, we have a strong focus on initiatives to accelerate safety performance improvement through targeting the main contributors to TRIFR and RPS, and a specific focus on identifying and learning from events that have the potential for SIF.\n\n## Environment\n\nAurizon's vision is to deliver environmental value through e/ffective management of material environmental risks and improved enterprise environmental performance. This vision is driven by proactive and evidencebased management measures covering key environmental issues such as, climate change, rail noise, and clean air.\n\nAurizon continues to work collaboratively with supply chain partners to minimise coal dust emissions associated with Aurizon's coal haulage operations. For further detail in relation to coal dust management and monitoring processes, refer to Aurizon's annual Sustainability Report.\n\nAs Bulk expands its service o/ffering beyond core rail capacity into stevedoring at key locations along the East Coast, Aurizon's environmental risk profile has changed. Accordingly, Aurizon's management measures have been adapted to cater for additional activities (such as loading of bulk mineral concentrates) and compliance requirements following extensive due diligence.\n\nIn FY2021 Aurizon had three notifiable environmental incidents. Remediation actions have been implemented as required and no ongoing environmental impacts are anticipated.\n\n## People\n\nAt Aurizon, our people are our greatest asset. We have more than 4,800 employees, with more than 80% living and working in regional Australia, including over a quarter of our senior management. Our Aurizon values (Safety, People, Integrity, Customer and Excellence) guide our people's work, in delivering bulk commodities to the world, and are underpinned by a workplace culture of connection.\n\nThrough our commitment to safe and e/fficient delivery for our customers, we are building our workforce for the future. Strong leadership, culture and values-aligned people practices lay the foundation to achieve this. During the year we progressed key initiatives, including:\n\n- \u203a the continued roll-out of our three core Leadership programs designed to embed a safe and high performing culture where our people live our values and are engaged and enabled to do their best work\n- \u203a further improvements to our people, processes and systems with a focus on embedding a quality performance management cycle through the organisation\n- \u203a continuing to strive towards creating an inclusive work environment by embedding flexible work practices, creating awareness and driving action for inclusion through employee representative groups (across gender, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and LGBTIQ inclusion), meeting workforce representation targets, actively reducing the gender pay gap and our continued commitment to employment of Veterans.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Report (continued) REMUNERATION REPORT\n\nDear fellow shareholders\n\nOn behalf of the Board, we are pleased to present Aurizon's Financial Year (FY) 2021 Remuneration Report. The Board believes that the Company has performed well and wishes to recognise the Leadership Team's performance in executing our business strategy and for achieving key milestones during the year. The Board would also like to thank all employees for their commitment and contributions throughout the year.\n\nAurizon delivered Underlying Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) in FY2021 of $903 million, including net earnings of $37 million relating to the favourable Queensland Court of Appeal decision on the Wiggins Island Rail Project (WIRP) fees. This was a solid result given the uncertain business environment. Aurizon's ability to deliver at the top end of guidance demonstrates the resilience of our Company, and the ongoing e/fforts and dedication of our employees at a challenging time.\n\nThe turnaround of the operational and financial performance of the Bulk business has continued during FY2021. The Aurizon Port Services business was expanded with the acquisition of ConPorts in Newcastle, volume growth has continued and ongoing e/fficiency improvements have been implemented. In the space of four years, Bulk has improved its EBIT by more than $100 million, from negative $14 million in FY2017 to $112 million in FY2021.\n\nThe Coal business delivered 202 million tonnes (mt) for customers during FY2021 and an EBIT of $325 million.\n\nThe Network business achieved an EBIT of $509 million in FY2021, including WIRP fees. Network achieved lower operating and maintenance costs compared to the prior comparative period despite increased Project Precision, legal and technology costs. Network achieved improved operational performance with below rail cancellations reducing to 1.6% in FY2021 from 2.5% in FY2020.\n\nAt Aurizon, we are committed to protecting ourselves, each other, and our communities. In FY2021, we have retained two primary safety metrics in our framework to measure safety outcomes across the enterprise including Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) and Rail Process Safety (RPS), which measures operational safety including derailments, signals passed at danger and rollingstock collisions. There has been a deterioration in both TRIFR and RPS during the year. While there was a significant improvement in TRIFR in the second half of the year, it is appropriate that no reward has been allocated for Safety performance in FY2021. Although not a primary measure, the Board notes the improvement in our Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) which saw an 8% improvement in the frequency of injuries against the prior period.\n\nA number of safety, health and wellbeing initiatives were delivered during the year, focusing on safety leadership and culture. Initiatives included the implementation of the new Safety Operating Model, a new second line of defense assurance program, our Leading for Safety leadership program, development of a new modern safety, health and environment reporting system, improvements in safety investigations, and the introduction of Aurizon's first mental wellbeing survey. In FY2022, we aim to accelerate safety performance improvement by targeting the main contributors to TRIFR and RPS, with a specific focus on identifying, preventing and learning from events that have the potential for Serious Injury and Fatality. In line with the execution of the Safety Strategy, the Board will consider measures that drive improved safety performance for future Awards.\n\nThe Short Term Incentive (STI) Award for FY2021 continued to be based on annual performance measures of Underlying EBIT, Safety and Individual Key Deliverables. Business Unit earnings metrics also continue to be used for Bulk, Coal and Network.\n\nFor the purposes of the FY2021 STI Award targets, the Board determined the receipt of retrospective WIRP fees would not contribute to FY2021 Underlying EBIT but would be assessed separately as noted below. As such, group Underlying EBIT in FY2021 was slightly above Target performance with EBIT outcomes varying across the Business Units. Network achieved an Underlying EBIT outcome of Stretch, Bulk achieved above Target whilst Coal performance was between Threshold and Target.\n\nThe mixed performance across the Enterprise and Business Unit earnings measures and individual measures is reflected directly in the STI payments for our Key Management Personnel (KMP). The Board has determined that an overall outcome above Target will be awarded to Bulk and Network participants; an overall outcome below Target will be awarded to Coal participants with the remaining participants receiving an overall outcome around Target.\n\nIn assessing the overall performance for FY2021, the Board acknowledged the receipt of the WIRP fees which were payable following the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal. As a result, the FY2021 STI Award payment will include a separate amount related to the FY2016-FY2020 WIRP fees, collected and recognised in FY2021. This payment rewards current participants for lower past STI Award outcomes due to WIRP fees not being collected or recognised in those years. This amount does not exceed what would have been paid if the WIRP fees had been received in the respective periods (FY2016-FY2020). These retrospective cash payments amounted to 30% of eligible employees Target STI Award. In line with the framework, a cap has been applied where participants STI Award reached the maximum potential award (150% of target percentage). Any future collection of WIRP fees will be treated as Underlying Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA).\n\nThe Long Term Incentive (LTI) Award performance measures are Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR). During FY2021, the 2017 (4 year) Long Term Incentive (LTI) Award was subject to testing. No portion of the award will vest and these rights will lapse.\n\nThe Board considers that these overall remuneration outcomes reach an appropriate balance between business performance, shareholder outcomes and recognising the value-adding contribution of the MD & CEO and the Leadership Team.\n\nDuring FY2021, the Board continued to review and refine Aurizon's remuneration framework. To further align incentive structures with business strategy, a strategic transformation measure has been added to the 2021 LTI Award to reflect the growth aspirations of the Bulk business and other non-Coal investments. In addition, the Board is adopting EBITDA from FY2022 in place of EBIT in the STI Award to align with a similar shift in how guidance will be provided and the Company's focus on cash flow. Further changes may be implemented from FY2023 to ensure the framework continues to deliver against our remuneration principles, long-term strategic outlook and to ensure it remains e/ffective in driving strong performance.\n\nWe are grateful for your ongoing support.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTim Poole Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKate Vidgen\n\nChair, Remuneration and People/uni00A0Committee",

Remuneration  Framework Components\n\n## Total Potential Remuneration\n\nAurizon's Remuneration Framework for each Executive comprises three components:\n\n- \u203a Fixed remuneration (not 'at risk') that comprises salary and other benefits, including superannuation\n- \u203a Short Term Incentive Award (STIA) ('at risk' component, awarded on the achievement of performance conditions over a 12-month period) that comprises both a cash component and a component deferred for 12 months into equity\n- \u203a Long Term Incentive Award (LTIA) ('at risk' component, awarded on the achievement of performance conditions over a fouryear period) that comprises only an equity component.\n\nThe structure is intended to provide an appropriate mix of fixed and variable remuneration, and provide a combination of incentives intended to drive performance against the Company's short and longer-term business objectives.\n\nThe mix of potential remuneration components for FY2021 for the MD & CEO and Executive KMP is set out in Figure 1: Total Potential Remuneration. This diagram demonstrates the revised remuneration mix for the MD & CEO that was implemented in FY2021 where a greater portion of the total potential remuneration is weighted towards the LTIA (from 120% to 150%). The remuneration mix for the other Executive KMP remains unchanged.\n\n## Executive Remuneration Governance\n\nFigure 2 represents Aurizon's remuneration governance framework. Details on the composition of the Remuneration and People Committee (Committee) are set out on page 9 of this report. The Committee's Charter is available in the Governance section of the Company's website at www.aurizon.com.au\n\n## FIGURE 1 - TOTAL POTENTIAL REMUNERATION 1,2\n\nFIGURE 2 - REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Assumes achievement of the stretch performance hurdle outcomes for STIA, full vesting of the Deferred STIA and LTIA at a value equal to the maximum opportunity of the original award i.e. assuming no share price appreciation\n- 2  Does not include the WIRP fee component payable in FY2021 as cash\n\n## BOARD\n\nThe Board:\n\n- \u203a Approves the overall remuneration policy and ensures it is competitive, fair and aligned with the long-term interests of the Company\n- \u203a Approves Non-Executive Director remuneration, MD & CEO and Executive Committee remuneration\n- 20 40 60 80 100 \u203a Assesses the performance of, and determines the STIA outcome for, the MD & CEO giving due weight to objective performance measures while retaining discretion to determine final outcomes\n- \u203a Considers and determines the STIA outcomes of the Executive Committee based on the recommendations of the MD & CEO.\n\n## REMUNERATION AND PEOPLE COMMITTEE\n\nThe Remuneration and People Committee is delegated responsibility by the Board to review and make recommendations on:\n\n- \u203a The remuneration policies and framework for the Company\n- \u203a Non-Executive Director remuneration\n- \u203a Remuneration for MD & CEO and Executive Committee\n- \u203a Executive incentive arrangements.\n\n## MANAGEMENT\n\n- \u203a Provides information relevant to remuneration decisions and makes recommendations to the Remuneration and People Committee\n- \u203a Obtains remuneration information from external advisors to assist the Remuneration and People Committee (i.e. market data, legal advice, accounting advice, tax advice).\n\n0\n\nCONSULTATION WITH SHAREHOLDERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS\n\n## REMUNERATION CONSULTANTS AND OTHER EXTERNAL ADVISORS\n\nIn performing duties and making recommendations to the Board, the Remuneration and People Committee may from time to time appoint and engage independent advisors directly in relation to remuneration matters.\n\nThese advisors:\n\n- \u203a Review and provide recommendations on the appropriateness of the MD & CEO and Executive remuneration\n- \u203a Provide independent advice, information and recommendations relevant to remuneration decisions.\n\nAny advice or recommendations provided by external advisors are used to assist the Board they do not substitute for the Board and Remuneration and People Committee processes.",

Remuneration outcomes, which are prepared in accordance with the accounting standards, are provided in Section 10 (page 38).\n\nThe Executive KMP did not receive a fixed remuneration increase during FY2021.\n\nThe remuneration outcomes identified in Table 4 are directly linked to the Company performance described in Section 6 (page 32) and Section 7 (page 34).\n\nThe actual STIA is dependent on Aurizon, Business Unit and individual performance as described in Section 6.\n\nIn assessing the overall performance for FY2021, the Board acknowledged the receipt of the WIRP fees which were payable following the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal. Further information in relation to the WIRP Component can be found in Section 6.\n\nVarying performance across our key measures is also reflected directly in the payments for our Executive KMP, which range from 79% to 100% of their potential maximum.\n\nThe actual vesting of the LTIA is dependent on Aurizon's performance and the outcomes are further described in Section 7.\n\nDuring FY2021, the 2017 Award (4 year) was subject to testing. However, Aurizon's performance resulted in no portion of this Award vesting.\n\nMovement in the Aurizon share price over the various performance periods is reflected in the remuneration outcomes for Executive KMP through the deferred portion of the STIA into equity. This aligns the Executive KMP outcomes with the shareholder experience.\n\nTABLE 4 - REMUNERATION EARNED IN FINANCIAL YEAR 2021\n\n| NAME          | FIXED  REMUNERATION   $'000   | NON-MONETARY  BENEFITS 1   $'000   | STIA   CASH/two.num  $'000   | STIA DEFERRED   FROM PRIOR YEAR 3 $'000   | WIRP  COMPONENT 4 $'000   | LTIA   VESTING 5 $'000   | SHARE PRICE  DEPRECIATION 6 $'000   | ACTUAL FY2021  REMUNERATION   OUTCOMES $'000   |\n|---------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| EXECUTIVE KMP |                               |                                    |                              |                                           |                           |                          |                                     |                                                |\n| A Harding     | 1,717                         | -                                  | 1,139                        | 654                                       | 515                       | -                        | (88)                                | 3,937                                          |\n| P Bains       | 788                           | -                                  | 469                          | 218                                       | 105                       | -                        | (29)                                | 1,551                                          |\n| G Lippiatt    | 700                           | -                                  | 334                          | -                                         | 158                       | -                        | -                                   | 1,192                                          |\n| C McDonald    | 667                           | 10                                 | 385                          | 263                                       | 109                       | -                        | (35)                                | 1,399                                          |\n| E McKeiver    | 683                           | 4                                  | 274                          | 134                                       | 154                       | -                        | (18)                                | 1,231                                          |\n\n- 2  The amount relates to the cash component (60%) of the FY2021 STIA which will be paid in September 2021\n\n- 5  The amount is the value of rights from the 2017 Award (4-year) which would have vested in August 2021.

Short Term Incentive Award\n\n## What is the STIA and who participates?\n\nThe STIA is 'at risk' remuneration subject to the achievement of pre-defined Company, Business Unit and individual performance measures which are set annually by the Board at the beginning of the performance period.\n\nFor each component of the STIA, three performance levels are set:\n\n- \u203a Threshold, below which no STIA is paid for that component\n- \u203a Target, which typically aligns to relevant corporate plans and budgets, a business improvement targeted outcome or reflects an improvement on historical achievement\n- \u203a Stretch, outcomes which are materially better than Target\n\nThe STIA applies in a similar manner to eligible non-enterprise agreement employees. For the MD & CEO, Executive KMP and the remaining Executive Committee (direct reports to the MD & CEO) a portion (40%) will be deferred into equity for a period of 12 months, which is subject to claw-back for financial misstatements and misconduct.\n\n## What are the Company performance measures?\n\nThe performance measures which apply to all participants are Underlying EBIT, Safety and Individual performance.\n\nBusiness Unit measures are included in the scorecard for Bulk, Coal and Network.\n\nEach measure has a defined level of performance. The measures drive a continuous safety improvement culture, strengthen and grow our current business while continuing to transform the Enterprise.\n\nThis is achieved through a focus on people and asset e/fficiencies whist at the same time delivering benefits to shareholders.\n\n## FIGURE 4 -\n\n## STRATEGIC MEASURES CASCADING PROCESS\n\nFIGURE 5 -\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEXCEL\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEXTEND\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIndividual performance measures relate to each specific role and measure an individual's contribution against a range of operational and strategic performance measures (including additional safety measures). At the start of the performance year the Board determines the MD & CEO individual deliverables. Relevant deliverables are cascaded to the Executive Committee and throughout the organisation as reflected in Figure 4.\n\n## What is the amount that participants can/uni00A0earn through an STIA?\n\nThe employment agreements specify a target STIA, expressed as a percentage of Fixed Remuneration (100% for the MD & CEO and 75% for the remaining Executive KMP). Each participant can earn between 0% up to a maximum of 150% of this target percentage, depending on performance and subject to Board discretion. Depending on performance assessed at year end, participants may earn for each enterprise measure: 0% for performance below Threshold , 50% at Threshold (for measures other than Underlying EBIT, for which Threshold earnings are 30%) with a linear scale up to 100% at Target performance; and a further linear scale to 200% at Stretch performance.\n\nSTIA outcomes are determined by calculating the performance outcome against the relevant weighted performance measure. Figure 5 provides an example of an at-target performance outcome.\n\n## What are the outcomes for FY2021?\n\nTable 5 identifies the performance measures, relevant weightings and outcomes for FY2021. These measures were assessed excluding net earnings of $37 million related to WIRP fees payable between FY2016 - FY2020. An outcome slightly above Target performance was achieved for Group Underlying EBIT.\n\n## STIA PERFORMANCE OUTCOME/uni00A0CALCULATION\n\n## MD & CEO AND SUPPORT FUNCTION PARTICIPANTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+\n\n+\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BUSINESS UNIT PARTICIPANTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnterprise Measures (EBIT)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnterprise Safety Measures (TRIFR, RPS)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBusiness Unit Measures (EBIT)\n\nIndividual Deliverable Measures (varied)\n\n+\n\n+\n\n=\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n=\n\nSTIA OUTCOME\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUnderlying EBIT outcomes varied across the Business Units, with Network achieving Stretch performance, Bulk achieving an outcome just below Stretch performance while Coal performance was between Threshold and Target.\n\nThere has been a deterioration in both TRIFR and RPS during the year. While there was a significant improvement in TRIFR in the second half of the year, it is appropriate that no reward has been allocated for Safety performance in FY2021. Aurizon continues to progress a number of initiatives to accelerate safety performance improvement.\n\nIn assessing the overall performance for FY2021, the Board acknowledged the receipt of the WIRP fees which were payable following the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal. As a result, the FY2021 STIA payment will include a separate amount related to the WIRP fees payable during FY2016 - FY2020, collected and recognised in FY2021. This payment rewards current participants for lower past STIA outcomes due to WIRP fees not being collected or recognised in those years.\n\nThis amount does not exceed what would have been paid if the WIRP fees had been received in the respective periods (FY2016-FY2020). These respective cash payments amounted to 30% of the eligible employees Target STIA. In line with the framework, a cap has been applied, where participants STIA reached the maximum potential award (150% of target percentage).\n\nAny future collection of WIRP fees will be treated as Underlying Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA).\n\nThe FY2021 actual outcomes for Executive KMP are identified within Table 6. Figure 6 provides an example of how the WIRP fees will be applied on top of the STIA performance outcome calculation.\n\nFIGURE 6 STIA + WIRP PAYMENT\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Report (continued) REMUNERATION REPORT\n\n## 7. Long Term Incentive Award\n\n## What is the LTIA and who participates?\n\nThe LTIA is the component of Total Potential Remuneration linked to providing long-term incentives for selected Executives whom the Board has identified as being able to contribute directly to the generation of long-term shareholder returns. This includes the MD & CEO, Executive KMP, the remaining Executive Committee (direct reports to the MD & CEO) and a number of other management employees.\n\n## What is the amount that Executives can earn through an LTIA?\n\nThe maximum potential remuneration (expressed as a percentage of Fixed Remuneration) available through the LTIA is 150% in the case of the MD & CEO and 112.5% for the remaining Executive KMP.\n\n## What is the performance period?\n\nThe company hurdles for the LTIA are measured over a four year period. Retesting does not form part of any award.\n\n## What are the performance hurdles?\n\nThe outstanding LTIA (2017 Award - 2020 Award) have two performance hurdles - Relative Total Shareholder Return and Average Return on Invested Capital. From the 2021 Award an additional Non-Coal Gross Revenue Growth measure has been introduced as outlined in Table 8.\n\n## How is the LTIA determined?\n\nThe number of performance rights issued under the LTIA to each Executive is calculated by dividing their respective LTIA potential remuneration (expressed as a percentage of Fixed Remuneration) by the five-day Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of Aurizon shares at the time of their award.\n\nEach performance right is a right to receive one share in Aurizon upon vesting. The number of performance rights that vest is determined by performance outcomes compared against predetermined company hurdles as described in Table 7 and Table 8.\n\n## What happens when performance rights/uni00A0vest?\n\nPerformance rights awarded under the LTIA vest subject to the satisfaction of company hurdles. Rights vest and the resulting shares are transferred to the Executive at no cost to the Executive. Value of the award will be subject to movements in the Aurizon share price over the performance period, aligning Executive outcomes and shareholder experience.\n\nCompany performance and vesting outcomes for the 2017 LTIA (4 year) is identified in Table 7. Aurizon's performance resulted in no component of this Award vesting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTABLE 7 - COMPANY PERFORMANCE AGAINST LONG TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS SUBJECT TO TESTING IN FINANCIAL YEAR 2021\n\n| COMPANY HURDLE AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT/uni00A0PERIOD   |                                                                                                            | WEIGHTING   | RESULT       | %   VESTED   | %  LAPSED   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|\n| 2017 AWARD (4 YEAR): 01 JULY 2017 - 30 JUNE 2021/one.num   | 2017 AWARD (4 YEAR): 01 JULY 2017 - 30 JUNE 2021/one.num                                                   |             |              |              |             |\n| Relative TSR:  against peer  group within ASX100 Index     | 30% of rights vest at the 50th percentile, 75% at the  62.5th percentile up to 100% at the 75th percentile | 50%         | Below Median | 0%           | 100%        |\n| ROIC:  average annual ROIC  FY2018 - FY2021/two.num        | 50% of rights vest with an average ROIC of 10.5%,   up to 100% at 11.5%                                    | 50%         | 9.5%         | 0%           | 100%        |\n\n- 1 From the 2017 Award, company hurdles are measured over an extended performance period, which increased from a three-year performance period to a four-year performance period. In order to facilitate this transition two awards were issued at 75% of the maximum vesting opportunity in FY2018\n- 2  Following the expected Network regulatory outcomes, the Board has determined that no adjustment will be made to the hurdles for 2017 and 2018 Awards\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMaximum/emspace\n\nBetween Minimum and Maximum/emspace\n\nMinimum/emspace\n\nBelow Minimum\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Retention awards may be time-based or project-based and are governed by stringent performance conditions and may be cash-based or equity-based. In FY2018, an award was issued to an Executive who has subsequently been appointed to the Executive Committee (CFO & GE Strategy) and which subsequently vested during FY2021. During FY2021, no retention awards were issued to Executive KMP and 46,296 performance rights were issued to one employee.

Executive Employment Agreements\n\n## Executive Employment Agreements\n\nRemuneration and other terms of employment for the MD & CEO and Executive KMP are formalised in an Employment Agreement as summarised in Table 9.\n\n## Minimum Shareholding policy for/uni00A0Executives\n\nTo align KMP and the Executive Committee (direct reports to the MD & CEO) with shareholders, the Company requires:\n\n- \u203a Non-Executive Directors to accumulate and maintain one year's Total Directors' fees (consisting of Directors' fee plus applicable Committee fee/s) of shares in the Company\n- \u203a the MD & CEO to accumulate and maintain one year's Fixed Remuneration of shares in the Company\n- \u203a the remaining Executive KMP and Executive Committee to accumulate and maintain 50% of one year's Fixed Remuneration of shares in the Company.\n\nThis is to be achieved within six years of the date of their appointment. This will be calculated with reference to the Total Directors' fees and Executives' Fixed Remuneration during the period divided by the number of years.\n\nDetails of KMP shareholdings as at 30 June 2021 are set out in Table 10.\n\n## Hedging and margin lending policies\n\nAurizon has in place a policy that prohibits Executives from hedging economic exposure to unvested rights that have been issued pursuant to a Company employee share plan. The policy also prohibits margin loan arrangements for the purpose of purchasing Aurizon shares. Adherence to this policy is monitored regularly and involves each Executive signing an annual declaration of compliance with the policy.\n\nTABLE 9 - EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS\n\n| NAME          | DURATION OF   EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT   | FIXED REMUNERATION AT  END OF FINANCIAL YEAR   | BY EXECUTIVE   | NOTICE PERIOD 2 BY COMPANY 3   |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------|\n| EXECUTIVE KMP |                                      | 2021/one.num                                   |                |                                |\n| A Harding     | Ongoing                              | 1,717,000                                      | 6 months       | 12 months                      |\n| P Bains       | Ongoing                              | 788,000                                        | 3 months       | 6 months                       |\n| G Lippiatt    | Ongoing                              | 700,000                                        | 3 months       | 6 months                       |\n| C McDonald    | Ongoing                              | 667,000                                        | 3 months       | 6 months                       |\n| E McKeiver    | Ongoing                              | 683,000                                        | 3 months       | 6 months                       |\n\n- 1   Fixed remuneration includes a superannuation component\n- 2  Post employment restraints in any competitor business in Australia is aligned to the notice period\n- 3  Any termination payment will be subject to compliance with the Corporations Act 2001 and will not exceed 12 months\n\nTABLE 10 -

The consolidated financial report comprises the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the Group or Aurizon).\n\nThe financial report is a general purpose financial report which:\n\n- \u203a  has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 , Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB);\n- \u203a  has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value;\n- \u203a  is presented in Australian dollars, with values rounded to the nearest $100,000 unless otherwise stated, in accordance with the ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191;\n- \u203a  presents reclassified comparative information where required for consistency with current year presentation;\n- \u203a  adopts all new and amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the AASB that are relevant to the operations of the Group and e/ffective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2020; and\n- \u203a  has applied the Group accounting policies consistently to all periods presented.\n\nThe general purpose financial report for the Group for the year ended 30 June 2021 (FY2021) has been authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 9 August 2021. The Directors have the power to amend and reissue the financial report.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Group's accounting policies. It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions of assets, liabilities, income and expense.\n\nThe areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity are set out below and in more detail in the related notes:\n\n|                                                           |   Note |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Revenue                                                   |      2 |\n| Useful lives of property, plant and equipment             |      8 |\n| Impairment of property, plant and equipment               |      8 |\n| Impairment of cash generating units (CGUs)   and goodwill |      9 |\n\n## Other accounting policies\n\nSignificant and other accounting policies that summarise the measurement basis used, and are relevant to an understanding of the financial statements, are provided throughout the notes to the financial statements.\n\n## The notes to the financial statements\n\nThe following notes include information which is material and relevant to the operations, financial position and performance of the Group. Information is considered material and relevant due to its size and nature or if the information:\n\n- \u203a is important for understanding the Group's current period results;\n- \u203a provides an explanation of significant changes in the Group's business for example acquisitions or divestments; or\n- \u203a relates to an aspect of the Group's operations that are important to its future performance.\n\n## Key events and transactions for the reporting period\n\n## (a)  Access revenue\n\n## 2017 Access Undertaking\n\nThe Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) applied under the 2017 Access Undertaking is 5.90%, increasing to 6.30% upon completion of an independent capacity assessment of the Central Queensland Coal Network (CQCN). In the event that a capacity deficit is identified, the WACC increase to 6.30% will commence when Aurizon Network Pty Ltd (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group) notifies relevant parties of proposed options to address the deficit. The Independent Expert continues the development of the Initial Capacity Assessment Report (ICAR) with the assistance of external consultants. The Independent Expert has advised that the ICAR is expected to be completed at the end of September 2021.\n\nThe 2017 Access Undertaking assumed the independent capacity assessment would be complete by 1 March 2020 and therefore, a WACC of 6.30% applied for FY2021. As a result of the delay in the independent capacity assessment, there has been an over-collection of access charges in FY2021 (the di/fference between 5.90% and 6.30%). The over-collection of access charges in FY2021 has been partially o/ffset by lower revenue resulting from reduced actual volumes (net of Take-or-Pay triggering in four rail network systems). A net under or over recovery of access charges by system after adjustments forms part of the revenue adjustment amount (revenue cap). The FY2021 net revenue cap adjustment is a recovery by customers of up to $16.0 million through tari/ff adjustments in FY2023. The FY2021 revenue cap adjustment is/uni00A0subject to approval by the Queensland Competition Authority (QCA).\n\nAccess revenue for the period has been recognised based on the 2017 Access/uni00A0Undertaking applying a WACC rate of 6.30% (2020: average WACC rate of 6.03%).",

As a result, the Group was able to charge customers non-regulated WIRP fees with e/ffect from March 2016 and commenced billing in November 2020.\n\nThe WIRP customers previously initiated other disputes under their respective WIRP Deeds which were the subject of an Expert Determination in February 2019. The Expert's Determination was issued on 4 June 2019 and found that the WIRP fee should be partially reduced. Aurizon Network Pty Ltd lodged proceedings against the WIRP customers in the Supreme Court of Queensland on 18 December 2020 to appeal the Expert's Determination and the WIRP customers filed their defence on 1 March 2021.\n\nThe amount of WIRP fees ultimately payable by WIRP customers will be dependent upon finalisation of the appeal of the Expert's Determination and finalisation of a cost variation factor related to WIRP project costs. WIRP fees of $60.3 million, including $48.9 million of historical fees (relating to FY2016 - FY2020), have been recognised in FY2021 (2020: $nil).\n\n## (b) Disposals\n\n- \u203a On 26 March 2021, the Group completed the sale of the Acacia Ridge Intermodal Terminal to Pacific National. The net gain on sale before income tax of $161.1 million has been classified as a significant item in discontinued operations.\n- \u203a On 26 May 2021, the Group sold its shares held in Aquila Resources Limited to Mineral Resources Limited for $10.0 million. As a result of the sale, the Group has recognised a tax benefit of $67.8 million for a previously unrecognised deferred tax asset associated with the impairment of the carrying amount of the shares held in FY2016. The net gain on sale before income tax of $8.2 million has been classified as a significant item in earnings before income tax (EBIT). The net income tax benefit of $65.3 million has been recognised as a significant item in profit after tax.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (c)  Acquisition of subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures\n\nDuring the year, the Group:\n\n- \u203a acquired a 41.67% investment in Ox Mountain Limited (UK registered), a maintenance software developer and provider, for consideration of $22.4 million on 28 August 2020. The investment is accounted for using the equity method of accounting; and\n- \u203a acquired 100% of the issued shares in ConPorts Pty Ltd (renamed to Aurizon Port Services NSW Pty Ltd), a shiploading services provider in Newcastle, for consideration of $42.7 million on 31 December 2020. The acquisition includes long-term leases at the Port of Newcastle with shiploading facilities adjacent to rail lines.\n\nRefer to note 22 for further information.\n\n## (d)  Debt refinancing\n\nDuring the year, Aurizon Network Pty Ltd:\n\n- \u203a  issued a $500.0 million 10-year fixed Medium-Term Note (Network AMTN 4) maturing 2 September 2030;\n- \u203a  repaid a $525.0 million fixed Medium-Term Note (Network AMTN 1) maturing 28 October 2020;\n- \u203a reduced the $850.0 million Bilateral Facility maturing 5 June 2023 by $100.0 million to $750.0 million;\n- \u203a  issued a $75.0 million 10.5-year fixed Private Placement (Network AMTN 5) maturing 15 December 2031; and\n- \u203a  re-financed an existing $100.0 million Working Capital Facility in December 2020 until June 2021, which was subsequently extended to June 2022 at a limit of $75.0 million.\n\nDuring the year, Aurizon Finance Pty Ltd:\n\n- \u203a  added $175.0 million to the existing $450.0 million Bilateral Facilities in November 2020, increasing total limits across the facilities to $625.0 million. The existing $450.0 million facilities mature 26 November 2023. The additional facilities mature 5 June 2023 ($50.0 million), 3 November 2023 ($50.0 million) and 3 November 2025 ($75.0 million);\n- \u203a  issued a $500.0 million seven-year fixed Medium-Term Note (Finance AMTN/uni00A01) maturing 9 March 2028; and\n- \u203a  re-financed an existing $150.0 million Working Capital Facility in December 2020 until June 2021, which was subsequently extended to June 2022 at a limit of $125.0 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (e)  On-market share buy-back scheme\n\nThe Group completed an on-market share buy-back program on 15 March 2021.

No provision for impairment of contracts assets has been recognised, refer to accounting policy in note/uni00A06 (2020: $nil).\n\n|                                                          |   2021 $m |   2020 $m |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Within one year                                          |       2.1 |       1.3 |\n| Later than one year but not later than five/uni00A0years |      32.9 |      16.3 |\n| Later than five years                                    |       4.2 |       5.6 |\n|                                                          |      39.2 |      23.2 |\n\n## (ii)  Contract liabilities\n\nThe Group has recognised the following revenue-related contract/uni00A0liabilities:\n\n|                                | 2021 $m   | 2020 $m   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Current                        |           |           |\n| Advances for track access      | 26.3      | -         |\n| Advances for freight transport | 4.8       | 2.0       |\n| Advances for other services    | 25.4      | 26.5      |\n|                                | 56.5      | 28.5      |\n| Non-current                    |           |           |\n| Advances for freight transport | 11.8      | 14.4      |\n| Advances for other services    | 123.2     | 136.0     |\n|                                | 135.0     | 150.4     |\n\nContract liabilities primarily represent amounts received from customers as advances for track access and the provision of services under agreements for mine-specific infrastructure. These amounts are deferred and earned over the term of the agreements using the output method as performance obligations are satisfied.",

Revenue is recognised on an as-invoiced basis, except for contracts that have a contract asset or a contract liability balance. For all other contracts, the right to consideration from a customer corresponds directly with the Group's performance obligations completed to date.\n\nLong-term track access and freight transport contracts are considered to be a series of annual performance obligations that are satisfied within each financial year. Any amounts received in advance are recognised over the term of the agreement as performance obligations are satisfied. The Group applies the practical expedient in paragraph 121 of AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (AASB 15) and does not disclose information on the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied.\n\nAll other track access and freight transport contracts for periods of one year or less are billed monthly based on the services provided. As permitted under AASB 15 the transaction price allocated to these unsatisfied performance obligations are not disclosed.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\n## Take-or-Pay revenue\n\nAurizon Network Pty Ltd is able to recover in the financial year part of an Allowable Revenue shortfall through Take-or-Pay clauses which may trigger when annual volumes railed are less than the regulatory forecast. Take-or-Pay is calculated based on management's judgement of below rail cause and above rail operator and/or mine cancellations. This judgement impacts the calculation of Take-or-Pay and the receivable recognised in the year that the contractual railings were not achieved. Take-or-Pay revenue of $77.5 million has been recognised at 30 June 2021 (2020: $25.6 million).\n\n## Wiggins Island Rail Project (WIRP) Access Revenue\n\nOn 1 September 2020, the Queensland Court of Appeal a/ffirmed the Supreme Court decision in the Group's favour and the WIRP customers did not seek leave to appeal that decision. As a result, the Group was able to charge customers non-regulated WIRP fees with e/ffect from March 2016 and commenced billing in November 2020.\n\nThe WIRP customers previously initiated other disputes under their respective WIRP Deeds which were the subject of an Expert Determination in February 2019. The Expert's Determination was issued on 4 June 2019 and found that the WIRP fee should be partially reduced. Aurizon Network Pty Ltd lodged proceedings against the WIRP customers in the Supreme Court of Queensland on 18 December 2020 to appeal the Expert's Determination and the WIRP customers filed their defence on 1 March 2021.\n\nThe amount of WIRP fees ultimately payable by WIRP customers will be dependent upon finalisation of the appeal of the Expert's Determination and finalisation of a cost variation factor related to the WIRP project costs. WIRP fees of $60.3 million, including $48.9 million of historical fees (relating to FY2016 - FY2020), have been recognised in FY2021 (2020: $nil).\n\n## Freight Transport Contract Modifications\n\nModifications to existing agreements where there is also a new agreement put in place are assessed based on the facts and substance of the individual contractual arrangements, and will be accounted for as either combined or separate contracts in accordance with AASB 15. There is significant judgement exercised in determining if a modification to an existing agreement should be treated as a combined or a separate contract. Judgement, including expected volumes to be railed in individual contract years and whether the contract price represents the market price in the respective contract period, is applied in determining the calculation of contract assets or contract liabilities recorded. These judgements impact the timing of revenue recognised over the term of the individual contract.\n\n## (c)  Accounting policies\n\nThe Group recognises revenue as performance obligations are satisfied. Revenue includes the provision of track access and freight transport services as described below.\n\n## (i) Track access\n\nTrack access revenue is generated from the provision of access to, and operation of, the CQCN under an approved Access Undertaking. Track access revenue is recognised over time as access to the rail network is provided and is measured on a number of operating parameters including volumes hauled applied to regulator approved tari/ffs.",

At each balance date, track access revenue includes an amount of revenue for which performance obligations have been met under the respective contract but have not yet settled. These amounts are recognised as trade receivables.\n\nWhere annual volumes railed are less than the regulatory forecast, Take-or-Pay may trigger. Take-or-Pay is recognised as revenue and a receivable in the year that the contractual railings were not achieved as the related performance obligations have been satisfied.\n\nRegulated access revenue is subject to a revenue cap mechanism that serves to ensure the rail network recovers its Allowable Revenue over the regulatory period. A revenue adjustment event results in the under or over recovery of regulatory access revenue (net of Take-or-Pay revenue) for a financial year being recognised in the accounting revenues of the second financial year following the financial year in which the event occurred as per the Access Undertaking.\n\nAccess revenue for the financial year has been recognised based on the 2017 Access Undertaking applying a WACC rate of 6.30% (2020: average WACC rate of 6.03%). Refer to key events and transactions for the reporting period for further information.\n\nA contract liability is recorded for revenue received in advance of satisfying a performance obligation and is subsequently recognised in profit and loss as revenue, as the performance obligation is satisfied during the term of the contract.\n\n## (ii)  Freight transport\n\nFreight transport revenue is recognised as the relevant performance obligations are satisfied over time, being the provision of freight transport services.\n\nFreight transport revenue is billed monthly in arrears and recognised at rates specified in each contractual agreement, and adjusted for the amortisation of customer contract assets or contract liabilities. At each balance date, freight transport revenue includes an amount of revenue for which performance obligations have been met under the respective contract but have not yet settled. These amounts are recognised as trade receivables.\n\nA contract modification is a separate contract if the scope of services is increased by distinct additional services and the total price increases by the market rate for those services over the remaining contract period. Where the distinct services don't indicate market prices, weightedaverage contract rates are applied, which may result in the recognition of a contract asset or a contract liability that amortise over the term of the individual contract. Modifications to existing agreements where there is also a new agreement put in place are assessed based on the facts and substance of the individual contractual arrangements, and are accounted for as either combined or separate contracts.\n\nA contract asset is recorded for revenue when the Group does not have an unconditional right to invoice the customer for performance obligations satisfied. A contract liability is recorded for revenue received in advance of satisfying a performance obligation and is recognised over the term of the contract.\n\n## (iii)  Capitalisation of customer contract costs\n\nWhere incremental costs are incurred to secure a new contract or an extension to an existing customer contract, these costs are capitalised as a contract asset and amortised against revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied over time.\n\nWhere an arrangement contains a significant financing component, the transaction price is adjusted to reflect the e/ffects of the financing component, and a contract asset is recognised and amortised against revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied over time.\n\n## 3  Expenses\n\nProfit before income tax from continuing operations includes the following specific expenses:\n\n|                                                   | 2021  $m   | 2020   $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|\n| Employee benefits expense                         |            |             |\n| Salaries, wages and allowances including on-costs | 753.2      | 707.5       |\n| Defined contribution superannuation expense       | 59.4       | 57.9        |\n| Defined benefit superannuation expense            | 9.7        | 10.2        |\n| Redundancies                                      | 13.9       | 16.0        |\n|                                                   | 836.2      | 791.6       |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                     |            |             |\n| Depreciation of property, plant and equipment     | 547.8      | 530.8       |\n| Amortisation of intangibles                       | 31.3       | 27.8        |\n|                                                   | 579.1      | 558.6       |\n| Finance expenses                                  |            |             |\n| Interest and finance charges paid/payable         | 149.8      | 152.3       |\n| Discounting on land rehabilitation provision      | 0.2        | -           |\n| Interest paid on lease liability                  | 5.1        | 5.1         |\n| Amortisation of capitalised borrowing costs       | 4.2        | 3.8         |\n| Amortisation of AMTN 2 fair value adjustment      | (2.4)      | (2.4)       |\n| Counterparty credit risk adjustments              | (3.8)      | (3.9)       |\n|                                                   | 153.1      | 154.9       |\n| Capitalised interest paid on qualifying assets    | (3.7)      | (3.9)       |\n|                                                   | 149.4      | 151.0       |",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements 30 June 2021 (continued)\n\n## 4  Income tax (continued)\n\n## (d)  Accounting policies\n\nThe tax position is calculated based on the tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, in the relevant operating jurisdiction. The tax laws and accounting standards have di/fferent rules in respect of timing and recognition of income and expense, resulting in temporary di/fferences (which reverse over time) and non-temporary di/fferences (which do not reverse over time or are temporary di/fferences that do not meet the recognition criteria under the accounting standards).\n\nIncome tax expense is calculated as the profit/(loss) before tax, multiplied by the applicable tax rate, and adjusted for non-temporary di/fferences. Income tax expense includes a current tax and deferred tax component and is recognised in the profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in equity or in other comprehensive income.\n\n## (i) Current tax\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable for the period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of prior periods. Current tax includes both temporary di/fferences and non-temporary di/fferences.\n\nThe positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation are periodically evaluated and provisions are provided where appropriate based on amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are o/ffset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to o/ffset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\n## (ii)  Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax represents taxes to be paid or deductions available in future income years and any adjustment to deferred tax amounts in respect of prior periods. Deferred tax is recognised on temporary di/fferences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements, except:\n\n- \u203a  when arising on the initial recognition of goodwill;\n- \u203a  when arising from the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that a/ffects neither accounting or taxable profit; or\n- \u203a  where it is not probable that future amounts will be available to utilise those temporary di/fferences or carried-forward tax losses.\n\n## (iii)  O/ffsetting deferred tax balances\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are o/ffset where there is a legally enforceable right to o/ffset and when the deferred tax balances relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.\n\n## (iv)  Tax consolidation legislation\n\nThe Company and its wholly owned Australian entities elected to form a tax consolidated group, and are taxed as a single entity. The head entity of the tax consolidated group is Aurizon Holdings Limited.\n\nThe Company and the entities in the tax consolidated group account for their own current and deferred tax amounts. These tax amounts are measured as if each entity in the tax consolidated group continues to be a stand-alone taxpayer.\n\nIn addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts, the Company also recognises the current tax liabilities (or assets) and the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax credits assumed from entities in the tax consolidated group.\n\nThe entities have entered into tax sharing and tax funding agreements. The tax funding agreement sets out the funding obligations of members of the tax consolidated group in respect of income tax amounts and requires payments to the Company equal to the current tax liability assumed by the Company. The Company is required to make payments equal to the current tax asset or deferred tax asset arising from unused tax losses and tax credits assumed from a subsidiary member. The tax funding arrangement results in the Company recognising a current inter-entity receivable/payable equal to the tax liability/asset assumed.\n\nThe tax sharing agreement limits the joint and several liability of the wholly owned entities in the case of a default by the Company.\n\n## 5  Earnings per share\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) is the amount of post-tax profit attributable to each share. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding after adjustment for the e/ffects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.\n\n|                                                                            | 2021  Cents          | 2020  Cents          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Earnings per share for continuing operations                               |                      |                      |\n| Basic earnings per share                                                   | 32.5                 | 31.0                 |\n| Diluted earnings per share                                                 | 32.4                 | 30.9                 |\n| Earnings per share                                                         |                      |                      |\n| Basic earnings per share                                                   | 39.1                 | 31.5                 |\n| Diluted earnings per share                                                 | 39.0                 | 31.5                 |\n|                                                                            | 2021   Number   '000 | 2020   Number   '000 |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary  shares for basic earnings per share   | 1,868,553            | 1,952,895            |\n| Dilution due to rights issued pursuant to  performance rights plans        | 1,909                | 2,918                |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares  for diluted earnings per share | 1,870,462            | 1,955,813            |",

Trade receivables are generally due for settlement within 31 days and are therefore classified as current.\n\n## (ii)  Provision for impairment\n\nThe collectability of trade and other receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Individual debts which are known to be uncollectable are written o/ff when identified.\n\nThe Group recognises a provision for impairment based on expected lifetime losses of trade receivables. The amount of the provision for impairment is recognised in profit or loss in other expenses.\n\n## (b)  Credit risks related to receivables\n\nIn assessing an appropriate provision for impairment of trade receivables, consideration is given to historical experience of bad debts, the aging of receivables, knowledge of debtor insolvency and individual account assessment.\n\nThe Group's trade receivables exhibit similar credit risk characteristics and exposures. Customer credit risk is managed in accordance with the procedures and controls set out in the Group's credit risk management policy. Credit limits are established for all customers based on external and internal credit rating criteria. For some trade receivables, the Group may also obtain security in the form of guarantees, deeds of undertaking or letter of credit which can be called upon if the counterparty is in default under the terms of the agreement.\n\n## 7  Inventories\n\n|                                      | 2021  $m   | 2020  $m   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Current                              |            |            |\n| Raw materials and stores - at cost   | 160.0      | 155.9      |\n| Provision for inventory obsolescence | (9.6)      | (10.1)     |\n|                                      | 150.4      | 145.8      |\n| Non-current                          |            |            |\n| Raw materials and stores - at cost   | 59.0       | 50.5       |\n| Provision for inventory obsolescence | (13.1)     | (12.4)     |\n|                                      | 45.9       | 38.1       |\n\n## (a)  Accounting policies\n\nInventories includes infrastructure and rollingstock items held in centralised stores, workshops and depots. Items expected to be consumed after more than 12 months are classified as non-current.\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of individual items of inventory are determined using weighted average cost.\n\nThe Group recognises a provision for inventory obsolescence based on an assessment of damaged stock, slow-moving stock and stock that has become obsolete. The amount of the provision for inventory obsolescence is recognised in profit or loss in other expenses.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements 30 June 2021 (continued)\n\n## 8   Property, plant and equipment (continued)\n\n## SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\n## Useful lives\n\n## Context of judgements\n\nAurizon's business is primarily linked to the demand for and supply of Australian commodities, almost entirely destined for export markets in Asia. As part of Aurizon's Strategy in Uncertainty framework, scenario analysis is used to test market drivers and evaluate capital, fleet and haulage opportunities and sustainability in the context of climate change risks. A key component of this analysis is understanding the drivers of demand and supply for commodities transported. This process considers short-term impacts as well as risks that emerge over the medium to long term, where the timing and magnitude is less certain. In addition to the fundamental drivers of Australian commodities, more subjective factors are also considered including government policy and trade considerations.\n\n## Useful lives of infrastructure assets\n\nThe useful lives of infrastructure assets are determined based on the expected engineering life, capped at the remaining term of the infrastructure leases and are reviewed annually. Infrastructure predominantly relates to CQCN assets. Aurizon Network Pty Ltd (Network) is responsible for the provision of access to, and operation of, the below rail regulated CQCN which connects 40 mines to five export terminals as well as to domestic customers.\n\nAccess to the rail network is managed under a process approved by the QCA. The QCA determines Network's access pricing based on the estimated value of our assets, which is known as the Regulatory Asset Base (RAB). Economic depreciation considered for regulatory purposes within Allowable Revenue varies from depreciation applied for statutory reporting purposes as a result of an accelerated depreciation profile and di/fferences in applied asset lives. For example, under the 2017 Access Undertaking, the QCA determined that the existing depreciation approach would be retained, including 20-year rolling depreciation for assets included in the RAB post 1 July 2009.\n\nDemand for Australian coal is dependent on seaborne-traded markets which are increasingly concentrated in Asia. Metallurgical coal is primarily used to produce steel and thermal coal is used as a heat source in energy generation. Around 70% of volumes hauled across the network is considered to be metallurgical coal (remaining 30% thermal coal), with demand linked to Asian steel production. Therefore, the useful life of infrastructure assets will be impacted primarily by the future demand for Australian metallurgical coal which is dependent on economic development in Asia including steel intensive growth, alternatives to steel and current steel production methods, competing supply of metallurgical coal, changes in government policies (for example, domestic/imported coal preferences and net-zero emission targets) and technological advancements.\n\nDuring the period, major import nations of Australian coal have set net-zero emissions targets and include China (2060), Japan (2050) and South Korea (2050). India, who is also a significant export market for Australian coal, is yet to set a long-term emissions target.\n\nIn performing its annual review of the appropriateness of the useful lives of infrastructure assets, management monitors and assesses a range of indicators of global coal demand over the short, medium, and long term. Indicators include the following:\n\n- \u203a Asian GDP growth and steel-related demand\n- \u203a global supply competitiveness and Australian supply constraints for metallurgical coal\n- \u203a crude steel production method and scrap metal availability\n\n- \u203a climate policy targets and how they are intended to be met at both a country and corporate level\n- \u203a the viability of new and alternative technologies that are developed to reduce emissions targets such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), and hydrogen-based steel making, that may positively or negatively impact future coal demand\n- \u203a the ability of customers to gain regulatory approvals and raise funding to support development of their resource base.\n\nThe impact of the above indicators and other factors that may emerge on global coal demand and Australian coal supply are uncertain at this time and di/fficult to predict. Consequently, there is a risk that the engineering useful lives assigned to infrastructure assets may require revision to an alternate benchmark in the future, resulting in a change in depreciation rates on a prospective basis. As an indication of sensitivity, if the useful life of assets with a remaining life greater than 50 years were capped at 60 to 70 years, annual depreciation would increase by $4.0 - $9.0 million per annum.\n\n## Useful lives of rollingstock\n\nRollingstock assets are predominantly used by the Coal and Bulk business units to transport bulk commodities to end customers and ports. The useful lives of rollingstock assets are determined based on the expected engineering life and are reviewed annually.\n\nIn performing the annual review of the appropriateness of the useful lives of rollingstock assets, management monitors and assesses a range of indicators influencing demand and supply of rollingstock over the short, medium and long term. Indicators include the following:\n\n- \u203a long-term market and commodity demand under six scenarios developed under our Strategy in Uncertainty framework\n- \u203a our contract position in key markets\n- \u203a flexibility of fleet capacity, including the ability to shift standard gauge fleet between New South Wales and Western Australia (WA), narrow gauge fleet between Queensland and WA, and between commodities within states\n- \u203a competitors fleet mix and their associated investment profile over time\n- \u203a continuous improvement in fleet investment strategies such as those predicated on condition-based and preventative maintenance approaches, as well as advancements in component change-out models.\n- \u203a the risk of obsolescence as alternative technologies are developed\n\nThe impact of the above indicators, and other factors that may emerge, on demand and supply of rollingstock are uncertain. Consequently, there is a risk (both upside and downside) that the engineering useful lives assigned to rollingstock assets may require revision to an alternate benchmark in the future, resulting in a change in depreciation rates on a prospective basis.\n\n## Impairment tests for property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The level of rollingstock required is determined with consideration of the Group's Enterprise Fleet Plan (EFP). Key assumptions include forecast volumes, productivity and contingent fleet requirements. There is a risk that the key assumptions applied in the EFP may be impacted by the e/ffects of indicators described in the useful lives judgements, and do not reflect actual rollingstock requirements.

The leases generally provide the Group with the right to renewal at which time the lease terms are renegotiated. The Group applies the following practical expedients permitted by the standard:\n\n- \u203a payments for short-term leases of less than 12 months are recognised as an expense in profit or loss as incurred; and\n- \u203a payments for leases for which the underlying asset is of a low value are recognised as an expense in profit or loss as incurred.\n\n## Coal infrastructure\n\nThe Group leases infrastructure assets including:\n\n- \u203a CQCN from the State of Queensland; and\n- \u203a North Coast Line owned by Queensland Rail.\n\nThe coal infrastructure assets are leased to Aurizon Network Pty Ltd. The term of each lease is 99 years, expiring on 30 June 2109, at a rental of $1 per year if demanded. The State of Queensland and Queensland Rail (Infrastructure Lessors) have an option to extend the infrastructure leases by a further 99 years, with at least 20 years notice prior to expiry of the existing term. As the rental is only payable if demanded, no lease liability is recognised on the balance sheet for coal infrastructure assets.\n\n## Corridor land and buildings\n\nAurizon Network Pty Ltd, leases corridor land and buildings owned by the State of Queensland. The leases expire on 30 June 2109 and rental is $1 per year if demanded. As the total rental is minimal and only payable if demanded, no lease liability is recognised on the balance sheet for corridor land and buildings.\n\n## (i) Amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet\n\nThe consolidated balance sheet includes the following amounts relating to leased assets:\n\n|                       | 2021  $m   | 2020  $m   |\n|-----------------------|------------|------------|\n| Right-of-use assets   |            |            |\n| Buildings             | 91.5       | 88.8       |\n| Equipment             | 3.0        | 5.6        |\n|                       | 94.5       | 94.4       |\n| Other leased assets 1 |            |            |\n| Coal infrastructure   | 4,341.1    | 4,371.4    |\n| Corridor land         | 25.8       | 25.8       |\n| Buildings             | 1.8        | 1.9        |\n|                       | 4,368.7    | 4,399.1    |\n| Total leased assets   | 4,463.2    | 4,493.5    |\n| Lease liabilities     |            |            |\n| Current               | 17.0       | 17.4       |\n| Non-current           | 120.7      | 125.4      |\n|                       | 137.7      | 142.8      |\n\n- 1   CQCN and North Coast Line assets.\n\n## (ii)  Amounts recognised in consolidated income statement\n\nThe consolidated income statement includes the following amounts relating to leased assets:\n\n|                                                                                 | 2021  $m   | 2020  $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Depreciation of right-of-use assets                                             |            |            |\n| Buildings                                                                       | 10.1       | 13.5       |\n| Equipment                                                                       | 2.6        | 0.7        |\n|                                                                                 | 12.7       | 14.2       |\n| Depreciation of other leased assets                                             |            |            |\n| Coal infrastructure                                                             | 257.3      | 245.7      |\n| Buildings                                                                       | 0.2        | 0.2        |\n|                                                                                 | 257.5      | 245.9      |\n| Total leased assets depreciation                                                | 270.2      | 260.1      |\n| Interest expense                                                                | 5.1        | 5.1        |\n| Expenses relating to short-term leases                                          | 1.6        | 1.4        |\n| Expenses relating to variable lease payments  not included in lease liabilities | 5.9        | 4.8        |\n\nThe total cash outflow for leases during the financial year was $29.0 million (2020: $25.9 million).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Costs include expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items and borrowing costs that are related to the acquisition or construction of an asset. Costs may also include transfers from equity of any gains or losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group. All repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis, except for motor vehicles included in plant and equipment for which depreciation is calculated on a diminishing value method. Straight-line allocates the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment net of residual values over the expected useful life of each asset. Estimates of remaining useful life and residual values are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, on an annual basis.\n\nThe useful lives applied for each class of assets are:\n\n| Infrastructure, including:     |               |\n|--------------------------------|---------------|\n| - Tracks                       | 7 - 50 years  |\n| - Track turnouts               | 20 - 25 years |\n| - Ballast                      | 8 - 20 years  |\n| - Civil works                  | 20 - 88 years |\n| - Bridges                      | 30 - 88 years |\n| - Electrification              | 20 - 50 years |\n| - Field signals                | 15 - 40 years |\n| Buildings                      | 10 - 40 years |\n| Rollingstock, including:       |               |\n| - Locomotives                  | 25 - 35 years |\n| - Locomotives componentisation | 8 - 12 years  |\n| - Wagons                       | 25 - 35 years |\n| - Wagon componentisation       | 10 - 17 years |\n| Plant and equipment            | 3 - 20 years  |\n\nAn asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.\n\n## (ii)  Leases\n\nLeases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Where the Group is a sub-lessor and the sub-lease is for the duration of the head lease, the right-of-use asset recognised from the head lease is derecognised and a lease receivable equal to the present value of future lease payments receivable is recognised.\n\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present-value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:\n\n- \u203a fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;\n- \u203a variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate; and\n- \u203a payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.\n\nThe lease payments are discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate, being the rate that the Group would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:\n\n- \u203a the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;\n- \u203a any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received; and\n- \u203a any initial direct costs.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life which varies from two to 20 years.\n\n## (iii)  Impairment tests for property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment subject to depreciation is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\nIn testing for impairment, the recoverable amount is estimated for an individual asset or, if it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount for the individual asset, the recoverable amount for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. CGUs are the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash flows that are largely independent from the cash flows of other assets or group of assets. Each CGU is no larger than a reportable segment.\n\nAssets are impaired if their carrying value exceeds their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is determined as the higher of its fair value less cost of disposal or value-in-use.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the asset or a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs) and then to reduce the carrying amount of other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs).\n\nWhere there is an indicator that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased, the asset is tested for impairment. The impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount of the asset and is reversed only to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised.",

Goodwill is tested annually or more regularly if there are indicators of impairment.\n\nThe recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the higher of the value-in-use (VIU) method or the fair value less cost of disposal (FVLCD) method, both of which require the use of assumptions. These calculations use cash flow projections extrapolated using estimated growth rates.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of the goodwill allocation and the key assumptions used in determining the recoverable amount:\n\n|                              | Bulk  NSW   | Bulk  QLD   |\n|------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| 2021                         |             |             |\n| Goodwill allocation ($m)     | 19.7        | 5.2         |\n| Valuation approach           | FVLCD       | VIU         |\n| Discount rate basis          | Post-tax    | Pre-tax     |\n| Discount rate (%)            | 8.5         | 10.8        |\n| Cash flow projection (years) | 20          | 4           |\n| Long-term growth rate (%)    | 2.0         | 2.0         |\n| 2020                         |             |             |\n| Goodwill allocation ($m)     | -           | 5.2         |\n| Valuation approach           | -           | VIU         |\n| Discount rate basis          | -           | Pre-tax     |\n| Discount rate (%)            | -           | 10.4        |\n| Cash flow projection (years) | -           | 4           |\n| Long-term growth rate (%)    | -           | 2.0         |\n\n## SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\n## Impairment tests for cash generating units (CGUs) and goodwill\n\nFollowing the acquisition of ConPorts Pty Ltd on 31 December 2020 (refer to note 22(a)), the existing NSW CGU was separated into Bulk NSW and Coal NSW, and the existing Bulk East CGU was renamed Bulk QLD.\n\nCGUs are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. CGUs containing goodwill are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. CGUs that have previously recognised an impairment to the carrying amount are reviewed for impairment reversal whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount may exceed the carrying amount.\n\nIndicators of impairment reversal were identified for the Western Australia CGU. The carrying amount of the Bulk QLD and Bulk NSW CGUs contain goodwill and have therefore also been tested for impairment.\n\nThere is a risk that the assumptions applied in calculating the recoverable amount of the CGUs may be impacted by the e/ffects of indicators described in the useful lives judgements and as a result change the estimated recoverable amount.\n\n## Western Australia CGU\n\nThe recoverable amount of the Western Australia CGU has been determined based on VIU methodology. The calculation uses a fouryear cash flow projection, a pre-tax discount rate of 10.8% (2020: 10.4%) and a long-term growth rate of 2.0% (2020: 2.0%). The Western Australia CGU was tested for sensitivity of the pre-tax discount rate as well as other factors noted below.\n\nThe Western Australia CGU has a small number of customers and the recoverable amount is sensitive to changes in iron ore customer contractual arrangements. The recoverable amount of the CGU was determined taking into consideration expected expiry of iron ore customer contracts. Should contracts with iron ore customers not be renewed or the iron ore customers either cease to operate before the expected end-of-mine life or be unable to comply with current contractual arrangements, it may result in a change to the impairment recorded for the CGU. The recoverable amount of the CGU supports the carrying amount, therefore no further impairment has been recognised. Due to the carrying value being highly sensitive to the iron ore customer assumptions, no reversal of previous impairments has been recognised.\n\n## Bulk QLD CGU\n\nThe recoverable amount of the Bulk QLD CGU has been determined based on VIU methodology and the cash flow projection, pre-tax discount rate and long-term growth rate as described in note 9(a). The Bulk QLD CGU was tested for sensitivity of the pre-tax discount rate and changes in customer contractual arrangements.\n\nThe recoverable amount is sensitive to changes in customer contractual arrangements and should any major contracts not be renewed it may result in a reduction to the recoverable amount of the CGU. The recoverable amount of the CGU supports the carrying amount, including goodwill, therefore no further impairment has been recognised. Due to the sensitivity of the recoverable amount to the renewal of major customer contracts, no reversal of previous impairments has been recognised.\n\n## Bulk NSW CGU\n\nThe Bulk NSW CGU includes goodwill recognised on acquisition of a subsidiary (refer to note 22(a)) in FY2021. The recoverable amount of the CGU has been determined based on FVLCD methodology and the cash flow projection, post-tax discount rate and a long-term growth rate as described in note 9(a). The recoverable amount of the CGU supports the carrying amount, therefore no impairment has been recognised.",

Goodwill is initially measured as the amount the Group paid to acquire a business over and above the fair value of net assets acquired.\n\n## (ii)  Software\n\nCosts incurred in developing products or systems, and costs incurred in acquiring software and licenses that will contribute to future period financial benefits through revenue generation and/or cost reduction are capitalised to software and systems. Costs capitalised include external direct costs of materials and service, employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Software development costs include only those costs directly attributable to the development phase, and are only recognised following completion of technical feasibility and where the Group has an intention and ability to use the asset.\n\nSoftware-as-a-Service (SaaS) arrangements are service contracts which provide the right to access the cloud provider's application software over the contract period. Costs incurred to configure or customise, and the ongoing licence fees, are recognised as an expense in profit or loss. Some of these costs incurred are for the development of software code that enhances or creates additional capability to existing systems and are recognised as an intangible asset when the recognition criteria are met.\n\nSoftware is stated at historical cost, less any accumulated amortisation or impairment. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life which varies from three to 11 years.\n\n## 10 Other assets\n\n|                      | 2021  $m   | 2020  $m   |\n|----------------------|------------|------------|\n| Current              |            |            |\n| Contract assets (a)  | 2.1        | 1.3        |\n| Lease receivable (b) | 7.2        | 6.5        |\n| Other current assets | 6.0        | 7.0        |\n|                      | 15.3       | 14.8       |\n| Non-current          |            |            |\n| Contract assets (a)  | 37.1       | 21.9       |\n| Lease receivable (b) | 41.5       | 48.6       |\n|                      | 78.6       | 70.5       |\n\n## (a)  Contract assets\n\nRefer to note 2(b) for further information relating to contract assets.\n\n## (b)  Lease receivable\n\nLease receivables represent the present value of future lease payments receivable on sub-lease arrangements where the expiry of the term of the sub-lease is the same as the head lease.\n\nMinimum lease payments receivable on sub-leases are as follows:\n\n|                                                       | 2021  $m   | 2020  $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Within one year                                       | 8.7        | 8.2        |\n| Later than one year but not later than five years     | 28.6       | 32.9       |\n| Later than five years                                 | 18.2       | 22.6       |\n|                                                       | 55.5       | 63.7       |\n| Less: Unearned interest income                        | (6.8)      | (8.6)      |\n| Total lease receivables                               | 48.7       | 55.1       |\n| Interest income relating to   sub-lease arrangements  | 1.8        | 1.9        |\n| Income relating to variable lease   payments received | 7.1        | 7.6        |\n\nThe total cash inflow for sub-leases in the financial year was $15.4 million (2020: $15.2 million).\n\n## 11  Trade and other payables\n\n|                | 2021  $m   | 2020  $m   |\n|----------------|------------|------------|\n| Current        |            |            |\n| Trade payables | 234.0      | 289.0      |\n| Other payables | 35.1       | 34.0       |\n|                | 269.1      | 323.0      |\n\n## (a)  Accounting policies\n\nTrade and other payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of financial year which are unpaid.

The Group does not expect all employees to take the full amount of accrued leave or require payment within the next 12 months based on past experience. The current provision for employee benefits includes $109.5 million (2020: $105.6 million) that is not expected to be taken or paid within the next 12 months.\n\n## (i) Superannuation\n\nThe Group pays an employer subsidy to the Government Superannuation O/ffice in respect of employees who are contributors to the Public Sector Superannuation (QSuper) scheme.\n\nEmployer contributions to the QSuper Defined Benefit Fund are determined by the State of Queensland Treasurer having regard to advice from the State Actuary. The primary obligation to fund the defined benefits obligations are that of the State, however the Treasurer has the discretion to request contributions from employers that contribute to the defined benefit category of QSuper. No liability is recognised for accruing superannuation benefits as this liability is held on a whole-ofGovernment basis and reported in the whole-of-Government financial statements. The State Actuary performs a full actuarial valuation of the assets and liabilities of the fund at least every three years. The latest valuation was completed as at 30 June 2020 and the State Actuary found the fund was in surplus from a whole-of-Government perspective. The Defined Benefit Fund was closed to new members in 2007, therefore any potential future deficit would be diluted as membership decreases. Accordingly, no asset or liability is recognised for the Group's share of any potential surplus or deficit of the QSuper Defined Benefit Fund. The State has provided the Group with an indemnity if the Treasurer requires the Group to pay any amounts required to meet any potential deficit. The indemnity is subject to the Group not taking any unilateral action, other than with the approval of the State that causes a significant increase in unfunded liabilities.\n\nThe Group also makes superannuation guarantee payments into the QSuper Accumulation Fund (Non-Contributory) and QSuper Accumulation Fund (Contributory) administered by the Government Superannuation O/ffice and to other complying Superannuation Funds designated by employees nominating Choice of Fund.\n\n## (b)  Accounting policies\n\nA provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the present value of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date.",

They are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.\n\nLiabilities for annual leave and long service leave are measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting date. Expected future payments that are not expected to be settled within 12 months are discounted using market yield at the reporting date of Australian corporate bond rates and reflects the terms to maturity. Remeasurements as a result of adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nA liability for short-term incentive plans is recognised based on a formula that takes into consideration the Group and individual key performance indicators. The Group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.\n\nA termination benefit is payable when the Group decides to terminate the employment, or when an employee accepts redundancy in exchange for these benefits. A provision is recognised at the earlier of when the Group can no longer withdraw the o/ffer of those benefits or when the Group recognises costs for restructuring and is measured using the present value of the expected amounts to be paid to settle the obligation.\n\nEmployee benefits are presented as current liabilities in the balance sheet if the Group does not have any unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the reporting period, regardless of when the actual settlement is expected to occur.\n\n## (ii)  Provision for insurance claims\n\nA provision for insurance claims is raised for insurance claims external to the Group and represents the aggregate deductible component in relation to loss or damage to property, plant and equipment.\n\n## (iii)  Litigation and workers compensation provision\n\nA provision is made for the estimated liability for workers' compensation and litigation claims. Claims are assessed separately for common law, statutory and asbestos claims. Estimates are made based on the average number of claims and average claim payments over a specified period of time. Claims that are Incurred But Not Reported are also included in the estimate.\n\n## (iv)  Land rehabilitation\n\nA provision is recognised for the present value of estimated costs of land rehabilitation where the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to restore a site.\n\nAn inflation rate of 2.4% (2020: 1.6%) is applied to estimate future land rehabilitation costs. This estimate is discounted at a weighted average discount rate of 2.0% (2020: 1.2%) to determine the present value of the provision. The unwinding of the discount is recognised in profit or loss in finance costs.\n\n## 13 Other liabilities\n\n|                               | 2021  $m   | 2020  $m   |\n|-------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Current                       |            |            |\n| Contract liabilities (a)      | 56.5       | 28.5       |\n| Income received in advance    | 1.3        | 36.9       |\n| Lease liabilities (b)         | 17.0       | 17.4       |\n| Other current liabilities     | 16.8       | 18.5       |\n|                               | 91.6       | 101.3      |\n| Non-current                   |            |            |\n| Contract liabilities (a)      | 135.0      | 150.4      |\n| Lease liabilities (b)         | 120.7      | 125.4      |\n| Other non-current liabilities | 1.4        | 1.5        |\n|                               | 257.1      | 277.3      |\n\n## (a)  Contract liabilities\n\nRefer to note 2(b) for further information relating to contract liabilities.\n\n## (b)  Lease liabilities\n\nLease liabilities represent the present value of future lease payments.

Refer to note 28 for further details of the Group's performance rights plans.\n\nThe fair value of rights granted are recognised as an employee benefits expense in profit or loss with a corresponding increase in the sharebased payment reserve in equity and is spread over the vesting period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the right.\n\nWhere the Company purchases ordinary shares to satisfy performance rights plans, the consideration paid is deducted from the share-based payment reserve.\n\n## (iii)  Capital reserve\n\nThe capital reserve represents capital contributions from the Queensland State Government prior to the listing of the Company on the ASX. Incremental costs attributable to share buy-backs and certain on-market share buy-backs are deducted from capital reserves.\n\n## (iv)  Foreign currency translation reserve\n\nOn consolidation all exchange di/fferences arising from translation of controlled entities with a financial currency that is not Australian dollars are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve. When a foreign operation is disposed, the cumulative amount recognised within the reserve relating to that foreign operation is transferred to profit or loss.\n\n## 17 Borrowings\n\nThe Group borrows money through bank debt facilities and the issuance of debt securities in capital markets.\n\nThe carrying amount of the Group's borrowings are as follows:\n\n|                             | 2021  $m   | 2020  $m   |\n|-----------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Current - Unsecured         |            |            |\n| Medium-Term Notes           | -          | 524.6      |\n| Bank debt facilities        | 59.0       | 133.0      |\n|                             | 59.0       | 657.6      |\n| Non-current - Unsecured     |            |            |\n| Medium-Term Notes           | 3,210.4    | 2,249.8    |\n| Bank debt facilities        | 480.0      | 710.0      |\n| Capitalised borrowing costs | (11.4)     | (10.2)     |\n|                             | 3,679.0    | 2,949.6    |\n| Total borrowings            | 3,738.0    | 3,607.2    |\n\nThe Group's bank debt facilities contain financial covenants. The bank debt facilities and Medium-Term Notes contain general undertakings including negative pledge clauses which restrict the amount of security that the Group can provide over assets in certain circumstances. The Group has complied with all required covenants and undertakings throughout the reporting period.\n\nThe Group manages its exposure to interest rate risk as set out in note 18(a). Details of the Group's financing arrangements and exposure to risks arising from borrowings are set out in note 18(b).\n\nDetails of changes to the Group's financing arrangements during the reporting period are outlined in key events and transactions.\n\n## (a)  Accounting policies\n\nBorrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, less directly attributable borrowing costs. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest rate method.\n\nDirectly attributable borrowing costs are capitalised and amortised over the expected term of the bank debt facilities and Medium-Term Notes.\n\nBorrowings are classified as current liabilities, except for those liabilities where the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the reporting period which are classified as noncurrent liabilities.",

The gain or loss on remeasurement is recognised immediately in profit or loss unless the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, in which case the remeasurement is recognised in equity.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nAt inception of the hedge relationship, the Group formally designated the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment at hedge inception date and on an ongoing basis as to whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been and will continue to be highly e/ffective in o/ffsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.\n\nThe Group enters into hedge relationships where the critical terms of the hedging instrument match exactly with the terms of the hedged item and a qualitative assessment is performed to assess e/ffectiveness. If changes in circumstances a/ffect the terms of the hedged item, such as the terms no longer match exactly with the critical terms of the hedged instrument, a hypothetical derivative method is used to assess e/ffectiveness.\n\n## Rebalancing\n\nIf the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective remains unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Any hedge ine/ffectiveness is calculated and accounted for at the time of the hedge relationship rebalancing.\n\nFor the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges and are accounted for as set out in the table below.\n\nHedges that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:\n\n| Risk                                | Fair value hedge                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Cash flow hedge                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| What is it?                         | A derivative or financial instrument designated as  hedging the change in fair value of a recognised asset  or liability or firm commitment. A fair value hedge is  used to swap fixed interest payments to variable interest  payments in order to manage the Group's exposure to  interest rate risk.                                                         | A derivative or financial instrument hedging the exposure  to variability in cash flow attributable to a particular  risk associated with an asset, liability or forecasted  transaction. A cash flow hedge is used to swap variable  interest rate payments to fixed interest rate payments,  or to lock in foreign currency rates in order to manage  the Group's exposure to interest rate risk and foreign  exchange risk.                                                      |\n| Movement in fair value              | Changes in the fair value of the derivative are  recognised in profit or loss, together with the changes in  fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to  the hedged risk.

The change in the fair value that is identified  as ine/ffective is recognised immediately in profit or loss  within other income or other expense. Amounts accumulated in equity are transferred to profit                                                                                 |\n| Discontinuation of hedge accounting | If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge  accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a  hedged item for which the e/ffective interest method is used is amortised to profit or loss in finance income over  the period to maturity using a recalculated e/ffective  interest rate.                                                         | When a hedging instrument expires or is sold or  terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria  for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing  in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised  when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in  profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer  expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was  reported in equity is immediately transferred to profit   or loss. |",

Where certain credit events occur, such as default, the net position owing/receivable to a single counterparty in the same currency will be taken as owing and all the relevant arrangements terminated. The Group does not currently have legally enforceable right of set-o/ff between transaction types and therefore these amounts are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nISDA's held with counterparties allow for the netting of payments and receipts for the settlement of interest rate swap transactions.\n\n## (d)  Fair value measurement\n\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, and non-interest bearing financial assets and liabilities approximates fair value due to their shortterm maturity.\n\nThe fair value of borrowings is estimated by discounting future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rates that are available to the Group for similar financial instruments. The market interest rates were determined to be between 1.0% and 3.2% (2020: 0.9% and 3.0%) depending on the type of facility.\n\nThe Group measures the fair value of financial instruments using market observable data where possible. Fair values are categorised into three levels with each of these levels indicating the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:\n\nLevel 1: Quoted prices for an identical asset or liability in an active market Level 2: Directly or indirectly observable market data Level 3: Unobservable market data.\n\nThe fair value of forward exchange contracts are determined as the unrealised gain/(loss) with reference to market rates. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined as the net present value of contracted cash flows. The existing exposure method, which estimates future cash flows to present value using credit adjusted discount factors after counterparty netting arrangements, has been adopted for both forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.\n\nThe fair value of CCIRS is determined as the net present value of contract cash flows.

The Group's share of net assets from investment in joint ventures at reporting date are $26.1 million (2020: $2.7 million) and are not considered material.\n\n## (a)  Accounting policies\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Investments are initially recognised at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group's share of net profit or loss. The carrying value of an investment is reduced by the value of dividends received from the associate or joint venture.\n\nWhen the Group's share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest, including any other unsecured long-term receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.\n\nThe carrying amount of investments are tested for impairment in accordance with the policy described in note 8.\n\n## 20 Material  subsidiaries\n\nThe ultimate parent of the Group is Aurizon Holdings Limited.

The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to a/ffect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity.\n\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. Transactions between continuing and discontinued operations are treated as external from the date that the operation was discontinued. Where arrangements between the continuing and discontinued operations will continue subsequent to disposal, transactions including revenue and expenses are included in continuing operations profit or loss with elimination entries recognised in profit or loss of the discontinued operation.\n\nInter-company transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## (b)  Changes in ownership interest\n\nWhen the Group ceases to have control, joint control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The remeasured fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest of an associate, joint venture or financial asset. Any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities and may result in amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income being reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nIf the ownership interest in a joint venture or an associate is reduced but joint control or significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.",

The Group has implemented this guidance and determined that there is no material impact as a result of the change in accounting policy.\n\nThe Group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for the reporting period commencing 1 July 2020:\n\n- \u203a AASB 2018-7 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards Definition of Material\n- \u203a AASB 2018-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards Definition of a Business\n- \u203a  AASB  2019-3 Amendments to Australia Accounting Standards Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n- \u203a  AASB  2019-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards Disclosures of the E/ffect of New IFRS Standards Not Yet issued in Australia\n- \u203a  AASB  2019-1 Amendments to Australia Accounting Standards References to the Conceptual Framework.\n\nThe Group also elected to adopt the following amendments early:\n\n- \u203a  AASB 2020-8 A mendments to Australia Accounting Standards Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2.\n\nThe Interest Rate Benchmark Reform amendments modify specific hedge accounting requirements to allow hedge accounting to continue during the period of uncertainty relating to the benchmark reforms for a/ffected cash flow and fair value hedges related to the Group's EMTNs. The Interest Rate Benchmark Reform and other amendments listed above did not have any impact on the amounts recognised in prior years and are not expected to significantly a/ffect the current or future years.\n\n## (ii)  New standards and interpretations not yet adopted\n\nCertain new accounting standards and amendments to standards have been published that are not mandatory for reporting periods commencing 1 July 2020 and have not been early adopted by the Group. These standards are not expected to have a material impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.\n\n## (b)  Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash at-bank and on-hand, and shortterm money market investments with an original maturity of three months or less and are classified as financial assets held at amortised cost.\n\nCash at-bank earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposits. Short-term deposits are made for varying periods, depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group and earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates.\n\n## (c)  Foreign currency and commodity transactions\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the entities included within the Group are measured using the currency of the economic environment in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash. These financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is the functional and presentation currency of the Company.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of the entity using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the translation of the monetary assets and liabilities, or from the settlement of foreign currency translations, are recognised in profit or loss, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges. The amounts deferred in equity in respect of cash flow hedges are recognised in profit or loss when the hedged item a/ffects profit or loss.\n\nAs at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of entities within the Group that have a functional currency di/fferent from the presentation currency, are translated into Australian dollar at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and profit or loss are translated at the average exchange for the year. The exchange di/fferences arising on the balance sheet translation are taken directly to a separate component in equity in the foreign currency translation reserve.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements 30 June 2021 (continued)\n\n## (d)  Business combinations\n\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. In accordance with the acquisition method, the Group measures goodwill, at acquisition date, as the fair value of the consideration transferred less the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. The fair value of the consideration transferred comprises the initial cash paid and an estimate for any future contingent or deferred payments the Group may be liable to pay.\n\nThe application of the acquisition method requires certain estimates and assumptions to be made particularly around the determination of fair value of any contingent or deferred consideration, the acquired intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and liabilities assumed. Such estimates are based on information available at acquisition date.\n\nAcquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nPredecessor value method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations that involve entities under common control. Acquired assets and liabilities are recorded at their existing carrying values and no goodwill is recorded. Retrospective presentation of the acquired entity's results and balance sheet are incorporated as if both entities had always been combined.\n\n## (e)   Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nNon-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost of disposal, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits, financial assets and investment property that are carried at fair value and contractual rights under insurance contracts, which are specifically exempt from this requirement.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent writedown of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less cost of disposal. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less cost of disposal of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognised at the date of derecognition.\n\nNon-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale continue to be recognised.\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the consolidated income statement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (f)  Financial instruments\n\n## (i) Non-derivative financial assets\n\nThe Group initially recognises financial assets on the trade date at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred, and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\nFinancial assets are initially measured at fair value. If the financial asset is not subsequently accounted for at fair value through profit or loss, then the initial measurement includes transaction costs that are directly attributable to the asset's acquisition or origination. On initial recognition, the Group classifies its financial assets as subsequently measured at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on its business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets.\n\n## (ii)  Financial assets measured at amortised cost\n\nA financial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the e/ffective interest method and net of any impairment loss, if:\n\n- \u203a  the asset is held within the business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and\n- \u203a  the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.\n\nThe Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset (or group of financial assets) is impaired.\n\n## (iii)  Non-derivative liabilities\n\nThe Group initially recognises loans and debt securities issued on the date when they originate. Other financial liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date. The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire.\n\nNon-derivative financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest method.\n\n## (g)   Goods and Services Tax (GST)\n\nRevenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation O/ffice (ATO). In this case, the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense.\n\nReceivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO is included with other receivables or payables in the balance sheet.\n\nCash flows are presented in the cash flow statement on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the ATO, are presented as operating cash flows.\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are grouped for GST purposes. Therefore, any inter-company transactions within the Group do not attract GST.",

Should duty become payable in respect of the restructure (for example, due to a change in ownership of Aurizon Network Pty Ltd within three years of the transfer of the shares in FY2019), Aurizon estimates the duty liability may be approximately $295 million.\n\n## (b)  Contingent assets\n\n## Guarantees and letters of credit\n\nFor information about guarantees given to the Group, refer to note 18(d).\n\n## Wiggins Island Rail Project (WIRP)\n\nThe amount of WIRP fees ultimately payable by WIRP customers will be dependent upon finalisation of the appeal of the Expert's Determination and finalisation of a cost variation factor related to WIRP project costs. WIRP fees of $60.3 million, including $48.9 million of historical fees (relating to FY2016 - FY2020), have been recognised in FY2021 (2020: $nil).\n\n## (c)  Capital commitments\n\nAt 30 June 2021, the Group has capital commitments contracted but not provided for in respect of the acquisition of property, plant and equipment of $77.3 million (2020: $102.6 million) which are due within one year.\n\n## 32   Events occurring after the reporting period\n\nNo matter or circumstance, other than the matters disclosed in key events and transactions for the reporting period, has occurred subsequent to the financial period that has significantly a/ffected, or may significantly a/ffect, the operations of the Group, the results of those operations, the state of a/ffairs of the Group or economic entity in subsequent financial periods.",

To calculate materiality, we adjusted profit before income tax for significant unusual items such as the sale of an interest in an equity-accounted investment and discontinued operations. These adjustments were tested separately using a specific materiality level.\n- \u25cf We utilised a 5% threshold based on our professional judgement, noting it is within the range of commonly acceptable thresholds.\n- \u25cf Our audit focused on where the Group made subjective judgements; for example, significant accounting estimates involving assumptions and inherently uncertain future events.\n- \u25cf The Group is a large railbased freight operator and transports coal, iron ore and other bulk commodities across Australia.\n- \u25cf The Group also owns and operates the Central Queensland Coal Network (CQCN) which is a multiuser track network that comprises  four major coal systems and one connecting system serving Queensland's Bowen Basin coal region.\n- \u25cf Amongst other relevant topics, we communicated the following key audit matters to the Audit, Governance and Risk Management Committee:\n- -Access revenue recognition\n- -Recoverability of the Western Australia and Bulk Queensland cash generating units (CGUs)\n- -Assessment of useful lives of assets\n- \u25cf These are further described in the Key audit matters section of our report.",

The key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Further, any commentary on the outcomes of a particular audit procedure is made in that context.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## Access revenue recognition\n\n(Refer to note 2 and Key events and transactions for the reporting period)\n\nTake-or-Pay access revenue recognition - $77.5m\n\nDuring the year ended 30 June 2021 (FY2021), the Group recorded track access revenue of $1,166.4m.\n\nTrack access revenue is recognised over time as access to the Central Queensland Rail Network (CQCN) is provided and is measured on a number of operating parameters, including the volume hauled and regulator (Queensland Competition Authority (QCA)) approved pricing tariffs.\n\nThe tariffs are determined with reference to the total allowable revenue, applied to the regulatory approved annual volume forecast for each rail system.\n\nWhere annual volumes railed are less than the regulatory forecast, Take-or-Pay clauses may be triggered. Take-or-Pay is calculated based on the Group's judgement of below rail cause versus above rail operator/mine cancellations.\n\nIn FY2021, the Group determined Take-or-Pay clauses have been triggered under the 2017 Access Undertaking resulting in $77.5m of revenue being recognised where the Group considered that customers have not railed their nominated forecast volumes and the reason for the shortfall was not due to Aurizon Network's management of the CQCN.\n\nThere is judgement by the Group involved in respect of the revenue recognised in accordance with the Take-or-Pay clauses in determining whether the shortfall to nominated forecast volumes is due to below rail cause or above rail operator/mine cancellations.\n\nHow our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nThe following procedures, amongst others, were performed in relation to Take-or-Pay access revenue recognition:\n\n- \u25cf Obtained the computation for the Take-orPay revenue and compared the basis of the calculations to the 2017 Access Undertaking.\n- \u25cf Agreed on a sample basis the Take-or-Pay calculation inputs (including operational units such as tonnages hauled, train paths, consist configuration, kilometres travelled etc.) to underlying customer contracts and other relevant documentation.\n- \u25cf Tested the mathematical accuracy of the Take-or-Pay calculations.\n- \u25cf Compared the QCA approved tariffs and forecast volumes to actual volumes and revenue recognised during the financial year to assess the shortfall and whether Take-orPay clauses were triggered.\n- \u25cf Evaluated on a sample basis the evidence in respect of  the service cancellations considered for Take or Pay calculations and assessed the Group's determination of whether the cause for the resulting volume shortfall was due to below rail or any other cause.",

The Expert's determination was issued in June 2019 and found that the WIRP fee should be partially reduced however the Group has appealed this decision. Due to this, the fee payable by the customers and revenue recognised by the Group is dependent on the finalisation of the appeal and finalisation of a cost variation factor related to the project costs.\n\nWe considered revenue recognition to be a key audit matter due to the complexity and judgement in the determination of Take-or-Pay and WIRP revenue.\n\n## Recoverability of the Western Australia and Bulk Queensland cash generating units (CGUs)\n\n(Refer to note 9)\n\nWestern Australia (WA) and Bulk Queensland (QLD) CGUs\n\nThe WA and Bulk QLD CGUs have been impaired from FY2017 to FY2019 due to the loss of key customers, challenging and competitive Bulk markets and operational performance issues.\n\nDuring FY2021, impairment reversal indicators have been identified by the Group for the WA and Bulk QLD CGUs.\n\nThe recoverable amounts of the CGUs have been estimated using value in use (VIU) methodology utilising a discounted cash flow model.\n\nIn estimating the recoverable amounts, the Group has made the following key judgements:\n\n- \u25cf Current contractual arrangements with key customers are complied with taking into consideration the expected expiry and/or renewal of the contracts; and\n- \u25cf A terminal value growth rate of 2.0% and the pre-tax discount rate of 10.8%.\n\nWiggins Island Rail Project (WIRP) revenue recognition\n\n- \u25cf Obtained the computation for WIRP revenue and on a sample basis, agreed the inputs (target costs, base fee applicable to each of the customers etc.) of the calculation to the underlying WIRP Deeds and relevant documentation.\n- \u25cf Tested the mathematical accuracy of the WIRP revenue calculation.\n- \u25cf Obtained an understanding of the Group's assessment and determination of the revenue recognised in relation to the historical and current year's fees in light of the ongoing dispute between the parties to the WIRP Deed.\n- \u25cf Evaluated the appropriateness of the judgements made by the Group in relation to the Expert's determination and the pending finalisation of the cost variation factor related to WIRP project costs.\n\nTo evaluate the Group's assessment of the recoverable amount of the WA and QLD CGUs, we performed a number of procedures including the following:\n\n- \u25cf Assessed whether the division of the Group's property, plant and equipment assets into CGUs was consistent with our knowledge of the Group's operations and internal Group reporting.\n- \u25cf Assessed whether the carrying value of the CGUs included all assets and liabilities directly attributable to the CGU and that the model included all cash flows directly attributable to the CGU and a reasonable allocation of corporate overheads.\n- \u25cf Evaluated the Group's historical ability to forecast future cash flows by comparing budgets with reported prior years' actual results.",

        "page_content": "## Non-IFRS Financial Information in FY2021 Annual Report\n\nIn addition to using profit as a measure of the Group and its segments' financial performance, Aurizon uses EBITDA (Statutory and Underlying), EBITDA margin - Underlying, EBIT (Statutory and Underlying), NPAT - Underlying, Return On Invested Capital (ROIC), Net debt and Net gearing ratio. These measurements are not defined under IFRS and are, therefore, termed 'Non-IFRS' measures.\n\nEBITDA - Statutory is Group profit before net finance costs, tax, depreciation and amortisation, while EBIT - Statutory is defined as Group profit before net finance costs and tax. EBIT - Underlying can di/ffer from EBIT Statutory due to exclusion of significant items that permits a more appropriate and meaningful analysis of the underlying performance on a comparative basis. EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing underlying EBITDA by total revenue. These measures are considered to be useful measures of the Group's operating performance because they approximate the underlying operating cash flows by eliminating depreciation and amortisation.\n\nNPAT - Underlying represents underlying EBIT less finance costs, tax expense and the tax impact of significant adjustments.\n\nROIC is defined as underlying rolling 12-month EBIT divided by average invested capital. Average invested capital is calculated as the rolling twelve-month average of net assets (excluding cash, borrowings, tax, derivative financial assets and liabilities). This measure is intended to ensure there is alignment between investment in infrastructure and superior returns for shareholders.\n\nNet debt consists of borrowings (both current and non-current) less cash and cash equivalents. Net debt excludes lease liabilities. Net gearing ratio is defined as Net debt divided by Net debt plus Equity. Net debt and Net gearing ratio are measures of the Group's indebtedness and provides an indicator of the balance sheet strength. An alternative Net debt and Net gearing ratio are also disclosed to include derivative financial instruments used to hedge market risk on borrowings.\n\nThese above mentioned measures are commonly used by management, investors and financial analysts to evaluate companies' performance.\n\nA reconciliation of the Non-IFRS measures and specific items to the nearest measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is included in the table. The Non-IFRS financial information contained within this Directors' report and Notes to the Financial Statements has not been audited in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards.\n\n|                                                          | 2021                      | 2021                        | 2020                      | 2020                        |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                                          | Continuing  operations $m | Discontinued  operations $m | Continuing  operations $m | Discontinued  operations $m |\n| NPAT -
