        "page_content": "## 1. Letter to Shareholders\n\n## Dear Shareholders,\n\n2021 was a year full of challenges and opportunities for TSMC, as the COVID-19 pandemic persisted against a backdrop of strong semiconductor industry growth. Although the wide availability of vaccines has provided much-needed protection, outbreaks from new variants of the virus continued to lead to heavy health institution overloads, sporadic lockdowns and global supply chain disruptions in 2021. TSMC took stringent precautions to protect the health and safety of our employees, while safeguarding our fab operations to ensure we continue to support our customers amidst the pandemic. At the same time, global demand for semiconductors exceeded supply, driven by concerns of supply chain disruptions during the pandemic, and the accelerated digital transformation brought in by COVID-remote lifestyle. Thus, semiconductor shortages became an issue for many areas of the global supply chain in 2021.\n\nTo fulfill TSMC's mission of being the global logic IC industry's trusted technology and capacity provider, we focused diligently on improving our productivity and increasing our fab operations quality, to generate more wafer output from our existing capacity to support the fast-growing demand from our customers. We also continued to enhance our service, enrich our R&D infrastructure, expand our capacity, and invest to support our customers' growth. Our capital spending increased to US$30 billion in 2021. Through our relentless efforts, we delivered a twelfth-consecutive year of record revenue, thanks to strong demand for our industry-leading advanced and specialty technologies, and our 2021 annual revenue increased 24.9% year-over-year in US dollar terms.\n\nWe believe TSMC is entering a period of higher structural growth, as the multi-year megatrends of 5G and High Performance Computing (HPC)-related applications are expected to fuel massive demand for computation power, which expand the use of leading edge technologies. The structural increase in the long-term market demand profile will drive growth across our smartphone, HPC, IoT and Automotive platforms, and TSMC is working closely with our customers to plan our capacity, and accelerating our investments in both leading edge and specialty technologies to support their demand.\n\nWe are also expanding our global manufacturing footprint in the U.S., Japan and China to better serve our customers, reach for global talents, and sustain and enhance our competitive advantages. We are also aggressively accelerating our digital transformation in our company operations to support our fast expansion.\n\nAt the same time, we are committed to achieving a sustainable and proper return that enables us to invest to support our customers' growth. Our pricing strategy will remain strategic, not opportunistic, to reflect our value creation. We will also work diligently in our fab operations, and with our suppliers, to deliver on cost improvements. By taking such actions, we can continue to invest to support our customers' growth, and deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders.\n\nTo address the insatiable demand for energy-efficient computing power, customers rely on TSMC not only for reliable capacity, but also a predictable pace of technology development.\n\nIn its second year of volume ramp, our N5 technology has proven to be the industry's most competitive leading edge technology.

According to TSMC's Compensation Committee Charter, the distribution of compensation to directors shall be made in accordance with TSMC's 'Rules for Distribution of Compensation to Directors' based on the following principles: (1) directors who also serve as executive officers of the Company are not entitled to receive compensation; (2) the compensation for independent directors may be higher than the other directors, as all independent directors also serve as members of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee and thus participate in the discussions as well as resolutions of related committee meetings in accordance with the charter of each committee; and (3) the compensation for overseas independent directors may be higher than domestic independent directors, as they require additional time to attend quarterly meetings in Taiwan.\n\nNote 2: Mr. Stan Shih's tenure expired on July 26, 2021 because he was not re-elected at the 2021 Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nNote 3: Dr. L. Rafael Reif was elected as TSMC's independent director at TSMC's Annual Shareholders' Meeting on July 26, 2021.\n\nNote 4: Pensions funded according to applicable law.\n\nNote 5: The above-mentioned figures include expenses for Company cars and related reimbursements, but do not include compensation paid to Company drivers (totaled NT$4,142,123). Note 6: Total remuneration paid to the directors from TSMC and from all consolidated entities in 2020, including their employee compensation, both accounted for 0.1832% of 2020 net income.",

We believe that the basis for successful corporate governance is a sound and effective Board of Directors. In line with this principle, the TSMC Board delegates various responsibilities and authority to two Board Committees, Audit Committee and Compensation Committee. Each Committee has a written charter approved by the Board. Each Committee's chairperson regularly reports to the Board on the activities and actions of the relevant committee.\n\n## 2021 Corporate Governance Awards and Ratings\n\n| Organization                            | Awards                                                                                                                                                     |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) | Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the 21 st  consecutive year Dow Jones Sustainability Emerging Markets Index                                       |\n| MSCI ESG Indexes                        | MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders Index component MSCI ESG Research - AAA Ratings MSCI ACWI SRI Index component MSCI Emerging Markets ESG Leaders Index                |\n| Sustainalytics                          | Company ESG Risk Ratings: Low ESG Risk - Semiconductor Industry                                                                                            |\n| ISS ESG                                 | 'Prime' Rated by ISS ESG Corporate Rating                                                                                                                  |\n| FTSE4Good Index                         | FTSE4Good Emerging Index component FTSE4Good All-World Index component FTSE4Good TIP Taiwan ESG Index component                                            |\n| Corporate Knights                       | Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations                                                                                                                   |\n| RobecoSAM (S&P Global)                  | The Sustainability Yearbook Award 2021 - Silver Class                                                                                                      |\n| TIME Magazine                           | TIME100 Most Influential Companies                                                                                                                         |\n| Institutional Investor Magazine         | Most Honored Company (Technology/Semiconductors) - All-Asia Best Overall ESG (Technology/Semiconductors) - 1 st  Place (buy-side and sell-side) - All-Asia |\n| FORTUNE                                 | 2021 World's Most Admired Companies Fortune Global 500                                                                                                     |\n| Forbes                                  | The World's Top 10 Largest Technology Companies in 2021 World's Best Employers                                                                             |\n| FinanceAsia                             | Best Managed Listed Company                                                                                                                                |\n| Asiamoney                               | 2021 Asia's Outstanding Companies - Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment Sector for the 4 th  consecutive year                                         |\n| Taiwan Stock Exchange                   | Top 5% in Corporate Governance Evaluation of Listed Companies for the 7 th  consecutive year                                                               |\n| CommonWealth Magazine                   | Excellence in Corporate Social Responsibility Award - Large cap - 1 st  Place                                                                              |\n| Taiwan Institute of Sustainable Energy  | The Most Prestigious Sustainability Awards - Top Ten Domestic Corporates for the 6 th  consecutive year                                                    |\n\n## 3.2 Board of Directors\n\n## Board Structure\n\nTSMC's Board of Directors consists of ten distinguished members with a great breadth of experience as world-class business leaders or professionals. We deeply rely on them for their diverse knowledge, personal perspectives, and solid business judgment. Six of those ten members are Independent Directors: former British Telecommunications Chief Executive Officer, Sir Peter L. Bonfield; former Chairman of National Performing Arts Center and former Advisor of Executive Yuan, R.O.C., Ms. Kok-Choo Chen; former Chairman of Applied Materials, Inc., Mr. Michael R. Splinter; former Chief Executive Officer of Xilinx, Inc., Mr. Moshe N. Gavrielov; currently Chairman of Delta Electronics Inc., Mr. Yancey Hai; and currently President of MIT, Mr. L. Rafael Reif.\n\nTSMC's Board is comprised of a diverse group of professionals from different backgrounds in industries, academia, law, etc. These professionals include citizens from Taiwan, Europe and the U.S. with world-class business operating experience, one of whom is female. Independent Directors constitute 60% of the Board.\n\n## Board Responsibilities\n\nInheriting the spirit of TSMC's Founder, Dr. Morris Chang's philosophy on corporate governance, under the leadership of Chairman Dr. Mark Liu and CEO & Vice Chairman Dr. C.C. Wei, TSMC's Board of Directors takes a serious and forthright approach to its duties and is a dedicated, competent and independent Board.\n\nThe Board's primary duty is to supervise the Company's compliance with relevant laws and regulations, financial transparency, timely disclosure of material information, and maintaining of the highest integrity. TSMC's Board of Directors strives to perform these responsibilities through its Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee, the hiring of a financial expert consultant for the Audit Committee, and coordination with our Internal Audit department.\n\nThe second duty of the Board of Directors is to evaluate the management's performance and to appoint and dismiss officers of the Company when necessary. TSMC's management has maintained a healthy and functional communication with the Board of Directors, has been devoted in executing guidance of the Board, and is dedicated in running the business operations, all to achieve the best interests for TSMC shareholders.\n\nThe third duty of the Board of Directors is to resolve important, concrete matters, such as capital appropriations, investment activities, dividends, etc.\n\nThe fourth duty of the Board of Directors is to provide guidance to the management team of the Company. Quarterly, TSMC's management reports to the Board on a variety of subjects (including ESG programs). The management also reviews the Company's business strategies with the Board and updates TSMC's Board on the progress of those strategies, obtaining Board guidance as appropriate.\n\n## Nomination and Election of Directors\n\nTSMC envisions the membership of its esteemed Board of Directors to be composed of highly ethical professionals with the necessary knowledge, experience and understanding from diverse backgrounds. TSMC establishes the 'Guidelines for Nomination of Directors' that set out the procedures and criteria for the nomination, qualification and evaluation of candidates for Directors. In addition, TSMC envisions its Board to be composed of a majority of independent directors, with the independence of each independent director candidate considered and assessed under relevant laws.\n\nDirectors shall be elected pursuant to the candidate nomination system specified in Article 192-1 of the R.O.C. Company Law. The tenure of office for Directors shall be three years. The independence of each independent director candidate is also considered and assessed under relevant law such as the Taiwan 'Regulations Governing Appointment of Independent Directors and Compliance Matters for Public Companies'. Under R.O.C. law, in which TSMC was incorporated, any shareholders holding one percent or more of our total outstanding common shares may nominate their own candidate to stand for election as a Board member. This democratic mechanism allows our shareholders to become involved in the selection and nomination process of Board candidates. The final slate of candidates is put to the shareholders for voting at the relevant annual shareholders' meeting.\n\nThere are no limits on the number of terms that a director may serve. We believe the Company benefits from the contributions of directors who have over their years of dedicated service acquired unique insights into the operations and financial developments of the Company. The Company reviews the appropriateness of each director's continued service to ensure there are new viewpoints available to the Board.\n\n## Directors' Compensation\n\nAccording to TSMC's Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to determine the salary for the Chairman, Vice Chairman and Directors, taking into account the extent and value of the services provided for the management of the Corporation and the standards of the industry within the R.O.C. and overseas.\n\nTSMC's Articles of Incorporation also state that not more than 0.3 percent of our annual profits may be distributed as compensation to our directors. In addition, directors who also serve as executive officers of the Company are not entitled to receive any director compensation. According to TSMC's Compensation Committee Charter, the distribution of compensation to directors shall be made in accordance with TSMC's 'Rules for Distribution of Compensation to Directors' based on the following principles: (1) directors who also serve as executive officers of the Company are not entitled to receive compensation; (2) the compensation for independent directors may be higher than other directors, as all independent directors also serve as members of the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee and thus participate in the discussions as well as resolutions of related committee meetings in accordance with the charter of each committee; and (3) the compensation for overseas independent directors may be higher than domestic independent directors, as they require additional time to attend quarterly meetings in Taiwan.",

The members of TSMC Board of Directors are nominated via rigorous selection processes. It not only considers background diversity, professional competence and experience, but also attaches great importance to his/her personal reputation on ethics and leadership. The Company aims to have at least of 50% independent directors and at least one female director to serve on the Board. Presently, the ten members of the Board of Directors represent diversified perspectives, including a complementary mix of skills, experiences, and backgrounds such as that from the industry, academia, and in law. These professionals, including a female board member, are citizens from Taiwan, Europe and the U.S. with world-class business operating experiences. The six Independent Directors constitute 60% of the Board, and there is no marital or is within the second degree of kinship relationship between or among the Directors. As such, the Board of Directors carries independence. The following table demonstrates the implementation of the diversity policy for Board members:\n\n| Title                                | Chairman                             | Vice  Chairman                       | Director                             | Director                             | Independent Director                 | Independent Director                 | Independent Director                 | Independent Director                 | Independent Director                 | Independent Director                 |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Name                                 | Mark Liu                             | C.C.

TSMC strictly adheres to the highest standards of integrity and promotes good ethical behavior to sustain the hard-earned trust and confidence of its shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees and the general public - constantly and vigilantly promoting integrity, fairness, and transparency in all that we say and do. We have zero tolerance for corruption, refrain from bribery, fraud, embezzlement of corporate assets, and prohibit the advancement of personal interests at the expense of or in conflict with TSMC. At the heart of our corporate governance culture is the 'TSMC Ethics and Business Conduct Policy' (Ethics Code). The Ethics Code requires that each employee bear a heavy personal responsibility to preserve and to protect TSMC's ethical values and reputation. At the same time, we have formulated the 'TSMC's Supplier Code of Conduct' as well to ensure our suppliers understand and follow the Ethics Code and together fulfill our corporate social responsibilities.\n\nSpecifically, every TSMC employee must adhere to the following:\n\n- \u25cf  Do not advance personal interests at the expense of or in conflict with the Company;\n- \u25cf  Refrain from corruption (including collusion with others), bribery, unfair competition, fraud, extortion, embezzlement, and waste or abuse of corporate assets;\n- \u25cf  Avoid any improper efforts to influence the decisions of anyone, including government officials, agencies, as well as TSMC's customers and suppliers;\n- \u25cf  Do not undertake any practices detrimental to TSMC, to the environment, or to society;\n- \u25cf  Procure all of our raw materials from socially responsible sources;\n- \u25cf  Protect proprietary information of TSMC, our customers and suppliers; and\n- \u25cf  Abide by the letter of all applicable laws, rules and regulations.\n\nIntellectual Property Protection: In order to build and sustain an environment of innovation, technology leadership, and sustainable profitable growth, the Ethics Code requires that TSMC promote business relationships founded upon an unwavering respect for the intellectual property rights, proprietary information and trade secrets of TSMC, our customers, and others.\n\nPublic Disclosures: TSMC's officers, especially our CEO, CFO, and General Counsel, with oversight from our Board, are responsible for the full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable financial accounting and financial disclosure in reports and documents filed by the Company with securities authorities and in all TSMC public communications and disclosures. TSMC has a variety of measures in place to ensure compliance with these disclosure obligations.\n\nAny modification to the Ethics Code requires the approval of our Audit Committee to ensure our ethics compliance program is independently reviewed against corporate best practices.\n\n## Ethics Code Implementation\n\nHigh Standard of Ethics Culture: Our ethics program is implemented in four ways by all of TSMC's Board members, officers, and employees. First, the TSMC management team sets the 'tone from top' by acting in accordance with the Ethics Code so that they will be an example to all stakeholders. Second, working-level managers are responsible for ensuring their staff's understanding of and compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Third, TSMC encourages an environment of open communications in discussing any questions related to the Ethics Code. Any employee may consult his or her direct supervisors, Human Resources or Legal to obtain timely advice. Lastly, TSMC requires all employees to stay vigilant and report any noncompliance by anyone to their supervisors, the function head of Human Resources, the responsible corporate senior management appointed by CEO that oversees the Ombudsman\n\nsystem, or to the Chairman of the Company's Audit Committee directly.\n\n## Self-Assessment of All Departments and Employees:\n\nSelf-assessment of all departments and employees is an important part of our ethics compliance program. All TSMC departments and subsidiaries are required to conduct Control Self-Assessment (CSA) tests annually in reviewing employees' awareness of the Ethics Code, and to evaluate and strengthen the effectiveness of internal control related to the Ethics Code. The CSA results are reviewed to track the results of our compliance program. In addition, all employees must disclose any matters that cause, or may cause, actual or potential conflict of interest. In addition to this proactive disclosure requirement, employees with specific job grades or job responsibilities must annually declare any relationships that may constitute a conflict of interest, which enables TSMC to take necessary arrangements and report the results to the Audit Committee.\n\nInternal Auditing: The Internal Auditor of TSMC plays a critical role in ensuring the Company's compliance with the Ethics Code and relevant rules and regulations. To ensure that our financial, managerial, and operating information is accurate, reliable, and timely and that our employees' actions are in compliance with applicable policies, standards, procedures, laws and regulations, our Internal Auditor conducts audits of various control points within the Company in accordance with its annual audit plan approved by the Board of Directors and subsequently reports its audit findings and remedial issues to the Board and management on a regular basis.\n\nTraining and Promotion: To promote awareness to our employees of their responsibilities under the Ethics Code, we publish our Ethics Code and related policies and documents on our intranet and, provide training courses, posters, emails, and internal news articles. In terms of training courses, TSMC not only provides annual online course on the Ethics Code and requires all employees to complete the training, as well as face-to-face training courses delving into more specific ethics-related topics for targeted employees. In 2021, there were 59,366 attendances that completed the'Annual Ethics and Compliance Training Course' (mandatory 0.5 hour online course) at TSMC and its subsidiaries, reaching 99.9% completion rate.\n\nIn addition to our internal compliance efforts, we expect and assist our business partners such as customers and suppliers, and any other entities with whom we deal (include",

For instance, we require all of our suppliers to declare in writing that they will respect and comply with TSMC's ethical standards and culture. TSMC is a full member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA, formerly the (Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition, EICC)), dedicated to global supply chain sustainability. In addition to adopting the RBA Code of Conduct at all of its facilities, TSMC applied the RBA's standards to enhance our audit program of our suppliers and relevant business partners. We provide training and communicate our ethical culture to our suppliers through live seminars and online programs to prevent any unethical conduct and detect any sign of Ethics Code violations. In 2021, we held a sustainable supply chain ESH forum to share/exchange practical experiences on topics such as the Ethics Code, environmental protection, and occupational safety. In total, 229 attendees from 102 suppliers participated (including through online meeting) in these activities. We also exchange views on appropriate business conduct and TSMC's ethical standards and implementation status with our customers as part of customer audit programs.\n\n## Reporting Channels and Whistleblower Protection\n\nTSMC has established and published its 'Complaint Policy and Procedure for Certain Accounting & Legal Matters' and pledges to comply with the relevant regulations in the policy. Open and multiple reporting channels are available for internal and external voices to protect the rights and interests of stakeholders and the Company. All reported incidents collected from reporting channels inside or outside of TSMC are properly recorded and traced. TSMC also prohibits any form of retaliation by providing proper protection for any individual who in good faith reports a suspected violation or participates in an investigation. In 2021, the Ethics Committee held a total seven meetings to examine major reported incidents under investigation.\n\nTSMC investigates each individual case according to its characteristics through specific divisions, and treats every received case seriously, carefully, and effectively to ensure the accuracy of the investigation. The TSMC Ethics Committee will evaluate each case to determine whether it is an exceptional case or whether it results from systemic issues of insufficient awareness in ethics. This allows TSMC to continue evaluating whether it is necessary to improve its management and internal control procedures. Awareness such as emails to employees describing the violations and disciplinary actions in each quarter are conducted to promote employees' awareness and avoid recurrence of similar incidents.\n\nIn 2021, TSMC did not receive any reports related to finance, accounting or antitrust matters, nor did we receive any complaints concerning breach of customer privacy and loss of customer data, or any material regulatory violations (where a fine exceeds NT$1 million).\n\nIn 2021, the incidents reported through the Audit Committee Whistleblower System, Ombudsman System, and Irregular Business Conduct Reporting System totaled 327. Among them, 207 cases were related to people management/employee relations, 103 cases were categorized as others (e.g., asking personal questions or private matters), and 17 cases were related to ethics. Four incidents were verified upon investigation and determined for disciplinary action by the Ethics Committee. In 2021, TSMC leveraged the four violations to strengthen ethics promotion for all employees in supplier-related activities. Below is a summary of the number of reported incidents.\n\n| Year                                                 |   FY2017 |   FY2018 |   FY2019 |   FY2020 | FY2021      |\n|------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------|\n| Total reported cases                                 |      113 |      150 |      205 |      246 | 327         |\n| Ethics-related cases                                 |       20 |       14 |       26 |       22 | 17          |\n| Cases investigated and verified as ethics violations |        4 |        1 |        2 |        6 | 4  (Note 1) |\n| Sexual Harassment Investigation Committees Formed    |        7 |        3 |        4 |        4 | 14          |\n| Cases investigated and verified as violations        |        3 |        3 |        4 |        2 | 11 (Note 2) |\n\n## Ethics Code Violation Disciplinary Action\n\nWe do not tolerate any violation of the Ethics Code and treat every possible violation incident seriously. Each violator of the Ethics Code (or relevant regulations) will be severely disciplined to the full extent of our policies and the law, up to and including immediate dismissal, termination of business relationship, and judicial prosecution as appropriate.\n\n## 3.5.1  Taiwan Corporate Conduct and Ethics Implementation as Required by the Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission\n\n|

TSMC's Board of Directors and management are responsible for establishing, implementing, and maintaining an adequate internal control system. Internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance over the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations (including profitability, performance and safeguarding of assets), reliability, timeliness, transparency and regulatory compliance of our reporting, and compliance with applicable rulings, laws and regulations.\n- 2.  An internal control system has inherent limitations. No matter how perfectly designed, an effective internal control system can provide only reasonable assurance of accomplishing its stated objectives. Moreover, the effectiveness of an internal control system may be subject to changes due to extenuating circumstances beyond our control. Nevertheless, our internal control system contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and TSMC takes immediate remedial actions in response to any identified deficiencies.\n- 3.  TSMC evaluates the design and operating effectiveness of its internal control system based on the criteria provided in the Regulations Governing the Establishment of Internal Control Systems by Public Companies (herein below, the 'Regulations'). The criteria adopted by the Regulations identify five key components of managerial internal control: (1) control environment, (2) risk assessment, (3) control activities, (4) information and communication, and (5) monitoring activities. Each component also includes several items which can be found in the Regulations.\n- 4.  TSMC has evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of its internal control system according to the aforesaid Regulations.\n- 5.  Based on the findings of such evaluation, TSMC believes that, on December 31, 2021, it has maintained, in all material respects, an effective internal control system (that includes the supervision and management of our subsidiaries), to provide reasonable assurance over our operational effectiveness and efficiency, reliability, timeliness, transparency and regulatory compliance of reporting, and compliance with applicable rulings, laws and regulations.\n- 6.  This Statement is an integral part of TSMC's annual report and prospectus, and will be made public. Any falsehood, concealment, or other illegality in the content made public will entail legal liability under Articles 20, 32, 171, and 174 of the Securities and Exchange Law.\n- 7.  This Statement was passed by the Board of Directors in their meeting held on February 15, 2022, with none of the ten attending directors expressing dissenting opinions, and the remainder all affirming the content of this Statement.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMark Liu,\n\nChairman\n\nC.C.

If the actual amounts subsequently paid differ from the above estimated amounts, the differences will be recorded in the year paid as a change in accounting estimate.\n\n## 2021 Directors' Compensation and Employees' Profit Sharing\n\n|                                  | Board Resolution (02/15/2022)   |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                                  | Amount (NT$ thousands)          |\n| Directors' Compensation (Cash)   | 487,537                         |\n| Employee's Profit Sharing (Cash) | 35,601,449                      |\n\nNote: NT$ 35,601,449 thousand business performance bonus was already distributed following each quarter of 2021.

Competition continues to intensify in the face of increasing industry consolidation and the commoditization of technology at more mature, conventional levels, and thus semiconductor companies must find ways to keep innovating in order to survive and prosper. One way to promote innovation is through active collaboration with external partners. At TSMC this is known as 'Open Innovation \u00ae '. It is an 'outside in' approach to complement traditional 'inside out' methods. TSMC has chosen this path to stimulate innovation via its OIP initiative, which is a key part of the TSMC Grand Alliance.\n\nThe OIP initiative is a comprehensive design technology infrastructure that encompasses all critical IC implementation areas to lower design barriers and improve first-time silicon success. OIP promotes the speedy implementation of innovation amongst the semiconductor design community and its ecosystem partners using TSMC's & partners' IP and process technology in design implementation and backend services.\n\nCrucial to OIP are ecosystem interfaces and collaborative components initiated and supported by TSMC to empower innovation throughout the supply chain and, in turn, drive the creation and sharing of new revenue and profits. TSMC's active accuracy assurance (AAA) initiative is key to OIP, providing the precision and quality required by the ecosystem interfaces and collaborative components.\n\nTSMC's Open Innovation \u00ae model brings together the creative thinking of customers and partners under the common goal of shortening each of the following: design time, time-to-volume, time-to-market and, ultimately, time-to-revenue. The model features:\n\n- \u25cf  the foundry segment's earliest and most comprehensive electronic design automation (EDA) certification program, delivering timely design tool enhancement required by new process technologies;\n- \u25cf  the foundry segment's largest, most comprehensive and most robust silicon-proven IP (intellectual properties) and library portfolio; and\n- \u25cf  comprehensive design ecosystem alliance programs covering market-leading EDA, IP, and design service partners.\n\nTSMC's OIP alliance consists of 16 EDA partners, six Cloud partners, 46 IP partners, 22 design center alliance (DCA) partners, and eight value chain aggregator (VCA) partners. TSMC and partners work together proactively and engage much earlier and deeper than ever before in order to address mounting design challenges at advanced technology nodes. Through this early and intensive collaboration effort, TSMC's OIP is able to deliver the needed design infrastructure with timely enhancement of EDA tools, early availability of critical IPs and quality design services when customers need them. Taking full advantage of the process technologies once they reach production-ready maturity is critical to customers' success. Hence, this helps to achieve design technology co-optimization (DTCO) among TSMC process technologies, OIP design solutions and customer product designs.\n\nTSMC's OIP partner management portal facilitates communication with ecosystem partners for efficient business productivity. Designed with a highly intuitive interface, this portal can be accessed via a direct link from TSMC-Online TM .\n\nTSMC held its online OIP Ecosystem Forum in October 2021. This annual event demonstrates how TSMC and its ecosystem partners jointly develop design solutions on top of TSMC's advanced technologies through OIP collaboration. It is also a good opportunity to maintain contact with customers and ecosystem partners during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the forum, TSMC made key presentations on 3nm that continues the full-node Power Performance Area (PPA) scaling trend together with the offering of high density and high performance libraries and design solutions for the support of smartphone and HPC design applications. The Company also made presentations on 4nm and 5nm design solutions and ecosystems that have already been applied to actual customer chip production. Other presentation topics included: N12e TM , featuring further enhancement to support 0.4V operation with design solutions for IoT products that can further reduce power consumption; comprehensive automotive design enablement platform (ADEP) with design solutions and ecosystems previously developed for 16nm and 7nm and the same ADEP in 5nm, already under development; comprehensive RF technology portfolio to support general RF, millimeter Wave and RF frontend products; and TSMC 3DFabric TM design solutions that include TSMC-SoIC TM for 3D chip stacking, and InFO (Integrated FanOut) and CoWoS \u00ae (Chip on Wafer on",

|\n\nBased on capital expenditures listed above, TSMC's annual production capacity increased by approximately 0.9 million 12-inch equivalent wafers in 2021.\n\n## 6.2.5 Long-term Equity Investment Policy and Results\n\nTSMC's long-term equity investments, accounted for using the equity method, were all made for strategic purposes. In 2021, the gains from these investments amounted to 5,603,084 thousand on a consolidated basis, up from the previous year mainly due to increases in product demand. In the future, TSMC's long-term equity investments, accounted for using the equity method, will continue to focus on strategic purposes through prudent assessments.\n\n## 6.3 Risk Management\n\nThe Board of Directors plays a key role in helping TSMC identify and manage risks. According to the Audit Committee's charter, approved by the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee is authorized to review TSMC's enterprise risk management (ERM), including business continuity management policy and plans, ERM procedures and implementation status. The risk management organization annually briefs the Audit Committee on TSMC's ever-changing risk environment, the key points of TSMC's ERM, and risk assessment and mitigation efforts. The Audit Committee's Chairperson also reports to the Board of Directors on the risk environment and risk mitigation measures to be taken.\n\nTSMC operates an ERM program based on its corporate vision and its long-term, sustainable responsibility to both industry and society, integrating and managing potential sustainability risks including strategic, operational, financial and hazardous risks. ERM seeks to provide the appropriate management of risks on behalf of all stakeholders. TSMC applies a risk management framework (including risk identification and assessment, risk control and mitigation, risk response, risk monitoring and reporting) and a risk map to assess the risk levels by defining likelihood and impact severity of events on TSMC's operations, and to prioritize controls and implement corresponding mitigation measures.\n\n## Scope of Risk Management\n\n## Strategic Perspective\n\n- \u25cf  Changes in technology (including IT security) and industry\n- \u25cf  Decrease in demand and average selling price\n- \u25cf  Competition\n- \u25cf  Changes in the government policies and regulatory environment\n\n## Operational Perspective\n\n- \u25cf  Capacity expansion\n- \u25cf  Construction of new fabs\n- \u25cf  Sales concentration\n- \u25cf  Purchasing concentration\n- \u25cf  Intellectual property rights\n- \u25cf  Litigious and non-litigious matters\n- \u25cf  Mergers and acquisitions\n- \u25cf  Recruiting quality personnel\n- \u25cf  Future R&D plans and expected R&D spending\n- \u25cf  Change in corporate reputation\n- \u25cf  Change in management\n\n## Financial Perspective\n\n- \u25cf  Interest rate fluctuation, foreign exchange volatility, inflation, and amendments to tax regulations or implementation of new tax laws\n- \u25cf  External financing\n- \u25cf  High-risk/highly leveraged investments; lending, endorsements, and guarantees for other parties; and financial derivative transactions\n- \u25cf  Impairment charges\n\n## Hazardous Event Perspective\n\n- \u25cf  Earthquakes and natural disaster\n- \u25cf  Fire or chemical spills\n- \u25cf  Climate change\n- \u25cf  Pandemics\n- \u25cf  Utility supply disruption\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management Framework\n\n## Risk Identification and Assessment\n\n- \u25cf RM Steering Committee and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors review and approve implementation of risk management strategy and prioritization of risk controls\n- \u25cf RM Executive Council adopts risk map which assesses likelihood and impact of risk events on operations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk Control and Mitigation\n\n- \u25cf RM Program conducts cross-functional risk communication to facilitate each function for enhancing risk prevention and mitigation controls\n- \u25cf RM Executive Council implements risk controls and improves continuously\n- \u25cf Each department includes the effectiveness of risk controls into annual self-assessment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk Response\n\n- \u25cf RM task forces establish crisis management and business continuity plans\n- \u25cf RM Program plans and implements the response and exercise for material crisis events\n- \u25cf Each department implements the planning and execution of business continuity plan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk Monitoring and Reporting\n\n- \u25cf Risk management organization reports to RM Steering Committee and Audit Committee on the focus of enterprise risk management, risk assessment, and mitigation efforts",

        "page_content": "To mitigate the TSMC's operational impacts of crisis events, TSMC's risk management organization conducts pre-crisis risk assessment and identifies feasible strategies for crisis prevention. Response procedures and recovery plans are established for various scenarios. For specific severe crisis events involving multiple TSMC manufacturing sites, the cross-functional central crisis command center, composed of operations and support functions, is responsible for direction and internal coordination to speed up TSMC's response time to crisis event and proactively communicate with stakeholders. To raise risk awareness and strengthen the risk management culture in TSMC, RM task forces have been formed to enhance risk assessment and conduct crisis response exercises for potential critical events such as fire, earthquake, IT service disruption, IT security breach, supply chain disruption, major yield loss, and utility supply disruption. In order to continuously mitigate corporate risks, crisis response exercises are used to test the integrity of ERM and effectiveness of risk controls.\n\nTo mitigate supply chain disruption risks, TSMC has created a task force comprised of members of fab operations, materials management, risk management and quality systems management to work with suppliers to develop business continuity plans and enhance supply chain resilience. Partly as a result of these efforts, there were no interruptions in TSMC's supply chain in 2021.\n\nAs production capacity continues to expand with more advanced technology, TSMC has initiated and implemented seismic protection engineering design, risk treatment practices and green manufacturing projects during the design phase of all new fabs.\n\n## 6.3.1  Risk Management Organization and Implementation Status\n\nThe TSMC risk management organization is composed of the RM steering committee, the RM executive council, the RM program and the RM task force. The role and responsibility of the risk management organization and its implementation status are summarized as follows:\n\n## Risk Management Organization Chart\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RM Steering Committee\n\n- \u25cf  Consist of functional heads, with internal audit head sitting in as an observer\n- \u25cf  Report to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors \u25cf  Advise and approve risk control prioritization\n- \u25cf  Supervise continuous improvements for risk management\n\n## RM Executive Council\n\n- \u25cf  Consist of director-level representatives from each function \u25cf  Identify and implement risk control plans\n- \u25cf  Continuously improve risk management practices and effectiveness\n\n## RM Program\n\n- \u25cf  Consolidate ERM reports and update the RM Steering Committee\n- \u25cf  Coordinate and facilitate the RM Executive Council's risk management activities\n- \u25cf  Facilitate RM task forces to enhance the effectiveness of risk controls\n\n## RM Task Force\n\n- \u25cf  Identify potential scenarios and business impacts\n- \u25cf  Plan and execute risk prevention and mitigation actions in accordance with various scenarios\n- \u25cf  Establish crisis management procedures and conducts exercises\n\n## The Implementation in 2021\n\n## Systemic Risk Management Enhancement\n\n- \u25cf  In addition to current risk identification and assessment, compliance check, lessons learned from internal and external incidents, and benchmarking, a series of risk interviews and analysis are conducted to identify any unknown systemic risks and risk control measures to be enhanced. TSMC\n\ncontinuously improves the effectiveness of risk controls and risk culture through cross-functional collaborations.\n\n## Continue Existing Risk Management Organization's Activities\n\n- \u25cf  For enterprise risks, each RM task forces conduct risk assessment and lesson-learned from incidents, identify potential risk scenarios continuously, plan and implement risk prevention and mitigation measures, emergency response, crisis management and corresponding exercises.\n- \u25cf  The RM executive council reviews and follows up on the progress and results of RM task force activities, including the response to systemic risks and emerging risks, improving opportunities identified from compliance checks, and sharing and learning of best practices.\n- \u25cf  The RM steering committee advises and approves the risk map and the prioritization of risk controls and review the continuous improvement in managing systemic risks.\n\n## 6.3.2 Strategic Risks\n\n## Risks Associated with Changes in Technology and Industry\n\n## \u25cf  Industry Developments\n\nThe electronics industries and semiconductor market are cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid fluctuations in product demand, which could impact TSMC's semiconductor foundry business. Variations in order levels from TSMC's customers may result in volatility in the Company's revenue and earnings.\n\nFrom time to time, the electronics and semiconductor industries have experienced significant and occasionally prolonged periods of downturns and overcapacity. Because TSMC is, and will continue to be, dependent on the requirements of electronics and semiconductor companies for its services, periods of downturns and overcapacity in the general electronics and semiconductor industries could lead to reduced demand for overall semiconductor foundry services, including TSMC's services. If TSMC cannot take appropriate actions, such as reducing its costs to sufficiently offset declines in demand, the Company's revenue, margin and earnings will likely suffer during periods of downturns and overcapacity.\n\n## \u25cf  Changes in Technology\n\nThe semiconductor industry and its technologies are constantly changing. TSMC competes by developing process technologies using increasingly advanced nodes and on manufacturing products with more functions. The Company also competes by developing new derivative technologies. If TSMC does not anticipate these changes in technologies and rapidly develop new and innovative technologies, or the Company's\n\ncompetitors unforeseeably gain sudden access to additional technologies, TSMC may not be able to provide foundry services on competitive terms. In addition, TSMC's customers have significantly decreased the time in which their products or services are launched into the market. If TSMC is unable to meet these shorter product time-to-market, it risks losing these customers. These factors have also been intensified by the shift of the global technology market to consumer driven products, such as smartphones, and increasing competition and concentration of customers (all further discussed separately among these risk factors).\n\nAlso, the uncertainty and instability inherent in advanced technologies also impose challenges for achieving expected product quality and product yield. If TSMC fails to maintain quality, it may result in loss of revenue and additional cost, as well as loss of business or customer trust. For example, in January 2019, the Company discovered yield problems in 12-nanometer and 16-nanometer wafers caused by a batch of photoresist, which resulted in delayed delivery of products and had a negative effect on TSMC's gross margin and operating margin in the first quarter of 2019. To reduce future risks of such incidences, the Company has since strengthened inline wafer inspection and tightened control of incoming material to deal with the increasing complexity of leading-edge technologies. If TSMC is unable to innovate new technologies that meet the demand of its customers or overcome the above factors, it may become less competitive and its revenue may decline significantly.\n\nRegarding the response measures for the above-mentioned risks, please refer to '2.2.4 TSMC Position, Differentiation and Strategy' on pages 14-16 of this Annual Report.\n\n## \u25cf  IT Security\n\nEven though TSMC has established a comprehensive internet and computing security network, the Company cannot guarantee that its computing systems which control or maintain vital corporate functions, such as its manufacturing operations and enterprise accounting, would be completely immune to crippling cyberattacks. In the event of a serious cyberattack, TSMC's systems may lose important corporate data or its production lines may be shut down pending the resolution of such attack. Major cyberattacks could also lead to loss or divulgence of trade secrets and other sensitive information, such as proprietary information of our customers and other stakeholders and personal information of our employees. While TSMC seeks to continuously review and assess its cybersecurity policies and procedures to ensure their adequacy and effectiveness, the Company cannot guarantee",

        "page_content": "that it will not be susceptible to new and emerging risks and attacks in the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats.\n\nMalicious hackers may also try to introduce computer viruses, corrupted software or ransomware into TSMC's network systems to disrupt its operations, blackmail it to regain control of its computing systems, or spy on it for sensitive information. These attacks may result in TSMC having to pay damages for its delayed or disrupted orders or incur significant expense in implementing remedial and improvement measures to further enhance its cybersecurity network, and may also expose the Company to significant legal liabilities arising from or related to legal proceedings or regulatory investigations associated with such breaches.\n\nIn the past, TSMC experienced and may in the future be subject to attacks by malicious software contained in the equipment the Company purchases and installs. TSMC has implemented and continually updates rigorous cybersecurity measures to prevent and minimize harm caused by such attacks. Such measures include advanced virus scanning tools to prevent a fab from installing virus-infected software, strengthening firewall and network controls to prevent computer viruses from spreading among tools and fabs, the installation of anti-virus and advanced malware detection solutions across Company computer devices, and enhancement of data center security through faster patch cycle times. In addition, TSMC has deployed secure PCs and laptops, developed a public cloud security policy with monitoring, defined and regularly reviewed the security key performance indicators (KPI), introduced new technology for data protection, and improved email phishing detection and regularly performed employee awareness testing. TSMC also established an integrated and automatic security operation platform, enhanced the automation of cybersecurity event detection and response, enhanced internal assessment automation, practiced the response to ransomware attacks and conducted external security risk assessments. In addition, to reduce supply chain risks, through collaboration, TSMC helped major suppliers improve their security maturity with KPI monitoring and share with them industry security events and best practices on demand and by schedule. Moreover, TSMC led the SEMI standard taskforce to formulate and release information security standards for semiconductor equipment (SEMI E187) to help improve the resilience of semiconductor supply chain. While these ongoing enhancements further improve Company's cybersecurity defense solutions, there can be no assurance that the Company is immune to cyberattacks.\n\nIn addition, TSMC employs certain third-party service providers for itself and its affiliates worldwide with whom it needs to\n\nshare highly sensitive and confidential information to enable them to provide the relevant services. Despite requiring the third-party service providers to strictly fulfill the confidentiality and/or internet security requirements in its service agreements with them, there is no assurance that each of them will comply with such obligations. Moreover, such third-party service providers may also be susceptible to cyberattacks. If TSMC or its service providers are not able to timely resolve the respective technical difficulties caused by such cyberattacks, or ensure the integrity and availability of its data (and data belonging to its customers and other third parties) or maintain control of its or its service providers' computing systems, the Company's commitments to its customers and other stakeholders may be materially impaired and its results of operations, financial condition, prospects and reputation may also be materially and adversely affected.\n\n## Risks Associated with Decrease in Demand and Average Selling Price\n\nA vast majority of the Company's revenue is derived from customers who use TSMC products in smartphones, high performance computing (HPC), Internet of Things (IoT), automotive, and digital consumer electronics (DCE). Any deterioration in or a slowdown in the growth of such end markets resulting in a substantial decrease in the demand for overall global semiconductor foundry services, including TSMC products and services, could adversely affect the Company's revenue. Further, semiconductor manufacturing facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed-cost assets once they are in operation. Because the Company owns most of its manufacturing capacities, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. In general, these costs do not decline when customer demand or our capacity utilization rates drop, and thus declines in customer demand, among other factors, may significantly decrease our margins. Conversely, as product demand rises and factory utilization increases, the fixed costs are spread over increased output, which can improve our margins. In addition, the historical trend of declining average selling prices (or 'ASP') of end use applications places downward pressure on the prices of the components that go into such applications. Decreases in the ASP of end use applications may increase pricing pressure on components produced by TSMC, which, in turn, may negatively impact its revenue, margin and earnings.\n\n## Risks Associated with Competition\n\nThe markets for TSMC's foundry services are highly competitive. The Company competes with other foundry service providers, as well as a number of integrated device manufacturers. Some of these companies may have access to more advanced\n\ntechnologies than TSMC. Other companies may have greater financial and other resources than TSMC, such as the possibility of receiving direct or indirect government subsidies, economic stimulus funds, or other incentives that may be unavailable to TSMC. For example, Chinese companies are expected to be key players for new semiconductor fab development and fab equipment spending in part due to various incentives provided by the Chinese government. The governments of Europe, the United States, South Korea, and Japan also have incentive programs to incentivize developments of their domestic semiconductor industries. Although governments in certain of the countries or regions where TSMC is currently expanding or planning to expand its production capacity have extended or may in the future extend certain financial incentives to the Company, there is no assurance that TSMC will be able to apply for or receive such financial incentives at the levels TSMC expects or at all. Additionally, any financial incentives the Company receive may be subject to strict conditions, or the grantors could seek to recover any funds provided to TSMC, or cancel, reduce or deny our requests subsidies or grants in the future. This could materially increase TSMC's operating costs and adversely affect its results of operations.\n\nFurthermore, the Company's competitors may, from time to time, also decide to undertake aggressive pricing initiatives in one or several technology nodes. These competitive activities may decrease TSMC's customer base or its ASP, or both. If TSMC is unable to compete effectively with such new and aggressive competitors on technology, manufacturing capacity, product quality and customer satisfaction, it risks losing customers to such new contenders.\n\n## Risks Associated with Changes in the Government Policies and Regulatory Environment\n\nTSMC management closely monitors all domestic and foreign governmental policies and regulations that might impact TSMC's business and financial operations. In 2021 and as of the date of this Annual Report, there were no governmental policies or regulatory changes would materially impact TSMC's operations or financial condition.\n\n## 6.3.3 Operational Risks\n\n## Risks Associated with Capacity Expansion\n\nTSMC performs long-term market demand forecasting for its products and services to manage its overall capacity. Based on its market demand forecasts, the Company has continued to add capacity to meet market needs for its products and services, including in Taiwan, in Nanjing, China, in Arizona, U.S., and in Kumamoto, Japan.\n\nImplementing these capacity expansion plans will increase its costs, and the increases may be substantial. For example, the Company would need to build new facilities, purchase additional equipment and hire and train personnel to operate the new equipment. If TSMC does not increase its net revenue accordingly, its financial performance may be adversely affected by these increased costs.\n\nIn addition, market conditions are dynamic and TSMC's market demand forecast may change significantly at any time. During periods of decreased demand, certain manufacturing lines or tools in some of the Company's manufacturing facilities may be suspended or shut down temporarily. However, if demand subsequently increases rapidly over a short period of time, TSMC may not be able to restore the capacity in a timely manner to take advantage of the upturn. In such circumstances, its financial performance and competitiveness may be adversely affected.\n\nIn order to mitigate the risk associated with capacity expansion, TSMC continuously watches for changes in market conditions and works closely with its customers. When market demand is not as expected, the Company tries to adjust its capacity plans in a timely manner to reduce the impact on its financial performance.\n\n## Risks Associated with Construction of New Fabs\n\nThe Company has multiple expansion projects that are currently underway, including the design and construction of new fabs worldwide. Labor shortages, interruptions in the supply chains for various building materials, and construction issues could substantially delay the completion of our expansion projects. Any prolongation of such delays could result in us incurring substantial additional costs or failing to meet our capacity expansion plans. In addition, future expansions of its operations in the R.O.C. could be limited by the limited availability of commercial-use land.\n\n## Risks Associated with Sales Concentration\n\nOver the years, the profile of the Company's customers and the nature of the Company's customers' business have changed dramatically. While TSMC generates revenue from hundreds of customers worldwide, TSMC's ten largest customers in 2019, 2020 and 2021 accounted for approximately, 71%, 74% and 71% of TSMC's net revenue in the respective year. TSMC's largest customer in 2019, 2020 and 2021 accounted for 23%, 25% and 26% of the Company's net revenue in the respective year. TSMC's second largest customer in 2019, 2020 and 2021 accounted for 14%, 12% and 10% of TSMC's net revenue in the respective year.",

        "page_content": "A more concentrated customer base will subject TSMC's revenue to seasonal demand fluctuations from the Company's large customers, and cause different seasonal patterns in the Company's business. This customer concentration results in part from the changing dynamics of the electronics industry with the structural shift to mobile devices and applications and software that provide the content for such devices.\n\nThere are only a limited number of customers who are successfully exploiting this new business model paradigm. Also, TSMC has seen the changes of nature in its customers' business models in response to this new business model paradigm. For example, there is a growing trend toward the system companies developing their own designed semiconductors and working directly with semiconductor foundries which makes their products and services more marketable in a changing consumer market.\n\nAlso, since the global semiconductor industry is becoming increasingly competitive, some of TSMC's customers have engaged in industry consolidations in order to remain competitive. Such consolidations have taken the form of mergers and acquisitions. If more of TSMC's major customers consolidate, this will further decrease the overall number of the Company's customer pool. In addition, regulatory restrictions, such as export control directed at TSMC's major customers, could impact the Company's ability to supply products to those customers, reduce those customers' demand for TSMC's products and services and impact their business operations.\n\nThe loss of, or significant curtailment of purchases by, one or more of the Company's top customers, including curtailments due to increased competitive pressures, heightened regulatory scrutiny, industry consolidation, changes in applicable regulatory restrictions, product designs, manufacturing sourcing or outsourcing policies or practices of these customers, or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments, or changes in its major customers' business models, may adversely affect TSMC's results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Risks Associated with Purchasing Concentration \u25cf  Raw Materials\n\nTSMC's production operations require that it obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, such as silicon wafers, gases, chemicals, and photoresist, on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices. In the past, shortages in the supply of some materials, whether by specific vendors or by the semiconductor industry generally, have resulted in occasional industry-wide price adjustments and delivery delays. Moreover, major natural disasters, trade barriers and political or economic\n\nturmoil, including military conflicts and inflation occurring within the country of origin of such raw materials may also significantly disrupt the availability of such raw materials or increase their prices. Also, since TSMC procures some of its raw materials from sole-sourced suppliers, there is a risk that the Company's needs for such raw materials may not be met or that back-up supplies may not be readily available. Importation and domestic production limitations may also limit our ability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials as well as materials of the necessary quality. In addition, recent trade tensions could result in increased prices or even unavailability of raw materials due to tariffs, export control or other non-tariff barriers. TSMC's revenue and earnings could decline if it is unable to obtain adequate supplies of the necessary raw materials in a timely manner or if there are significant increases in the costs of raw materials. To reduce the supply chain risk and to manage the cost effectively, TSMC commits resources toward developing new supply sources. Further, the Company continually encourages its suppliers to reduce their supply chain risk by decentralizing production plants and to improve their cost competitiveness by moving their production facilities to Taiwan from higher-cost areas.\n\nGiven that qualified backup suppliers are hard to find, TSMC engages early and extensively with primary suppliers on managing quality and capacity issues so as to be prepared for any unexpected need to ramp up or curtail production when the Company lacks sufficient time to re-tune its production process. For leading technology nodes, TSMC not only adopts world-class processes and facilities but also requires world-class materials. To streamline supply chain risk, the Company has increased supplier site audits and meetings to extend supply chain best practices to its upstream suppliers. In addition, in response to the rapid increase or decrease in production capacity of new products, TSMC has continued to improve its inventory monitoring system to achieve more accurate demand forecasts and ensure that the supply chain maintains sufficient inventory levels. The Company has established a supply chain risk assessment to ensure that critical suppliers meet various standards in labor, ethics, ESH (environmental, safety and health) and BCP (business continuity plan). Onsite audits are conducted regularly to encourage suppliers to take responsibility for their supply chain, as any regulatory violations or adverse environmental impact event, or failure to meet sustainability requirements could result in business reduction or termination.\n\n## \u25cf  Equipment\n\nThe Company's operations and ongoing expansion plans depend on its ability to obtain an appropriate amount of equipment and related services from a limited number of suppliers in a market that is characterized from time to time\n\nby limited supply and long delivery cycles. During such times, supplier-specific or industry-wide lead times for delivery can be longer than previously expected and the cost of ownership may intrinsically increase.\n\nTo better manage its supply chain, the Company has implemented various collaborative business models and risk management contingencies with suppliers to ensure supply and shorten the procurement lead times. However, if TSMC is unable to timely acquire the equipment and parts needed, the Company may fail to successfully implement its capacity expansion plans and exploit time sensitive business opportunities. Additionally, ongoing trade tensions or protectionist measures could result in increased prices for, or even unavailability of, key equipment, including as a result of necessary export licenses being delayed or denied, additional export control measures, and other tariff or non-tariff barriers. If TSMC is unable to obtain equipment in a timely manner to fulfill its customers' demand on technology and production capacity, or at a reasonable cost, its financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\n\n## Risks Associated with Intellectual Property Rights\n\nThe Company's ability to compete successfully and to achieve future growth depends in part on the continued strength of its intellectual property portfolio. While the Company actively enforces and protects our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that its efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of its proprietary technologies, patents, software, trade secrets or know-how. Also, the Company cannot assure you that, as its business or business models expand into new areas, it will be able to develop independently the technologies, patents, software, trade secrets or know-how necessary to conduct its business or that it can do so without unknowingly infringing the intellectual property rights of others. As a result, the Company may have to rely on, to a certain degree, licensed technologies and patent licenses from others. To the extent that the Company relies on licenses from others, there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain any or all of the necessary licenses in the future on terms it considers reasonable or at all. The lack of necessary licenses could expose the Company to claims for damages and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by its customers in instances where it has contractually agreed to indemnify its customers against damages resulting from infringement claims.\n\nThe Company has received, from time to time, communications from third parties, including non-practicing entities and semiconductor companies, asserting that TSMC's technologies, its manufacturing processes, or the design IPs\n\nof the semiconductors made by TSMC or the use of those semiconductors by its customers may infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. Because of the nature of the industry, its market position, and the expansion of its manufacturing operations outside of Taiwan, the Company may receive an increased number of such communications in the future. The assertions made and lawsuits initiated by litigious, well-funded, non-practicing entities are particularly aggressive in their monetary demand and in seeking court-issued injunctions. Such lawsuits and assertions may increase TSMC's cost of doing business and may potentially be extremely disruptive if these asserting entities succeed in blocking the trade of products made and services offered by TSMC. Also, with the expansion of its manufacturing operations into certain non-R.O.C jurisdictions, it has faced increased challenges in managing risks of intellectual property misappropriation. Despite our efforts to adopt robust measures to mitigate the risk of intellectual property misappropriation in such new jurisdictions, we cannot guarantee that the protection measures we adopted will be sufficient to prevent us from potential infringements by others, or at all.\n\nIf the Company fails to obtain or maintain certain technologies or intellectual property licenses or fails to prevent our intellectual property from being misappropriated and, if litigation relating to alleged intellectual property matters occurs, it could: (1) prevent the Company from manufacturing particular products or selling particular services or applying particular technologies; and (2) reduce our ability to compete effectively against entities benefiting from our misappropriated intellectual property, which could reduce its opportunities to generate revenue.\n\nThe Company has taken related measures to minimize potential loss of shareholder value arising from intellectual property claims and litigation filed against it. These measures include: strategically obtaining licenses from certain semiconductor and other technology companies as needed; timely securing intellectual property rights originating within and outside of TSMC for defensive and/or offensive protection of TSMC technology and business; and aggressively defending against baseless litigation.\n\n## Risks Associated with Litigious and Non-litigious Matters\n\nAs is the case with many companies in the semiconductor industry, the Company has received from time to time communications from third parties asserting that its technologies, its manufacturing processes, or the design of the semiconductors made by TSMC or the use of those semiconductors by its customers may infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights. These assertions",

        "page_content": "have at times resulted in litigation by or against the Company and settlement payments by the Company. Irrespective of the validity of these claims, the Company could incur significant costs in the defense thereof or could suffer adverse effects on its operations. The Company is also subject to antitrust compliance requirements and scrutiny by governmental regulators in multiple jurisdictions. Any adverse results of such proceeding or other similar proceedings that may arise in those jurisdictions could harm TSMC's business and distract its management, and thereby have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or prospects, and subject the Company to potential significant legal liability.\n\nIn 2021 and as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC is not currently a party to any material legal proceedings.\n\n## Risks Associated with Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nIn 2021 and as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC had not conducted any merger or acquisition.\n\n## Risks Associated with Recruiting Quality Personnel\n\nTSMC relies on the continued service and contribution of its management team, skilled technical and professional personnel. The Company's business could suffer from the inability to fulfill personnel needs with high quality professionals in a timely fashion caused by the loss of personnel, illegal talent poaching, immigration controls, or related changes in market demand for its products and services. Since there is fierce competition for talent recruitment, the Company cannot ensure timely fulfillment of its personnel demand.\n\nIn order to reduce the risk of talent recruitment challenges, TSMC encourages job rotation and employs an on-the-job training and certification system. In this way, employees can learn and enhance their work efficiency and effectiveness in the actual workplace. Moreover, TSMC creates multiple recruitment channels and continues to hire various top-notch, talented professionals from Taiwan and overseas. At the same time, the Company continues to expand industry-academic cooperation to meet outstanding talented individuals at an early Phase in order to recruit them in the future.\n\n## Future R&D Plans and Expected R&D Spending\n\nFor additional details, see '5.2.7 Future R&D Plans' on pages 95-96 of this Annual Report.\n\n## Changes in Corporate Reputation and Impact on Company's Crisis Management\n\nTSMC has established an excellent reputation based on its core values of integrity, commitment, innovation and customer\n\ntrust. The Company's positive image also reflects outstanding operations, rigorous corporate governance and dedication to social responsibility by serving as a good corporate citizen. TSMC continues to pursue innovation in the economic, environmental and social dimensions.\n\nIn 2021, TSMC was honored with numerous awards for achievements in operations, corporate governance, patents, profit growth, investor relations, environmental protection, corporate sustainability and other fields. These included: the inaugural Terra Carta Seal Award launched by HRH The Prince of Wales' Sustainable Markets Initiative; the Taiwan Institute for Sustainable Energy 2021 Taiwan Corporate Sustainability Awards' Most Prestigious Sustainability Award - Top Ten Domestic Corporates, Best Sustainability Report Award, Cyclical Economy Leadership Award, Supply Chain Leadership Award, and Information Security Leadership Award; First Place in CommonWealth Magazine's Excellence in Corporate Social Responsibility Award for Large-Cap companies; ranked top 5% in the Taiwan Stock Exchange corporate governance evaluation; member of Fortune Magazine's 2021 World's Most Admired Companies and the 2021 Global 500; the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic Affairs Industrial Development Bureau's Energy Conservation Benchmark Award; the R.O.C. Environmental Protection Administration's Enterprise Green Procurement Award; membership in the Corporate Knights 100 Most Sustainable Corporations for 2021; membership in the 2021 Carbon Clean 200 list by Corporate Knights and As You Sow; and membership in the Time Magazine 100 Most Influential Companies. In addition, TSMC was selected as a part of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for the 21 st consecutive year.\n\nAs TSMC strives to excel in corporate social responsibility, the Company also encourages employees to make innovative breakthroughs in how they think about things and do things, as well as nurture their empathy and broaden their horizons. In 2021, the ESG Steering Committee, led by Chairman Dr. Mark Liu, held the second 'TSMC ESG AWARD,' taking tangible action to encourage all employees to propose ideas for sustainability in the five ESG strategic directions, including green manufacturing, building a responsible supply chain, creating a diverse & inclusive workplace, talent development, and caring for the disadvantaged. The award further motivates TSMC colleagues to think innovatively about their work and implement corporate social responsibility. Compared with 785 sustainability proposals in the first year, the second annual ESG Award received 1,257 innovative ideas, adding new energy to the Company's culture of sustainability.\n\nWith its global reputation in mind, TSMC employs numerous preventative measures to address potential risks from earthquakes, fires, IT service disruption, yield loss, information security, supply chain disruption, pandemics, environmental events, and utility supply disruption. TSMC sets crisis response and recovery measures according to possible crisis events and maintains a 'TSMC crisis command center control instruction' as well as a 'TSMC emergency response procedure' to establish its emergency response command structure. TSMC also performs regular exercises for crisis scenarios to ensure that crisis response procedures are comprehensive. In 2021, TSMC received a rating of 'low risk' from the Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating.\n\nTSMC holds monthly meetings of the Environment, Safety and Health Committee, which coordinates relevant departments in each fab to conduct regular emergency response drills and continuously improve their notification and operational procedures to ensure clear channels of communication to stakeholders in crisis management, with the public relations department serving as the designated gateway for external communications.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, all departments immediately deploy emergency response measures to eliminate or minimize impact on personnel safety, the surrounding environment, company property and manufacturing operations. Responders also alert the public relations department at the earliest stages of response to ensure timely, clear and consistent communication regarding the situation.\n\n## Risks Associated with Change in Management\n\nIn 2021 and as of the date of this Annual Report, there were no such risks for TSMC.\n\n## 6.3.4 Financial Risks\n\n## Economic Risks\n\nAny future systemic political, economic or financial crisis or market volatility, including but not limited to interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, inflation or deflation and changes in economic, fiscal and monetary policies in major economies, could cause revenue or profits for the semiconductor industry as a whole to decline dramatically, and if the economic conditions or financial conditions of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, the demand for its products and services may decrease and additional accounting related allowances may be required, which could reduce our operating income and net income.\n\n## \u25cf  Interest Rate Fluctuation\n\nTSMC is exposed to interest rate risks primarily in relation to its investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash and cash equivalents and fixed income securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as the interest paid on its debt.\n\nThe objective of TSMC's investment policy is to achieve a return that will allow the Company to preserve principal and support liquidity requirements. The policy generally requires the Company to invest in investment grade securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. TSMC's cash and cash equivalents, as well as fixed income investments in both fixed- and floating-rate securities, carry a degree of interest rate risk. The majority of TSMC's fixed income investments are fixed-rate securities, which are classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, and may have their fair value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates. At the same time, if interest rates fall, cash and cash equivalents as well as floating-rate securities may generate less interest income than expected.\n\nTSMC has entered and may in the future enter into interest rate derivatives to partially hedge interest rate risk on its fixed income investments and anticipated debt issuance. However, these hedges can offset only a limited portion of the financial impact from movements in interest rates.\n\nAll of the Company's short-term debt is floating-rate, hence a rise in interest rates may result in higher interest expense than expected. The majority of its long-term debt is fixed-rate and measured at amortized cost and, as such, changes in interest rates would not affect future cash flows or the carrying amount.\n\nCertain of TSMC's fixed income investments are primarily based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which will be replaced by alternative benchmark rates after June 30, 2023. The transition from LIBOR to alternative benchmark rates might result in a reduction in TSMC's interest income.\n\n## \u25cf  Foreign Exchange Volatility\n\nSubstantially all of TSMC's sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and over half of its capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than the NT dollar, primarily in U.S. dollars, Euros and Japanese yen. As a result, any significant fluctuations to its disadvantage in the exchange rate of the NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on the Company's revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT",

        "page_content": "dollars. For example, every one percent depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar would result in an approximately 0.4 percentage point decrease in the Company's operating margin based on its 2021 results.\n\nConversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly versus other major currencies, the demand for the products and services of TSMC's customers and for its goods and services will likely decrease, which will negatively affect the Company's revenue.\n\nTSMC uses foreign currency derivative contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-NT-dollardenominated assets and liabilities and certain forecasted transactions. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on its assets and liabilities.\n\nFluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the NT dollar may affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company's common shares and the market price of the Company's American Depositary Shares (ADSs) as well as any cash dividends paid in NT dollar on TSMC's common shares represented by ADSs.\n\n## \u25cf  Inflation\n\nIf inflation continues running higher, the Federal Reserve would take tightening monetary policy which could result in higher interest rates, adversely affecting the fair value of TSMC's fixed income investments and causing higher interest expenses of future debt issuance. In order to control the interest rate risk, TSMC closely monitors the market development and monetary policy. TSMC has entered - and may in the future enter - into interest rate derivatives to partially hedge the interest rate risk on its fixed income investments and anticipated debt issuance.\n\n## \u25cf  Amendments to Tax Regulations or Implementation of New Tax Laws\n\nAny amendments to existing tax regulations or the implementation of any new tax laws in the jurisdictions in which TSMC operates its business may have an adverse effect on its net income.\n\nWhile the Company is subject to tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which it operates or conducts business, TSMC's principal operations are in the R.O.C. and it is exposed primarily to taxes levied by the R.O.C. government. Any unfavorable changes of tax laws and regulations in this jurisdiction could increase TSMC's effective tax rate and have\n\nan adverse effect on its operating results. Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project that was undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). These changes may increase tax uncertainty and have an adverse effect on TSMC's operating results.\n\nIn order to control tax risk, the Company closely monitors all domestic and foreign governmental policies and regulations that might impact its financial operations. TSMC has established risk management procedures to collect information, analyze potential tax implications, and develop countermeasures.\n\n## Risks Associated with External Financing\n\nIn times of market instability, sufficient external financing may not be available to the Company on a timely basis, or on commercially reasonable terms to the Company, or at all. If sufficient external financing is not available when TSMC needs such financing to meet its capital requirements, the Company may be forced to curtail its expansion, modify plans or delay the deployment of new or expanded services until it obtains such financing.\n\n## Risks Associated with High-Risk/Highly Leveraged Investments; Lending, Endorsements, and Guarantees for Other Parties; and Financial Derivative Transactions\n\nIn 2021 and as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC made no high-risk or highly leveraged financial investments. All financial derivative transactions engaged by TSMC were strictly for hedging and not for trading or speculative purposes. All guarantees and intercompany loans provided by TSMC and TSMC's subsidiaries were solely for TSMC and/or TSMC's wholly-owned subsidiaries. All guarantees and intercompany loans were in compliance with relevant rules and regulations.\n\nTo manage risks of various financial transactions, TSMC has established internal control policies and procedures based on sound financial and business practices, all in compliance with the relevant rules and regulations issued by the R.O.C. Financial Supervisory Commission. TSMC's policies and procedures include 'Procedures for Financial Derivatives Transactions,' 'Procedures for Lending Funds to Other Parties,' 'Procedures for Acquisition or Disposal of Assets,' and 'Procedures for Endorsement and Guarantee.'\n\n## Risks Associated with Impairment Charges\n\nUnder Taiwan-IFRSs, TSMC is required to evaluate its tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets for impairment\n\nwhenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. If certain criteria are met, TSMC is required to record an impairment charge. TSMC is not able to estimate the extent or timing of any impairment charge for future years. Any impairment charge required may have a material adverse effect on the Company's net income.\n\nThe determination of an impairment charge at any given time is mainly based on the projected results of operations over several years subsequent to that time. Consequently, an impairment charge is more likely to occur during a period when the Company's operating results are otherwise already depressed. See 'Note 5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION AND UNCERTAINTY' in Annual Report section (II), Financial Statements for a discussion of how TSMC assesses if an impairment charge is required and, if so, how the amount is determined.\n\n## 6.3.5 Hazardous Risks\n\nThe frequency and severity of disruptive events, including damaging earthquakes, other natural disasters and extreme weather, have been increasing in part due to climate change or systemic regional geological changes. TSMC has manufacturing and other operations, and is expanding its production capacity, in locations that may experience natural disasters, such as flooding, earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, and droughts that may cause interruptions or shortages in the supply of utilities, such as water and electricity, which in turn could disrupt operations. In addition, TSMC's suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. For example, most of TSMC's production facilities, as well as those of many of its suppliers and customers and upstream providers of complementary semiconductor manufacturing services, are located in Taiwan and Japan, areas susceptible to earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons, and droughts from time to time that may cause shortages of electricity or water, or interruptions to TSMC's operations.\n\nThus, if one or more natural disasters result in a prolonged disruption to TSMC's operations or those of its customers or suppliers, or if any of its fabs or vendor facilities were to be damaged or cease operations as a result of an explosion or fire, it could reduce the TSMC's manufacturing capacity and cause the loss of important customers and thereby have an adverse, material impact on its operational and financial performance.\n\nIn 2021, Taiwan faced one of the worst droughts in decades. To cope with such severe weather events, the government placed restrictions on the supply and usage of water by industrial companies such as TSMC, which could also disrupt\n\nTSMC's operations. In response, TSMC implemented its business continuity plans, including water conservation measures, the use of more secured water sources, water supplied by tank cars, stress tests and various exercises. As a result, there was no material impact to TSMC's business or operational performance.\n\nTSMC has occasionally suffered power outages or surges in Taiwan caused by difficulties encountered by its electricity supplier, the Taiwan Power Company, or other power consumers on the same power grid. Some of these have resulted in interruptions to our operations. Such shortages or interruptions in electricity supply could further be exacerbated by changes in the energy policy of the government, which intends to make Taiwan a nuclear-free country by 2025. If the TSMC is unable to secure reliable and uninterrupted supply of electricity to power its manufacturing fabs within Taiwan, its ability to fill customers' orders would be severely jeopardized.\n\nIf such events were to occur over prolonged periods of time, TSMC's operations and financial performance may be materially adversely affected.\n\nTSMC's future capacity expansions in the R.O.C. and elsewhere could be curtailed by shortages in water and electricity.\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may materially adversely affect TSMC's business and results of operations in several ways, including but not limited to: (1) interruption of the operations of TSMC's supply chains for equipment, parts and materials in terms of manufacturing, logistics, and manpower arrangements for tool installation; (2) significant fluctuation in TSMC customers' demands for certain products, leading to uncertainties for TSMC's capacity planning and also for meeting customer demand, which may harm TSMC's business with its customers and subject TSMC to the risk of legal disputes; and (3) potential production delays for TSMC's products due to forced factory or office closures or partial operation.\n\nTSMC has formed an 'Epidemic Prevention Committee' to identify, implement and monitor actions stemming from the dynamic exigencies of the pandemic, including but not limited to, health management of TSMC's employees, splitting operation and work from home arrangements, identification and control of high risk individuals, rapid investigation of confirmed cases, management of production inventory, supply chain management, and capacity management for demand changes. In 2021 and as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC's current business and results of operations have not been materially affected by the pandemic. However, there is no certainty that the measures TSMC has taken will be sufficient",

        "page_content": "to mitigate further risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and TSMC's ability to perform critical functions and to meet customers' needs could be materially adversely affected as a result. In addition, there is also a risk that any post-pandemic downward changes in consumers' demand for electronic products may, in turn, lead to reduced demand for and place downward pressure on the price of our products and services.\n\nTSMC maintains a comprehensive risk management system dedicated to human safety, the conservation of natural resources and the protection of property. In order to cope effectively with emergencies and natural disasters, management at each facility has developed comprehensive plans and procedures that focus on risk prevention, emergency response, crisis management and business continuity. All TSMC manufacturing fabs have been ISO 14001 certified (environmental management) and ISO 45001 certified (occupational health and safety management). All manufacturing fabs in Taiwan have also been TOSHMS (Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System) certified. New fabs will also attain the above certifications within 18 months after acquiring factory registration certification.\n\nTSMC has further strengthened its business continuity management, which includes periodic risk assessment, risk mitigation, and the establishment of emergency taskforces when necessary, combined with the preparation of a thorough analysis of an emergency, its impact, alternative actions, and solutions for each possible scenario together with appropriate precautionary and/or recovery measures. Each taskforce is given the responsibility of ensuring TSMC's ability to minimize personal injury, business disruption and financial impact under the circumstances. TSMC periodically reviews its business continuity plans and revises them according to exercise results and implementation.\n\nIn response to the impact of the earthquake that occurred in Taiwan, TSMC continued to improve its earthquake emergency response, tool anchorage and seismic isolation facilities, and readiness for tool salvage and production recovery. These improvements have also been integrated into new fab design. TSMC's business continuity procedures were further enhanced through the compliance with ISO 22301.\n\nTSMC and many of its suppliers use flammable and toxic materials in their manufacturing processes and are therefore subject to risks that cannot be completely eliminated arising from explosion, fire, or environmental influences. Although TSMC maintains multiple layers of risk prevention and protection, as well as fire and casualty insurance, TSMC's\n\nrisk management and insurance coverage may not always be sufficient to cover all of its potential losses. If any of TSMC's fabs or vendor facilities were to be damaged or cease operations as a result of an explosion, fire or environmental causes, it could reduce the TSMC's manufacturing capacity leading to the loss of important sales and customers and have a negative impact on TSMC's financial performance. In addition to periodic fire-protection inspections and firefighting drills, TSMC has also carried out a corporate-wide fire risk mitigation project focused on managerial and hardware improvements.\n\n## 6.3.6  Risks Regarding Non-Compliance with Export Control, Environmental and Climate Change Related Laws, Regulations and Accords, and Failure to Timely Obtain Requisite Approvals Necessary for Conducting Business\n\nBecause TSMC engages in manufacturing activities in multiple jurisdictions and conducts business with its customers located worldwide, such activities are subject to a myriad of governmental regulations. For example, the manufacturing, assembling and testing of TSMC's products require the use of metals, chemicals, and materials that are subject to environmental, climate-related, health and safety, and humanitarian conflict-free sourcing laws, regulations and guidelines issued worldwide.\n\nThe Company's failure to comply with any such laws or regulations, as amended from time to time, or its failure to comply with any information or document sharing requests from the relevant authorities in a timely manner could result in: significant penalties and legal liabilities, such as the denial of import or export permits, or third-party private lawsuits,\n\n- \u25cf  criminal or administrative proceedings;\n- \u25cf  the temporary or permanent suspension of production of the affected products;\n- \u25cf  the temporary or permanent inability to procure or use certain production critical chemicals or materials;\n- \u25cf  unfavorable alterations in TSMC's manufacturing, fabrication and assembly and test processes;\n- \u25cf  challenges from its customers that place TSMC at a significant competitive disadvantage, such as loss of actual or potential sales contracts in case the Company is unable to satisfy the applicable legal standard or customer requirement;\n- \u25cf  restrictions on TSMC's operations or sales;\n- \u25cf  loss of tax benefits, including termination of current tax incentives, disqualification of tax credit application and repayment of the tax benefits that the Company are not entitled to; and\n- \u25cf  damages to TSMC's goodwill and reputation.\n\nComplying with applicable laws and regulations, such as environmental and climate related laws and regulations, could also require TSMC, among other things, to do the following: (1) purchase, use or install remedial equipment; (2) implement remedial programs such as climate change mitigation programs; (3) modify its product designs and manufacturing processes, or incur other significant expenses such as obtaining renewable energy sources, renewable energy certificates or carbon credits, substitute raw materials or chemicals that may cost more or be less available for the Company's operations.\n\nTSMC's inability to timely obtain approvals necessary for the conduct of its business could impair its operational and financial results. For example, if the Company is unable to timely obtain environmental related approvals needed to undertake the development and construction of a new fab or expansion project, then such inability may delay, limit, or increase the cost of its expansion plans that could also in turn adversely affect its business and operational results. In light of increased public interest in environmental issues, TSMC's operations and expansion plans may be adversely affected or delayed responding to public concern and social environmental pressures even if the Company complies with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\nTSMC believes that climate change should be regarded as a significant corporate risk that must be managed to improve competitiveness. For TSMC's climate change related risks and control measures, see the 'Climate Change and Energy Management' section under '7.2.1 Environmental Protection' on page 146-147 of this Annual Report.\n\n## 6.3.7 Other Risks\n\nPotential Impact and Risks Associated with Sales of Significant Numbers of Shares by TSMC's Directors, and/ or Shareholders Who Own 10% or More of TSMC's Total Outstanding Shares\n\nThe value of TSMC shareholders' investment may be reduced by possible future sales of TSMC shares owned by major shareholders.\n\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, no single shareholder owned 10% or more of TSMC's total outstanding shares.\n\n## Risks of Trade Policies\n\nAs TSMC's revenue is primarily derived from sales to customers in major global markets (please refer to '2.2.4 TSMC Position, Differentiation and Strategy' on page 14-16 of this annual report), any changes in the trade policies of major economic\n\nregions - such as the increase of tariffs on certain products, the implementation of import and export controls, or the adoption of other trade barriers - could affect  TSMC sales or those of its customers and thereby affect the Company's operating results. TSMC continues to monitor the recent shifts in trade policies and measures among the relevant major economies and will take appropriate actions in accordance with subsequent developments.\n\nIn May 2020 and again in August 2020, the U.S. tightened its export control measures against Huawei Technology Co. Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, 'Huawei'), including an expanded license requirement for providing Huawei with items subject to the U.S. export control jurisdiction. To comply with relevant laws and regulations, we have discontinued shipment of products to Huawei since September 15, 2020. On the other hand, measures adopted by an affected country to counteract impacts of another country's actions or regulations could lead to significant legal liability to multinational corporations including our own. For example, in January 2021, China adopted a blocking statute that, among other matters, entitles Chinese entities incurring damages from a multinational's compliance with foreign laws to seek civil remedies. Additionally, in February 2022, several countries and regions began to impose various measures, including sanctions and export controls, against Russia, including certain individuals and entities, as a result of the military conflict in Ukraine. Imposition of trade barriers, including protectionist measures, sanctions and import and export controls, could increase our manufacturing costs, limit our access to certain supplies and make our pricing less competitive.\n\nIn 2021 and as of the date of this annual report, our current results of operations have not been materially affected. Nevertheless, depending on future developments of global trade tensions, such relevant regulations, rules, or measures may have an adverse impact on our business and operations, and we may incur significant legal liability and financial losses as a result.\n\nTSMC continues to monitor the recent shifts in trade policies and measures among the relevant major economies and will take corresponding responsive actions in accordance with subsequent developments.\n\n## Other Material Risks\n\nIn 2021 and as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC's management was not aware of any other risk that could potentially have a material impact on the financial status of the Company.",

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)\n\n## 7.1 Overview\n\nAs a global leader in the semiconductor industry, TSMC is dedicated to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. The Company collaborates with all stakeholders - employees, shareholders, customers, suppliers, government and society - to drive positive change for society by pursuing three primary missions: acting with integrity, strengthening environmental protection, and caring for the disadvantaged.\n\n## Guidance for the Implementation of ESG\n\nIn keeping with its vision of Uplifting Society, TSMC's ESG policy is the overarching guiding principle for sustainable development. The ESG Matrix, set by TSMC's founder Dr. Morris Chang, clearly defines the scope of the Company's ESG responsibility. The horizontal axis shows the seven areas where TSMC strives to demonstrate its ESG commitment: morality, business ethics, economy, rule of law, sustainability, work/life balance and happiness, and philanthropy. On the vertical axis are actions that TSMC has taken to fulfill these commitments.\n\n## TSMC ESG Matrix\n\n| Society TSMC                                                   | Morality   | Business Ethics   | Economy   | Rule of Law   | Sustainability   | Work/Life  Balance  Happiness   | Philanthropy   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------|-----------|---------------|------------------|---------------------------------|----------------|\n| Integrity                                                      | V          | V                 |           |               |                  |                                 |                |\n| Law Compliance                                                 |            |                   |           | V             |                  |                                 |                |\n| Anti-Corruption  Anti-Bribery  Anti-Cronyism                   | V          | V                 |           | V             |                  |                                 |                |\n| Environmental Protection  Climate Control  Energy Conservation |            |                   |           | V             | V                |                                 |                |\n| Corporate Governance                                           |            | V                 | V         | V             |                  |                                 |                |\n| Provide Well-Paying Jobs                                       |            |                   | V         |               |                  | V                               |                |\n| Good Shareholder Return                                        |            |                   | V         |               |                  |                                 |                |\n| Employees' Work-Life Balance                                   |            |                   |           |               |                  | V                               |                |\n| Encourage Innovation                                           |            | V                 | V         |               |                  |                                 |                |\n| Good Work Environment                                          |            |                   |           |               |                  | V                               |                |\n| TSMC Charity Foundation                                        |            |                   |           |               | V                | V                               | V              |\n| TSMC Education and Culture Foundation                          |            |                   |           |               | V                | V                               | V              |\n\n## ESG Management\n\nThe ESG Steering Committee is committed to aligning TSMC closely with best practices in international sustainability. TSMC's Chairman leads the Steering committee, while the Chairperson of the ESG committee serves as Executive Secretary, and senior executives from a wide variety of functions - all working together to set the short-, medium- and long-term ESG strategic directions that link to the UN's sustainable development goals (SDGs).\n\nESG Department coordinates quarterly meeting, on behalf of the ESG Committee that facilitates cross-divisional communication and issue-based discussions among cross-organizational teams, where committee members jointly set the Company's ESG strategies and targets, identify key issues for the year, draft ESG-related budgets, coordinate resource deployment and carry out annual projects. The committee pursues sustainability in the interest of all stakeholders and ensures the strategies are implemented effectively in daily operations.\n\nThe Board of Directors supervises the Company's sustainability management, strategies, and goals as well as performance measurement. The ESG Committee Chairperson reports quarterly to the Board of Directors on the implementation of plans and\n\nresults. In 2021, TSMC focused primarily on climate change strategy (including net zero emission, carbon footprint, and supply chain carbon emission management), human rights protection under the pandemic, maintaining a diverse and inclusive workplace, making sustainability disclosures and performing sustainable culture advocacy (i.e., TSMC ESG awards). At the same time, to attract and retain corporate executives and to link their compensation with shareholders' interests and ESG achievements, the Board of Directors approved 2021 Employee Restricted Stock Awards Rules and the issuance of 2021 employee restricted stock awards (RSAs). The issuance of the RSAs was approved at the 2021 Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The number of shares to be vested by corporate executives will be subject to a modifier to increase or decrease up to 10% based on the Compensation Committee's evaluation of the Company's ESG achievements.\n\n## Stakeholder Engagement\n\nTSMC respects all stakeholders' rights and interests in sustainability issues. The Company thus deploys multiple communication venues for stakeholders to express ESG opinions and concerns including the 'Contact Us' section of the corporate website, the ESG website and the ESG mailbox, the Irregular Business Conduct Reporting System, as well as the Supply Chain Worker Grievance Channel. Through identification, prioritization and validation, TSMC manages and addresses stakeholders' concerns.\n\n## Stakeholders and Communication Channels in 2021\n\n| Stakeholders           |

The Company's ESH policies aim to achieve 'zero incident' and 'environmental sustainability' and to make TSMC a world-class organization in environmental, safety and health management. The Company's strategies for attaining these goals are to comply with regulations, promote safety and health, strengthen recycling and pollution prevention, manage ESH risks, instill an ESH culture, establish a green supply chain, and fulfill its related corporate social responsibilities.\n\nAll TSMC and its subsidiaries' manufacturing facilities have received ISO 14001: 2015 certification for environmental management systems and ISO 45001: 2018 certification for occupational safety and health management systems. All fabs in Taiwan have been certified by TOSHMS (Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System). All the above certifications are maintained valid. New facilities are required to receive aforementioned certifications within 18 months after receiving facility license per TSMC's internal policy.\n\nTSMC strives for continuous improvement and actively seeks to enhance climate-change management, pollution prevention and control, power and resource conservation, waste reduction and recycling, safety and health management, and fire and explosion prevention as well as to minimize the impact of earthquake damage, so as to reduce overall environmental, safety and health risks.\n\nIn order to meet regulatory and customer requirements for the management of hazardous materials, TSMC has adopted the IECQ QC 080000 Hazardous Substance Process Management (HSPM) System. All TSMC Fabs have been QC 080000 certified and maintained valid since 2007. Through the establishment of QC 080000, TSMC ensures that its products comply with international regulatory and customer requirements, including the European Union's 'Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive,' the EU's 'Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH),' the 'Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer,' the 'halogen-free in electronic products' initiative, perfluorooctane sulfonates (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and related substances restriction standards. In\n\naddition, TSMC started a project for reducing usage of hazardous substance N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) in 2016. NMP usage in process has been reduced 75% by 2021 comparing to 2016, and the project will continue promoting for further reduction.\n\nSince 2011, TSMC has adopted the ISO 50001 Energy Management System for continuous improvement in energy conservation. As of 2021, all TSMC and its subsidiaries' manufacturing facilities had received ISO 50001 Energy Management System certification and maintained valid except for the WaferTech subsidiary in the U.S. WaferTech was originally scheduled to receive the certification in 2021 but certification was postponed to 2022 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAiming to establish the healthiest possible workplace, in 2017 TSMC formed a corporate-level health promotion committee led by managers at the vice president level, which will hold irregular meetings per occupational disease cases or certain needs. The committee members include site directors, managers of safety and health department, and representatives from wellness, HR and legal affairs divisions. External experts have also been invited to discuss the potential risks of occupational diseases in the semiconductor manufacturing process and prevention plans for such diseases. To mitigate health risks to employees, suppliers and contractors in the workplace, TSMC has adopted rigorous safety and health control measures focused on preventing occupational injuries and diseases and promoting employee safety, physical and mental health.\n\nTo minimize the supply chain risk and fulfill corporate social responsibility, TSMC not only follows ESH best practices internally but also strives to improve the ESH performance of its suppliers and contractors through audits and counselling.\n\nTSMC uses priority work management and self-management to govern services provided by contractors. The Company requires contractors performing level-one high-risk operations to complete certification for technicians and to establish their own ISO 45001 safety and health management system. The emphasis on self-management nurtures the sense of responsibility, with the goal of promoting safety awareness and technical improvement for all contractors in the industry. For onsite contractor personnel, TSMC has standardized courses on safety and health and increased the frequency of such",

To ensure the Company's safety protocols are accurately delivered to contractors on a timely basis, TSMC has established a digital platform for mutual communication so that onsite operational risks can be mitigated.\n\nTSMC collaborates with suppliers to manage the sustainability of the supply chain, including formulating supplier sustainability standards, drawing up audit plans, performing audits and tracking improvements, coaching and training, and re-coaching for suppliers with poor performance. Coaching and training are key focuses in 2021, including the establishment of a fire protection designated personnel system (113 suppliers have established) and fire protection practice training (48 participants from 48 suppliers), inviting suppliers to participate as observers for TSMC's annual emergency response drills for six consecutive years (131 participants from 131 suppliers for the cumulative number), environmental, safety and health sustainability forum and good cases sharing (298 participants from 201 suppliers), etc., to improve the performances of environmental protection, safety, health and fire protection. TSMC conducts environmental, safety and health audits to suppliers' manufacturing sites, and actively assists suppliers to improve their environmental, safety and health performances. In addition, the Company requests that suppliers conduct carbon emissions inventory and encourages them to implement measures to save energy, reduce carbon emissions, conserve water and reduce waste.\n\n## 7.2.1 Environmental Protection\n\n## Climate Change and Energy Management\n\n## \u25cf  Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n\nGiven that climate change could potentially affect operations and pose financial risk, in 2018 TSMC adopted recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) released by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to identify risks and opportunities and further establish metrics and target management based on the results identified.\n\n## Management Structure of TSMC Climate-related Risks and Opportunities\n\n| Category            | Management Strategy and Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Governance          | Board of Directors periodically reviews climate change related risks and opportunities \u25cf  ESG Steering Committee led by the Chairman is the Company's top organization dealing with climate change management.

Reduction and Energy Management\n\nFacing the threats presented by extreme weather, TSMC sets strategies and targets, ensure sound execution and build a sustainable culture. In 2021, TSMC declared the long-term goal of Net Zero Emissions by 2050, while setting the short-term goal of zero growth in emissions by 2025. By actively implementing emission reduction measures, the Company is working to return its carbon emissions to the 2020 level by 2030. TSMC commits to becoming a global leader in green manufacturing.\n\nTSMC actively participates in the initiatives of the World Semiconductor Council (WSC), and has incorporated its past experience to develop PFC (perfluorinated compounds) emissions reduction best practices, and fully adopted and implemented since 2012. In 2013, in accordance with the 'EPA Early Actions for Carbon Credit of Greenhouse Gases Reduction' regulation, TSMC applied for the recognition of greenhouse gas reduction from 2005 to 2011, and received 5.28 million tons of carbon dioxide credits in 2015. Those carbon credits can be used to offset greenhouse gas emissions of new manufacturing facilities regulated by Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Act, which can support the Company's sustainable operations and mitigate climate-change risk.",

        "page_content": "Since 2005, TSMC has completed the GHG (Greenhouse Gas) inventory program and taken a complete inventory of its GHG emissions to gain ISO 14064 certification. The inventory shows that the major direct GHG emissions are PFCs, which are widely used in the semiconductor manufacturing process. The primary indirect GHG emission is electricity consumption. The analysis of the inventory data is not only to meet domestic regulatory reporting requirements but also to serve as a baseline reference for the Company's strategy to reduce GHG emissions. Since 2005, TSMC has also participated the international organization Carbon Disclosure Program (CDP) to publicly disclose climate change related information for 17 consecutive years and to continuously review and improve management practices through it.\n\nIn response to the commitment of global climate summit 'Paris Agreement' and the Republic of China's 'Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act' promulgated in 2015, TSMC initiated a cross-functional platform for corporate carbon management in 2016. The three areas of focus of this platform are legal compliance, carbon emission reduction, and carbon credit acquisition. In addition to participating in official regulatory consultation and communications meetings, TSMC also sets short-, medium- and long-term reduction targets through the energy and carbon reduction committee led by the Fab Operations vice president. The measures are carried out by energy and carbon reduction teams of individual fabs. Because more than 75% of TSMC's GHG emissions come from electricity consumption, the Company always emphasizes energy conservation and carbon reduction initiatives. TSMC has not only implemented energy-conserving designs in its manufacturing fabs and offices but has also continuously improved the energy efficiency of its facilities during operation. These efforts simultaneously reduce both carbon dioxide gas emissions and costs. As a result, TSMC has conserved 2.4 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of power since 2016.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2017, TSMC voluntarily participated in the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic Affairs' green power purchasing program for three consecutive years and became the largest buyer in Taiwan, purchasing 400 million kilowatt hours (kWh) of green power. Although the Taiwan Power Company stopped selling green power in 2018, TSMC still aggressively negotiates the purchase of renewable energy with renewable energy suppliers in Taiwan. Targeting a long-term commitment\n\nof 100% renewable energy for the Company, TSMC has committed to achieving a target of 40% renewable energy by 2030. Since 2018, the overseas manufacturing fabs and offices have purchased renewable energy, REC and carbon credits to offset all carbon emissions caused by power consumption. All TSMC overseas sites achieved zero carbon emission of electricity consumption in 2021 again. TSMC also used carbon credits to offset carbon emissions of natural gas consumption in kitchens, achieving the milestone of net zero emissions for TSMC global offices. Although development of renewable energy in Taiwan is in an early stage, TSMC has established a renewable energy task force and continues to communicate closely with government through the Association of Science Park Industries and Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association. The Company has made recommendations to the government in the hope that the collaboration would speed up renewable energy development in Taiwan. The recommendations include expanding the development of offshore wind power and increasing the supply of the renewable energy trading platform. TSMC continues to find renewable energy. By the end of 2021, the total installation capacity of renewable energy contracted reached 1.6 GW (Gigawatts). The renewable energy will be provided to TSMC gradually after the related business process has been completed. This is a clear manifestation of the Company's active support of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nIn 2020 TSMC became the first semiconductor company to join RE100 (the global corporate renewable energy initiative) and pledged that power consumption of all the Company's manufacturing plants and offices will be 100% supplied from renewable energy by 2050.\n\n## TSMC GHG Emissions in Recent Two Years\n\nUnit: Metric ton CO 2 equivalent\n\n|   Year | Scope 1   | Scope 2   |\n|--------|-----------|-----------|\n|   2021 | 2,591,231 | 8,045,102 |\n|   2020 | 2,450,354 | 7,459,856 |\n\nNote 1: GHG includes CO 2 , CH 4 , N 2 O, HCFCs, PFCs, SF 6 , NF 3\n\n## TSMC GHG Reduction Target and Achievement Status\n\n| Strategy                                                                                                                              | 2030 Goal                                                                                                                                                      | 2021 Target and  Achievement                                                                                                                                | Achievement  Status   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Continue to use  best available  technology to  reduce emissions of  GHG and become  an industry leader  in low-carbon  manufacturing | Reduce GHG emissions  per unit product  (metric ton of carbon  dioxide equivalent  (MTCO 2 e)/12-inch  equivalent wafer mask  layer) by 40% (Base  year: 2010) | Reduced GHG emissions  per unit product  (metric ton of carbon  dioxide equivalent  (MTCO 2 e)/12-inch  equivalent wafer mask  layer) by 23% (Target:  20%) | Achieved              |\n\n## Air and Water Pollution Control\n\nThe Company has installed effective air and water pollution control equipment in each wafer fab to meet regulatory emissions standards. In addition, TSMC maintains backup pollution control systems, including emergency power supplies, to lower the risk of pollutant emissions in the event of equipment failure. The Company centrally monitors the operations of its air and water pollution control equipment monitored by 24 hours a day rotating staff and treats system effectiveness as an important tracking item to ensure the quality of emitted air and discharged water.\n\nTo make the most effective use of Taiwan's limited water resources, all TSMC fabs strive to increase water reclamation rates by adjusting the water usage of manufacturing equipment and improving wastewater reclamation systems. By 2021, TSMC's unit product water consumption had decreased by 15% from 2010 levels. The long-term target is a 30% decrease by 2030. All fabs meet or exceed the process water reclamation rate standard of the Science Park Administration. Some fabs are able to reclaim more than 90% of process water, outperforming most semiconductor fabs around the world. The Company also makes every effort to reduce non-manufacturing-related water consumption, including water used in air conditioning systems, sanitary facilities, wall cleaning and landscaping activities and in kitchens. TSMC uses an intranet website to collect and measure water recycling volumes company-wide.\n\nSince water resources are inherently local, TSMC shares its water saving experience and expertise with other semiconductor companies through the Association of Science-Based Industrial Park to promote water conservation in order to achieve the Science Park's goals and ensure a long-term balance of supply and demand. In addition, TSMC\n\nhas committed to using partially reclaimed water in newly constructed fabs in the future in order to further reuse water resources and support government policy and promotion for reclaimed water.\n\nTo further enhance water resources management, TSMC has adopted and followed the AWS Standard, the world's only sustainable water management standard. Early in 2019, Fab 6 and Fab 14 Phase 5/6/7 began serving as demonstration factories and received AWS certification, making TSMC the first semiconductor enterprise in the world to receive AWS platinum level certification. In 2020, Fab 15A and Fab 15B, located in Central Taiwan Science Park, passed a third-party verification audit and obtained AWS platinum level certification simultaneously. In December 2021, Fab 12A, Fab 12B, Fab 5, located in Hsinchu Science Park, and Longtan Science Park Advanced Backend Fab 3 passed a third-party verification audit and will obtain AWS platinum level certification in early 2022.\n\n## TSMC Water Usage in Recent Two Years\n\n|   Year | Total Water Usage (m 3 )   |   Unit Product Water Usage  (L/12-inch wafer-e-layer) |\n|--------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n|   2021 | 82,674,982                 |                                                 119.7 |\n|   2020 | 77,257,163                 |                                                 128.4 |\n\nNote 1: Including TSMC fabs in Taiwan and Subsidiaries.\n\n## TSMC Water Usage Reduction Target and Achievement Status\n\n| Strategy                                                                                                              | 2030 Goal                                                                                              | 2021 Target and  Achievement                         | Achievement  Status   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Enforce climate  change mitigation  policies, implement  water conservation  and water shortage  adaptation  measures | Reduce unit water  consumption (liter/12- inch equivalent wafer  mask layer) by 30%  (Base year: 2010) | Reduced unit water  consumption by 15%  (Target: 9%) | Achieved              |\n\n## Waste Management and Recycling\n\nTSMC has expanded its facilities rapidly in recent years both at home in Taiwan and overseas. In 2021 the Company's total outsourced general waste was 335,080 tons; its hazardous waste was 339,623 tons; and its unit waste disposal was 0.99 kg/12-inch equivalent wafer mask layers.

The priorities are process waste reduction, onsite and offsite recycling and regeneration, with the last options being incineration and landfill. In 2017, TSMC amended its articles of incorporation to add four business items for chemical materials to ensure waste flow and reduce risks of improper waste disposal by commissioned agencies. It also set up onsite resource activation facilities to convert waste resources produced by processing activities into products to be used onsite or to sell to other factories. In 2021, TSMC recycled waste copper sulfate, cobalt-containing liquid, waste sulfuric acid and waste ammonium sulfate, all of which were regenerated into products. The Company also developed the system of cryolite synthesis whereby waste HF (hydrogen fluoride) is recycled and regenerated into raw material for other industries. As a result, it has become a leader in waste resources regeneration. At the same time, TSMC's fabs in Taiwan achieved a 95% waste recycling rate for the seventh consecutive year, with a landfill rate below 1% for the twelfth consecutive year, and Fab 12 won the platinum UL 2799 certification, the highest grade for zero landfill.\n\n## TSMC Waste Quantity and Outsourced Unit Waste Disposal in Recent Two Years\n\n|   Year | Outsourced  General Waste  (ton) (Note 1)   | Outsourced  Hazardous Waste  (ton) (Note 1)   |   Outsourced Unit  Waste Disposal  (Note 2) (kg/12-inch  equivalent wafer  mask layer) |\n|--------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|   2021 | 335,080                                     | 339,623                                       |                                                                                   0.99 |\n|   2020 | 277,340                                     | 298,400                                       |                                                                                   1.01 |\n\n- Note 2: The data is Outsourced Unit Waste Disposal of Taiwan facilities.\n\n## TSMC Waste Reduction Target and Achievement Status\n\n| Strategy                                                                                                             | 2030 Goal                                                                                    | 2021 Target and  Achievement                                                                                  | Achievement  Status   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Promote waste  reduction by source  separation and  require vendors to  provide low chemical  consumption  equipment | Outsourced unit waste  disposal per wafer  \u2266 0.50 (kg/12-inch  equivalent wafer mask  layer) | Outsourced unit waste  disposal per wafer 0.99  (kg/12-inch equivalent  wafer mask layer)  (Target:  \u2266 1.15%) | Exceeded              |\n\nIn order to ensure that all waste is treated and recycled properly, TSMC closely tracks the waste that is implemented in the process of recycling and reuse by clean and disposal vendors. The Company carefully selects waste disposal and recycling vendors that have certificates and permits, regularly checks the onsite operational status, disposal declaration forms, operational records, etc., compares with actual reuse and disposal, and takes proactive steps to strengthen vendor auditing. For example, all waste transportation contractors have agreed to join the GPS Satellite Fleet so that the cleanup transportation routes and abnormal stays for all trucks can be traced. All waste recycling and disposal vendors have installed closed-circuit TV systems at operating sites to monitor and audit waste handling. In addition, TSMC also conducts an ongoing survey of recycled product tracking and requires all recycling contractors to report their recycled product sales monthly to track waste flow and ensure that actions are taken to adhere to lawful and proper waste recycling and treatment.\n\n## Environmental Accounting\n\nThe purpose of TSMC's environmental accounting system is to identify and quantify environmental costs for internal management. At the same time, the Company also evaluates the savings or economic benefits of environmental protection programs so as to continuously promote economically-effective programs. While environmental expenses are expected to continue to rise, environmental accounting can help manage these costs more effectively. TSMC's environmental accounting measures various environmental costs, establishes independent environmental account codes, and provides the data to all units for use in annual budgeting. The Company's economic benefit evaluation calculates cost savings for energy conservation, water or waste reductions and recycling benefits in accordance with its environmental protection programs. The benefits disclosed in this report include real income from projects such as waste recycling and savings from major environmental projects.

All TSMC fabs in Taiwan have received TOSHMS (Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System) certification since 2009. In 2018, the International Organization for Standardization released ISO 45001: 2018, replacing OHSAS 18001, with major changes in the expansion of the scope, support and participation of the leadership, the collection and planning of internal and external issues, the expectations and demand of stakeholders, the evaluation of risk inspections, communication and consultation with non-managers, the application of performance indicators, and the evaluation of corrective and preventive actions. Meanwhile, ISO 45001 ensures the spirit of the system can be effectively implemented at the management level through management review, internal audit, automatic check, and security patrol to find safety concerns and opportunities for improvement. All fabs in Taiwan received ISO 45001 certification for occupational health and safety in 2019 and all TSMC subsidiaries obtained the certification in 2020. All the above certifications are maintained valid. New facilities are required to receive aforementioned certifications within 18 months after receiving facility license per TSMC's internal policy.\n\nBesides accident prevention, TSMC has established emergency response procedures to protect employees and contractors if a disaster should occur, as well as to prevent and/or reduce the negative impact on the community and the environment. TSMC communicates regularly with suppliers to ensure that potential risk in the operation of production equipment is minimized and that safety control procedures are followed rigorously during installation. The Company places stringent controls on high-risk operations and also evaluates the seismic tolerance of its facilities and equipment to reduce the risk of earthquake damage.\n\nFor epidemics, TSMC has established corporate-level prevention committees and procedures for emergency response to outbreaks of infectious diseases.\n\n## Working Environment and Employee Safety and Health Protection\n\nThe Company's ESH policy is focused on establishing a safe working environment, preventing occupational injury and illness, keeping employees healthy, enhancing every employee's awareness and sense of accountability to ESH, and building an ESH culture.\n\nThere were a total of 44 occupational injuries in 2021, with 44 people, representing approximately 0.08% of the total number of employees. The disabling injury frequency rate (FR) was 0.38, under the 0.4 target, but the disability injury severity rate (SR) was 7, in excess of the target of 4. In response, TSMC is reviewing potential improvement measures, such as interlocking devices for machine safety, as well as standard safety operation procedures. In addition to regular reviews, the caring program for employees has been enhanced and managers have been directed to pay closer attention to the physical and mental state of employees to ensure their safety and health during their work.\n\nTSMC safety and health management operations apply to the following:\n\n## \u25cf  Equipment Safety and Health Management\n\nIn addition to meeting regulatory requirements and internal standards, as well as mitigating ESH-related risks when building or expanding facilities, TSMC also maintains procedures governing new equipment and raw materials, requires safety approvals for bringing new tools online, updates safety rules, and implements seismic protection and other safety measures. TSMC requires that all new tools meet SEMI-S8 requirements and that appropriate supplementary control measures be taken to reduce ergonomic risk. Moreover, the Company endeavors to automate 300mm front-opening unified pod (FOUP) transportation to prevent accumulative physical damage caused by repetitive manual handling of 300mm FOUPs. TSMC 300mm fabs have converted to automatic transportation control.\n\n## \u25cf  Environmental, Safety and Health Evaluation of New Tools and New Chemical Substances\n\nAs a technology leader in the global semiconductor industry, TSMC operates increasingly diversified process tools and introduces new chemicals in the R&D stage. Before using new tools or new chemicals, they are reviewed carefully by the new tools and new chemical review committee. The purpose is to\n\nensure that new tools are compliant with the semiconductor industry's safety standards (such as SEMI-S2) and that new chemicals' environmental, safety and health concerns can be well controlled, including engineering controls, application of personal protection equipment, and operational safety training during storage, transportation, usage and disposal. A total of 403 cases of new tools and chemical substances were passed by the New Tool and New Chemical Review Committee in 2021, and they were evaluated and reviewed in accordance with the aforementioned standards before entering TSMC.\n\n## \u25cf  General Safety Management, Training and Audit\n\nAll TSMC manufacturing facilities hold environmental, safety and health committee meetings on a monthly basis. TSMC has adopted multiple preventive measures such as controls on high-risk work, contractor management, chemical safety management, personal protective equipment requirements, and safety audit management. In addition, the Company maintains detailed disaster response procedures and performs regular drills designed to minimize damage to employees and property, as well as the impact on society and the environment in the event of a disaster.\n\n## TSMC Safety-Related Training and Promotion in the Recent Two Years\n\n|   Year | Total Number of Employees who have Completed  Safety-related Training   |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|   2021 | 289,398                                                                 |\n|   2020 | 244,747                                                                 |\n\n## \u25cf  Working Environment Hazardous Factors Management\n\nTSMC conducts workplace hazard assessments to provide a comfortable, safe workplace to employees. The Company also educates and requires employees to use personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent hazardous exposures.\n\nThe Company performs semi-annual workplace environment assessments of physical and chemical hazards, including CO 2 concentration, illumination, noise, and hazardous chemical substances regulated by local laws. In addition, TSMC performs exposure assessments and uses hierarchy management control for chemicals with potential health hazards.

        "page_content": "## \u25cf  Health Promotion Program\n\nIn order to establish the healthiest possible workplace and reduce the incidence of occupational disease, TSMC formed a corporate-level committee to carry out health promotion programs covering three key areas:\n\n- 1.  Exposure and health risk assessment: develop an exposure assessment system to identify high health risk employees.\n- 2.  Hazardous training and notification: use standardized training materials for employees and contractors in all TSMC fabs. Inform them of the health risks and prevention measures at the workplace before working or providing any services there.\n- 3.  Strengthen management of chemicals with significant health risks: inform suppliers that all materials they provide to TSMC must comply with applicable laws including clear disclosure of any hazardous substances. Perform sampling of raw materials used in the manufacturing process to confirm that they do not contain any carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic-reproductive materials as claimed in supplier's safety data sheet (SDS).\n\n## \u25cf  Emergency Response\n\nThe planning and execution of an effective emergency response should identify potential high-risk events via risk assessment and be prepared for various scenarios. It should focus on continuous improvement and drills covering all potentially serious events. TSMC's emergency response plans include procedures for rapid-response crisis management and disaster recovery for potential incidents.\n\nAll TSMC fabs conduct major annual emergency response exercises and evacuation drills. TSMC's onsite service contractors are also required to participate in emergency response planning and exercises to ensure cooperation in handling accidents and to effectively minimize any damage caused by disasters. At least every two years, each fab director invites fab management and support functions to participate in business continuity drills for potentially high-risk events such as earthquake, fire and flood (at the Tainan site). Since 2018, TSMC has conducted complex accident emergency response drills, which include simultaneous scenarios for earthquake, fire and chemical spills to ensure rapid response to emergencies so that losses can be minimized in the event of a real disaster. In 2020, TSMC took lead in the industry to introduce the All-Hazard approach recommended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to conduct disaster prevention exercises.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, TSMC added tabletop exercises to disaster prevention training in an effort to minimize the risks of group infections that may arise as a result of full-scale exercises. The inclusion of tabletop exercises also aids in the verification of full-scale exercise procedures to make disaster response more comprehensive, thus effectively mitigating the impact of various types of disasters on business continuity in the future. As of 2021, 215 sessions of tabletop exercises had been completed in addition to 125 full-scale exercises.\n\nIn addition to the regular emergency response drills held by engineering and facilities departments each quarter, the Company's laboratory, canteen, dormitory, and shuttle bus personnel also hold emergency response drills to prepare for events such as earthquakes, chemical spills, ammonia release, fires and traffic accidents.\n\n## \u25cf  Emerging Infectious Disease Response\n\nTSMC has a dedicated corporate ESH organization to monitor emerging infectious diseases around the world, to assess any potential impact on the workplace, and to provide an appropriate strategic response plan. In previous outbreaks such as SARS in 2003, H1N1 influenza in 2009, and MERS in 2015, as well as with the current COVID-19 threat, TSMC followed the Taiwan CDC's (Centers for Disease Control) rules and convened the corporate influenza response committee to develop the Company's strategies. These strategies included educating employees in prevention and response, publishing guidelines for managers, establishing guidelines for employee sick leave due to flu, and installing alcohol-based hand sanitizers at appropriate locations. The Committee also monitors the status of employee leave due to illness and, at the same time, develops a continuity plan to address manpower shortages and minimize business impact. In order to protect the health of TSMC employees, their families, and work partners, employees are encouraged to be fully vaccinated if in healthy condition. In addition, employees should complete daily body temperature checks and update vaccination information before entering TSMC, and continue to follow epidemic prevention regulations such as wearing a mask, washing their hands frequently and maintaining safe social distancing.\n\n## \u25cf  Employee Physical and Mental Health Enhancement\n\nTSMC believes that employee physical and mental health is not only fundamental to maintaining sound business operations\n\nbut is also an important part of a corporation's responsibility. To preserve and promote the physical and mental health of its employees, TSMC fosters collaboration among the onsite industrial safety and environmental protection department, the onsite medical personnel of the health center, and physicians of occupational medicine. TSMC strives to reduce cerebral and cardiovascular conditions or injuries that might be induced or aggravated by overwork, night work or shift work. The Company conducts programs for maternal health protection and for prevention of cumulative trauma disorders as well. TSMC devotes significant resources to mental health awareness, focused not only on hazards at work but also on employee health in general. In 2021, through planned personal health management, (1) 550 female employees participated in the maternal health program, and the completion rate was 100%. All but one of them were at first degree risk, where there was no potential harm to the mother or infant. One woman was assessed as second degree risk, with potential harm to the mother or infant, but after proper adjustments to her work duties, her risk was downgraded to first degree. (2) Through analysis of historical cerebral and cardiovascular cases of its employees, TSMC has sharpened the disease assessment criteria used by contracted doctors, and, in combination with internal annual health examination reports and work scheduling information, the Company was able to identify 3,520 employees with middle to high risk for cerebral and cardiovascular diseases. These employees were provided with health education and medical assistance. Also, they and their managers received recommended changes in working hours and shifts to reduce health risks. (3) 168 employees were identified as high risk for cumulative trauma disorders, including one who might also have job-related risks, and the Company adjusted working conditions accordingly to reduce potential risks. (4) As obesity has been considered as a precursor to hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, TSMC has held health promotion programs for several consecutive years. In 2021, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and catering to the younger generation's preference for social and video media, apart from physical weight loss activities (671 participants; total weight loss reached 3,155.82kg),TSMC conducted a series of online interactive activities including: three sessions of 'Health Lecture Online' with 1,527 attendees in total; three health education videos about Weight-loss Diets/ Sport and improving sleeping, with a total of 8,947 visits; three sessions of online quizzes on the same three topics of Weight-loss Diets/Sport and improving sleeping, with a total of 14,910 attendees; and two session of 'Selection of Health\n\nDiet' of Low-sugar diets and 211 balanced diet, with 3,373 participants. In addition, one-on-one sleep counseling related to psychology has been increased in 2021, 220 attendees in total. The above activities have all received positive feedback from employees. In the future, we will continue to implement relevant health promotion activities to take care of the health of employees.\n\n## 7.2.4 Supplier Management\n\n## Management Aspect\n\nFor better supply chain management, TSMC is committed to communicating with and encouraging its suppliers, including contractors, to increase their quality, cost effectiveness and delivery performance, and make continuous improvement in environmental protection, safety and health. Through regular communication with senior managers, site audits and experience sharing, the Company collaborates with major suppliers and contractors to enhance partnerships and ensure continued improvement of performance and increased joint contributions to society. As noted above, contractors performing high-risk activities must lay out clearly defined safety precautions and preventative measures. In addition, contractors working on high-risk engineering projects must establish ISO 45001 or OHSAS 18001 systems and the workers must successfully complete work-related skill training. All contractors performing high-risk activities have obtained ISO 45001 certification before the end of 2021.\n\n## Supply Chain Sustainability\n\nTSMC works with suppliers in several fields of sustainable development, such as greening the supply chain, carbon management for climate change, mitigation of fire risk, ESH management and business continuity plans in the event of a natural disaster.\n\nSince becoming a full member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) in 2015, TSMC has completed implementation of the RBA code of conduct throughout the Company by performing self-assessments at its facilities worldwide and reviewing policies and procedures in the areas of labor, health and safety, environment, ethics and management systems.\n\nTo enhance supply chain sustainability and streamline risk management, the Company is committed to collaborating with its suppliers to maintain full compliance with Taiwan's environmental, safety, health and fire protection regulations. TSMC developed a supplier's code of conduct, which",

TSMC works with suppliers to evaluate the risk and impact on the economy, the environment, and society and to make continuous improvement. The Company has helped boost suppliers' performance of sustainability through experience sharing and training and hopes to establish a world-class semiconductor supply chain that exceeds international standards and serves as a global benchmark.\n\nTSMC is subject to the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure rule on conflict minerals released under Rule 13p-1 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a recognized global leader in the high-tech supply chain, the Company acknowledges its corporate social responsibility to strive to procure conflict-free minerals in an effort to recognize humanitarian and ethical social principles that protect the dignity of all people. To this end, TSMC has implemented a series of compliance safeguards in accordance with leading industry practices such as adopting the due diligence framework in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s Model Supply Chain Policy for a Responsible Global Supply Chain of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High Risk Areas issued in 2011.\n\nTSMC is a strong supporter of the Responsible Business Alliance and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), which will help the Company's suppliers source conflict-free minerals through their jointly developed Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). Since 2011, TSMC has asked its suppliers to disclose information and make timely updates on smelters and mines. The Company encourages suppliers to source minerals from facilities or smelters that have received a 'conflict free' designation by a recognized industry group (such as the RBA) and also requires those who have not received such designation to become compliant with Responsible Minerals Initiative or an equivalent third-party audit program. TSMC requires the use of conflict-free tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold in its products.\n\nTSMC will continue to conduct the supplier survey annually and require suppliers to improve and expand their disclosure to fulfill regulatory and customer requirements. For further information, see the Company's Form SD filed with the U.S. SEC. (https:// www.tsmc.com/english/investorRelations/sec\\_filings.htm)\n\n## 7.3 TSMC Education and Culture Foundation\n\nTaiwan has had its biggest battle against the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. Every sector in the society has been gravely affected and the efforts to launch artistic, cultural and educational campaigns have been seriously challenged. In the face of the pandemic, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation still endeavours to continue its support for various educational and cultural events, art exhibitions and performance. At the same time, as a response to pandemic restriction measures, the Foundation taps into the power of technology to make its upmost efforts to encourage girls' high schools to engage in the scientific fields, to empower teachers in rural communities, and to initiate classes that teach and continue traditional theater courses on university campuses. In doing so, the cultural and educational work to which the Foundation has dedicated itself would not be disrupted because of the severe pandemic situation. In 2021, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation has invested NT$87 millions in culture and education events that revolve around three main themes: 'nurture young talents,' 'education collaboration,' and 'advocation for arts and culture'. The Foundation's efforts continue to inject abundant resources into the arts and education sectors in the society in order to drive the society to the common good, begin a positive cycle, and grow sustainably.\n\n## Value Gender Diversity, Encourage Women to Engage in STEM Fields\n\nThe TSMC Education and Culture Foundation teams up with National Museum of Natural Science to organize the TSMC Female Scientists Tour. Through trips to science museums and talks by female scientists, the Foundation hopes to spark female students' interest and nurture female talent in the sciences. In 2021, the Foundation invited 450 girls from 12 girls' high schools in Taiwan to take part in the TSMC Female Scientists Tour, whose program includes a visit to the educational hall at the World of Semiconductors. The trip was guided by female engineers at TSMC, giving students a chance to further understand the designing, manufacturing and application of semi-conductors. Other events in the trip include talks by renown Taiwanese female scientists and outstanding female engineers to share with young students their educational trajectory and work experiences. The students further learned the application of basic electronics at circuit board workshops. The TSMC Education and Culture\n\nFoundation hopes to encourage more female high school students to engage in studying in the STEM fields, thereby nurturing more science and technology talents for the country.\n\nIn 2021, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation also continues to hold the TSMC Cup - Competition of Scientific Short Talk. Held online due to the pandemic, the competition had two award categories: 'competition for expressing scientific innovation' and 'essay awards on reading popular science books'. Apart from the two competition themes, the Foundation organized a series of online classes for competing participants, aiming to strengthen their ability to express themselves.

        "page_content": "Key audit matter for the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 is stated as follows:\n\nProperty, plant and equipment (PP&E) -commencement of depreciation related to PP&E classified as equipment under installation and construction in progress (EUI/CIP)\n\nRefer to Notes 4, 5 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Company's evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP involves determining when the assets are available for their intended use. The criteria the Company uses to determine whether  EUI/CIP  are  available  for  their  intended  use  involves  subjective  judgments  and assumptions about the conditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on when depreciation is recognized.\n\nGiven the subjectivity in determining the date to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the Company's  judgments  and  assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment. Consequently, the validity of commencement of depreciation related to PP&E classified as EUI/CIP is identified as a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit procedures related to the evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP included the following, among others:\n\n- 1. We  read  the  Company's  policy  and  understood  the  criteria  used  to  determine  when  to commence depreciation.\n- 2. We  tested  the  effectiveness  of  the  controls  over  the  evaluation  of  when  to  commence depreciation of EUI/CIP.\n- 3. We sampled the year-end balance of EUI/CIP and performed the following for each selection:\n- a.  Evaluated whether the selection did not meet the criteria specified by the Company for commencement of depreciation.\n- b. Observed the assets and evaluated their status.\n- 4. We sampled and evaluated whether the selection of EUI/CIP met the criteria specified by the Company for commencement of depreciation during the year.\n- 5. We sampled and evaluated whether the selection of EUI/CIP met the criteria specified by the Company for commencement of depreciation subsequent to year end.\n\n## Other Matter\n\nWe have also audited the parent company only financial statements of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 on which we have issued an unmodified opinion.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers and the IFRS, IAS, IFRIC, and SIC endorsed and issued into effect by the Financial Supervisory Commission of the Republic of China, and for such internal control as management\n\n- 5 -",

        "page_content": "determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern,  disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose charged with governance (including members of the Audit Committee) are responsible for overseeing the Company's financia l reporting process.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur  objectives  are  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  consolidated  financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue  an  auditors'  report  that  includes  our  opinion.  Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- 1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- 2.  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effec tiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- 3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- 4. Conclude  on  the  appropriateness  of  management's  use  of the  going  concern  basis  of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant  doubt  on  the  Company's  ability  to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- 5.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\n## The basis for the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of TSMC and entities controlled by TSMC (its subsidiaries).\n\nIncome and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the shareholders of the parent and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n\nWhen necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Company.\n\nAll intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.\n\n- 16 -",

        "page_content": "Changes in the Company's ownership interests in subsidiaries that  do  not  result  in the  Company  losing control  over  the  subsidiaries  are  accounted  for  as  equity  transactions.  The  carrying  amounts  of  the Company's interests and the non -controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity and attributed to shareholders of the parent.\n\nWhen the Company loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss and is calculated as the difference between:\n\n- a. the aggregate of the fair value of consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest at the date when control is lost; and\n- b. the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interest.\n\nThe Company shall account for all amounts recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary on the same basis as would be required if the Company had directly disposed of the related assets and liabilities.\n\nThe fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate.\n\n## The subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe detail information of the subsidiaries at the end of reporting period was as follows:\n\n|                  |                                                           |                                                                                                                   | Establishment                    | Percentage of Ownership   | Percentage of Ownership   |        |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------|\n| Name of Investor | Name of Investee                                          | Main Businesses and Products                                                                                      | and Operating  Location          | December 31,  2021        | December 31,  2020        | Note   |\n| TSMC             | TSMC North America                                        | Sales and marketing of integrated  circuits and other semiconductor  devices                                      | San Jose, California,  U.S.A.    | 100%                      | 100%                      | -      |\n|                  | TSMC Europe B.V.

The functional currency of TSMC and presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements are both New Taiwan Dollars (NT$). In preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  operating  results  and  financial  positions  of  each consolidated entity are translated into NT$.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements of each individual consolidated entity, transactions in currencies other than the entity's functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Such exchange differences are recognized in profit  or  loss  in  the  year  in  which  they  arise.  Non-monetary  items  measured  at  fair  value  that  are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items are included in profit or loss for the year except for exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognized directly in other comprehensive income, in which case, the exchange differences are also recognized directly in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not retranslated.\n\nFor the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign operations are translated into NT$ using exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity (attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate).\n\n## Classification of Current and Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities\n\nCurrent assets are assets held for trading purposes and assets expected to be converted to cash, sold or consumed within one year from the end of the reporting period. Current liabilities are obligations incurred for trading purposes and obligations expected to be settled within one year from the end of the reporting period.  Assets  and  liabilities  that  are  not  classified  as  current  are  noncurrent  assets  and  liabilities, respectively.\n\n- 18 -\n\nEstablishment\n\nPercentage of Ownership\n\n|                  |                                                   |                                                                    | and Operating      | December 31,   | December 31,   |      |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|----------------|------|\n| Name of Investor | Name of Investee                                  | Main Businesses and Products                                       | Location           | 2021           | 2020           | Note |\n| TSMC Partners    | TSMC Development, Inc.

        "page_content": "## Cash Equivalents\n\nCash equivalents, for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments, consist of highly liquid time deposits and investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities shall be recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are initially recognized at fair values. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\n## Financial Assets\n\nThe classification of financial assets depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined  at  the  time  of  initial  recognition.  Regular  way  purchases  or  sales  of  financial  assets  are recognized and derecognized on a trade date or settlement date basis for which financial assets were classified in the same way, respectively. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.\n\n## a. Category of financial assets and measurement\n\nFinancial assets are classified into the following categories: financial assets at FVTPL, investments in debt instruments and equity instruments at FVTOCI, and financial assets at amortized cost.\n\n## 1)  Financial asset at FVTPL\n\nFor certain financial assets which include debt instruments that do not meet the criteria of amortized cost or FVTOCI, it is mandatorily required to measure them at FVTPL. Any gain or loss arising from remeasurement is recognized in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss incorporates any interest earned on the financial asset.\n\n## 2)  Investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI\n\nDebt instruments with contractual terms specifying that cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, together with objective of collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, are measured at FVTOCI.\n\nInterest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment gains or losses on investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI are recognized in profit or loss. Other changes in the carrying amount of these debt instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income and will be reclassified to profit or loss when these debt instruments are disposed.\n\n## 3)  Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI\n\nOn initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate investments in equity investments that is not held for trading as at FVTOCI.\n\n- 19 -",

Impairment of financial assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, a loss allowance for expected credit loss is recognized for financial assets at amortized cost (including accounts receivable) and for investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI.\n\nThe loss allowance for accounts receivable is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. For financial assets at amortized cost and investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI, when the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from possible default events of a financial instrument within 12 months after the reporting date. If, on the other hand, there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\n\nThe Company recognizes an impairment loss in profit or loss for all financial instruments with a corresponding  adjustment  to  their  carrying  amount  through  a  loss  allowance  account,  except  for investments  in  debt  instruments  that  are  measured  at  FVTOCI,  for  which  the  loss  allowance  is recognized in other comprehensive income and does not reduce the carrying amount of the financial asset.\n\n## c. Derecognition of financial assets\n\nThe Company derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset to another entity.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial asset at amortized cost in its entirety, the differ ence between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognized in profit or loss. On derecognition of an investment in a debt instrument at FVTOCI, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized in profit or loss. However, on derecognition of an investment in an equity instrument at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred directly to retained earnings, without recycling through profit or loss.\n\n- 20 -",

        "page_content": "## Financial Liabilities and Equity Instruments\n\n## Classification as debt or equity\n\nDebt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are subsequently measured either at amortized cost using effective interest method or at FVTPL.\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss when the financial liability is either held for trading or is designated as at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognized in profit or loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities other than those held for trading purposes and designated as at FVTPL are subsequently measured at amortized cost at the end of each reporting period.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nThe Company derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when,  the  Company's  obligations  are discharged, cancelled or they expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration paid and payable is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative financial instrument is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.\n\n## Hedge Accounting\n\n## a. Fair value hedge\n\nThe Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as interest rate futures contracts, to partially hedge against the fair value change caused by interest rates fluctuation in the Company's fixed income investments. Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognized in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged items that are attributable to the hedged risk.\n\n- 21 -",

Cash flow hedge\n\nThe Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as forward contracts, to partially hedge its foreign  exchange  rate  risks  or  interest  rate  risks  associated  with  certain  highly  probable  forecast transactions (capital expenditures or issuance of debts). The effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments is recognized in other comprehensive income. When forecast transactions actually take place, the accumulated gains or losses that were recognized in other comprehensive income are removed from equity and included in the initial cost of the hedged items, or reclassified to finance costs of hedged items in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss. The gains or losses from hedging instruments relating to the ineffective portion are recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nThe Company prospectively discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship ceases to meet the qualifying criteria; for instance, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories are recorded at standard cost and adjusted to approximate weighted-average cost at the end of the reporting period. Net realizable value represents  the  estimated  selling  price  of  inventories  less  all  estimated  costs  of  completion  and  costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## Investments Accounted for Using Equity Method\n\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method are investments in associates.\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\nThe operating results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Company's share of profit or loss and other comprehensive incom e of the associate as well as the distribution received. The Company also recognizes its share in the changes in the equities of associates.\n\nAny excess of the cost of acquisition over the Company's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of an associate recognized at the date of acquisition is recognized as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Company's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nWhen necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.\n\nWhen the Company subscribes to additional shares in an associate at a percentage different from its existing ownership percentage, the resulting carrying amount of the investment differs from the amount of the Company's proportionate interest in the net assets of the associate. The Company records such a difference as an adjustment to investments with the corresponding amount charged or credited to capital surplus. If the Company's  ownership  interest  is  reduced  due  to  the  additional  subscription to the shares of associate by other investors, the proportionate amount of the gains or losses previously recognized in other comprehensive\n\n- 22 -",

Costs  include  any  incremental  costs  that  are  directly  attributable  to  the  construction, acquisition of the item of property, plant and equipment or borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative purposes  are  carried  at  cost,  less  any  recognized  impairment  loss.  Such  assets  are  classified  to  the appropriate categories of property, plant and equipment when completed and ready for intended use. Depreciation  of  these  assets,  on  the  same  basis  as  other  identical  categories  of  property,  plant  and equipment, commences when the assets are available for their intended use.\n\nDepreciation is recognized so as to write off the cost of the assets less their residual values over their useful lives, and it is computed using the straight-line method mainly over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements - 20 years; buildings (assets used by the Company and assets subject to operating leases) - 10 to 20 years; machinery and equipment (assets used by the Company and assets subject to operating leases)  -  5  years;  and  office  equipment  -  5  years.  The  estimated  useful  lives,  residual  values  and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimates accounted for on a prospective basis. Land is not depreciated.\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the assets. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Leases\n\nFor a contract that contains a lease component and non-lease component, the Company may elect to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\n\n## The Company as lessor\n\nRental income from operating lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\n## The Company as lessee\n\nExcept for payments for low-value asset leases and short-term leases (leases of machinery and equipment and others) which are recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis, the Company recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases at the commencement date of the lease.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost. The cost of right-of-use assets comprises the initial measurement of lease liabilities adjusted for lease payments and initial direct costs made at or before the commencement date,  plus  an  estimate  of  costs  needed  to  restore  the  underlying  assets.  Subsequent  measurement  is calculated as cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss and adjusted for changes in lease liabilities as a result of lease term modifications or other related factors. Right-of-use assets are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n- 23 -",

        "page_content": "Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement dates to the earlier of the end of the useful lives of the right-of-use assets or the end of the lease terms. If the lease transfers ownership of the underlying assets to the Company by the end of the lease terms or if the cost of right-of-use assets reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option, the Company depreciates the right-of-use assets from the commencement dates to the end of the useful lives of the underlying assets.\n\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments. Lease payments comprise fixed payments, variable lease payments which depend on an index or a rate and the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option. The lease payments are discounted using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate s.\n\nSubsequently, lease liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognized over the lease terms. When there is a change in a lease term, a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payments, or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase an underlying asset, the Company remeasures the lease liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use assets. Lease liabilities are presented on a separate line in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nVariable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nOther separately acquired intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is recognized using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: Technology license fees - the estimated life of the technology or the term of the technology transfer contract; software and system design costs - 3 years or contract period; patent and others - the economic life or contract period. The estimated useful life and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.\n\n## Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is not amortized and instead is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the cash generating unit may be  impaired.  For  the  purpose  of  impairment  testing, goodwill is allo cated to each of the Company's cash -generating units or groups of cash-generating units that  are  expected  to  benefit  from  the  synergies  of  the  combination.  If  the  recoverable  amount  of  a cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the difference is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to such cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the cash generating unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the cash generating unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\n\n- 24 -",

        "page_content": "## Tangible assets, right-of-use assets and other intangible assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets (property, plant and equipment), right-of-use assets and other intangible assets to determine whether there is any  indication  that  those  assets  have  suffered  an  impairment  loss.  If  any  such  indication  exists,  the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable  amount  of  the  cash-generating  unit  to  which  the  asset  belongs.  When  a  reasonable  and consistent  basis  of  allocation  can  be  identified,  corporate  assets  are  also  allocated  to  individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset  or  cash-generating  unit  is  reduced  to  its  recoverable  amount.  An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. The performance obligations are satisfied when customers obtain control of the promised goods, which is generally when the goods are delivered to the customers' specified locations.\n\nRevenue from sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. Estimated sales returns  and  other  allowances  is  generally  made  and  adjusted  based  on  historical  experience  and  the consideration of varying contractual terms to recognize refund liabilities, which is classified under accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\n\nIn principle, payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 30 days from the end of the month of when the invoice is issued. Due to the short term nature of the receivables from sale of goods with the immaterial discounted effect, the Company measures them at the original invoice amounts without discounting.\n\n## Employee Benefits\n\n## Short-term employee benefits\n\nLiabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for service rendered by employees.\n\n## Retirement benefits\n\nFor defined contribution retirement benefit plans, payments to the benefit plan are recognized as an expense when the employees have rendered service entitling them to the contribution. For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing benefit is recognized based on actuarial calculations.\n\n- 25 -",

Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nNet defined benefit liability represents the actua l deficit in the Company's defined benefit plan.\n\n## Taxation\n\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.\n\n## Current tax\n\nIncome tax on unappropriated earnings (excluding earnings from foreign consolidated subsidiaries) is expensed in the year the shareholders approved the appropriation of earnings which is the year subsequent to the year the earnings are generated.\n\nAdjustments of prior years' tax liabilities are added to or deducted from the current year's tax provisio n.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits for research and development expenses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered. The deferred tax assets which originally not recognized is also reviewed at the end of each reporting period and recognized to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year in which the liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.\n\n## Current and deferred tax for the year\n\nCurrent  and  deferred  tax  are  recognized  in  profit  or  loss,  except  when  they  relate  to  items  that  are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.\n\n- 26 -",

CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING  JUDGMENTS  AND  KEY  SOURCES  OF  ESTIMATION  AND UNCERTAINTY\n\nThe Company has considered the economic implications of COVID-19 on critical accounting estimates and will continue evaluating the impact on its financial position and financial performance as a result of the pandemic.\n\nIn the application of the aforementioned Company's accounting p olicies, the Company is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.\n\n## Critical Accounting Judgments\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue when the conditions described in Note 4 are satisfied.\n\nCommencement of Depreciation Related to Property, Plant and Equipment Classified as Equipment under Installation and Construction in Progress (EUI/CIP)\n\nAs described in Note 4, commencement of depreciation related to EUI/CIP involves determining when the assets are available for their intended use. The criteria the Company uses to determine whether EUI/CIP are available  for  their  intended  use  involves  subjective  judgments  and  assumptions  about  the  conditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner.\n\n## Judgments on Lease Terms\n\nIn determining a lease term, the Company considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive  to  exercise  or  not  to  exercise  an  option,  including  any  expected  changes  in  facts  and circumstances from the commencement date until the exercise date of the option. Main factors considered include  contractual  terms  and  conditions  covered  by  the optional periods, and the importance of the underlying asset  to  the  lessee's  operations,  etc.  The  lease  term  is  reassessed  if  a  significant  change  in circumstances that are within the control of the Company occurs.\n\n- 27 -",

The amount is deducted from revenue in the same period the related revenue is recorded. The Company periodically reviews the reasonableness of the estimates.\n\n## Valuation of Inventory\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the Company uses estimate to determine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of each reporting period.\n\nThe  Company  estimates  the  net  realizable  value  of  inventory  for  normal  waste,  obsolescence  and unmarketable items at the end of reporting period and then writes down the cost of inventories to net realizable value. The net realizable value of the inventory is determined mainly based on assumptions of future demand within a specific time horizon.\n\n## Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets Other than Goodwill\n\nIn the process of evaluating the potential impairment of tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill, the Company determines the independent cash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue and expenses related to the specific asset groups with the consideration of the nature of semiconductor industry. Any change in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in significant impairment charges or reversal in future years.\n\n## Realization of Deferred Income Tax Assets\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those deferred tax assets can be utilized. Assessment of the realization of the deferred tax assets requires subjective judgment and estimate, including the future revenue growth and profitability, tax holidays, the amount of tax credits can be utilized and feasible tax planning strategies. Any changes in the global economic environment, the industry trends and relevant laws and regulations could result in significant adjustments to the deferred tax assets.\n\n## Determination of Lessees' Incremental Borrowing Rates\n\nIn  determining  a  lessee's  incremental  borrowing  rate  used  in  discounting  lease  payments,  the  Company mainly takes into account the market risk-free rates, the estimated lessee's credit spreads and secured status in a similar economic environment.\n\n## 6.

These accounts receivable are classified as at FVTOCI because they are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.\n\nIn principle, the payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 30 days from the  end  of  the  month  when  the  invoice  is  issued.  Aside  from  recognizing  impairment  loss  for credit-impaired accounts receivable, the Company recognizes loss allowance based on the expected credit loss ratio of customers by different risk levels with consideration of factors of historical loss ratios and customers'  financial  conditions,  competitiveness  and  business  outlook.  For  accounts  receivable  past  due over 90 days without collaterals or guarantees, the Company recognizes loss allowance at full amount.\n\n## Aging analysis of notes and accounts receivable\n\nDecember 31,\n\n|                         | 2021           | 2020           |\n|-------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Not past due            | $  191,740,045 | $  140,933,622 |\n| Past due                |                |                |\n| Past due within 30 days | 6,186,814      | 4,784,425      |\n| Past due 31-60 days     | 6,182          | 8,708          |\n| Past due 61-120 days    | 88             | 48             |\n| Past due over 121 days  | -              | 95             |\n| Less: Loss allowance    | (347,020)      | (246,626)      |\n|                         | $  197,586,109 | $  145,480,272 |\n\nAll of the Company's accounts receivable classi fied as at FVTOCI were not past due.\n\n- 33 -\n\nDecember 31,",

RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS\n\n## a. Defined contribution plans\n\nThe plan under the R.O.C. Labor Pension Act (the  'Act') is deemed a defined contribution plan. Pursuant to the Act, TSMC and VisEra Tech have made monthly contributions equal to 6% of each employee's  monthly  salary  to  employees'  pension  accounts.  Furthermore,  TSMC  North  America, TSMC Arizona, TSMC China, TSMC Nanjing, TSMC Europe, TSMC Canada and TSMC Technology also  make  monthly  contributions  at  certain  percentages  of  the  basic  salary  of  their  employees. Accordingly,  the  Company  recognized  expenses  of  NT$3,711,010  thousand  and  NT$2,809,484 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## b. Defined benefit plans\n\nTSMC has defined benefit plans under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law that provide benefits based on an employee's length of service and average monthly salary for the six-month period prior to retirement. The Company contributes an amount equal to 2% of salaries paid each month to their respective pension funds  (the  Funds),  which  are  administered  by  the  Labor  Pension  Fund  Supervisory  Committee  (the Committee) and deposited in the Committee's name in the Bank of Taiwan. Before the end of each year, the Company assesses the balance in the Funds. If the amount of the balance in the Funds is inadequate to pay retirement benefits for employees who conform to retirement requirements in the next year, the Company is required to fund the difference in one appropriation that should be made before the end of\n\n- 44 -",

Labor Standards Law, the Company is exposed to the following risks:\n\n- 1)  Investment risk: The pension funds are invested in equity and debt securities, bank deposits, etc. The investment is conducted at the discretion of the government's designated authorities or under the mandated management. However, under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law, the rate of return on assets shall not be less than the average interest rate on a two-year time deposit published by the local banks and the government is responsible for any shortfall in the event that the rate of return is less than the required rate of return.\n- 2)  Interest risk: A decrease in the government bond interest rate will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the debt investments of the plan assets.\n- Assuming a hypothetical decrease in interest rate at the end of the reporting period contributed to a decrease of 0.5% (and not below 0.0%) in the discount rate and all other assumptions were held constant,  the  present  value  of  the  defined  benefit  obligation  would  increase  by  NT$780,460 thousand and NT$694,732 thousand as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n- 3)  Salary risk: The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation.\n- Assuming the expected salary rate increases by 0.5% at the end of the reporting period and all other assumptions were held constant, the present value of the defined benefit obligation would increase by  NT$759,527  thousand  and  NT$835,964  thousand  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020, respectively.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.\n\nFurthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability.\n\nThe Company expects to make contributions of NT$2,269,881 thousand to the defined benefit plans in the next year starting from December 31, 2021. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 9 years.\n\n## 21.  EQUITY\n\n## a.

The  capital  surplus  from  share  of  changes  in  equities  of subsidiaries and associates and dividend of a claim extinguished by a prescription may be used to offset a deficit.\n\n## c. Retained earnings and dividend policy\n\nTSMC's Articles of Incorporation provide that, earning s distribution may be made on a quarterly basis after the close of each quarter. Distribution of earnings by way of cash dividends should be approved by TSMC's  Board  of  Directors  and  reported  to  TSMC's  shareholders  in  its  meeting.  When  allocating earnings, TSMC shall first estimate and reserve the taxes to be paid, offset its losses, set aside a legal capital reserve at 10% of the remaining earnings (until the accumulated legal capital reserve equals TSMC's paid -in capital), then set aside a special capital reserve in accordance with relevant laws or regulations or as requested by the authorities in charge. Any balance left over shall be allocated according to relevant laws and the TSMC's Articles of Incorporation.\n\nTSMC's Articles of Incorporation also provide that profits of TSMC may be distributed by way of cash dividend and/or stock dividend. However, distribution of earnings shall be made preferably by way of cash dividend. Distribution of earnings may also be made by way of stock dividend, provided that the ratio for stock dividend shall not exceed 50% of the total distribution.\n\n- 48 -",

Financial risk management objectives\n\nThe Company manages its exposure to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk  and  liquidity  risk  with  the  objective  to  reduce  the  potentially  adverse  effects  the  market uncertainties may have on its financial performance.\n\nThe plans for material treasury activities are reviewed by the Audit Committees and/or Board of Directors in  accordance  with  procedures  required  by  relevant  regulations  or  internal  controls.  During  the implementation of such plans, the Company must comply with certain treasury procedures that provide guiding principles for overall financial risk management and segregation of duties.\n\n- 61 -",

        "page_content": "## c. Market risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to the financial market risks, primarily changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity investment prices. A portion of these risks is hedged.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nSubstantially  all  the  Company's  sales  are  denominated  in  U.S.  dollars  and  over  half  of its capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than NT dollars, primarily in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen and Euros. As a result, any significant fluctuations to its disadvantage in the exchanges rate of NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of U.S. dollar against NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on the revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollars. The Company uses foreign currency derivative contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-NT dollar-denominated assets and liabilities and certain forecasted transactions. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the assets and liabilities.\n\nBased on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company ' s total monetary assets and liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate change of 10% would have decreased its net income by NT$1,435,346 thousand and NT$897,722 thousand, respectively, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risks primarily related to its investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash and cash equivalents and fixed income securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as the interest paid on its debt.\n\nThe  Company's  cash  and  cash  equivalents  as  well  as  fixed  income  investments  in  both  fixed - and floating-rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. The majority of the Com pany's fixed income investments are fixed-rate securities, which are classified as financial assets at FVTOCI, and may have their fair value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates. At the same time, if interest rates fall, cash and cash equivalents as well as floating-rate securities may generate less interest income than expected. The Company has entered and may in the future enter into interest rate futures to partially hedge the interest rate risk on its fixed income investments. However, these hedges can offset only a small portion of the financial impact from movements in interest rates.\n\nBased on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company's fixed income investments at the end of the reporting period, interest rates increase of 100 basis points (1.00%) across all maturities would have decreased the Company's other comprehensive income by NT$3,767,071 thousand and NT$3,143,569 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nAll of the Company's short -term debt is floating-rate, hence a rise in interest rates may result in higher interest  expense  than  expected.  The  majority of  the  Company's  long -term  debt  is  fixed-rate  and measured at amortized cost and as such, changes in interest rates would not affect the future cash flows and the carrying amount.\n\n## Other price risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to equity price risk arising from financial assets at FVTOCI.\n\nAssuming a hypothetical decrease of 10% in prices of the equity investments at the end of the reporting period for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the other comprehensive income would have decreased by NT$595,766 thousand and NT$446,470 thousand, respectively.\n\n- 62 -",

        "page_content": "## d. Credit risk management\n\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the Company. The Company is exposed to credit risks from operating activities, primarily  accounts  receivable,  and  from  investing  activities,  primarily  deposits,  fixed-income investments and other financial instruments with banks. Credit risk is managed separately for business related and financial related exposures. As of the end of the reporting period , the Company's maximum credit risk exposure is equal to the carrying amount of financial assets.\n\n## Business related credit risk\n\nThe Company's accounts receivable a re from its customers worldwide. The majority of the Company's outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collaterals or guarantees. While the Company has procedures to monitor and manage credit risk exposure on accounts receivable, there is no assurance such procedures will effectively eliminate losses resulting from its credit risk. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020 ,  the  Company's  ten  largest  customers accounted for 79% of accounts receivable in both years. The Company considers the concentration of credit risk for the remaining accounts receivable not material.\n\n## Financial credit risk\n\nThe Company mitigates its financial credit risk by selecting counterparties with investment grade credit ratings and by limiting the exposure to any individual counterparty. The Company regularly monitors and reviews the limit applied to counterparties and adjusts the limit according to market conditions and the credit standing of the counterparties.\n\nThe objective of the Company's investment policy is to achieve a return that will allow the Company to preserve principal and support liquidity requirements. The policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company assesses whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk in the invested securities \u0121 since initial recognition by reviewing changes in external credit ratings, financial market conditions and material information of the issuers.\n\nThe Company assesses the 12-month expected credit loss and lifetime expected credit loss based on the probability of default and loss given default provided by external credit rating agencies. The current credit risk assessment policies are as follows:\n\nExpected\n\n| Category   | Description                                                                                                                             | Basis for Recognizing  Expected Credit Loss        | Credit Loss  Ratio   |\n|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Performing | Credit rating is investment grade on  valuation date                                                                                    | 12 months expected credit  loss                    | 0-0.1%               |\n| Doubtful   | Credit rating is non-investment grade  on valuation date                                                                                | Lifetime expected credit  loss-not credit impaired | -                    |\n| In default | Credit rating is CC or below on  valuation date                                                                                         | Lifetime expected credit  loss-credit impaired     | -                    |\n| Write-off  | There is evidence indicating that the  debtor is in severe financial  difficulty and the Company has no  realistic prospect of recovery | Amount is written off                              | -                    |\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the expected credit loss decreased NT$3,293 thousand and increased NT$1,054 thousand, respectively. The changes were mainly due to investment portfolio adjustment.\n\n- 63 -",

Liquidity risk management\n\nThe objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund its business operations over the next 12 months. The Company manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash and cash equivalents, financial assets at FVTOCI-current, financial assets at amortized cost-current and sufficient cost-efficient funding.\n\nThe  table  below  summarizes  the  maturity  profile  of  the  Company's  financial  liabilities  based  on contractual undiscounted payments, including principal and interest.\n\n|                                                                                                              | Less Than    1 Year     | 1-3 Years      | 3-5 Years      | More Than    5 Years   | Total                             |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------|----------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| December 31, 2021                                                                                            |                         |                |                |                        |                                   |\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities                                                                         |                         |                |                |                        |                                   |\n| Short-term loans                                                                                             | $  114,767,034       $  | -

On December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company uses unobservable inputs derived from discount for lack of marketability of 10%. When other inputs remain equal, the fair value will decrease by NT$51,372 thousand and NT39,006 thousand, respectively, if discounts for lack of marketability increase by 1%.\n\nFor the remaining few investments, the market approach is used to arrive at their fair values, for which the recent financing activities of investees, the market transaction prices of the similar companies and market conditions are considered.\n\n- 3)  Fair value of financial instruments that are not measured at fair value\n\nExcept as detailed in the following table, the Company considers that the carrying amounts of financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements that are not measured at fair value approximate their fair values.\n\n- 67 -",

Under a Shareholders Agreement entered into with Philips and EDB Investments Pte Ltd. on March 30, 1999, the parties formed a joint venture company, SSMC, which is an integrated circuit foundry in Singapore.  TSMC's  equity  interest  in  SSMC  was  32%.  Nevertheless,  in  September  2006,  Philips spun-off its semiconductor subsidiary which was renamed as NXP B.V. Further, TSMC and NXP B.V. purchased  all  the  SSMC  shares  owned  by  EDB  Investments  Pte  Ltd.  pro  rata  according  to  the Shareholders Agreement on November 15, 2006. After the purchase, TSMC and NXP B.V. currently own  approximately  39%  and  61%  of  the  SSMC  shares,  respectively.  TSMC  and  NXP  B.V.  are required, in the aggregate, to purchase  at  least  70%  of  SSMC's  capacity,  but  TSMC  alone  is  not required to purchase more than 28% of the capacity. If any party defaults on the commitment and the capacity utilization of SSMC falls below a specific percentage of its capacity, the defaulting party is required  to  compensate  SSMC  for  all  related  unavoidable  costs.  There  was  no  default  from  the aforementioned commitment as of December 31, 2021.\n- c.

Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on when depreciation is recognized.\n\nGiven  the  subjectivity  in  determining  the  date  to  commence  depreciation  of  EUI/CIP,  performing  audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the Company's judgments and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment. Consequently, the validity of commencement of depreciation related to PP&E classified as EUI/CIP is identified as a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit procedures related to the evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP included the following, among others:\n\n- 1. We read the Company's policy and underst ood the criteria used to determine when to commence depreciation.\n- 2. We tested the effectiveness of the controls over the evaluation of when to commence depreciation of EUI/CIP.\n- 3. We sampled the year-end balance of EUI/CIP and performed the following for each selection:\n- a. Evaluated whether the selection did not meet the criteria specified by the Company for commencement of depreciation.\n- b. Observed the assets and evaluated their status.\n- 4.  We sampled and evaluated whether the selection of EUI/CIP met the criteria specified by the Company for commencement of depreciation during the year.\n- 5.  We sampled and evaluated whether the selection of EUI/CIP met the criteria specified by the Company for commencement of depreciation subsequent to year end.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Parent Company Only Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the parent company only financial statements in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of parent company only financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn  preparing  the  parent  company  only  financial  statements,  management  is  responsible  for  assessing  the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose charged with governance (including members of the Audit Committee) are responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Parent Company Only Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the parent company only financial statements as a who le are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these parent company only financial statements.\n\n- 118 -",

We also:\n\n- 1.  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the parent company only financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- 2.  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- 3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- 4. Co nclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast  significant  doubt  on  the  Company's  abi lity to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the parent company only financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- 5.  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the parent company only financial statements, including  the  disclosures,  and  whether  the  parent  company  only  financial  statements  represent  the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- 6.  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Company to express an opinion on the parent company only financial statements. We are  responsible  for  the  direction,  supervision  and  performance  of  the  group  audit.  We  remain  solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the parent company only financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n- 119 -",

The related impact will be disclosed when the Company completes its evaluation.\n\n## 4.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nFor the convenience of readers, the accompanying parent company only financial statements have been translated into English from the original Chinese version prepared and used in the R.O.C. If there is any conflict between the English version and the original Chinese version or any difference in the interpretation of the two versions, the Chinese-language parent company only financial statements shall prevail.\n\n## Statement of Compliance\n\nThe accompanying parent company only financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the Regulations  Governing  the  Preparation  of  Financial  Reports  by  Securities  Issuers  (the  'Accounting Standards Used in Preparation of the Parent Company Only Fina ncial Statements').\n\n## Basis of Preparation\n\nThe accompanying parent company only financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for financial instruments that are measured at fair values, as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.\n\nWhen preparing the parent company only financial statements, the Company account for subsidiaries and associates  by  using  the  equity  method.  In  order  to  agree  with  the  amount  of  net  income,  other comprehensive income and equity attributable to shareholders of the parent in the consolidated financial statements, the differences of the accounting treatment between the parent company only basis and the consolidated basis are adjusted under the heading of investments accounted for using equity method, share of profits of subsidiaries and associates and share of other comprehensive income of subsidiaries and associates in the parent company only financial statements.\n\n## Foreign Currencies\n\nIn preparing the parent company only financial statements, transactions in currencies other than the entity's functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Such exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss in the year in which they arise. Non-monetary items measured at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items are included in profit or loss for the year except\n\n- 128 -",

        "page_content": "for exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognized directly in other comprehensive income, in which case, the exchange differences are also recognized directly in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not retranslated.\n\nFor the purposes of presenting parent company only financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign operations are translated into NT$ using exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.\n\n## Classification of Current and Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities\n\nCurrent assets are assets held for trading purposes and assets expected to be converted to cash, sold or consumed within one year from the end of the reporting period. Current liabilities are obligations incurred for trading purposes and obligations expected to be settled within one year from the end of the reporting period. Assets and liabilities that are not classified as current are noncurrent assets and liabilities, respectively.\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nCash equivalents, for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments, consist of highly liquid time deposits and investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities shall be recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are initially recognized at fair values. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\n## Financial Assets\n\nThe classification of financial assets depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on a trade date or settlement date basis for which financial assets were classified in the same way, respectively. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.\n\n## a. Category of financial assets and measurement\n\nFinancial assets are classified into the following categories: financial assets at FVTPL, investments in debt instruments and equity instruments at FVTOCI, and financial assets at amortized cost.\n\n## 1)  Financial asset at FVTPL\n\nFor certain financial assets which include debt instruments that do not meet the criteria of amortized cost or FVTOCI, it is mandatorily required to measure them at FVTPL. Any gain or loss arising from remeasurement is recognized in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss incorporates any interest earned on the financial asset.\n\n- 129 -",

        "page_content": "## 2)  Investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI\n\nDebt instruments with contractual terms specifying that cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, together with objective of collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, are measured at FVTOCI.\n\nInterest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment gains or losses on investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI are recognized in profit or loss. Other changes in the carrying amount of these debt instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income and will be reclassified to profit or loss when these debt instruments are disposed.\n\n## 3)  Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI\n\nOn initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate investments in equity investments that is not held for trading as at FVTOCI.\n\nInvestments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and  losses  arising  from  changes  in  fair  value  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  and accumulated in other equity.\n\nDividends on these investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are recognized in profit or loss when the C ompany's  right  to  receive  the  dividends  is  established , unless  the  Company's  rights clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.\n\n## 4)  Measured at amortized cost\n\nCash and cash equivalents, debt instrument investments, notes and accounts receivable (including related parties), other receivables and refundable deposits are measured at amortized cost.\n\nDebt instruments with contractual terms specifying that cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, together with objective of holding financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, are measured at amortized cost.\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, financial assets measured at amortized cost are measured at amortized cost, which equals to carrying amount determined by the effective interest method less any impairment loss.\n\n## b. Impairment of financial assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, a loss allowance for expected credit loss is recognized for financial assets at amortized cost (including accounts receivable) and for investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI.\n\nThe loss allowance for accounts receivable is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. For financial assets at amortized cost and investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI, when the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from possible default events of a financial instrument within 12 months after the reporting date. If, on the other hand, there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\n\n- 130 -",

Derecognition of financial assets\n\nThe Company derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset to another entity.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial asset at amortized cost in its entirety, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognized in profit or loss. On derecognition of an investment in a debt instrument at FVTOCI, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized in profit or loss. However, on derecognition of an investment in an equity instrument at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred directly to retained earnings, without recycling through profit or loss.\n\n## Financial Liabilities and Equity Instruments\n\n## Classification as debt or equity\n\nDebt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are subsequently measured either at amortized cost using effective interest method or at FVTPL.\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss when the financial liability is either held for trading or is designated as at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognized in profit or loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities other than those held for trading purposes and designated as at FVTPL are subsequently measured at amortized cost at the end of each reporting period.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nThe  Company  derecognizes  financial  liabilities  when,  and  only  when,  the  Company's  obligations  are discharged, cancelled or they expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration paid and payable is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n- 131 -",

        "page_content": "## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative financial instrument is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.\n\n## Hedge Accounting\n\n## Cash flow hedge\n\nThe Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as forward exchange contracts, to partially hedge its foreign exchange rate risks associated with certain highly probable forecast transactions (capital expenditures). The effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments is recognized in other comprehensive income. When the forecast transactions actually take place, the associated gains or losses that were recognized in other comprehensive income are removed from equity and included in the initial cost of the hedged items. The gains or losses from hedging instruments relating to the ineffective portion are recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nThe Company prospectively discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship ceases to meet the qualifying criteria; for instance, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories are recorded at standard cost and adjusted to approximate weighted-average cost at the end of the reporting period. Net realizable value represents  the  estimated  selling  price  of  inventories  less  all  estimated  costs  of  completion  and  costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## Investments Accounted for Using Equity Method\n\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method include investments in subsidiaries and associates.\n\n## Investment in subsidiaries\n\nA subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by the Company.\n\nUnder the equity method, an investment in a subsidiary is initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Company's share of profit or loss and other co mprehensive income of the subsidiary as well as the distribution received. The Company also recognized its share in the changes in the equity of subsidiaries.\n\nChanges in the Company's ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Company l osing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. Any difference between the carrying amount of the subsidiary and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity.\n\nWhen the Company loses control of a subsidiary, any retained investment of the former subsidiary is measured at the fair value at that date. A gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss and calculated as the difference between (a) the aggregate of the fair value of consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest at the date when control is lost; and (b) the previous carrying amount of the investments in such subsidiary. In addition, the Company shall account for all amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary on the same basis as would be required if the subsidiary had directly disposed of the related assets and liabilities.\n\n- 132 -",

        "page_content": "When the Company transacts with its subsidiaries, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the  subsidiaries  are  recognized  in  the  Company's  parent  company  only  financial  statements  only  to  the extent of interests in the subsidiaries that are not owned by the Company.\n\n## Investment in associates\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\nThe operating results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these parent company only financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized in the statement of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Company's share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate as well as the distribution received. The Company also recognizes its share in the changes in the equities of associates.\n\nAny excess of the cost of acquisition over the Company's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of an associate recognized at the date of acquisition is recognized as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Company's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nWhen necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.\n\nWhen the Company subscribes to additional shares in an associate at a percentage different from its existing ownership percentage, the resulting carrying amount of the investment differs from the amount of the Company's proportionate interest in the net assets o f the associate. The Company records such a difference as an adjustment to investments with the corresponding amount charged or credited to capital surplus. If the Company's ownership interest is reduced due to the additional subscription to the shares of associate by other  investors,  the  proportionate  amount  of  the  gains  or  losses  previously  recognized  in  other comprehensive income in relation to that associate shall be reclassified to profit or loss on the same basis as would be required if the associate had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.\n\nWhen the Company transacts with an associate, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the associate are recognized in the Company's parent company only financial statements only to the extent of interests in the associate that are not owned by the Company.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  measured  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated impairment.  Costs  include  any  incremental  costs  that  are  directly  attributable  to  the  construction, acquisition of the item of property, plant and equipment or borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  in  the  course  of  construction for production, supply or administrative purposes  are  carried  at  cost,  less  any  recognized  impairment  loss.  Such  assets  are  classified  to  the appropriate categories of property, plant and equipment when completed and ready for intended use. Depreciation  of  these  assets,  on  the  same  basis  as  other  identical  categories  of  property,  plant  and equipment, commences when the assets are available for their intended use.\n\n- 133 -",

The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimates accounted for on a prospective basis. Land is not depreciated.\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the assets. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Leases\n\nFor a contract that contains a lease component and non-lease component, the Company may elect to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\n\n## The Company as lessor\n\nRental income from operating lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\n## The Company as lessee\n\nExcept for payments for low-value asset leases and short-term leases (leases of machinery and equipment and others) which are recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis, the Company recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases at the commencement date of the lease.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost. The cost of right-of-use assets comprises the initial measurement of lease liabilities adjusted for lease payments and initial direct costs made at or before the commencement date,  plus  an  estimate  of  costs  needed  to  restore  the  underlying  assets.  Subsequent  measurement  is calculated as cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss and adjusted for changes in lease liabilities as a result of lease term modifications or other related factors. Right-of-use assets are presented separately in the parent company only balance sheets.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement dates to the earlier of the end of the useful lives of the right-of-use assets or the end of the lease terms. If the lease transfers ownership of the underlying assets to the Company by the end of the lease terms or if the cost of right-of-use assets reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option, the Company depreciates the right-of-use assets from the commencement dates to the end of the useful lives of the underlying assets.\n\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments. Lease payments comprise fixed payments, variable lease payments which depend on an index or a rate and the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option. The lease payments are discounted using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate s.\n\nSubsequently, lease liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognized over the lease terms. When there is a change in a lease term, a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payments, or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase an underlying asset, the Company remeasures the lease liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use assets. Lease liabilities are presented on a separate line in the parent company only balance sheets.\n\nVariable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.\n\n- 134 -",

Amortization is recognized using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: Technology license fees - the estimated life of the technology or the term of the technology transfer contract; software and system design costs - 3 years or contract period; patent and others - the economic life or contract period. The estimated useful life and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.\n\n## Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is not amortized and instead is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an  indication  that  the  cash  generating  unit  may  be  impaired.  For  the  purpose  of  impairment  testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company's cash generating units or groups of cash -generating units that are expected to benefit. If the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the  difference  is  allocated  first  to  reduce  the  carrying  amount  of  any  goodwill  allocated  to  such cash-generating unit and then to the other assets of the cash generating unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the cash generating unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\n\n## Tangible assets, right-of-use assets and other intangible assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets (property, plant and equipment), right-of-use assets and other intangible assets to determine whether there is any  indication  that  those  assets  have  suffered  an  impairment  loss.  If  any  such  indication  exists,  the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable  amount  of  the  cash-generating  unit  to  which  the  asset  belongs.  When  a  reasonable  and consistent  basis  of  allocation  can  be  identified,  corporate  assets  are  also  allocated  to  individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset  or  cash-generating  unit  is  reduced  to  its  recoverable  amount.  An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\n- 135 -",

The performance obligations are satisfied when customers obtain control of the promised goods which is generally when the goods are delivered to the customers' specified locations.\n\nRevenue from sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. Estimated sales returns  and  other  allowances  is  generally  made  and  adjusted  based  on  historical  experience  and  the consideration of varying contractual terms to recognize refund liabilities, which is classified under accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\n\nIn principle, payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 30 days from the end of the month of when the invoice is issued. Due to the short term nature of the receivables from sale of goods with the immaterial discounted effect, the Company measures them at the original invoice amounts without discounting.\n\n## Employee Benefits\n\n## Short-term employee benefits\n\nLiabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for service rendered by employees.\n\n## Retirement benefits\n\nFor defined contribution retirement benefit plans, payments to the benefit plan are recognized as an expense when the employees have rendered service entitling them to the contribution. For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing benefit is recognized based on actuarial calculations.\n\nDefined benefit costs (including service cost, net interest and remeasurement) under the defined benefit retirement benefit plans are determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Service cost (including current service cost), and net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) are recognized as employee benefits expense in the period they occur. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nNet defined benefit liability represents the actual deficit in the Company's defined benefit plan.\n\n## Taxation\n\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.\n\n## Current tax\n\nIncome tax on unappropriated earnings is expensed in the year the shareholders approved the appropriation of earnings which is the year subsequent to the year the earnings are generated.\n\nAdjustments of prior years' tax liabilities are added to or deducted from the current year's tax provision.\n\n- 136 -",

Deferred  tax  liabilities  are  generally  recognized  for  all  taxable  temporary  differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits for research and development expenses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered. The deferred tax assets which originally not recognized is also reviewed at the end of each reporting period and recognized to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year in which the liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.\n\n## Current and deferred tax for the year\n\nCurrent  and  deferred  tax  are  recognized  in  profit  or  loss,  except  when  they  relate  to  items  that  are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.\n\n## 5.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING  JUDGMENTS  AND  KEY  SOURCES  OF  ESTIMATION  AND UNCERTAINTY\n\nThe Company has considered the economic implications of COVID-19 on critical accounting estimates and will continue evaluating the impact on its financial position and financial performance as a result of the pandemic.\n\nIn the application of the afor ementioned Company's accounting policies, the Company is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.\n\n## Critical Accounting Judgments\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue when the conditions described in Note 4 are satisfied.\n\n- 137 -",

The criteria the Company uses to determine whether EUI/CIP are available  for  their  intended  use  involves  subjective  judgments  and  assumptions  about  the  conditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner.\n\n## Judgments on Lease Terms\n\nIn determining a lease term, the Company considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive  to  exercise  or  not  to  exercise  an  option,  including  any  expected  changes  in  facts  and circumstances from the commencement date until the exercise date of the option. Main factors considered include  contractual  terms  and  conditions  covered  by  the  optional periods, and the importance of the underlying  asset  to  the  lessee's  operations,  etc.  The  lease  term  is  reassessed  if  a  significant  change  in circumstances that are within the control of the Company occurs.\n\n## Key Sources of Estimation and Uncertainty\n\n## Estimation of Sales Returns and Allowances\n\nSales  returns  and  other  allowance  is  estimated  and  recorded  based  on  historical  experience  and  in consideration of different contractual terms. The amount is deducted from revenue in the same period the related revenue is recorded. The Company periodically reviews the reasonableness of the estimates.\n\n## Valuation of Inventory\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the Company uses estimate to determine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of each reporting period.\n\nThe  Company  estimates  the  net  realizable  value  of  inventory  for  normal  waste,  obsolescence  and unmarketable items at the end of reporting period and then writes down the cost of inventories to net realizable value. The net realizable value of the inventory is determined mainly based on assumptions of future demand within a specific time horizon.\n\n## Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets Other than Goodwill\n\nIn the process of evaluating the potential impairment of tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill, the Company determines the independent cash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue and expenses related to the specific asset groups with the consideration of the nature of semiconductor industry. Any change in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in significant impairment charges or reversal in future years.\n\n## Realization of Deferred Income Tax Assets\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those deferred tax assets can be utilized. Assessment of the realization of the deferred tax assets requires subjective judgment and estimate, including the future revenue growth and profitability, tax holidays, the amount of tax credits can be utilized and feasible tax planning strategies. Any changes in the global economic environment, the industry trends and relevant laws and regulations could result in significant adjustments to the deferred tax assets.\n\n- 138 -",

Pursuant to the Act, the Company has made monthly contributions equal to 6% of each employee's monthly  salary  to  employees'  pension  accounts.

Defined benefit plans\n\nThe Company has defined benefit plans under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law that provide benefits based on an employee's length of service and average monthly salary for the six-month period prior to retirement. The Company contributes an amount equal to 2% of salaries paid each month to their respective pension funds (the Funds), which are administered by the Labor Pension Fund Supervisory Committee (the Committee) and deposited in the Committee's name in the Bank of Taiwan. Before the end of each year, the Company assesses the balance in the Funds. If the amount of the balance in the Funds is inadequate to pay retirement benefits for employees who conform to retirement requirements in the next year, the Company is required to fund the difference in one appropriation that should be made  before  the  end  of  March  of  the  next  year.  The  Funds  are  operated  and  managed  by  the government's designated authorities; as such, t he Company does not have any right to intervene in the investments of the Funds.\n\nAmounts recognized in respect of these defined benefit plans were as follows:\n\nYears Ended December 31\n\n|                                                                             | 2021       | 2020        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|\n| Current service cost                                                        | $  145,289 | $  123,311  |\n| Net interest expense                                                        | 47,196     | 81,604      |\n| Components of defined benefit costs recognized in profit or loss            | 192,485    | 204,915     |\n| Remeasurement on the net defined benefit liability:                         |            |             |\n| Return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net  interest expense) | (73,298)   | (139,212)   |\n| Actuarial loss arising from experience adjustments                          | 94,278     | 494,051     |\n|                                                                             |            | (Continued) |\n\n- 153 -",

As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation.\n- Assuming the expected salary rate increases by 0.5% at the end of the reporting period and all other assumptions were held constant, the present value of the defined benefit obligation would increase by  NT$759,527  thousand  and  NT$835,964  thousand  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020, respectively.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.\n\nFurthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability.\n\nThe Company expects to make contributions of NT$2,269,881 thousand to the defined benefit plans in the next year starting from December 31, 2021.

The capital surplus from share of changes in equities of subsidiaries and associates and dividend of a claim extinguished by a prescription may be used to offset a deficit.\n\n## c. Retained earnings and dividend policy\n\nThe  Company 's  Articles of  Incorporation  provide  that,  earnings  distribution  may  be  made  on  a quarterly basis after the close of each quarter. Distribution of earnings by way of cash dividends should be approved by the Company's Board of Directors and reported to the Company's shareholders in its meeting. When allocating earnings, the Company shall first estimate and reserve the taxes to be paid, offset its losses, set aside a legal capital reserve at 10% of the remaining earnings (until the accumulated legal capital reserve equals the Company's paid -in capital), then set aside a special capital reserve in accordance with relevant laws or regulations or as requested by the authorities in charge. Any balance left over shall be allocated according to relevant laws and the Company 's Articles of Incorporation .\n\nThe Company's Articles of Incorporation also provide that profits of the Company may be distributed by way of cash dividend and/or stock dividend. However, distribution of earnings shall be made preferably by way of cash dividend. Distribution of earnings may also be made by way of stock dividend, provided that the ratio for stock dividend shall not exceed 50% of the total distribution.\n\nThe legal capital reserve may be used to offset a deficit, or be distributed as dividends in cash or stocks for the portion in excess of 25% of the paid-in capital if the Company incurs no loss.\n\nPursuant to existing regulations, the Company is required to set aside additional special capital reserve equivalent to the net debit balance of the  other  components  of  stockholders'  equity,  such  as  the accumulated balance of foreign currency translation reserve, unrealized valuation gain or loss from fair value through other comprehensive income financial assets, gain or loss from changes in fair value of hedging instruments in cash flow hedges, etc. For the subsequent decrease in the deduction amount to stockholders' equity, any special reserve appropriated may be reversed to the extent that the net debit balance reverses.\n\n- 157 -",

        "page_content": "The plans for material treasury activities are reviewed by the Audit Committees and/or Board of Directors in accordance with procedures required by relevant regulations or internal controls. During the implementation of such plans, the Company must comply with certain treasury procedures that provide guiding principles for overall financial risk management and segregation of duties.\n\n## c. Market risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to the financial market risks, primarily changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity investment prices. A portion of these risks is hedged.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nSubstantially  the  Company's sales  is  denominated  in  U.S.  dollars  and  over  half  of  its  capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than NT dollars, primarily in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen and Euros. As a result, any significant fluctuations to its disadvantage in the exchanges rate of NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of U.S. dollar against NT dollars, would have an adverse impact on the revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollar. The Company uses foreign currency derivative contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-NT dollar-denominated assets and liabilities and certain forecasted transactions. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the assets and liabilities.\n\nBased on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company ' s total monetary assets and liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate change of 10% would have decreased its net income by NT$1,196,014 thousand and NT$832,231 thousand, respectively, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risks primarily related to its bank deposits and bank loans. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's bank deposits , as well as the interest paid  on  its  bank  loans.  Because  all  of  the  Company's  bonds  issued  are  fixed -rate and measured at amortized cost, changes in interest rates would not affect the future cash flows and the carrying amount.\n\n## Other price risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to equity price risk arising from financial assets at FVTOCI.\n\nAssuming a hypothetical decrease of 10% in prices of the equity investments at the end of the reporting period for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the other comprehensive income would have decreased by NT$87,841 thousand and NT$73,464 thousand, respectively.\n\n## d. Credit risk management\n\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the Company. The Company is exposed to credit risks from operating activities, primarily  accounts  receivable,  and  from  investing  activities,  primarily  deposits,  fixed-income investments and other financial instruments with banks. Credit risk is managed separately for business related and financial related exposures. As of the end of the reporting period, the Company's maximum credit risk exposure is equal to the carrying amount of financial assets.\n\n- 170 -",

        "page_content": "## Business related credit risk\n\nThe Company's accounts receivable are from its customers worldwide. The majority of the Company's outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collaterals or guarantees. While the Company has procedures to monitor and manage credit risk exposure on accounts receivable, there is no assurance such procedures will effectively eliminate losses resulting from its credit risk. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  the  Company's  ten  largest  customers  accounted  for  67 % of accounts receivable in both years. The Company considers the concentration of credit risk for the remaining accounts receivable not material.\n\n## Financial credit risk\n\nThe Company mitigates its financial credit risk by selecting counterparties with investment-grade credit ratings and by limiting the exposure to any individual counterparty. The Company regularly monitors and reviews the limit applied to counterparties and adjusts the limit according to market conditions and the credit standing of the counterparties.\n\n## e. Liquidity risk management\n\nThe objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund its business operations over the next 12 months. The Company manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash and cash equivalents and sufficient cost-efficient funding.\n\nThe  table  below  summarizes  the  maturity  profile  of  the  Company's  financial  liabilities  based  on contractual undiscounted payments, including principal and interest.\n\n|                                                                                                               | Less Than    1 Year   | 1-3 Years              | 3-5 Years     | More Than  5 Years   | Total                   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------|\n| December 31, 2021                                                                                             |                       |                        |               |                      |                         |\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities                                                                          |                       |                        |               |                      |                         |\n| Short-term loans                                                                                              | $  114,767,034        | $  -                   | $  -          | $  -                 | $  114,767,034          |\n| Accounts payable (including related  parties)                                                                 | 48,892,095            | -                      | -             | -                    | 48,892,095              |\n| Payables to contractors and  equipment suppliers                                                              | 136,212,285           | -                      | -             | -                    | 136,212,285             |\n| Accrued expenses and other current  liabilities                                                               | 105,867,008           | -                      | -             | -                    | 105,867,008             |\n| Bonds payable                                                                                                 | 7,705,092             | 31,050,325             | 87,631,487    | 248,960,671          | 375,347,575             |\n| Lease liabilities (including those  classified under accrued expenses  and other current liabilities)  (Note) | 1,740,990             | 3,129,411  164,991,929 | 2,868,048  -  |                      |                         |\n| Others                                                                                                        | -                     |                        |               | 13,739,223  -        | 21,477,672  164,991,929 |\n|                                                                                                               | 415,184,504           | 199,171,665            | 90,499,535    | 262,699,894          | 967,555,598             |\n| Derivative financial instruments                                                                              |                       |                        |               |                      |                         |\n| Forward exchange contracts                                                                                    |                       |                        |               |                      |                         |\n| Outflows                                                                                                      | 132,106,866           | -                      | -             | -                    | 132,106,866             |\n| Inflows                                                                                                       | (132,001,910 )        | -                      | -  -          | -                    | (132,001,910 )          |\n|                                                                                                               | 104,956               | -                      |               | -                    | 104,956                 |\n|                                                                                                               | $  415,289,460        | $  199,171,665         | $  90,499,535 | $  262,699,894       | $  967,660,554          |\n\n- 171 -\n\n(Continued)",

SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND UNRECOGNIZED COMMITMENTS\n\nSignificant contingent liabilities and unrecognized commitments of the Company as of the end of the reporting period, excluding those disclosed in other notes, were as follows:\n\n- a.  Under a technical cooperation agreement with Industrial Technology Research Institute, the R.O.C. Government or its designee approved by the Company can use up to 35% of the Company's capacity provided the Company's outstanding commitments to its customers are not prejudiced. The term of this agreement is for five years beginning from January 1, 1987 and is automatically renewed for successive periods of five years unless otherwise terminated by either party with one year prior notice. As of December 31, 2021, the R.O.C. Government did not invoke such right.\n- b. Under a Shareholders Agreement entered into with Philips and EDB Investments Pte Ltd. on March 30, 1999, the parties formed a joint venture company, SSMC, which is an integrated circuit foundry in Singapore. The Company's equity interest in SSMC was 32%. Nevertheless, in September 2006, Philips spun-off its semiconductor subsidiary which was renamed as NXP B.V. Further, the Company and NXP B.V. purchased all the SSMC shares owned by EDB Investments Pte Ltd. pro rata according to the Shareholders Agreement on November 15, 2006. After the purchase, the Company and NXP B.V. currently own approximately 39% and 61% of the SSMC shares, respectively. The Company and NXP B.V. are required, in the aggregate, to purchase at least 70% of SSMC's capacity, but the Company alone  is  not  required  to  purchase  more  than  28%  of  the  capacity.  If  any  party  defaults  on  the commitment and the capacity utilization of SSMC falls below a specific percentage of its capacity, the defaulting party is required to compensate SSMC for all related unavoidable costs. There was no default from the aforementioned commitment as of December 31, 2021.\n- c. The Company entered into long-term purchase agreements of materials and supplies and agreements of waste  disposal  with  multiple  suppliers.  The  relative  minimum  fulfillment  quantity  and  price  are specified in the agreements.\n- d.  The Company entered into a long-term purchase agreement of equipment. The relative fulfillment quantity and price are specified in the agreement.\n- e. The Company entered into long-term energy purchase agreements with multiple suppliers. The relative fulfillment period, quantity and price are specified in the agreements.\n- f.
