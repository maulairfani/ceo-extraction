Our focus is therefore on delivery, working in partnership with all stakeholders particularly suppliers and customers.\n\nOur strategy is much more broad-based than climate alone, as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) demand. We are already land net zero, with our crop science ingredients saving more land than is used to grow our bio-based raw materials. We recognise that our strategy will need to adapt in response to the latest science and needs of planet and society. For example, we are investigating our impacts and dependencies on biodiversity and the development of a science-based target for nature.\n\nThis year we have engaged all our stakeholders in reviewing our material impacts. The insight gained has focused our attention and encouraged us to continue our ambitious journey to become Climate, Land and People Positive by 2030.\n\nTS values are a manifestation of this; we encourage our people to be 'responsible' and 'innovative' and to\n\nCroda has a unique culture which combines our heritage with a diverse and global footprint. Our\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwork 'together'.\n\nWe are responsible and 'do what we say we will do'; delivering on our promises is something which is evident in our financial and non-financial performance this year. This year we have reached our target of ensuring all employees earn a Living Wage globally and continue to enjoy largely positive scores in our employee engagement surveys.\n\nAs a leading innovator we encourage the broad range of thinking made possible in a company that values diversity, enhancing the solutions that we deliver for customers and the communities that we serve. We are pleased to have exceeded both the Board gender and ethnic diversity ambitions of the Hampton-Alexander and Parker Reviews for the start of 2022 and we also increased the proportion of leadership positions held by women to 36% this year. At Croda, we share a clear sense of Purpose to use our Smart science to improve lives TM that ensures everyone pulls together to achieve our goals. Read more about our culture and diversity and inclusion on page 36.\n\nTracy Sheedy is Group Human Resources Director\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee Delivering value through our culture P36\n\n## Combining science and sustainability at Alban Muller\n\nThrough our Sederma business we are the leading innovator in the skin care market and the number one supplier of anti-ageing ingredients. We are also a leader in natural extracts sourced from plants, under our Crodarom brand. This year we acquired Alban Muller, a privately owned company that combines science and natural extracts, broadening the natural ingredients offering in our Beauty Actives business.\n\nAlban Muller's natural active and functional ingredients create a significant growth opportunity to meet changing consumer requirements in a skin care market that is growing 9% per year. The acquisition is also a good example of where we expect to continue to allocate capital in consumer markets.\n\nAlban Muller product Cytokalmine TM is a natural concentrate for sensitive skin with proven soothing and antioxidant effects. This new product, launched in 2021, is 100% naturally derived from by-products of pomegranate food production. The production of natural active ingredients using locally sourced by-products is a good example of how Alban Muller delivers beauty ingredients that are more sustainable than alternative products.\n\nChristiano Lubrano, Research & Development Director at Alban Muller, said: 'The integration with Croda presents the perfect opportunity to combine our scientific botanical knowledge with Croda's existing expertise to create new natural ingredients for customers; both more innovative and natural.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These partnerships with leading scientists in universities and SMEs enable us to access specialist, world class expertise and facilities. We now have more than 500 open innovation partners working with us on over 100 active projects at any one time.\n\nOur partners contribute to the high proportion of New and Protected Products (NPP) we sell as well as the continued differentiation of our portfolio. Through our strategy, we are becoming a more knowledge-intensive company, with recent acquisitions contributing to the strong increase in NPP that we have seen this year.\n\nTogether with our partners, we are developing novel ingredients that deliver better results for our customers with a reduced impact on the planet. Each project aims to either improve the sustainability of our products, raw materials and manufacturing processes, or create new ingredients that deliver sustainability benefits in use to our customers and their consumers. Even better if they achieve both.\n\nFor example, we work with partners to help access the latest thinking in biotechnology, drawing on recent advances in the ability to harness the biological world. Biotechnology can help meet growing consumer demand for more sustainable and personalised products, and so has the potential to transform chemical industries.\n\nOne challenge is that innovation often happens in pockets, disconnected from the real-world impact. Croda's cross sector expertise and ability to look across industries provides us with a unique opportunity to connect disruptive innovation in areas such as biotech with tangible business benefits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee Key Performance Indicators for NPP metric P45\n\n## Driving innovation in the crop care market\n\nAgriculture is responsible for approximately 20% of carbon emissions globally, so it is not surprising that the environmental impact of the agricultural industry is becoming a high-profile issue. While the industry has traditionally relied on chemical fertilisers and pesticides, the potential of biologics in crop care is now better understood. The/uni00A0role of predators to control insects in greenhouses is well established but micro-organisms and naturally occurring compounds also have potential as biostimulants and biopesticides.\n\nThrough Croda's acquisition of the Incotec Seed Enhancement business in 2015 and the Plant Impact Biostimulants business in 2018, we are well placed to address some of the challenges in the adoption of biologics. These include the survival of micro-organisms before use, compatibility with application methods and variations in/uni00A0environment.\n\nWe have developed new technology, which when applied to soybean seeds results in stimulation of shoot and root growth, and increased yields. We are now evaluating this biostimulant in different seed application technologies. In collaboration with Royal Holloway University of London, we are also further developing seed enhancement as the optimal method of microbial application. We are also using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to address the big data challenge of optimising biologics for specific environments.\n\nCarola Peters (pictured, right-hand page), a research scientist at our Incotec Seed Enhancement business in the Netherlands, said: 'Over time a larger proportion of seeds will be treated before they are sown and crops will be sprayed less.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee Sector review: Life Sciences P26\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOver time a larger proportion of seeds will be treated before they are sown and crops will be sprayed less.\n\nCarola Peters, Research Scientist, Incotec Seed Enhancement",

In the more favourable environment we have seen this year, we have delivered a record performance, benefitting from significant investment in previous years, notably in sustainability.\n\nThe demands of this rapid recovery combined with the ongoing challenges of managing through COVID-19 created added challenges to our operational teams. To our employees, thank you for stepping up to the challenges and making a significant contribution to our results and delivering for our customers.\n\nWe are reinvesting for growth, particularly disciplined organic investment in new capacity, product innovation and attractive geographic markets such as Asia. We are focused on consumer and life science markets which provide the opportunity to deliver stronger and more profitable growth.\n\nAt an operational level, this means building on our position as a sustainability leader including executing against the decarbonisation road maps we will have in place for all of our major sites by the end of 2022. In addition, the top priority in Life Sciences is to scale our world-leading delivery systems for patient health.

This reflects strong growth in our existing business, significant benefits from recent acquisitions and our Health Care business performing exceptionally well.\n\nThe Croda team has met the demands of a rapid global recovery, combined with ongoing challenges presented by COVID-19. Customer demand and cost inflation have been at levels we have not seen for a decade; at the same time COVID-19 restrictions have remained in place in many countries around the world. This has presented many challenges for our people, carefully managing both employee wellbeing and customer expectations.\n\nAs always, our clarity of Purpose has been our guide, ensuring we deliver for our customers, whilst always looking after our business partners and one another. Our success is made possible by our people, who have risen to the challenges the year has presented. Their hard work, dedication and customer focus have been exceptional, and I want to thank all of our employees for their contribution to a successful year.\n\n## A Purpose-driven company\n\nOur strategy will continue to evolve but our Purpose - Smart science to improve lives TM -will remain constant, guiding the choices we make. Our Purpose is illustrated by the contribution we are making to COVID-19 vaccination programmes around the world, supporting over 150 COVID-19 projects in more than 30 countries. This support has often involved considerable commitment from our people, not least from colleagues on our graduate programme who put personal lives on hold to travel to Alabama and help produce lipid systems that continue to play such a key role in the fight against the pandemic.\n\n## Sustainability as a strategic priority\n\nIn line with our Purpose, we have made a bold Commitment to be the world's most sustainable supplier of innovative ingredients. Our focus is now on execution, working with our suppliers and customers to ensure we are Climate, Land and People Positive by 2030. Only by working in partnership can we achieve our goals, and we recognise that the strength of our relationships with others helps drive our success and our positive impact on the world around us. During 2021, our communities also benefited from our longstanding volunteering programme and educational outreach. In addition we established the Croda Foundation, which is already helping over 50 million people by supporting vaccine infrastructure projects globally, extending the positive impact we are making.\n\nSustainability has been a strategic priority for Croda over more than a decade, influencing how we develop our business and product portfolio and our priorities for investment. Climate change, biodiversity loss and rising inequality are now changing consumer demands, making sustainability as important to consumer choice as performance. This is providing us with opportunities to leverage our leadership position in sustainability, to help our customers meet these changing consumer needs.\n\nBoard members engage regularly with our Sustainability Committee to track progress and were represented at the Executive review of our sustainability strategy in October (see page 65). When reviewing progress, I am particularly struck by the level of our employees' engagement around this topic and the ownership across Croda which will ensure we continue to achieve our goals.\n\n## A culture where we put people first\n\nCroda has always had a unique culture, built on customer intimacy and innovation with an entrepreneurial spirit. Promoting this 'One Croda' culture is important to our long-term success, as it enables us to operate a decentralised model where decisions are taken as close to the customer as possible, ensuring that we are more agile than our competitors, whilst delivering the governance and consistency we expect across Croda. Our values, which we have worked hard to articulate over the last two years, are to be 'responsible', 'innovative' and to work 'together'. We expect managers to put people first, irrespective of whether they are colleagues or partners, and all of our people to look after one another.\n\nIn 2021 we implemented an eight-point plan to support the wellbeing of our employees facing the combined challenges of COVID-19 and a rapid recovery in demand. The wellbeing and engagement of all employees is a cornerstone of our success, and I am delighted that we have been able to adopt the Living Wage in 2021 for all employees. Employee share ownership remains at impressive levels, at over 80% in the UK and 60% internationally. We have augmented this with a new 'Free Share Plan', under which employees who do not participate in other bonus schemes were awarded ten shares in 2021 and will continue to receive free shares when those schemes pay out.",

Our contribution required the rapid ramp-up of lipid production capacity in Alabama and a project to expand production volumes that would typically take two years was completed in a matter of months. While it was Avanti's deep knowledge of lipid drug delivery combined with Croda's expertise in operational scale-up that made the project possible, it was our people who made it happen. Our teams worked around the clock running three shifts a day to produce the required quantities of lipids. The project involved diverting resources from around the business to support lipid production, including employees from Croda sites in the US and UK\n\n## Promoting executive and workforce diversity\n\nAt the beginning of the 2021, we published a Board diversity and inclusion (D&I) policy and communicated our commitment to greater diversity within our business. We believe that the diversity of our people - in terms of ideas, skills, knowledge, experience, ethnicity, gender or any other characteristic - is very important for the continuing long-term success of the Company. We will report annually on the progress we are making. See pages 37 and 61 for further details.\n\nThe Board recognises the importance of developing diversity in senior management roles and oversees the objective of achieving gender balance in all leadership roles by 2030 and the doubling of the number of women in leadership positions. In this year's submission to the Alexander Hampton review, we were pleased to report that 36% of leadership positions were held by women. We will also develop a target aligned to increasing the number of ethnically diverse employees in executive roles by the end of 2022 and in leadership positions by the end of 2024.\n\nCroda has not historically collected companywide information about employee ethnicity. However, we understand the importance of having sufficient data to make good decisions about D&I and how this will enable us to track our progress. This year we conducted our first global diversity survey and are using the results to develop an action plan to drive improvements. The results are reported in the Culture section of this report on page 37, where you can read more about our approach to D&I and the work of our global steering committee. We expect to be able to implement routine monitoring and disclosure of employee ethnicity from 2023 for the UK and globally from 2024.\n\n## Evolved Board composition to reflect our ambition\n\nThis commitment to diversity applies to the makeup of the Board, ensuring it is well equipped to lead the business effectively, embraces new ideas and makes good use of differences in experiences, backgrounds and perspectives to satisfy all the different stakeholders we have as a global organisation.\n\nwho put their lives on hold and travelled to Alabama for five months. Many of these seconded employees were graduates, with a rotation added to our graduate programmes. Our people worked tirelessly, exemplifying the Croda values, to deliver for our customers. The immediate impact of this work is obvious, but beyond this the experience and knowledge gained will aid their development as they progress in their careers.\n\nAshlea Taylor-Hughes, pictured, a Croda research scientist from Cheshire, UK, who postponed her wedding due to the COVID-19 pandemic and spent time on secondment in Alabama, said: 'It was scary to come out here for five months but, just thinking of all the good that it would do, I/uni00A0was completely up for it.'\n\nIn September 2021, Julie Kim was appointed as a Non-Executive Director (NED), bringing 25 years' experience of health care markets across Europe, Asia and Latin America. Julie is President Plasma-Derived Therapies at Takeda Pharmaceutical, a global, R&D driven biopharmaceuticals company. In early 2022, we welcomed Nawal Ouzren, CEO of biopharmaceutical company Sensorion, to the Board as a NED, adding further health care expertise through her first-hand experience of biologics and novel gene therapies.\n\nBoth appointments add relevant experience as we look to access higher growth markets in health care, and in regions beyond Europe and North America, such as Asia. They also bring even greater diversity to the Board in terms of gender, ethnicity, nationality and tenure. Overall, I am pleased to have fulfilled our commitment to meeting the requirements of the Parker Review on ethnic diversity and to achieving full gender balance on the Board.\n\nI am confident that the diversity of thought and experience we have around the boardroom table will ensure we are able to provide effective support and guidance as Croda continues to focus on the fast-growth markets of the future. Despite the challenges presented by COVID-19, as a Board we have been able to continue our programme of engagement with employees across Croda, including virtual visits to Avanti and Iberchem, the businesses that we acquired in 2020. I would like to thank all Board members for their support and hard work throughout 2021.\n\n## Accelerated strategic progress in a transformational year\n\nOur agile approach and resilient business model have allowed us to look beyond the immediate COVID-19 pandemic, with the Board and Executive Committee working together on our strategy driving sustainability and innovation to deliver growth.\n\nIn December 2021, we announced the sale of the majority of our Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals businesses to Cargill, the largest private company in the United States. This divestment, due to complete in Summer 2022, will progress Croda's transition to a pure-play Consumer Care and Life Sciences\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncompany, markets in which we can deliver on our Purpose of using Smart science to improve lives TM . As Steve Foots, our Group Chief Executive, outlines further in his review on page 10, this focus on Consumer Care and Life Sciences will enable us to deliver consistent sales growth and an even stronger profit margin.\n\nWe committed to communicating openly with the employees of our Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals businesses during the strategic review, recognising that it was a period of uncertainty. Cargill is a company with a distinguished history and I am confident that our employees can look forward to a bright future under its ownership.\n\n## Committed to generating value for all stakeholders\n\nThe divestment will allow us to focus our resources on delivering sustainable solutions and scaling our consumer, health and crop care technologies. We have a clear capital allocation policy, with a focus on organic investment, given the exciting growth opportunities we see in the future in these markets. We will also provide regular returns to shareholders, invest in complementary acquisitions and retain our balance sheet strength. The Board is proposing a full year dividend for 2021 of 100 pence per share, representing growth of 10% over 2020, a year in which we were one of the few companies to continue to increase the dividend as we managed the impact of COVID-19.\n\n2021 has been an excellent year for Croda in which we have delivered a record financial performance and strong progress against our non-financial targets. We are becoming a dedicated Consumer Care and Life Sciences company where our leadership in sustainability and innovation will deliver further profitable growth. With our clear Purpose, strong culture and committed workforce, we look forward to the future with confidence.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This has been enabled through the accelerated implementation of our strategic priorities, increased investment in innovation and growth, and a broader global recovery in demand.\n\nOur excellent strategic progress during the COVID-19 pandemic has included progressing our transition to a pure-play Consumer Care and Life Sciences company. Our 2020 acquisitions of Avanti and Iberchem, which created new growth platforms in our target markets, have been followed by our recent agreement to divest the majority of our Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals businesses ('PTIC'). This will release more capital to reinvest in faster growth, higher return markets, positioning us to deliver more consistent sales growth and an even stronger profit margin.\n\nThis strategic progress is consistent with our Purpose of using Smart science to improve lives TM . The importance of our sustainability Commitment, made in 2020, has come to the fore, with consumers everywhere seeking more sustainable products and customers needing Croda to help decarbonise their supply chains. Our part in helping produce COVID-19 vaccines is a proud example of our smart science in action. Our capabilities in sustainability and innovation will drive our future growth. Croda is becoming a more knowledge intensive business, investing more in commercialising R&D, expanding emerging market exposure and increasing the value captured from our products. We are focused on the fast growth markets of the future, making bigger and bolder bets to expand our leadership positions and drive significant value creation.\n\nThe results of this strategic action can be seen in 2021's performance. It was a record year for sales and profit, with every part of the Group performing well. The strength of the 'existing' Croda business was clearly demonstrated, with underlying sales growing by 26% and underlying growth in adjusted operating profit of \u00a3116m over 2020. Consumer Care led the way, with a strong recovery in Personal\n\nCare. Alongside this, we realised significant benefits from recent acquisitions in Consumer Care and Life Sciences, delivering \u00a358m of additional adjusted operating profit within the first year post-acquisition. Our 2020 acquisition of Avanti has helped to establish the lipid systems platform in Health Care, with approximately US$200m of sales in 2021, primarily to our principal vaccine customers. We deployed more capital and resources to scale our consumer, health and crop care technologies. We increased innovation spend by over 50% on 2020 and the proportion of New and Protected Products (NPP) from 27% to 37% of total sales. We increased annual organic capital investment by 31% to almost \u00a3160m; reflecting our successful 'buy and build' approach. This has allowed us to unlock the potential of Avanti and Iberchem, acquiring adjacent technology platforms and then scaling them through organic investment.\n\nTo deliver these record results, our colleagues have risen to the dual challenges of responding to a rapid recovery in customer demand whilst managing ongoing COVID-19 restrictions. Combined with global disruption affecting many industries, supply chain management has been challenging but, thanks to the efforts of our global team, we have managed to supply the increased demand whilst limiting the impact on customer service. I am proud that we have continued to support our stakeholders and keep our colleagues safe, and I would like to thank everyone at Croda for their commitment.\n\n## Record financial results\n\nIn 2021, reported sales grew by 36% to \u00a31,889.6m (2020: \u00a31,390.3m). Underlying sales were up 26% and acquisitions added 17% (both at constant currency), while stronger Sterling saw an adverse impact from currency translation of 7%. Notably, underlying sales were 18% ahead of 2019 (excluding sales of lipid systems introduced since 2019, for better comparability), demonstrating significant growth against pre-pandemic levels. 2021 also saw the most significant period of raw material cost increases in over a decade, up by 17% in the underlying business. With full cost recovery achieved through Croda's powerful operating model, alongside a strengthening product mix, this helped drive underlying sales price/mix 17% higher year-on-year. Despite higher prices, most markets globally saw strong demand recovery, and underlying sales volume rose 9%. Strong demand and the faster growth of higher value-add technology platforms across Life Sciences and Consumer Care resulted in a record profit margin for the Group. Return on sales rose 180 basis points to 24.8% (2020: 23.0%). In Life Sciences, the highest growth was in the patient health care platforms, which increasingly focus on producing high value products. Personal Care returned to good growth within the Consumer Care sector and a recovery in Performance Technologies markets benefitted operating leverage. The combination of sales growth, acquisition and improved margin saw reported profit before tax (on an IFRS basis) increase by 53% to \u00a3411.5m (2020: \u00a3269.5m), while adjusted profit before tax increased by 48% to a record full year result of \u00a3445.2m (2020: \u00a3300.6m) and was 38% higher than 2019. With adjusted earnings per share 43% higher, the Board has proposed a rise of 10% in the full year ordinary dividend, completing a 30-year record of consistently increasing the annual ordinary dividend.\n\nCash generation in 2021 supported an increase in working capital, reflecting the higher costs of raw materials and a tactical increase in inventory to",

Health Care is a key investment focus for us, with over \u00a370m invested to expand our three patient health care platforms, including new capacity for speciality excipients in therapeutic drug delivery, further build out of the lipid systems platform and expansion of the fast growing vaccine adjuvant platform.\n\nWe also committed funding to create a new combined fragrance and Beauty Active facility for Consumer Care, to accelerate sales growth in China, and a new proteins capability in Home Care. In R&D, we invested \u00a35m in expanding innovation centres and in disruptive process technologies. We supplemented this organic investment with the acquisition of adjacent technologies, acquiring two businesses in Consumer Care which are accelerating our transition to natural raw materials. In March, we acquired natural Beauty Actives specialist Alban Muller for \u20ac25m and in June we completed on Parfex for \u20ac45m, strengthening Iberchem's position in fine and natural fragrances.\n\n## Growth across all regions and sectors\n\nAll geographic regions delivered good sales and profit growth. Consumer recovery was strongest in North America, with Asia and Europe also seeing double digit percentage growth in underlying Consumer Care sales. Latin America saw excellent Crop Care sales and all regional markets saw good progress in Performance Technologies. Health Care sales grew across the globe, with Europe and North America benefitting from the lipid systems platform.\n\n## A stronger Consumer Care business\n\n2021 saw the creation of the Consumer Care sector, comprising Croda's leading global position in Personal Care, the recently acquired Iberchem fragrances and flavours (F&F) business and Home Care. Consumer Care delivered an excellent sales performance in 2021, up 45% in reported terms, with underlying sales 18% higher. This was supplemented by 35% growth from acquisitions and partly offset by adverse currency translation of 8%. Adjusted operating profit increased by 29% (and by 26% on an IFRS basis), with return on sales of 24.7% (2020: 27.8%); the latter reduction reflected dilution from the acquisition of Iberchem, with F&F industry margins structurally lower than those of Personal Care. A strengthening product mix overall saw profit margin improve in the second half year.\n\nAfter a steady recovery in the second half of 2020 from the negative impact of COVID-19 on 'going out' sales of actives and cosmetics, Personal Care performance improved markedly in 2021. This was led by a resurgence in consumer demand for our innovative, high value Beauty Actives products. In previous years, Personal Care performance has been held back by softer growth in our heritage Beauty Care formulation ingredients, particularly in North America and Asia. Beauty Care enjoyed a return to growth in 2021, benefitting from customer restocking and innovative sustainability-driven ingredients, including bio-based surfactants from the US plant, which was fully operational from the end of the first quarter. Improved demand continued through the year, resulting in 2021 Personal Care underlying sales 15% above 2019 pre-pandemic levels and a return on sales of 30%. Growth continued in Home Care, reflecting customer interest for sustainable products from our US ECO plant and excellent demand for Croda's innovative fabric care offering.\n\nIn Consumer Care, we are already recognised as the leading innovator in ingredients for the personal care and home care markets. Our acquisition of Iberchem has given us a similar platform in F&F, with innovation at the heart of its business, offering customers on-trend fragrances, particularly for emerging markets. We are delivering the first cross-selling synergies from Croda's global presence, including the launch of Iberchem fragrances into the large Brazil market, leveraging Croda's local operation. With lower vaccination rates, emerging markets have seen softer demand due to COVID-19, which has constrained sales in the short term, but the F&F business still delivered double digit percentage growth in 2021, including the mid-year acquisition of Parfex.\n\n## Rapid expansion in Life Sciences\n\nWith an excellent 2021 performance, Life Sciences now rivals Consumer Care in scale. Sales grew 46% in reported terms in 2021, with underlying sales over 40% higher. This was supplemented by over 13% growth from acquisition in the first year of ownership and was partly offset by adverse currency translation of 8%. Adjusted operating profit increased by 67% (and by 79% on an IFRS basis), with return on sales reaching 36.4% (2020: 31.7%). As noted at the half year, achieving this level of growth and profit improvement in such a short period placed significant demands on the business and, as anticipated, the margin level moderated in the second half of the year, as we invested in additional people and brought new capacity on-stream to future-proof this growth.\n\nLife Sciences is leveraging in-house developed and acquired technologies, building further scale to deliver customers' drug, vaccine and crop science products. It is moving into faster growth, higher value/lower volume niches. In 2021, the strongest growth was seen in the Health Care business, with reported sales up 80% year-on-year. This was driven by our focus on patient health care platforms. Whilst much of this growth was delivered by Avanti and the scale-up of its exciting lipid systems platform by Croda's UK Health Care site, resulting in around US$200m (\u00a3145m) of sales to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, speciality excipients and vaccine adjuvants also grew by over 40%. With\n\ncontinued investment in these platforms, double digit percentage organic sales growth is expected to continue into the medium term.\n\nOur Health Care business has had outstanding early success with its involvement in COVID-19 vaccines, but even more importantly, we have built a foundation for Croda in biopharma drug delivery. Whilst the majority of lipid system sales in 2021 were to our principal COVID-19 vaccine customers, opportunities in other drug and vaccine customer projects continue to develop. Across our three patient health platforms, we secured 130 new customers and 250 new programmes, two thirds of which were for non-COVID applications, including nucleic acid therapeutic drugs and vaccines (such as mRNA). We expect to see an ongoing expansion in the range of applications for lipid systems in vaccines and therapeutic drugs, as this exciting Health Care technology develops through clinical trials to commercial customer product launches in the medium term.\n\nCrop Protection delivered double-digit percentage sales growth, reflecting strong demand across crop science customers, particularly in the second half of the year. This included significant growth in sales to non-tier one customers who now represent more than 50% of revenue. By contrast, Seed Enhancement growth was subdued, with slower sales in Europe and China.\n\n## A new future for Performance Technologies\n\nThe recovery of Performance Technologies strengthened during 2021, with sales growth reflecting a recovery in industrial end markets and sustainability-driven demand across our innovative product applications. Sales grew 18% in reported terms, with underlying sales 24% higher, partly offset by adverse currency translation of 6%. Adjusted operating profit increased by 32% (and by 38% on an IFRS basis), with return on sales improving to 14.7% (2020: 13.1%), as higher sales volume positively impacted operating leverage. Second half margin was notably stronger than the prior year. In December 2021, we agreed to sell the majority of the PTIC businesses to Cargill Inc., for an enterprise value of \u20ac915m (approximately \u00a3778m). The business to be divested accounted for 77% of PTIC's 2021 reported sales and comprises five manufacturing facilities, together with associated laboratory facilities and sales operations. We are currently working on the process to separate the two businesses, with completion expected in summer 2022. The consideration includes the sale of 100% of Croda Sipo in China, a joint venture which Croda currently manages and in which it has a 65% shareholding. If Croda's 100% ownership of Sipo cannot be realised, Sipo will be excluded from the PTIC sale, reducing the consideration by \u20ac140m. The overall divestment is subject to customary regulatory approvals but is not subject to shareholder approval. Under Cargill's ownership, the divested business and its talented workforce can look forward to a bright future.\n\nCroda's retained business within PTIC, which accounted for 23% of 2021 sales, will form a new Industrial Specialties sector. This will play a key role supporting the Consumer Care and Life Sciences sectors. The divestment is a key step in delivering Croda's transition to a pure-play Consumer Care and Life Sciences company.\n\nWe use a number of Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) to assist in presenting information in an easily analysable and comparable form. We use such measures consistently at the half year and full year and reconcile them as appropriate. Adjusted results are stated before exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition, and tax thereon. Constant currency results reflect current year performance for existing business translated at the prior year's average exchange rates and include the impact of acquisitions. Underlying results reflect constant currency values adjusted to exclude the impact of acquisitions and disposals in the first year of ownership. All comparators are full year 2020 unless otherwise stated. Sector results for full year 2020 have been restated to reflect a 2021 change to the Group's reporting structure.",

        "page_content": "## Chief Executive's review (continued)\n\n## Strategy: driving growth through sustainability and innovation\n\nAs a result of the strategic moves that we have made over the last 18 months, including the acquisitions of Avanti and Iberchem, and the agreement to divest the majority of our industrial businesses, Croda is now becoming a pure-play business, focused on life science and consumer markets. These markets have reduced cyclicality, are faster growth, deliver high margins, are capital and carbon light, and leverage innovation, IP and new technologies.\n\nIn focusing on these markets, Croda is combining leadership in sustainability with market-leading innovation to deliver profitable growth. Sustainability trends are developing rapidly in these markets, driven by consumer demand for products which do not harm the planet and meet growing trends for clean, bio-based solutions. In addition, our customers have set their own sustainability goals and need Croda, as part of their supply chains, to deliver products created through sustainable ingredients, ethical sourcing, greater ingredient transparency and lower-carbon manufacturing. Regulatory change is also driving companies to move to net zero and Croda has responded by developing clear manufacturing decarbonisation plans during 2021.\n\nOur innovation ecosystem sees R&D driven by increased organic investment and highly productive external innovation partnerships. We are increasing the proportion of NPP that we sell and formulate into customer products. This dynamic innovation engine enables us to both create new market niches through our novel product offerings and win business in existing markets by providing sustainable alternatives to incumbent petrochemical supply. Through innovation, we deliver our strategic objective of consistent top and bottom line growth, with profit growing ahead of sales, ahead of volume.\n\n## Delivering our sustainability Commitment\n\nCroda was built on a heritage of using science to turn renewable raw materials into innovative ingredients. Today, our Purpose is to use Smart science to improve lives TM . We have made a bold Commitment to be the world's most sustainable supplier of innovative ingredients. This is both the right thing to do and also what our customers and consumers are seeking. Accelerating the transition to sustainable ingredients makes clear commercial, as well as ethical, sense. Our focus is now on\n\nCroda is combining leadership in sustainability with market-leading innovation to deliver profitable growth.'\n\nexecution, working in partnership with our suppliers and customers to achieve our Commitment to be Climate, Land and People Positive by 2030.\n\nOn our journey to becoming Climate Positive, in 2021 we became only the third chemical company globally to have our 1.5\u00b0C target verified by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). This commits us to delivering improvements in line with the objective to limit global temperature rises to no more than 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, the most ambitious SBTi pathway. We are supporting our site decarbonisation roadmaps through investment within our existing capital budget and by considering opportunities to decarbonise with every capital investment decision. The divestment of the majority of PTIC will make Croda less carbon intensive and we will re-baseline our Climate targets to maintain the challenge we have set. PTIC has significant use of bio-based organic raw materials and the divestment will reduce the Group's proportion of bio-based organic raw materials from 69% in 2021 (2020: 67%) to around 52% post-divestment, but we will retain our bio-based target of 75% by 2030.\n\nIn becoming Land Positive, the land saved using our crop care technologies will exceed any increase in the land used to grow our raw materials by at least double. We are also developing Nature Positive targets ready for when the future science-based target for nature is published.\n\nIn our People Positive objective, we focus on using our smart science to improve lives globally, support our communities and improve the experience of the people we employ. 2021 saw the Health Care business contribute to the development of 15 of the 24 vaccines prioritised by the World Health Organisation, including new projects for HIV and Ebola vaccines. To help our communities, in 2021 we established the Croda Foundation, providing \u00a31m of annual funding. In addition, to reflect the progress made in our Health Care business, we made an extra funding award of \u00a32m in 2021, to improve vaccine and health infrastructure. The first projects funded will help deliver vaccinations to over 50 million people by supporting infrastructure and training in India, Brazil and Uganda. Finally, in delivering our employee objectives, we are focused on improving inclusion and diversity, achieving both the Board gender and ethnic diversity targets of the Hampton-Alexander and Parker Reviews by the start of 2022, whilst making good progress in improving diversity and inclusion within the business.\n\nSupporting our Climate, Land and People Positive strategy are our Fundamental objectives. We are committed to being a safe company for our employees and communities. With the inclusion of recent acquisitions into Group metrics, the Total Recordable Injury Rate ('TRIR') rose to 0.73, excluding COVID-19 cases (2020 full year: 0.58). 83 of our 105 locations had no recordable injuries during 2021 and we are working on the remainder to deliver our targeted improvement to 0.3 by 2025, which would place us towards the leading performance in our industry. During the year we also adopted an enhanced approach to process safety aligned with SASB standards for our industry, targeting a 20% reduction in the incident rate by 2025.\n\n## Driving innovation\n\nIn line with repositioning as a more knowledgeintensive company, NPP as a percentage of sales increased from 27% in 2020 to 28% in 2021\n\norganically and 37% including lipid systems and the Iberchem and Avanti acquisitions. This significant step forward will support higher growth, improved product mix and better margins. The divestment of the majority of PTIC will further enhance our knowledge intensity.\n\nOur innovation strategy combines internal R&D with external technology investments and partnerships, augmenting Croda's innovation centres globally with a network of over 500 academic and SME partners, working on more than 100 innovation projects. In 2021, we commenced a multi-million pound project to introduce artificial intelligence and data mining across our global R&D knowledge base and improve collaboration within our innovation ecosystem.\n\nInnovation is focused on sustainability and, in particular, biotechnology, which will enhance the sustainability of our processes, contributing to the achievement of our target for bio-based raw materials whilst developing disruptive technologies. Our Beauty Actives business has augmented its product synthesis with 50 biotech product launches. Our biotech expertise also leverages previous technology acquisitions, such as Enza and Nautilus, and 2021 saw investment in a new centre for biotech process design and optimisation in the UK. With innovation operating expenditure up over 50% in 2021, we are expanding the pipeline of new opportunities.\n\n## Sector strategies to deliver growth and even stronger profit margins\n\nWith the divestment of the majority of PTIC, Croda will be a Purpose-driven company focused on two attractive sectors that will deliver consistent sales growth and even stronger profit margin. Each of the two sectors comprises four businesses, all offering superior sales growth, at least one and a half times GDP. Each can deliver margins above 20% and return on invested capital (ROIC) of at least twice our cost of capital. We will target an expanded organic capital investment programme to access faster growth, supported by selective acquisitions of adjacent technologies.\n\nConsumer Care is already recognised as the leading innovator in ingredients and fragrances for the personal care and home care markets. Our future vision is to be the global leader in sustainable solutions in these premium markets. This will be achieved by delivering sustainable ingredients, supported by performance data and ingredient transparency, and by being the leader in product formulation and application technologies.\n\nConsumer Care is focused on high value niches in the faster growing markets of skin care, hair care, solar protection, fabric and surface care, and fragrances. Our strategy is to Strengthen to Grow Consumer Care, to deliver mid-single digit percentage sales growth at strong margins. This will be delivered by developing more sustainable ingredients; leveraging our capability to deliver formulation solutions; by driving innovation in premium markets, with Croda providing a 'one stop shop' to 'Indie' customers; and by expanding our presence in high growth regions, with increased investment in China, expected to drive 70% of Asian growth between 2021 and 2025.\n\nWithin Consumer Care's four businesses, this strategy is being achieved by:\n\n- \u00b7  Scaling our market leadership in Beauty Actives in peptides, botanicals and biotechnology, expanding our geographic footprint and leveraging selective acquisitions;",

Our established speciality excipient platform provides high purity delivery systems for therapeutic drug applications, such as oncology, and is growing rapidly, providing the excipients of choice for the newest biologic drug innovations. To this we have added two new platforms - vaccine adjuvants in 2018, providing the important accelerator to a range of new global vaccines; and lipid systems in 2020, the preferred solution for the developing science of nucleic acid delivery (e.g. mRNA), which is expected to revolutionise medical delivery in\n\nThis year we have taken a big step towards achieving our ambition of expanding the reach of our smart science to permanently improve more lives by funding the Croda Foundation.\n\nAs part of its charitable remit, the independent Foundation issues grants for critical projects to support livelihoods and communities. Initial projects funded by the Foundation are benefitting people in the US facing food insecurity, supporting vulnerable mothers in Kenya, and unemployed, blind and partially sighted people in South Africa, who are being trained as food tasters to enable them to participate in the local economy.\n\nThe Foundation also distributed grants specifically focused on health infrastructure projects, improving access to vaccines, and tackling vaccine hesitancy in India, Uganda and Brazil. By funding the Croda Foundation, we are making a bigger impact on communities across the world.\n\nRommel Moseley, Executive Director Croda Foundation, said: 'The Foundation has been established on Croda's firm commitment to be People Positive by 2030. Our priority areas approved by our trustees are to improve health and wellbeing, reduce hunger and poverty, and protect and restore forest and ecosystems.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo read more about the Croda Foundation see our 2021 Sustainability Report P33\n\nthe next decade. Our strategy is to identify and acquire new platforms, and grow them organically with rapid, agile investment;\n\n- \u00b7  Continuing to grow in Consumer and Veterinary Health, through oral care, topical application and animal health solutions;\n- \u00b7  Innovating in Crop Protection. We are developing an industry-leading range of low carbon, bio-based and biodegradable delivery systems, alongside systems for next generation biopesticide delivery and crop nutrition, as the world reduces its dependence on chemical solutions; and\n- \u00b7  Creating long-term partnerships in Seed Enhancement. This includes providing seed coatings and pellets that are free from micro-plastics and developing technologies to stimulate plant growth.\n\n## Deploying capital\n\nOur transition to a pure-play Consumer Care and Life Sciences company will allow us to deploy capital into the rich seam of growth opportunities in these markets, whilst maintaining our discipline of careful capital allocation to projects which generate superior returns on capital. This will allow us to continue to scale our consumer, health and crop care technologies and deliver consistent sales growth and an even stronger profit margin. Our priority is organic capital expenditure to take advantage of the significant growth opportunities available in higher returning life science and consumer markets. This will be supplemented by selective acquisition of disruptive technologies in existing and adjacent markets to accelerate strategic delivery.\n\nWe are unlocking the value of \u00a31.2bn of investment in the last two years in acquisitions and capacity expansion. Our preferred approach is to 'buy and build', as exemplified by our investment in Life Sciences since 2015, where we have secured new technology platforms and know-how through modest acquisition spends, such as Incotec seed enhancement, Biosector vaccine adjuvants and Avanti lipid systems, then built scale through organic investment.\n\nIn Life Sciences, drug delivery offers a significant growth opportunity, much of which can now be delivered through organic investment, although we will continue to look for additional delivery technologies to complement our three successful platforms. In addition to over \u00a370m invested in 2021, we have committed a similar amount in\n\nfuture capital expenditure to reinforce our leading position in drug and vaccine systems. This investment programme will include expanding our lipid systems capability in the US and UK.\n\nIn Consumer Care, our investment focuses on expanding sustainable technologies, such as mild surfactants and innovative proteins for clothes care, to meet developing customer demand. We will also invest in increasing geographic coverage,\n\nparticularly in fast growth markets, such as Asia. The sector will also benefit from investment in biotechnology and decarbonisation. This will continue to be supplemented by careful acquisition of adjacent technology bolt-ons, particularly those which can accelerate our transition to greater use of natural raw materials, an important differentiator in consumer markets.\n\n## Outlook\n\nGrowth is expected to continue in 2022 in line with our medium-term expectations. This should be supported by robust consumer demand, inflation cost recovery and the benefit of our recent investments more than offsetting moderation in customer restocking. Lipid systems sales are expected to be at a similar level to 2021. With an increasing proportion of sales coming from higher value add solutions, profit margins in Consumer Care and Life Sciences are expected to remain strong.\n\nThe combination of our differentiated business model, healthy innovation pipeline and current investment programme are expected to underpin performance and continue to generate value for all our stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSteve Foots\n\nGroup Chief Executive\n\nThe Strategic Report was approved by the Board on 28 February 2022 and signed on its behalf by Steve Foots.",

Our range of sunscreens meet a clear need and are an important pillar of our sustainability Commitment to be People Positive by 2030. Our capability is in mineral inorganic sunscreen filters that are the natural choice, certified by regulators, and are coral safe - a key concern with organic sunscreens that currently dominate the market and can be destructive to coral reefs in the oceans.\n\nTo meet the needs of consumers in different regions of the world we are adapting our formulations for different skin types, skin tones and consumer preferences. For example, R&D teams across Asia worked collaboratively to optimise our sunscreen ingredients for consumers in the Asian market. Detailed market evaluation identified demand for a sunscreen offering a high level of protection with a translucent-to-transparent finish and no white smearing.\n\nThe sensory evaluation and data analysis undertaken provided insights that enabled our R&D teams to develop ingredients that have seen high levels of interest from customers across Asian markets.\n\nDr. Jasmine Leong, Technology Development Manager, said: 'Croda has its own group of sensory experts who can characterise cosmetics products with precision and reproducibility. Our expertise within sun care has allowed us to understand the sensory behaviour and consumer expectations, thereby helping the formulators in optimising the product.'\n\n## Consumer Care response\n\n## Life Sciences response\n\n- \u00b7  We have established Consumer Care as a sustainability-driven sector to meet consumer demands for products that are 'green', 'clean' and 'conscious'.\n- \u00b7  We are differentiated by science and sustainability, providing ingredients that are the most effective and the most sustainable.\n- \u00b7  We 'think global' and 'act local'.\n- \u00b7  We are enhancing our people, technical, and manufacturing capabilities in China and other countries in North Asia.\n- \u00b7  We are leveraging Iberchem's network of 3,000 customers, more than 80% of whom are outside Europe and North America.\n- \u00b7  We are the leading innovator for delivery systems in Life Sciences, providing targeted solutions that help customers meet their sustainability challenges.\n- \u00b7  We have added seed enhancement and biostimulants to our crop care capabilities, in recognition that in future, more seeds will be treated before they are sown and fewer chemicals will be applied to growing crops.\n- \u00b7  To improve the health and wellbeing of consumers, we are expanding our technology platforms, enabling the effective delivery of vaccines and next-generation therapeutics.\n- \u00b7  We are growing our Crop Care business in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East, and expanding our reach to smaller customers beyond the major crop science companies.\n- \u00b7  Asia is a priority for our Health Care business with new product registrations in China complemented by strengthened regulatory support to accelerate approvals; Japan, Korea and India are also a focus for investment.\n- \u00b7  Our R&D teams are adopting digital knowledge management, enabling enhanced use of data science and faster innovation.\n- \u00b7  Our operations teams are adopting AI; for example, our Seed Enhancement business has used AI to improve the quality of high-value tomato seeds.\n- \u00b7  Our sales and marketing teams are utilising digital communication tools, such as Live Chat and new websites specifically written for Chinese customers, to connect directly with customers in particular market segments, such as pharmaceutical researchers and independent brands.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sandra Breene, President Regional Delivery:\n\nOur focus in 2021 has been to listen more closely to the voice of our customer; we developed a comprehensive survey which has been rolled out globally to understand the things that are of most importance to our customers and how we are performing against them.\n\nSustainability makes strong commercial sense for our customers. As consumers become more educated about the impact of their behaviour on the wider environment, they are looking to make choices in the products that they buy so that they can make a positive contribution to living more sustainably.\n\nConsumer requirements differ country-bycountry and whilst emerging markets are recovering more slowly from COVID-19, they are increasingly setting new trends. They offer higher growth rates over the medium term, particularly in Asia where China's personal care market is growing 9% a year. We tailor our offering to those differing needs by listening to our customers wherever they are.\n\nAlmost all customers have experienced huge growth in digital sales during the COVID-19 pandemic, accelerating trends we were already seeing in our markets. Digital is a huge disruptor and our digital strategy focuses on R&D and production as well as sales & marketing, helping us bring innovation to market faster and in a more targeted way.",

Grasse has been the centre of the world's perfume industry since the 18 th century. It is blessed with abundant natural fragrance sources, producing two thirds of the natural raw materials used by the French perfume industry.\n\nParfex employs a dedicated team of perfumers working on natural fragrances and has recently launched a new renewable range. We are creating a new R&D facility which will become the creation centre for natural, sustainable, biodegradable and fine fragrances within Croda.\n\nThe new R&D centre will provide more than 2,000 square metres of laboratory and office space. Sustainability and the customer experience were at the heart of the design of the new centre. The centre incorporates a 'green' roof with fragrance vegetation and the space has been designed to enable collaboration with our customers, perfumers and R&D specialists. This investment in natural fragrances for premium personal care and fine perfumery is a potential differentiator in the fragrance markets.\n\nAlexandre Levet, Sales Director at Parfex, said: 'The launch of our new renewable range of fragrances has been well received by customers and the new, cutting-edge R&D facility will spur the creation of new natural fragrances and sustainable products.'\n\n## 2021 progress and ongoing priorities",

We will deliver higher and more consistent growth as the leading sustainable and science-driven solution provider in consumer care markets.\n\nConsumer Care comprises Croda's leading global position in Personal Care, F&F and Home Care. After a challenging period for the top-line in 2019 and a COVID-impacted 2020, the Personal Care business returned to good sales growth in 2021, delivered with a strong margin. This was led by our innovative, high value Beauty Actives business, supported by a resurgence in consumer demand in the heritage Beauty Care division, with total Personal Care underlying sales 15% above 2019's prepandemic level and return on sales of 30%. Alongside Personal Care, the Home Care business saw excellent demand for its innovative fabric care ingredients.

        "page_content": "## Doubling the lifetime of clothes\n\nThe garment industry is responsible for 3% of global carbon emissions. What's more, over half the clothes we wear end up in landfill. Extending fabric life can therefore deliver significant benefits for the planet.\n\nCroda has developed a range of fabric care proteins that replace silicones and double the lifetime of clothes. Our ingredients protect individual fibres helping our customers meet consumer demand for renewable ingredients, sensory benefits and 'care for clothes'.\n\nThese proteins were critical to Unilever's relaunch of their Comfort fabric conditioner. We are backing this technology with \u00a330m of investment and expect sales of tens of millions pounds a year.\n\nMost importantly, our fabric care technology is reducing the impact of this industry on the environment through lower carbon emissions, reduced water use and a significant reduction in clothes disposed in landfill.\n\n## 2021 business performance\n\nAfter recovering in the second half of 2020 from the impacts of the first COVID-19 global lockdown, demand from Personal Care customers strengthened during the first half year, particularly in luxury and premium markets. This was driven by resurgent consumer demand, which continued through the balance of the year. Customers also increased their short-term stockholding. This growth benefitted our Beauty Actives business, the leading innovator in the global skin care market. Beauty Care also saw good growth in its ingredients for sun care, cosmetics and hair care markets, alongside continued demand for 'at home' use products. Innovation is focused on natural ingredients and biotechnology to meet growing consumer demand, with Beauty Actives launching Ameyezing TM , a biodegradable product with its origins in wild ginger that improves the appearance of dark eye circles. Beauty Care and Home Care leveraged sustainability through the bio-based ECO surfactants plant in the US, which enables delivery of sustainable ingredients that deliver identical performance to petrochemical peers.\n\nIberchem and Parfex have proven to be excellent acquisitions. The integration of Iberchem, which has more than 80% of sales in emerging markets, is on track to deliver nearly \u20ac50m of annualised revenue synergies by 2025, principally through leveraging the combined global sales network. Integration has focused on realising these revenue synergies and helping to transition raw materials onto a more sustainable basis. Ten target countries have been identified for revenue synergies, including the United States and countries in Asia, leveraging Croda's sales team presence. In Brazil, a new Iberchem business and R&D laboratory have been established at the Croda site. Iberchem has launched new product lines that are Ecocert-accredited as environmentally friendly and socially conscious, as well as biodegradable. Overall F&F sales grew double digit percentage, despite the impacts of COVID being more pronounced in emerging markets, with their lower vaccination protection rates.\n\nYong Chuan Lew (pictured), Global Business Director for Home Care at Croda, said: 'Croda continues to lead sustainable innovation through our novel protein technology, delivering unique solutions to help our clients to achieve their sustainability goals and meet consumer demands. At the same time we are making a positive contribution to the environment, demonstrating our Purpose of using Smart science to improve lives TM .'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strengthen to grow in Consumer Care\n\nConsumer Care is focused on high value niches in faster growing markets, where sustainability and innovation are key differentiators. NPP as a percentage of sales grew to 44% (2020: 38%). Our strategy is to Strengthen to Grow Consumer Care to deliver mid-single digit percentage growth (before raw material cost recovery) at strong margins. We are achieving this by embracing biotechnology, in addition to chemistry, to develop more sustainable ingredients, by leveraging our world class reputation for formulation expertise to become a full solution provider in premium markets, and by expanding our presence in key technology adjacencies and in high growth regions, particularly Asia.\n\nOrganic investment in Consumer Care is focused on expanding sustainable technologies, such as mild surfactants and innovative proteins for clothes care, to meet accelerating customer demand. The sector is benefitting from investment in biotechnology and decarbonisation, both of which help reduce 'scope 3' carbon emissions in our customers' supply chains. We supplemented organic investment with the acquisition of two businesses which accelerate our transition to more natural raw materials, an important differentiator in consumer markets. In March, we acquired natural actives specialist Alban Muller for \u20ac25m, expanding our portfolio of natural ingredients in our global leading Beauty Actives business. In June, we completed the acquisition of Parfex for \u20ac45m. This acquisition increases Iberchem's sustainable fragrance offerings and reinforces Iberchem's superior growth profile with greater access to fine fragrances.\n\nThe four Consumer Care businesses each have a clear growth strategy. Beauty Actives is the leader in premium skin active markets, developing critical ingredients based on its expertise in peptides, botanicals and biotechnology. We have introduced our\n\nsuccessful French botanical ingredients to China, where consumers have a long-standing preference for plant-based beauty products. We will continue to invest in China, building on excellent sales in 2021, enabled by investment in sales, innovation and leveraging tighter regulation of active ingredient claims.\n\nGrowth in Beauty Care is being driven by sustainability, with technologies such as vegan-friendly hair care ingredients and bio-based surfactants displacing petrochemical alternatives from competitors. We are developing the highly differentiated parts of the portfolio, such as our inorganic UV filters for sun protection. We have invested in additional capacity to deliver sulfate-free surfactants to meet consumer demand for 'clean beauty' products.\n\nIn F&F, we are targeting to continue delivering faster growth from emerging market exposure, supplemented by significant integration synergies and servicing the needs of smaller customers with a one-stop-shop approach, combining Croda's critical ingredients with Iberchem's on-trend fragrances. We will continue to invest in Fragrances, with a new creation centre for fine perfumery and natural fragrances at Parfex in France, by using bio-based solvents in production processes and through an R&D programme to develop next generation fragrances through biotechnology.\n\nWe are unlocking the growth potential of our Home Care business in fabric care and hygiene applications, with technologies that are highly differentiated by their sustainability credentials. The business delivered a 50% increase in sales of ECO surfactants to Home Care customers. We also commissioned additional capacity to deliver Coltide Radiance to a multinational customer for the relaunch of its fabric conditioner brand, together with protein technologies to other customers to extend the life of clothes.",

This has exceeded expectations since its acquisition in August 2020 with its sales more than doubling over its full year 2020 performance. It has grown sales for clinical research delivery systems with its pharmaceutical R&D customer base. In addition, its in-house production of lipid systems components for COVID-19 vaccine applications has been supported by sales from Croda's UK lipid facility, which worked with Avanti in 2020 to support the world's first COVID vaccines. Croda's total lipid systems sales in 2021 were approximately US$200m, primarily to our principal vaccine customers, accompanied by a rapidly building future sales pipeline of other nucleic acid applications.",

Alongside COVID-driven demand for therapeutic drugs and vaccines, this reflected strong demand for speciality excipients in biologic drugs, and for adjuvants for new vaccines and global expansion of existing protection, particularly in the developing world.\n\nWithin Crop Care, Crop Protection delivered robust sales growth as a result of strong demand, inflation recovery and continued diversification of its customer base. Seed Enhancement delivered a good performance in Latin America driven by continued good sales growth for field crops, but demand was constrained for vegetables.\n\n## Expand to grow in Life Sciences\n\nWe have established Life Sciences as a high value solution provider to pharmaceutical and crop customers. Our strategy is to Expand to Grow Life Sciences to deliver high single digit percentage organic sales growth with a return on sales well above 30%. We are deploying more capital into Life Sciences to develop sustainable solutions in our crop care businesses and to build a broad-based drug delivery business of global scale. We are also strengthening innovation, through technology acquisition and organic development.

Patient Health offers the most significant global opportunity for growth, much of which can be delivered through organic investment. We are leveraging our unique purification and synthesis know-how by investing in people resource, R&D and operational scale up to become a leader in biopharma drug delivery across nucleic acids, proteins and vaccine adjuvancy. This builds on our significant progress to date, including meaningful sales of novel technologies, such as non-aluminium vaccine adjuvants and lipids for non-COVID-19 nucleic acid applications.\n\nIn 2021, we invested over \u00a370m to scale up manufacturing capacity for our three patient health care platforms, reinforcing our leading positions in drug and vaccine delivery systems.

In addition,\n\nwe have committed a similar amount in further investment in these platforms. Whilst we are currently serving strong demand for emergency COVID-19 applications, this new capacity will increasingly unlock future opportunities in new mRNA and gene editing applications.\n\nAcross our three patient health technologies, we secured 130 new customers and 250 new programmes, two thirds of which were for non-COVID applications. We started working on 90 new COVID-19 projects, bringing the total to more than 150 in over 30 countries. 160 new non-COVID programmes included delivery of speciality excipients for oncology and immunosuppressant applications, support to the development of HIV and Ebola vaccines prioritised by the World Health Organisation, and the development of lipid systems for new mRNA vaccines such as influenza. We expect to see an ongoing expansion in the range of lipid systems for vaccines and therapeutic drugs, moving to a broader portfolio of customers and applications in the medium term.\n\nIn Consumer and Veterinary Health, we are continuing to grow in oral care, topical application and animal health solutions.\n\nOur Crop Protection business is expanding its leading position in formulation ingredients to provide sustainable delivery systems for our crop customers. It is established as a key innovation partner to the major crop science companies and is increasing sales to mediumsized and smaller customers who now account for more than 50% of revenue. Crop Protection already provides low carbon, bio-based and biodegradable delivery systems, and is developing systems for next generation biopesticides and biostimulants that use microbials and RNA. Similarly, sustainability trends are driving Seed Enhancement, where we have secured our first commercial customers for seed coatings that are free from micro-plastics. It is also developing seed enhancement technologies that stimulate plant growth.\n\n## Supporting WHO priority vaccine development around/uni00A0the world\n\nAs part of our People Positive strategy, we are committed to using our smart science to promote healthy lives. By the end of 2024, we want our technology to be part of 10 phase three clinical trials across at least a quarter of the priority pipeline vaccines listed by the World Health Organisation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are currently working on more than 150 COVID-19 projects in over 30 countries, the majority of which utilise our vaccine adjuvant technologies acquired with Biosector in 2018, as well as our expertise in speciality excipients and lipid systems. We worked with countries around the world to support their vaccination programmes as vaccine development and production globalised. For example, our team in Indonesia worked with authorities to fast-track import of Croda ingredients as well as providing technical support to produce vaccines locally in response to escalating cases.\n\nLaura Ciccardi, Sales Manager in Health Care at Croda, said: 'We are incredibly proud to be supporting the development of sovereign vaccine programmes around the world, helping to improve the supply and accessibility of COVID-19 treatments in both developed and developing nations.'\n\nLooking beyond COVID-19 we are investing in next generation adjuvant technologies to become more involved with the fight against 24 other WHO-listed diseases such as malaria, HIV and tuberculosis. We are also increasing the collaboration across our patient health portfolio, recognising the benefits of Avanti and Biosector working together.",

The business to be divested accounted for 77% of PTIC's 2021 reported sales and comprises five manufacturing facilities, together with associated laboratory facilities and sales operations. We are currently working on the process to separate the two businesses with completion expected in summer 2022. The consideration includes the sale of 100% of Croda Sipo in China, a joint venture which Croda currently manages and in which it has a 65% shareholding. If Croda's 100% ownership of Sipo cannot be realised, Sipo will be excluded from the PTIC sale, reducing the consideration by \u20ac140m. The overall disposal is subject to customary regulatory approvals but is not subject to shareholder approval. Under Cargill's ownership, the divested business and its talented workforce can look forward to a bright future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Creation of Industrial Specialities\n\nWith completion of the divestment expected in summer 2022, this transaction had no impact on the Group's reported results for 2021, except for costs incurred reported as an exceptional item. In these 2021 results, PTIC revenue totalled \u00a3554m (2020: \u00a3470m) and adjusted operating profit was \u00a372m (2020: \u00a349m).\n\nTaking account of the value to be retained by Croda under a future supply agreement for products to be manufactured at Croda sites and supplied to the acquirer, together with dis-synergy costs remaining with Croda which were previously allocated to the divested business, the estimated impact of the divestment on Croda's reported 2021 results, had it occurred at the start of 2021, would have been to reduce revenue by \u00a3361m (2020: \u00a3298m) and adjusted operating profit by \u00a359m (2020: \u00a336m).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith the agreement to divest the majority of PTIC reached in December 2021, the 23% of PTIC sales which will be retained within Croda will become the new Industrial Specialties sector. It will play a key role supporting Consumer Care and Life Sciences. It will support global site utilisation and profitability as part of Croda's integrated model in those areas of the business which are deeply embedded in Croda's regional operations, technologies and IP. Post-closing of the majority PTIC divestment, Industrial Specialties will also generate revenue and profit from a new long-term supply agreement, whereby Croda will supply certain products from its retained manufacturing sites to the acquirer.\n\nPost-closing, the Industrial Specialties sector will focus on supplying ingredients for its existing markets including coatings, emulsion technologies, water treatment and in fibres and fabrics. It will also leverage Croda's retained technology capabilities in markets such as display technologies and electronics, and a smart formulation capability in low-emission coatings. It will continue to manage tolling agreements and co-stream product sales from our sites which arise from Consumer Care and Life Sciences production processes.",

We will create, make and sell solutions to tackle some of the biggest challenges the world is facing. By 2030 we will be Climate, Land and People Positive.\n\n## Our Commitment\n\nIn 2020 we launched our Commitment to be Climate, Land and People Positive by 2030, externally benchmarking our targets with the support of the Cambridge Institute of Sustainability Leadership to ensure our ambitions align with expectations of a sustainability leader in our industry. Ours is a restorative strategy, designed to ensure that planet and society are better as a result of our activities, and that we are not just 'doing less bad'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe also have important KPIs outside of these three categories, which we believe are crucial to the success of our business. We have collectively called these our Fundamentals. We consider these targets to represent the required social licence to operate in 2030 for a multinational company such as Croda.\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), organised by the United Nations, underpin our Commitment. We have identified 23 SDG targets out of the 169, across nine goals, that are drivers of our strategy - those where we must reduce our negative impact and those where we can make the biggest positive contribution. These were then grouped around the themes of climate, nature and society, hence our Commitment to be Climate, Land and People Positive.\n\n## 2021 materiality assessment\n\nWe conducted a full materiality assessment during 2021, concluding the fourth materiality assessment triennial cycle that started in 2012. This was our most comprehensive to date, with more data sources, direct contact with stakeholders and detailed analysis than ever before. Given the accelerating nature of the global sustainability agenda it was vital to 'take the temperature' of stakeholder expectations in 2021. A full report on the materiality assessment can be found in the accompanying Sustainability Report 2021 (page 14); the outcome of the assessment reconfirmed we are focusing on the right topics for most stakeholders, while we saw nature/biodiversity and global health preparedness increasing in importance since our last assessment in 2018.\n\nAs we deliver on our Commitment to be Climate, Land and People Positive by 2030 we anticipate satisfying an increasing number of our stakeholders' sustainability demands. In doing so we anticipate generating significant value for our customers' brands as they meet the needs of consumers, who in return will reward suppliers, like Croda, who help them achieve their own ambitious sustainability targets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee our 2021 Sustainability Report for more detail P14-15\n\n<!-- image -->",

This was primarily due to the accuracy of estimations and emission factors for our 'Capital goods' scope 3 category. Purchased goods is our largest category, accounting for 83% of our upstream scope 3 emissions, with the majority of this being raw materials.\n\nLife cycle assessment studies for key raw materials have developed our knowledge of emissions within our supply chains and we are now able to represent the reduction in carbon footprint associated with purchasing palm certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Around 40% of our scope 3 emissions associated with raw materials are covered by supply chain specific studies such as this. We also have volume-based, industry-recognised life-cycle assessment (LCA) figures attached to a further 35% of our raw material greenhouse gas emissions, leaving only 25% based on spend calculations. As our customers look to their suppliers to help them achieve their sustainability targets, understanding our scope 3 emissions and being able to identify opportunities to reduce our own emissions supports our customers as they seek more sustainable ingredients.\n\nOur 2021 scope 3 emissions are 14.8% higher than our baseline year of 2018. This is largely due to greater investment and increased emissions associated with raw material purchases, due to increased production volumes. Business travel reduced by 75% due to the pandemic. This increased granularity allows us to identify carbon hotspots in our supply chain, and work with suppliers to drive emissions reductions.\n\nOur scope 3 emissions are calculated using methodologies consistent with the WRI's Greenhouse Gas Protocol: Corporate Value Chain (scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard as well as the WRI's GHG Protocol\n\nTechnical Guidance for Calculating scope 3 emissions. We use a hybrid approach to calculate our scope 3 emissions, using the following methods:\n\nProcess-based method - using actual consumption data on a given activity and the associated carbon conversion factor to calculate the emissions. Emissions factors have been sourced from:\n\n- \u00b7  Croda's Life Cycle (LCA) Analysis tools for raw materials\n- \u00b7  A Life Cycle Analysis database (Ecoinvent)\n- \u00b7  Life Cycle Analysis studies published by other reputable sources\n- \u00b7  Published conversion factor sets for reporting on organisational GHGs (DEFRA/IEA)\n\n## Extended Environmental Input-Output\n\n(EEIO) model method - using spend data, emissions are calculated using EEIO models to quantify the emissions associated with a sector of the economy in a given geography\n\nTo calculate our applicable scope 3 emissions, extensive EEIO modelling was carried out. This method combines macro-economic data and industry-level carbon emissions data to estimate the carbon associated with financial activity in a\n\n## 2021 scope 3 emissions by category 2021 scope 3 emissions by category 2021 scope 3 emissions by category\n\ngiven sector and geography. This approach provides us with the tools to carry out a complete assessment as well as identify carbon hotspots across the value chain, ensuring we focus our attention where it matters most. Where actual consumption data is available the process-based method is applied, as this is a more accurate estimation of our scope 3 emissions. The process-based method includes LCAs from a range of sources, and published conversion factors as described above.\n\n## Driving operational decarbonisation\n\nAn internal shadow carbon price of \u00a350 per metric tonne CO2e was applied to all major capital investment proposals during 2021.\n\nHowever, we realise that initiatives aimed at reducing emissions at manufacturing sites alone will not be enough to achieve our 1.5\u00b0C science-based target. We are also developing low carbon alternatives to existing ingredients. To support this, we have developed a methodology to calculate scope 1 and 2 emissions at a product level. By including the sales of all products, we can now track our scope 1 and 2 carbon footprint at the sector level, driving ownership and focusing our management teams on creating the alternative low carbon solutions our customers require.\n\nFor the first time in 2021, major sectors presented their carbon budget to the Executive Committee alongside their financial budget. They presented their forecasted carbon emissions for 2022, as well as actions to ensure emissions remain within budget and are aligned to achieving our Science-Based Target (SBT). In 2022 we will add scope 3 emissions associated with raw materials into these calculations, further improving sector visibility of their carbon footprint.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To enable us to identify areas where we can have the maximum impact on land use, we need to know our current land impact. In 2021 we collaborated with one of our major agriculture customers to validate the assumptions used to calculate our land saving data for our adjuvant technologies, demonstrating that our assumptions are justified and, in fact, conservative.\n\n2021 also saw us make significant steps towards how we will achieve our crop science innovation target, opening our Product Validation Centre located in Holambra near S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. This state-of-the-art facility includes laboratories and greenhouses and is focused on validating and substantiating claims and results from our formulation, microbiology and seed treatment laboratories. Managed by a specialist team that includes agronomists, chemists and biologists from Crop Protection and our Seed Enhancement business, Incotec, the centre has the highest level of technical expertise, generating realistic and robust data for customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## People Positive\n\nCollaboration to develop alternative vaccine adjuvants\n\nIn 2021 we established a strategic collaboration with the Danish Government's life science research institute, Statens Serum Institute (SSI). This will enable accelerated trials of alternatives to traditional aluminium-based adjuvants, providing new opportunities for the development of vaccines for diseases where effective vaccines do not currently exist, as well as more effective vaccines for a range of diseases.\n\nThe collaboration encompasses manufacturing and commercialisation of two novel adjuvants, both of which are in clinical development. Studies show that both adjuvants induce strong immune responses, with one inducing both antibody and T-cell response and the other, which is already in use within cancer immunotherapy trials, facilitating production of CD8+ T cells.\n\nThis agreement, along with the significant investment at manufacturing sites in the USA and UK made in 2021, will increase our capability and capacity to support World Health Organisation (WHO) pipeline vaccine development in the future. This takes us one step closer to achieving our ambition of supporting the successful development and commercialisation of at least 25% of WHO listed priority pipeline vaccines. See page 27 for more on our investments in Health Care.\n\nThis specialist team, now all under one roof, enhances our ability to develop innovative new solutions and explore the use of digitalisation and new technologies to create more sustainable ingredients.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For example the carbon, water and land footprints embedded in our raw materials are typically many times larger than the footprint associated with our own activities.\n\nWe are starting work with partners in our supply chains to identify programmes that will do more than reduce negative footprints and will restore and improve communities and ecosystems.\n\nBy innovating thoughtfully, sourcing sustainably, minimising the footprint of our own operations and leveraging our excellent decentralised customer intimacy, we will play our part in helping our customers and their markets deliver on the SDG targets.\n\n## Aligning the whole organisation to deliver on our Commitment\n\nThrough our decentralised approach to decision-making and can-do attitude, we can mobilise the whole of Croda in our sustainability journey, enabling us to respond to local variations in requirements from stakeholders and adjust our approach as the sustainability agenda evolves.\n\nOur Purpose and our Commitment are also proving to be vital recruitment and motivational tools for existing and future employees, enabling us to engage with the best possible candidates and support further development of our staff.\n\nWe are taking several approaches to support this and ensure we align all our activities. We have included Climate, Land and People Positive factors in our long-term incentive scheme for the most senior leaders; we have created regional Sustainability Champions Networks to engage those passionate individuals around the organisation who can contribute to local execution and share best practice; and by the end of 2022 we will have doubled the resources across the organisation focused on sustainability, beyond the central Group Sustainability team.\n\n## At the heart of our approach to meeting our Commitment is innovation, which has been the lifeblood of our success for many decades.\n\n## Innovating the right solutions for the planet and society in the right way\n\nAt the heart of our approach to meeting our Commitment is innovation, which has been the lifeblood of our success for many decades. Our business model has relied on creating new market niches with novel product offerings to drive growth. This approach remains relevant today, in the UN Decade of Action on the SDGs, with our innovation priorities focused on helping our customers and end markets deliver on the SDG targets, with 88% of new products directly contributing to our priority SDGs.\n\nOur innovation model is a decentralised one, with our R&D advances increasingly driven by our partnerships, often managed locally by one of our innovation centres around the world, close to customers and partners. This ensures we can respond to local variations in approach to contributing to the SDGs, and access novel processes, raw materials and expertise through our partners.\n\n## Assessing the risks and opportunities\n\nRisks and opportunities associated with delivering the various aspects of the sustainability agenda are captured using our global integrated risk management framework (page 50). In general, we identify more sustainability related opportunities than risks to the Croda business model.\n\nIn 2021 we adopted TCFD guidance to report our climate related risks and opportunities (pages 40 to 43).\n\nOur Commitment\n\n23 SDG targets\n\nunderpin our strategy",

We believe that embedding our values throughout the organisation will enable us to attract and retain the best talent, unlock our\n\npeople's full potential and deliver high performance and engagement within our teams. During 2021, a new set of 14 competencies aligned with our values of 'Responsible', 'Innovative' and 'Together', were introduced. Each competency describes how the values are exhibited and can be developed through specific behaviours within our work. A cross section of Croda employees from across the\n\nglobe assisted in the shaping of the competencies and will continue to be involved in the implementation and ongoing review. This has been a positive and exciting step forward in our journey as for the first time we have a description of the attitudes, skills and behaviours valued within Croda, that are shaped by our values and underpinned by our culture.\n\n## Values\n\nEmbedding new competencies, that support our values, has been a priority within our learning and development teams and an integral part of our leadership development. This year, we have introduced a number of new programmes and activities which are aligned directly with our new competencies.\n\n## Responsible - Authentic leadership training\n\nAuthenticity is part of our new competency framework and encourages self-awareness and working in a way that is aligned with inner values. We invited a number of our teams across the organisation to take part in an Authentic Leadership Development programme. The programme explains the importance of understanding purpose, acting with integrity and building relationships which are founded on trust. It uses psychometric evaluation and is facilitated by external consultants.\n\n## Responsible\n\n## Innovative\n\n## Together\n\n- \u00b7  Authenticity\n- \u00b7  Cross cultural sensitivity\n- \u00b7  Inclusivity\n- \u00b7  Living the values\n- \u00b7  Curiosity\n- \u00b7  Strategic perspective\n- \u00b7  Adaptability\n- \u00b7  Delivery\n\n## Foundation competencies\n\n- \u00b7  Self-led learning\n- \u00b7  Technical/functional expertise\n\n## Talent development\n\nOur learning and development programmes have been reviewed with the aim of modernising and aligning to our values and competencies. We have begun redesigning our internal offering with a plan to launch these programmes during 2022.\n\nA number of leadership behaviours aligned to our values were identified which will form part of selection and nomination to leadership development opportunities going forward.\n\n## How we manage and measure culture\n\nOur approach to monitoring culture is through direct engagement with our people:\n\n| Area                | Reason to use                                                                                                                             | Example of use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Pulse  surveys      | Used to give the perspective of our  people, helping leadership teams to  understand employee sentiment on  areas of interest or concern. | In 2021, we deployed a survey concerning the strategic review of the PTIC businesses. We asked a  series of questions, including a specific question related to our values; 'I believe Croda is committed  to carrying out the review process in line with our values, keeping everyone informed of progress'.  74% of responses agreed or strongly agreed, with 22% giving a neutral response.   |\n| Listening  groups   | A feedback channel used globally  and regionally to enable employees  to share their positive and negative  experiences on given topics.  | We regularly hold listening groups or offer feedback sessions, such as town hall meetings. In 2021,  members of the Board including the Chair, Anita Frew, hosted several sessions with participants from  all around Croda to discuss strategic priorities, pressures and to get input and ideas.                                                                                                |\n| Purposeful  outputs | Rewarding and sharing examples  of where employees have truly  lived our values.                                                          | The first annual 'Purpose in Action Awards' was held in summer 2021, with over 150 award entries  from all our regions. The awards were established to recognise teams and individuals that had  delivered actions that contribute towards either our Commitment or our values. Each entry  demonstrates how we are truly living our Purpose and that Croda's culture is actively driving change. |\n\n- \u00b7  Working together\n- \u00b7  Empathy\n- \u00b7  Care and compassion\n- \u00b7  Managing conflict\n\n## Innovative - Phoenix Rising\n\nWe introduced a new concept programme to our leadership development with a difference, called Phoenix Rising. It is routed in inclusive behaviours and attendees come from multiple levels and functions across the organisation, to connect through experiences and discussions. It is an opportunity to coach, mentor and reverse mentor each other, through different perspectives. This programme facilitates the integration of our Purpose, values and behaviours of our people through leadership and the programme is facilitated by external consultants.\n\n## Competencies\n\n## Together - Leading with empathy\n\nTo develop our understanding of the role empathy plays, particularly in uncertain times, our Executive Committee and senior leaders attended webinars on the importance of leading with empathy. The webinars used neuroscience to explain the important role empathy has in creating inclusive, innovative and psychologically safe working environments. We have opened up our new development planning tool to all employees, at all levels. To make development planning easy and accessible, we have included new competency-based playlists.",

        "page_content": "## Driving innovation through D&I\n\nAll of our new competencies encompass inclusive behaviours with one dedicated to inclusivity. We believe that every employee should feel able to come to work, give their best and feel valued for the work they do. To drive progress we created a D&I Roadmap. The roadmap has a number of areas including data gathering, improving awareness, developing our brand, measurement and setting of KPIs, and alignment to reward and recognition. Data gathering was focused on understanding\n\nrepresentation within Croda and how our organisation feels.\n\nThis was done through pulse surveys, reviewing employee data and benchmarking against external sources. Raising awareness, particularly at senior levels, focused on deepening knowledge about the experiences of different groups of people; the programme included external speakers, internal podcasts with our employees, and delivering unconscious bias training. A strategic objective achieved in 2021 was the delivery of a Global Diversity Representation Survey*. Carried out across all\n\nregions where data collection was legally allowed, it is a first for Croda and is an important step in understanding the broad representation in our organisation.\n\nThe survey consisted of brief questions asking employees to volunteer information about their race / ethnicity, sexuality, gender identity, and disability. Due to legal restrictions on collection of data, not all locations were able to participate including sites in the Netherlands, Finland and Denmark. 70% of eligible employees responded to the survey, including 97% of senior leaders. A summary of the results can be found below.\n\n## Global Diversity Representation Survey results*\n\n|                                                                                                                                           | Group average             | Senior leader average     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Identify as female                                                                                                                        | 41% of responses          | 39% of responses          |\n| Identify as male                                                                                                                          | 53% of responses          | 60% of responses          |\n| Identify as intersex, transgender, non-binary or other gender identity                                                                    | Less than 1% of responses | Less than 1% of responses |\n| Identify as a minority race or ethnic group in the country they are located,  based on local social, government or cultural understanding | 12.8% of responses        | 9.8% of responses         |\n| Identify as a person with a disability                                                                                                    | 3.5% of responses         | 1.8% of responses         |\n| Identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer or a sexuality other than heterosexual                                                          | 3.8% of responses         | 1.8% of responses         |\n\nWe have published this data internally and will continue with further surveys periodically to help us track our progress. As the survey closed in late 2021, we are currently reviewing next steps and appropriate actions. In addition, and linked to reward and recognition for 2022, we have a specific gender balance target in our long-term incentive Performance Share Plan. We will continue to promote and appoint on\n\nmerit, but we will work to ensure that we have balanced shortlists and create an environment where female employees can flourish, and believe this incentive will help us to achieve this. As part of our approach to understanding local inclusion and diversity needs, our regional teams have set up new D&I sub-committees to complement the Global D&I Committee. These teams are focused on driving awareness and\n\n## Key people metrics\n\nAverage headcount for 2021:\n\n## 6,037\n\n| Permanent employees   | 96.6%           |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|\n| Temporary employees   | 3.4%            |\n| Full time employees   | 94.9%           |\n| Part time employees   | 5.1%            |\n| Age category          | % of  workforce |\n| 17-25                 | 6.3%            |\n| 26-35                 | 29.6%           |\n| 36-45                 | 28.2%           |\n| 46-55                 | 23.2%           |\n| 56-65                 | 12.2%           |\n| 65+                   | 0.5%            |\n\n## All employees are paid a Living Wage.\n\n## Year end gender breakdown of our workforce^\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employee turnover by quarter, 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * As at 28 February 2022.

In Q2 and Q3 this year we experienced higher turnover rates, in line with many other organisations around the world.

We continue to monitor turnover and conduct exit interviews with leavers, the results of which are shared widely in the organisation to inform our people policies and practice.\n\nshaping decisions at a local level.

In 2021 we have utilised the SASB process safety indicators as the basis for measuring and reporting our Process Safety progress, one of our Fundamental KPIs (see Sustainability Report, page 37). We are also\n\nconducting an analysis of our public disclosures and internal data capture versus the entire SASB framework and have started work to close the gaps.\n\nWhile we anticipate further alignment with SASB in 2022, we are also monitoring the transformational development in global sustainability standard setting. In June 2021 SASB and the International Integrated Reporting Council (iiRC) announced they would merge to form the Value Reporting Foundation (VRF) and, at COP26 in November, the IFRS Foundation announced the launch of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) to run alongside the International\n\nAccounting Standards Board (IASB). ISSB has already reached agreement with VRF and other sustainability reporting standard setters to pool resources and expertise to develop unified global sustainability standards for reporting and disclosure. We will work with our stakeholders and the standards boards to identify how we will maintain disclosure compliance.\n\nWe support the aims of the Task Force on Climate-related Disclosure and are adopting their reporting recommendations to aid both our understanding of climate change on our business, and of our business on climate change (see pages 40 to 43).\n\n## Non-financial information

        "page_content": "## Tackling the climate emergency\n\nThe urgent need for society to tackle the climate emergency was highlighted during 2021. The United Nations Conference on Climate Change (COP26) showed that governments and businesses must both play their part in moving from ambition to action if we are to limit global temperature rises to no more than 1.5\u00baC above pre-industrial levels and prevent the most catastrophic effects of climate change.\n\nAs a signatory to the UN Global Compact Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C and member of the Race to Zero campaign, we are demonstrating leadership on climate action in an industry that is recognised as hard to decarbonise. In July 2021, this leadership continued as we became only the third major chemical company globally to have a 1.5\u00b0C Science-Based Target validated and declare our ambition to be net zero* by 2050.\n\nEmissions target: By the end of 2029 we will have reduced our operational (scope 1 and 2) emissions by 46.2% from a 2018 baseline. With the majority of our emissions within our supply chain, we also had our scope 3 target approved by the SBTi, to reduce our absolute upstream scope 3 emissions by 13.5% over the same time frame. The focus here is to engage and work with suppliers to reduce emissions associated with sourcing raw materials (see page 32) alongside transportation and distribution of products to our customers. By taking actions to achieve these targets within our operations and supply chain we can support our customers and enable them to meet their own supply chain SBT emission reduction targets.\n\nSustainable innovation target: In addition, we also have a sustainable innovation target to\n\nachieve 75% of our organic raw materials by weight to be bio-based. These absorb carbon as they grow, and using them allows us to minimise our impact on the environment by designing lower-footprint products. In 2021 we continued to show progress, achieving 69% (2020: 67%) bio-based organic raw materials.\n\nCarbon cover target: Climate Positive, for us, means more than achieving net zero emissions by 2050. Through our carbon cover target we aim to help customers and consumers save or avoid four times the emissions associated with our entire value chain (scope 1, 2 and 3). In 2021 we helped customers avoid 951,000 tonnes CO2e (2020: 838,000 MT CO2e).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Net zero means eliminating almost all scope 1 and 2 emissions and significantly reducing our upstream scope 3 emissions, with any residual supply chain emissions permanently offset through fully validated and approved schemes.\n\n## Greenhouse gas scope 1 and 2 emissions and intensity charts\n\nSince 2018, our baseline year, our total scope 1 and 2/uni00A0greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have reduced by 12.7%. Within this, scope 1 emissions increased by 4%, whilst we have seen a 60% reduction in scope 2 emissions. This has been driven by a switch to renewable electricity across our manufacturing sites. In 2021 we engaged with Accenture to help us with renewable electricity sourcing/uni00A0options for our manufacturing sites in Asia, where availability of green electricity is more challenging. Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) purchased at Thane in India and Singapore have led to a significant reduction in emissions this year.\n\nScope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from our UK operations were 34,559 TeCO2e in 2021 (2020: 35,692 TeCO2e) representing approximately 19% of our global GHG emissions.\n\nOur chosen measure of GHG emission intensity divides our GHG emissions (market-based scope 2 emissions) by value added 2 , a measure of our business activity. Since 2018, our GHG emissions intensity has improved by 39%, illustrating how we are decoupling growth from our environmental impact.\n\nOur scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions are verified by Avieco. Their formal independent verification statement is available at: www.croda.com/carbonverification\n\nEnergy consumption and efficiency improvements In 2021 we consumed 1,178,117,781 kWh (2020: 1,125,612,495 kWh) of energy across our global operations. This included 219,130,734 kWh (2020: 222,759,173 kWh) consumed by UK operations. As part of our strategy to improve the efficiency of\n\nenergy consumption, 36 projects were implemented globally, realising 39,514,274 kWh of annualised efficiency improvements, equivalent to 9,063 TeCO2e avoided emissions.\n\n## Emissions and energy usage\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1.  Our GHG inventory has been completed in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition). Scope 1 emissions are calculated using Defra Government emission conversion factors for greenhouse gas company reporting. Scope 2 emissions are market-based.\n- 2. Value added is defined as operating profit before depreciation and employee costs at reported currency.\n\n|                                   | 2021        | 2021          | 2021          | 2020        | 2020          | 2020          |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                   | UK          | Rest of world | Total         | UK          | Rest of world | Total         |\n| Scope 1/tonnes CO2e               | 34,321      | 126,514       | 160,835       | 35,279      | 114,342       | 149,621       |\n| Scope 2/tonnes CO2e               | 238         | 21,390        | 21,628        | 413         | 27,430        | 27,843        |\n| Total scope 1 and 2 / tonnes CO2e | 34,559      | 147,904       | 182,463       | 35,692      | 141,772       | 177,464       |\n| Scope 1 energy use / kWh          | 185,948,678 | 753,882,423   | 939,831,101   | 189,846,081 | 708,638,453   | 898,484,534   |\n| Scope 2 energy use / kWh          | 33,182,056  | 205,104,623   | 238,286,679   | 32,913,091  | 194,214,869   | 227,127,960   |\n| Total Energy use / kWh            | 219,130,734 | 958,987,047   | 1,178,117,781 | 222,759,173 | 902,853,322   | 1,125,612,495 |\n\nFor more, see our 2021 Sustainability Report.

Climate scenarios defined by the Network for Greening the Financial Systems (NGFS) were used to model the potential climate related risks and opportunities that Croda may be exposed to. Selected climate related risks and opportunities identified through our risk assessment process were modelled against the following three scenario categories:\n\n- \u00b7  Net Zero 2050: Orderly (+1.5\u00b0C) - early, ambitious action to a net zero CO2 emissions economy;\n- \u00b7  Divergent Net Zero: Disorderly (+2\u00b0C) - action that is late, disruptive, sudden and / or unanticipated;\n- \u00b7  Current Policies: Hot house world (+3\u00b0C) - limited action leads to a hot house world with significant global warming and, as a result, strongly increased exposure to physical risks.\n\nWe considered the impact over six, five year time periods to 2050, which extends significantly beyond our strategic planning horizon but is in line with our commitment to be net zero by 2050. For each transitional risk we also considered the impact under the assumption that Croda continues to operate as today (business as usual) and secondly that currently planned mitigating actions to meet Science Based Targets are successfully implemented.\n\nScenario data from the NGFS and Orbitas Finance, in conjunction with Croda's financial and process data, were used to forecast and quantify the potential levels of climate related financial risk in line with Croda's risk matrix.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nOur analysis shows that although the scenarios present financial risks to Croda, these could be managed by currently planned mitigating actions meaning that we would not have to materially change our business model. Of the risks assessed the potential cost impact of carbon taxation across the two transitional risks is the most notable, which will mitigated by implementing our planned emissions reduction programme, described in more detail on page 39.\n\n## The transition to 100% RSPO-certified palm derivatives - mitigating transitional and physical climate-related risks\n\nOur sustainable sourcing activities and future strategy will play a large part in mitigating both physical and transitional climate-related risks associated with our raw materials. Since 2012 we have supported the transition to RSPOcertified sustainable palm, with 85% of our purchased palm derivatives RSPO-certified by the end of 2021.\n\nRSPO-certified palm oil cultivation leads to increased yields due to more efficient farming practices, increasing availability of\n\npalm and palm kernel oil without further deforestation. Being a leading voice in industry and working with coalitions such as ASD to drive further industry transition to RSPO helps to mitigate the risks associated with increased pricing due to lack of availability.\n\nA peer reviewed LCA study 1 has demonstrated the measurable carbon footprint reduction associated with switching to RSPO-certified palm derivatives.\n\nThis is contributing to progress against our science-based target as well as mitigating the risk and impact of any potential carbon taxation associated with our product carbon footprints, for both ourselves and our customers.\n\n- 1.

Key  markets may develop and implement regional policies such  as the EU carbon border tax to prevent carbon leakage.

The cost   was modelled across the future climate related scenarios  using carbon price models at a global level from the   NGFS database.               | In the Current Policies scenario, the additional cost of carbon  taxes increase is limited, resulting in a minor level of financial  risk to the business out to 2045, when the risk level  increases to low.

        "page_content": "## Measuring our progress\n\nOur strategy is to combine sustainability and innovation to deliver growth. We measure our progress against each of these priorities through a range of KPIs.\n\n## Scope 1 & 2 emissions and intensity*\n\n## Definition:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur operational emissions (associated with burning fuels onsite and purchased electricity), both in absolute terms and as emissions intensity. Our chosen measure of emissions intensity divides our GHG emissions (market-based scope 2 emissions) by value added, a measure of our business activity*.\n\n## Target:\n\nBy 2030, we will have achieved our Science Based Target, reducing emissions in line with limiting global warming to no more than 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\n\n## Performance:\n\nSince 2018 our scope 1 & 2 emissions have reduced by 12.7%, in line with the absolute emissions reduction pathway required to achieve our verified Science Based Target. This has been driven by a 60% reduction in scope 2 emissions following a switch to renewable electricity at our manufacturing sites. Since 2018 our emissions intensity has improved by 39% and we are successfully disconnecting growth from emissions. For more detail see Sustainability on page 39.\n\n## Land area saved (hectares)\n\n## Definition:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLand area saved through the application of our crop protection and seed enhancement technologies, using 2019 as our baseline year.\n\n## Target:\n\nThroughout this decade, the land saved through the application of our technologies will exceed any increase in land used to grow our raw materials by at least a factor of two, and by 2030 we will save a minimum 200,000 hectares per year more than in 2019.\n\n## Performance:\n\nIn 2021 the use of our agricultural ingredients and new technologies saved 33,734 hectares of land compared to our 2019 baseline. This puts us on track to achieve our 2030 target that the land we save outpaces the land we use as our business grows by a factor of at least two. Read more in our Sustainability section on page 33.\n\n## Health and wellbeing**\n\n## Definition:\n\nThe number of pipeline vaccines that we are contributing to that combat the World Health Organisation's (WHO) 24 priority diseases.\n\n## Target:\n\nBy the end of 2024, our technology will be contributing to at least 10 clinical phase III trials across at least 25% of the WHO-listed pipeline vaccines.\n\nLand area saved\n\n33,734\n\nhectares of land saved over the 2019 baseline\n\n## 15/24\n\nOur smart science is contributing to vaccine projects combatting 15 of the WHO's 24 priority diseases\n\n## Performance:\n\nWe have continued to increase engagement with teams researching WHO-listed pipeline vaccines and are now supporting 79 projects (2020: 32) contributing to tackling 15 of the 24 priority diseases.\n\n## Total Recordable Injury Rate^\n\n## Definition:\n\nThe number of incidents per 200,000 hours worked where a person has sustained an injury, including all lost time, restricted work and medical treatment cases.\n\n## Target:\n\nAchieve TRIR of 0.3 by the end of 2024, with an interim target of 0.6 for 2022.\n\n## Performance:\n\nThe headline TRIR increased from 0.58 to 0.73 ^ in 2021. Injury rates at the sites of recently acquired businesses are, on average, higher than established Croda sites and while they are reducing as integration progresses, their inclusion has driven an increase in the overall Group TRIR. There was also a small increase driven by existing Croda sites as a return to more normal working patterns has seen increased recordable injuries. To read about our performance and safety initiatives see page 36 of our 2021 Sustainability Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * See page 39 for our definition of value added and further detail on our emissions intensity.\n- **  Our People Positive strategy encompasses various targets and cannot be represented by a single KPI. In 2022 we plan to implement an employee engagement KPI for reporting. We have also introduced a specific gender balance target to our Remuneration Policy for 2022.\n- ^ Both the 2021 and 2020 TRIR include businesses acquired but exclude workplace related COVID-19 cases.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScope 1 & 2 emissions and scope\n\nintensity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfi\n\nLand area saved (hectares)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTotal recordable injury rate",

NPP products are sales protected by virtue of being either newly launched, protected by intellectual property or by unique quality characteristics.\n\n## Target:\n\nNPP sales to grow ahead of sales growth.\n\n## Performance:\n\nNPP sales increased from 27.4% in 2020 to 28.0% on an organic basis, or to 36.6%, including the impact of the Iberchem and Avanti acquisitions. This reflects strong sales of lipid systems and a high NPP percentage at Iberchem where a large proportion of sales are of new products due to ongoing innovation within that business model. Read more about innovation in Identifying unmet needs on page 4.\n\n## Sales growth (%)\n\n## Definition:\n\nTotal sales growth measured at constant currency.\n\n## Target:\n\nMid-single digit % growth in Consumer Care. High-single digit % growth in Life Sciences. Excluding raw material price recovery.\n\n## Performance:\n\nSales growth in 2021 was 43.2%, driven by an excellent performance across all sectors including 52.9% growth in Consumer Care and 53.5% growth in Life Sciences. Acquisitions contributed 16.9% to sales growth, but excluding acquisitions underlying sales growth was 26.3%.\n\n## Return on sales (ROS) (%)\n\n## Definition:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdjusted operating profit as a percentage of sales.\n\n## Target:\n\nImprove ROS in Consumer Care. ROS similar to current levels in Life Sciences.\n\n## Performance:\n\nGroup ROS increased by 180 basis points to 24.8%. Consumer Care ROS was 24.7% (2020: 27.8%) reflecting the dilution effect from F&F, which operates at structurally lower margins than Personal Care. Life Sciences ROS was 36.4% (2020: 31.7%) reflecting strong growth in higher-value patient health technologies.\n\n## Return on invested capital (ROIC) (%)\n\n## Definition:\n\nAdjusted operating profit after tax divided by the average adjusted invested capital. Adjusted invested capital represents net assets adjusted for net debt, earlier goodwill written off to reserves and accumulated amortisation of acquired intangible assets.\n\n## Target:\n\nROIC of two to three times cost of capital.\n\n## Performance:\n\nThe post-tax return on invested capital ('ROIC') was broadly flat at 14.2% (2020: 14.6%). Despite a significant increase in average invested capital due to the annualisation of 2020 acquisition activity, the growth in adjusted operating profit net of tax resulting from these investments, together with underlying growth, broadly offset this. ROIC continues to be more than twice the Group's cost of capital.\n\n## Adjusted basic earnings per share (EPS)\n\n## Definition:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdjusted profit after tax divided by the average number of shares in issue.\n\n## Target:\n\nAt least mid-single digit % EPS growth per annum.\n\n## Performance:\n\nAdjusted earnings per share increased by 42.5% to 250.0p. This growth was driven by excellent profit growth and a marginally lower tax rate of 21.2% (2020: 24.1%) offset by an increased number of shares in issue following the equity placing in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo read more about our financial performance see Finance review P46\n\nNPP sales %\n\nData TBC\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCore Business sales growth\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReturn on invested capital\n\n21.2%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdjusted basic earnings per share (EPS)\n\n<!-- image -->",

As a result, currency translation reduced reported currency sales by \u00a3101.6m and adjusted operating profit by \u00a324.8m. Transactional currency impact is correlated with translation, given that the UK is a meaningful centre of production for the Group, with the strength of Sterling having an adverse impact on margins.\n\n## Strong sales from organic growth and acquisition\n\nSales grew by 35.9% to \u00a31,889.6m (2020: \u00a31,390.3m), comprising underlying growth of 26.3% and a first-year acquisition benefit of 16.9%, partly offset by adverse currency translation of 7.3%.

Life Sciences sales increased by 45.8%, with growth across all markets and sales of approximately US$200m from the lipid systems platform primarily to our principal vaccine customers. With volume growth in industrial end markets, Performance Technologies sales increased by 17.6%, whilst a recovery in commodity prices saw Industrial Chemicals sales 19.1% higher. Overall, year-on-year growth was slightly lower in the second half year, due to a softer first half comparator when COVID-19 had its biggest impact in 2020.\n\n| 2021 sales growth        |   First half % |   Second half % |   Full  year % |\n|--------------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|\n| Consumer Care            |           46.2 |            43.1 |           44.6 |\n| Life Sciences            |           61.5 |            32.5 |           45.8 |\n| Performance Technologies |           14.7 |            20.8 |           17.6 |\n| Industrial Chemicals     |           12.6 |            25.3 |           19.1 |\n| Group                    |           38.8 |            33.2 |           35.9 |\n\nNote: Sector results for full year 2020 have been restated to reflect a change to the Group's reporting structure.\n\nWe expect to continue with the current accelerated capital reinvestment and acquisition programmes over the next three years, given the strong demand environment and range of growth and technology opportunities in Consumer Care and Life Sciences.",

Alongside a strengthening product mix as we grew in higher value niches, this resulted in an improvement of 17% in sales price/mix.\n\n2021 also saw significant volume recovery globally, up 9% in underlying terms, as consumer demand returned as COVID impacts eased and customers restocked. Combined with global supply chain disruption affecting many industries, including a shortage of freight containers and delays accessing ports, together with new UK/European trading procedures post-Brexit and higher COVID-related absenteeism, maintaining customer service came under some stress and we increased tactical inventory volume to alleviate delays and protect customer supply. With volume growth moderating towards the end of the year, service levels improved. Our Brexit preparation plans were implemented smoothly and successfully.\n\n2021 included a significantly higher remuneration incentive charge than the prior year, reflecting bonus and share-based payment costs due to the enhanced profit and share price performance; this reduced year-on-year margin by two percentage points. Despite these headwinds, Croda achieved a record profit and return on sales in 2021.\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n|                     | IFRS  \u00a3m   | Adjustments  \u00a3m   | Adjusted \u00a3m   | IFRS  \u00a3m   | Adjustments \u00a3m   | Adjusted  \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------|------------|-------------------|---------------|------------|------------------|----------------|\n| Sales               | 1,889.6    | -                 | 1,889.6       | 1,390.3    | -                | 1,390.3        |\n| Cost of sales       | (950.7)    | -                 | (950.7)       | (758.2)    | -                | (758.2)        |\n| Gross profit        | 938.9      | -                 | 938.9         | 632.1      | -                | 632.1          |\n| Operating costs     | (500.7)    | (30.4)            | (470.3)       | (342.1)    | (29.6)           | (312.5)        |\n| Operating profit    | 438.2      | (30.4)            | 468.6         | 290.0      | (29.6)           | 319.6          |\n| Net interest charge | (26.7)     | (3.3)             | (23.4)        | (20.5)     | (1.5)            | (19.0)         |\n| Profit before tax   | 411.5      | (33.7)            | 445.2         | 269.5      | (31.1)           | 300.6          |\n| Tax                 | (88.7)     | 5.7               | (94.4)        | (67.9)     | 4.5              | (72.4)         |\n| Profit after tax    | 322.8      | (28.0)            | 350.8         | 201.6      | (26.6)           | 228.2          |\n\nIFRS operating profit increased by 51.1% to \u00a3438.2m (2020: \u00a3290.0m).\n\nThe charge for adjusting items before tax was \u00a333.7m (2020: \u00a331.1m). In common with many companies, Croda identifies adjusting items as amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition, together with exceptional items, which require separate disclosure by virtue of their size or incidence. The charge for amortisation of intangible assets before tax increased to \u00a334.3m (2020: \u00a313.6m), reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions. The net credit on exceptional items before tax was \u00a30.6m (2020 charge: \u00a317.5m), comprising a gain on pensions of \u00a311.2m (arising from transfer of the Dutch scheme to a collective defined contribution arrangement); a gain on contingent consideration of \u00a36.2m related to previous acquisitions; a charge for business acquisition and disposal costs of \u00a313.5m, principally relating to the sale of the majority of PTIC; and a charge for the unwind of the discount on contingent consideration of \u00a33.3m. Excluding these adjusting items, adjusted operating profit increased by 46.6% to \u00a3468.6m (2020: \u00a3319.6m), reflecting higher sales and margin. Return on sales improved to 24.8% (2020: 23.0%).\n\nWith the adjusted net interest charge increasing to \u00a323.4m (2020: \u00a319.0m), including the write-off of a loan to a technology investment, adjusted profit before tax increased by 48.1% to \u00a3445.2m (2020: \u00a3300.6m). IFRS profit before tax increased by 52.7% to \u00a3411.5m (2020: \u00a3269.5m).\n\nThe effective tax rate on adjusted profit reduced to 21.2% (2020: 24.1%). This benefitted from a one-off settlement of a previous uncertain tax position; we expect the future tax rate to be around 25%. The impact of the divestment of the majority of PTIC on the future tax rate is expected to be immaterial. There were no other significant adjustments between the Group's expected and reported tax charge based on its accounting profit. With an increase in shares in issue following the equity placing to acquire Iberchem in late 2020, IFRS basic earnings per share (EPS) were 230.0p (2020: 155.1p) and adjusted basic EPS increased by 42.5% to 250.0p (2020: 175.5p).\n\nProfit performance was strong across all sectors, led by Life Sciences where adjusted operating profit was up 67.5%, reflecting sales growth and an improvement in product mix towards higher value add niches. Consumer Care adjusted operating profit rose 28.7%, strengthening in the second half year with continued growth and mix improvement in its Personal Care business. Performance Technologies benefitted from the recovery in demand, with higher volume positively impacting operating leverage, resulting in adjusted operating profit 31.9% higher. Industrial Chemicals enjoyed significantly better profit due to improved commodity pricing.",

With completion of the divestment expected in summer 2022, this transaction had no impact on the Group's reported results for 2021, except for costs incurred reported as an exceptional item. In these 2021 results, PTIC revenue totalled \u00a3554m (2020: \u00a3470m) and adjusted operating profit was \u00a372m (2020: \u00a349m). Taking account of the value to be retained by Croda under future supply agreements for products to be manufactured at Croda sites and supplied to the acquirer, together with dis-synergy costs remaining with Croda which were previously allocated to the divested business, the estimated impact of the divestment on Croda's reported 2021 results, had it occurred at the start of 2021, would have been to reduce revenue by \u00a3361m (2020: \u00a3298m) and adjusted operating profit by \u00a359m (2020: \u00a336m).\n\n## Lower free cash flow reflecting higher investment and demand growth\n\nFree cash flow reduced to \u00a3153.6m (2020: \u00a3176.9m) as a result of higher working capital and increased capital investment. Working capital rose by just over \u00a3100m due to increased raw material costs and selling prices, higher sales volumes and tactical increases in inventory to mitigate global distribution challenges. The impact of higher pricing and sales volume (at constant working days cover) accounted for approximately \u00a369m of the increase with the balance reflecting tactical increases.\n\n|                                           | Full year ended 31 December   | Full year ended 31 December   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Cash flow                                 | 2021  \u00a3m                      | 2020  \u00a3m                      |\n| Adjusted operating profit                 | 468.6                         | 319.6                         |\n| Depreciation and amortisation             | 79.0                          | 68.2                          |\n| EBITDA                                    | 547.6                         | 387.8                         |\n| Working capital                           | (102.5)                       | (2.3)                         |\n| Net capital expenditure                   | (158.5)                       | (121.0)                       |\n| Payment of lease liabilities              | (14.4)                        | (7.6)                         |\n| Non-cash pension expense                  | 11.2                          | 7.7                           |\n| Interest & tax                            | (129.8)                       | (87.7)                        |\n| Free cash flow                            | 153.6                         | 176.9                         |\n| Dividends                                 | (132.5)                       | (115.9)                       |\n| Issue of new equity                       | -                             | 615.5                         |\n| Acquisitions                              | (58.8)                        | (869.7)                       |\n| Other cash movements                      | 19.0                          | (26.6)                        |\n| Net cash flow                             | (18.7)                        | (219.8)                       |\n| Net movement in borrowings                | 37.6                          | 237.3                         |\n| Net movement in cash and cash equivalents | 18.9                          | 17.5                          |\n\nCapital investment increased to \u00a3158.5m (2020: \u00a3121.0m), reflecting the start of a programme to reinvest proceeds from the divestment of the majority of PTIC to unlock growth opportunities in Consumer Care and Life Sciences. This is creating new technology platforms and expanding existing capacity to drive superior future growth. This organic expansion is supported by selected inorganic acquisition opportunities, with 2021 seeing \u00a358.8m invested in new platforms, with Parfex in fine fragrances and Alban Muller in natural Beauty Actives. Together, this organic and inorganic investment reflects elements 1 and 3 of the Group's capital allocation policy, to:\n\n- 1. Reinvest for growth - invest in organic capital expenditure to drive shareholder value creation through new capacity, product innovation and expansion in attractive geographic markets to drive sales and profit growth;\n- 2. Provide regular returns to shareholders - pay a regular dividend to shareholders, representing 40 to 50% of adjusted earnings over the business cycle. The full year dividend has been raised by 10% to 100.0p (2020: 91.0p), being 40% of adjusted earnings;\n- 3. Acquire disruptive technologies - to supplement organic growth, target a number of exciting technology acquisitions in existing and adjacent markets, strengthening Consumer Care and expanding Life Sciences; and",

Maintain an appropriate balance sheet and return excess\n\n- capital - maintain an appropriate balance sheet to meet future investment and trading requirements, targeting a leverage ratio of 1 to 2x over the medium-term cycle. We consider returning excess capital to shareholders when leverage falls below our target range and sufficient capital is available to meet our investment opportunities. At 31 December 2021, the leverage ratio was 1.4x (31 December 2020: 1.8x) and is expected to fall below 1x on completion of the disposal of the majority of PTIC.\n\nWe expect to continue with the current accelerated capital reinvestment and acquisition programmes over the next three years, given the strong demand environment and range of growth and technology opportunities in Consumer Care and Life Sciences.\n\nThe post-tax ROIC was broadly flat at 14.2% (2020: 14.6%). Despite a significant increase in average invested capital due to the annualisation of 2020 acquisition activity, the growth in adjusted operating profit net of tax resulting from these investments, together with underlying growth, broadly offset this. ROIC continues to be more than twice the Group's cost of capital.\n\nClosing net debt was \u00a3823.2m (31 December 2020: \u00a3800.5m). The Group has a strong balance sheet with its material debt maturities falling due between 2023 and 2030, and the primary bank revolving credit\n\n## Alternative Performance Measures (APMs)\n\nWe use a number of APMs to assist in presenting information in this statement in an easily analysable and comparable form. We use such measures consistently at the half year and full year, and reconcile them as appropriate. Whilst the Board believes the APMs used provide a meaningful basis upon which to analyse the Group's financial performance and position, which is helpful to the reader, it notes that APMs have certain limitations, including the exclusion of significant recurring items, and may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\n\nThe measures used in this statement include:\n\n- \u00b7 Constant currency results: these reflect current year performance for existing business translated at the prior year's average exchange rates and include the impact of acquisitions. Constant currency results are the primary measure used by management to monitor the performance of overseas business units, since they remove the impact of currency translation into Sterling, the Group's reporting currency, over which those overseas units have no control. Constant currency results are similarly useful to shareholders in understanding the performance of the Group excluding the impact of movements in currency translation over which the Group has no control. Constant currency results are reconciled to reported results in the Finance Review. The APMs are calculated as follows:\n- \u00b7  For constant currency profit, translation is performed using the entity reporting currency;\n- \u00b7  For constant currency sales, local currency sales are translated into the most relevant functional currency of the destination country of sale (for example, sales in Latin America are primarily made in US Dollars, which is therefore used as the functional currency). Sales in functional currency are then translated into Sterling using the prior year's average rates for the corresponding period;\n- \u00b7 Underlying results: these reflect constant currency values adjusted to exclude acquisitions and disposals in the first year of impact. They are used by management to measure the performance of each sector before the benefit of acquisitions or the impact of divestments are included, in order to assess the organic performance of the sector, thereby providing a consistent basis on which to make year-on-year comparison. They are seen as similarly useful to shareholders in assessing the performance of the business. Underlying results are reconciled to reported results in the Finance review;\n- \u00b7 Adjusted results: these are stated before exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition, and tax thereon. The Board believes that the adjusted presentation (and the\n\nfacility extended during the year to 2026. As at 31 December 2021, the Group had committed funding in place of \u00a31,225.8m, undrawn committed facilities of \u00a3334.4m and \u00a3112.8m in cash.\n\nAs part of the annual review of going concern, the Group conducts a series of scenario tests for different economic environments. In 2021, Group sales and profit performed well ahead of the base case scenario evaluated in February 2021, whilst cash generation was broadly similar.\n\n## Retirement benefits\n\nThe post-tax asset on retirement benefit plans at 31 December 2021, measured on an accounting valuation basis under IAS 19, improved to \u00a35.8m (31 December 2020: \u00a325.3m liability), primarily due to higher discount rates and the transfer of the Dutch scheme to a collective defined contribution arrangement. This new arrangement is accounted for as a defined contribution scheme as the Group pays a fixed rate of contributions and members are paid pensions with variable increases. The triennial actuarial valuation of the largest pension plan, the UK Croda Pension Scheme, was performed as at 30 September 2020 and indicated that the scheme was 101% funded on a technical provisions basis. Consequently, no deficit recovery plan is required. The Group has discussed with the Trustee the impact on the scheme of the planned divestment of the majority of PTIC and no changes to funding are anticipated as a result.\n\ncolumnar format adopted for the Group income statement) assists shareholders by providing a meaningful basis upon which to analyse business performance and make year-on-year comparisons. The same measures are used by management for planning, budgeting and reporting purposes and for the internal assessment of operating performance across the Group. The adjusted presentation is adopted on a consistent basis for each half year and full year results;\n\n- \u00b7 Return on sales: this is adjusted operating profit divided by sales, at reported currency. Management uses the measure to assess the profitability of each sector and the Group, as part of its drive to grow profit by more than sales value, in turn by more than sales volume, as set out in the Chief Executive's review;\n- \u00b7 Return on invested capital (ROIC): this is adjusted operating profit after tax divided by the average adjusted invested capital. Adjusted invested capital represents net assets adjusted for net debt, earlier goodwill written off to reserves and accumulated amortisation of acquired intangible assets. The Board believes that ROIC is a key measure of efficient capital allocation, in line with its policy set out in the Finance Review, with its aim being to maintain a ROIC of two to three times the cost of capital over the cycle, and that it is useful to shareholders in assessing the superior returns delivered by the Group and the impact of deploying more capital to grow future returns faster;\n- \u00b7 Net debt: comprises cash and cash equivalents (including bank overdrafts), current and non-current borrowings and lease liabilities. Management uses this measure to monitor debt funding levels and compliance with the Group's funding covenants which also use this measure. It believes that net debt is a helpful additional measure for shareholders in assessing the risk to equity holders and the capacity to invest more capital in the business;\n- \u00b7 Leverage ratio: this is the ratio of net debt to Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) adjusted to include EBITDA from acquisitions or disposals in the last 12 month period. EBITDA is adjusted operating profit plus depreciation and amortisation. The Board monitors the leverage ratio against the Group's debt funding covenants and overall appetite for funding risk, in approving capital expenditure and acquisitions. It believes that the APM is a helpful additional measure for shareholders in assessing the risk to equity holders and the capacity to invest more capital in the business;\n- \u00b7 Free cash flow: comprises EBITDA less movements in working capital, net capital expenditure, payment of lease liabilities, non-cash pension expense, and interest and tax payments. The Board uses free cash flow to monitor the Group's overall cash generation capability, to assess the ability of the Company to pay dividends and to finance future expansion, and, as such, it believes this is useful to shareholders in their assessment of the Group's performance.",

        "page_content": "## Managing risk\n\n## Our risk framework enables the business to protect and create value, helping us to identify opportunities and minimise threats to the delivery of our strategic and operational objectives.\n\n## Risk strategy and governance\n\nOur Board owns and oversees our risk management programme, with overall responsibility for ensuring that our risks are aligned with our goals and strategic objectives. The Audit Committee assists the Board in monitoring the effectiveness of our risk management and internal control policies, procedures and systems (page 81).\n\n## Risk monitoring and reporting\n\nGlobal visibility of all risks is delivered through our global risk reporting dashboard, updated daily from our risk and control system (the Digital Hive) which provides a platform to understand and manage risks and enables risk comparison across regions, operations and sectors. Using our global risk management framework (page 52), similar risks are considered together by generic risk area, sub-categories and categories, giving the Board and management visibility of the aggregated risks on a Group-wide basis. Each of our strategic and operational risks is owned by an Executive member.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nRisk appetite statements are defined for each subcategory of risks and each generic risk has a defined risk appetite, visible to all risk owners, which is owned and reviewed by an Executive member. Risk appetite statements are reviewed annually by the Executive and the Board (page 66) in order to guide the actions management take in executing our strategy.\n\n## Key risk indicators\n\nWe set targets to help monitor performance in mitigating our risks. These targets also support decision making by providing management with information about Executive expectations and are monitored and reviewed by the risk related steering groups (page 52).\n\n## Risk culture\n\nWe use our global risk management framework (page 52) to drive an integrated and owned approach to risk management through the culture of the entire organisation.\n\n## Risk oversight\n\nThe Board carried out a robust assessment of emerging and principal risks facing the Group at its meeting in July (page 66), including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. It also received quarterly assurance updates from the Chair of the Risk Management Committee.\n\n## Risk management\n\nResponsibility for risk management is embedded throughout our organisation. Our first line of defence, our employees, have a responsibility to manage day-to-day risk in their own areas guided by Group policies, procedures and control frameworks. Local management, and ultimately the Executive, ensure that risks are managed, maintained, reviewed and actioned according to these frameworks.\n\nThe second line of defence is provided by management team review of each risk register, culminating in review by the Risk Management Committee (page 52), which meets quarterly to challenge and monitor current risks and receive presentations from key risk owners. Insight on external trends and on internal emerging risks (from review of the bottom-up risk registers) is provided by the risk team and discussed by the Committee.\n\nThe third line of defence is assurance over the effectiveness of mitigating controls, which is provided through internal audits in addition to reports from external assurance providers. These reports are reviewed by three Executive Committees (page 52) and are monitored and challenged by the Audit Committee (page 81) and the Board.\n\nWe have a Global Crisis Management plan in place to manage significant risk events, owned by the Executive, which is tested at least annually based on key risk scenarios.\n\n## Our principal risks\n\nOur risk heat map (page 52) identifies principal pre-mitigation risks and reflects a summary of local risks identified in the risk framework. They are those that we consider most impact our business model (page 16) and the delivery of our long-term strategic objectives (page 20). They are explained in further detail in the table on pages 53 to 55. These risks also form the basis of scenario testing for the assessment of long-term viability of the Company on page 56.\n\n## Changes to our gross risk environment in 2021\n\nMovements on the risk heat map on page 52 reflect changes to the long-term risk environment that we are facing and how these risks have changed in the year. In 2021 we have added one new principal risk, whilst three risks have moved out of the principal list.\n\nBusiness system security risks have increased during 2021 as a result of increasing cyber threats globally, whilst other principal risks have remained at the same level as 2020.\n\nAll risks continue to be monitored by the Risk Management Committee for significant change and if the impact or likelihood increases will be identified as principal risks in future.\n\n## New principal risks in 2021\n\nIn the light of significant business change programmes being driven by our strategy (page 20) we have added a standalone principal risk relating to Management of Business Change which is described in detail, together with our mitigation approach, on page 54.",

        "page_content": "## Risks moving out of principal risks in 2021\n\nManagement's view is that the three risks which are no longer considered to be principal are all effectively managed. They are also slower velocity risks, giving us time to take mitigating actions to address any increased levels of risk. These risks are:\n\n- \u00b7  Supplier and raw material security: The last two years have seen a period of significant disruption to global trade (see case study below). Throughout this period our procurement teams have worked with suppliers to ensure that raw materials continue to be available and production has\n- remained uninterrupted. Our ability to secure supply in such a challenging period enables us to reduce the impact of supplier and raw material security which results in the risk falling outside our definition of a principal risk.\n- \u00b7  Product stewardship and chemical regulatory compliance: We consider this to be a risk with well established operational process, a dedicated specialist team and no recent issues. In 2021 we increased the size of the team to address complexity in this area and to support further integration across the business. This enabled us to reduce the likelihood of the risk, which results in this risk falling outside our definition of a principal risk.\n- \u00b7  Ineffective management of pension fund: In 2021 we worked with the UK scheme trustee to further reduce the likelihood of investment and funding risks. Given the Group's balance sheet strength, the impact of any significant increased funding requirements impacting Croda's balance sheet is assessed as reduced since 2020. The combination of reduced risk impact and likelihood results in the risk falling outside our definition of a principal risk.\n\n## Supply chain management\n\nThe continued short-term impact of COVID-19 and Brexit has seen disruption of our supply chain in 2021. This has the potential to impact both our raw material supply and the availability of freight to deliver finished product to our customers. We monitor delivery metrics closely through our Safety, Health, Environment and Quality (SHEQ) steering committee and at our monthly regional leadership team meetings. Supply chain management has been challenging, but thanks to the excellent work of our teams in customer service, shipping and sales we have supplied greater volumes to our customers than in previous years, demonstrating the resilience of our supply chain. In addition, our flexible production sites have implemented rapid debottlenecking and amended plant scheduling to accommodate changes to material availability and increased demand. The main short-term challenges we had to address in 2021 have been as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  Brexit import and export paperwork for particular raw materials, leading to a backlog of material being held in port\n- \u00b7  Shortage of hauliers, particularly in the UK, Spain and USA\n- \u00b7  Shortage of deep sea containers, particularly for shipping from East to West, with a consequent increase in prices of these containers\n- \u00b7  COVID-19 related absenteeism impacting Croda and third-party logistics provider teams\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nOur risk appetite is the level of risk that Croda is willing to accept in the pursuit of a specific objective or strategy. We have defined our risk appetite in a number of areas in order to manage and monitor our risk exposure. Assessing risks against our risk appetite also provides the opportunity to identify areas where we may not be taking enough risk. Our risk appetite statements are compiled based on our Company values, strategy, and capacity to absorb risk in certain areas. We have risk appetite statements in place for each of our risk sub-categories, each being owned by a member of the Executive. On an annual basis the risk appetites are reviewed by the Executive and the Board (page 66) and updated to ensure they remain relevant. We use our risk appetites as a starting point to review and challenge the level of risk that we are taking for each of our key risks, to identify areas where additional control may be needed, or where the level of control may be too onerous.",

To grow, we need to innovate and also keep pace with our customers as they serve consumers globally in established markets and higher risk developing markets. Failure to manage these challenges and the consequences of any geopolitical tensions will adversely impact delivery of our growth strategic objective (page 20). Acquisitions of adjacent technologies will dilute growth if they are not effectively integrated.\n\n## How we respond\n\nThrough our global sector sales, marketing and technology teams, we identify consumer trends and respond swiftly to satisfy customer needs through key technologies. Our direct selling model enables us to get closer to our customers. Our resilient business model (page 16) and continued focus on growing profit ahead of sales ahead of volume mitigates profit impact in difficult trading conditions.\n\n## What we have done in 2021\n\n- \u00b7  Delivered growth across all regions and sectors (page 11)\n- \u00b7  Continued to strengthen our country selling teams and developed further digital channels through which our customers can engage with us; crucial in maintaining the business pipeline whilst in-person visits have been restricted by COVID-19\n- \u00b7  Started integration of Iberchem as part of our Consumer Care sector and provided a stronger footprint in developing markets\n- \u00b7  Invested in Iberchem Brazil, one of the largest markets for fragrances globally\n- \u00b7  Optimised the opportunities available to us in Health Care vaccination, building our brand and reputation in this area and meeting the urgent needs of the COVID-19 pandemic\n- \u00b7  Implemented a global 'voice of the customer' survey to understand what we do well and where we need to improve, to continue to deliver innovative products and excellent service to our customers\n- \u00b7  Expanded our reach for high value niche Health Care ingredients globally, building a pipeline of new products\n- \u00b7  Acquired Alban Muller and Parfex (page 6)\n\nRisk increase\n\nEngage\n\nNo change\n\nCreate\n\nRisk decrease\n\nMake\n\nIncluded in viability statement (see page 57)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.

It plays a critical role across our operations; it differentiates us from the competition, protects sales and improves our margins. Failure to leverage the knowledge of our global innovation teams could lead to a reduction in New and Protected Products ('NPP') and will impact growth and margin.\n\nFailure to protect the intellectual property ('IP') in these products in existing and new markets could undermine our competitive advantage.\n\nOur outstanding technical research and development (R&D) teams, based in our customer innovation centres and application laboratories globally, focus innovation on customer and market needs and are embedded across our business. We invest in: R&D, Open Innovation and Smart Partnership programmes, seeking premium niches and disruptive technology acquisitions (page 12). Our specialist IP team protect new products and technologies, defending our IP and challenging third-party IP where appropriate.\n\nOur functional specialist teams focus on our business model areas of Create, Make and Sell (page 16) and provide global leadership to take advantage of the fast evolving digital world. They deliver an integrated market-facing environment that encompasses everything from product development through artificial intelligence-enabled manufacture, to customer service.

New and established customers expect a high level of online service, from researching ingredients to buying, and failure to meet these ahead of competitors will impact growth, hinder R&D knowledge sharing and create inefficient processes.\n\nWe have made a bold Commitment to be Climate and Land Positive by 2030 (page 2), aligning our smart science with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Sustainability has been a strategic priority for Croda for over a decade and we are committed to delivering improvements in line with the objective to limit global temperature rises to no more than 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Climate change, biodiversity loss and rising inequality are changing consumer demands, making sustainability as important to consumer choice as price.\n\nFailure to remain ahead of our competitors and to deliver on our stretching 2030 targets will damage our reputation and compromise growth.\n\nOur sustainability team, led by our Chief Sustainability Officer, maintain the organisation's focus. The Sustainability Committee, which meets quarterly, has representatives from all functions and sectors who work together to deliver our sustainability targets. We see more opportunity than risk in climate change.\n\nFor more on Land and Climate Positive see pages 32 and 33 and in our Sustainability Report (pages 20 to 29).\n\n- \u00b7  Committed to climate Science Based Targets (SBT) and became the third major chemical company in the world to have our plan to achieve them officially verified (page 12)\n- \u00b7  Invested in market leading technology to automate the collation and internal reporting of sustainability metrics\n- \u00b7  Committed to complete roadmaps in 2022 for decarbonisation of all our operational site and business sectors, supported by additional capital investment\n- \u00b7  Completed full Executive review of the sustainability strategy, attended by a Board member\n- \u00b7  Completed our periodic review of our material issues and climate related risks and opportunities (page 30)\n- \u00b7  Prepared carbon budgets for each sector, sitting alongside the financial budgets\n- \u00b7  Engaged our investors in sustainability (see case study on page 19)\n\n## 4.

Our business model relies heavily on the availability of IT networks and systems; an extended interruption of these services may result in an inability to operate.\n\nWe run our key applications in distributed computing environments with regular failover testing and penetration testing being undertaken. Our information security specialists monitor our IT services and networks, oversee cyber protection solutions and provide cyber awareness education globally, whilst internal and external auditors review and report on the operation of cyber and system controls annually.\n\n- \u00b7  Developed and adopted a new medium-term information security strategy\n- \u00b7  Assessed our IT operations against the NIST Cyber Security Framework\n- \u00b7  Developed new security controls within Croda's Operational Technology environment at a pilot manufacturing site\n- \u00b7  Conducted a third-party facilitated review of data privacy compliance, to maintain the health of the global data privacy framework and improve where necessary\n- \u00b7  Completed an in-depth review of the IT control framework, including assessment of governance and monitoring processes (page 81)\n- \u00b7  Carried out an internal audit review to provide assurance over asset management and third-party processes\n- \u00b7  Carried out a full review of cyber security controls at Incotec China\n\nSell\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Directors also considered it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis, as explained in the Group accounting policies (page 125).\n\n## The viability assessment period\n\nThe Directors have assessed the longer-term viability of the Company over the three year period to 31 December 2024, taking account of the Company's current financial position and the potential impact of the Company's principal risks identified on pages 53 to 55.\n\nFor 2021 the Board considers that, in assessing the prospects of the Company and determining the appropriate viability period, its investment and financial planning horizon of three years is the appropriate benchmark. In reaching this conclusion they considered the following:\n\n- \u00b7  the three year financial planning horizon, supported by detailed financial modelling which considers profitability, cash flows, gearing and other key financial metrics;\n- \u00b7  the three year investment planning cycle which reflects the typical maximum lead time involved in developing new capacity. Both financial and investment planning are led by the CEO and reviewed by the Board;\n- \u00b7  the Company has demonstrated a strong balance sheet and cash generation which ensure its ability to repay, renew and raise new debt facilities in most market conditions\n\n## Assessment of viability\n\nWe assess our longer-term resilience to risk in two ways:\n\n- \u00b7  Top down: we test the Company's overall funding capacity to withstand catastrophic events through stress testing the reduction in EBITDA required to breach the bank leverage covenant;\n- \u00b7  Bottom up: we assess the existing unused committed liquidity available and peak debt leverage rates under multiple bottom-up worst case risk scenarios, both individually and in combination. These risks are the principal risks which present long-term threats to the business as identified through our risk management process (page 50) and agreed by the Board. To ensure consistency, we use the base case model developed for going concern assessment (page 125).\n\nIn 2021 we assessed viability assuming the sale of the majority of our Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals business ('PTIC sale') (page 11) will complete in summer 2022. We completed additional scenarios to assess the impact of this sale not completing on the Group's viability, with the outcome described on page 57.\n\nAssuming a successful PTIC sale, under each worst case combination of scenarios, top-down headroom is considered to be more than adequate. The results of the bottom-up scenario modelling showed that no individual event or plausible combination of events (the most significant of which was scenario F) would give rise to a financial impact sufficient to endanger the viability of the Company in the period assessed, with ample liquidity and debt leverage headroom against funding covenants.\n\nWere the PTIC sale to be unsuccessful, using the same scenarios, the bottom-up modelling also showed that the financial impact of a severe but plausible combination of events would not endanger the viability of the Company but would require additional funding to be put in place (which is expected to be available).\n\n## Top-down liquidity headroom\n\nWe assess our overall funding capacity to withstand catastrophic events by stress testing the EBITDA reduction required to trigger the default of the bank leverage covenant, and the current level of committed debt facilities which mature within the viability period.\n\n- \u00b7  Bank leverage covenant: the leverage ratio at the end of 2021 of 1.4x remains substantially below the maximum covenant level under the Group's debt facilities of 3.5x. Based on 2021 results, stress testing assesses that EBITDA would need to fall by 66% to trigger an event of default. In the event that the maximum covenant level was reached we would also take action to conserve cash;\n- \u00b7  Unused committed liquidity headroom: at 31 December 2021 over 78% of the current level of committed debt facilities of \u00a31,226m mature after the end of the viability period, with current committed unused headroom of \u00a3334m (page 153). The Company expects to have access to additional liquidity funding in most market circumstances.\n\n(page 49). The most common debt maturity term is five years;\n\n- \u00b7  the resilient business model (page 16) and the Company's diversified portfolio of products, operations and customers, which reduce exposure to specific geographies and markets, as well as large customer/product combinations; and\n- \u00b7  the strong, sector-led innovation pipeline (pages 24 to 29) extending over more than three years, which supports the Company's business through development of new sales growth opportunities, protects sales and margins, differentiates the Company from competitors and provides barriers to entry\n\nGiven the progressive development of a longer term strategic plan for the Group, the Board will review over the coming year whether it is appropriate to consider a longer viability period in future Annual Reports.",

This focus and collaboration were enabled through our clarity of Purpose and a well-established and transparent governance framework. Together these underpin our decision making, ensuring we balance the interests of all our stakeholders whilst continuing to promote the long-term interests of the Company for our shareholders to provide a good return on their investment in Croda.\n\nAt the same time, we have remained focused on supporting the wellbeing of our employees across the Group, who have once again shown exceptional resilience to the challenges presented to them during the year. Our employees have continued supporting our customers, suppliers and local communities and there are many examples of this throughout this report. I am also delighted that we continued with our track record of paying regular dividends to our shareholders.\n\nThis report, together with the Directors' Remuneration Report, set out on pages 84 to 108, describe how the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) principles have been applied by the Company. I am pleased to report that the Company has complied with the provisions of the Code for the period under review. The 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code is available at www.frc.org.uk.\n\nOur strong well established governance framework underpins the delivery of the strategy and all our decision making by ensuring accountability, responsibility and transparency.'\n\nAnita Frew\n\nChair\n\n## Our strategy and stakeholders\n\nAs well as collaborating with the Executive team on the development of our five-year strategy, focusing on our Consumer Care and Life Sciences market sectors, the Board spent a considerable amount of time overseeing the disposal of the majority of our Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals business. As well as considering the strategic and financial implications of the disposal for Croda, the Board took account of the interests of our key stakeholders; this is further described in the case study on page 69.\n\nThe Board continued with the regular scheduled programme of meetings through in-person meetings when possible, via video conferencing and additional calls were held as required throughout the year. Our first priority in the Board meetings is always the health and safety of all our employees and others impacted by our operations.\n\nIn our meetings, we were presented with a number of strategic deep dives, which this year covered health and safety, our Health Care and Consumer Care businesses, innovation and also our operations strategy. These allowed the newly appointed Presidents of Consumer Care and Life Sciences to present to the Board on their strategic vision of the future for these businesses. These were then debated and challenged.\n\nIn all its deliberations and decisions, the Board is always mindful of the impact on the business' various stakeholders and on its long-term, sustainable success, in line with Section 172(1) of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nWe describe on page 68 how the Board engaged with each of our key stakeholders during 2021 and give some examples of how we have considered their interests in some of the Board's decisions made during the year.\n\n## Leadership and diversity\n\nWe consider that creating an inclusive Board is essential to ensuring we attract a diverse set of candidates for Board roles. The greater the diversity of our directors, the more likely we can foster innovative thinking in the boardroom.\n\nOn 1 September 2021 we welcomed Julie Kim to the Board and more recently on 1 February 2022 we were joined by Nawal Ouzren. These two additional Non-Executive Director appointments have brought fresh perspectives to our discussions and support our strategic priorities. We look forward to working with them in the years ahead.\n\nFollowing these appointments, I am delighted to report that the composition of the Board not only meets, but exceeds the ambitions set out in the Hampton-Alexander and Parker reviews for FTSE 100 companies.

        "page_content": "the recruitment of these directors and to maintaining this Board diversity is set out in the Nomination Committee Report on pages 76 to 77.\n\nThe composition of the Executive Committee was reviewed and refreshed with the appointment of new members following consideration of the talent, development and succession throughout the business. Details of these changes and our succession processes are included in the report of the Nomination Committee.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, the Board agreed to extend my appointment for a further year following the completion of my second three-year term of office. This annual extension is in line with our policy to review appointments annually once six years' tenure has been completed. Helena Ganczakowski's appointment for a further year was also recommended and agreed by the Board. Roberto Cirillo and Jacqui Ferguson completed their first three-year terms and the Nomination Committee recommended to the Board that their appointments be extended for a further three years. Before making the recommendations to the Board, the Nomination Committee considered the contribution made to the Board and the Committees by the individual and their time commitments. No director being considered for re-appointment took part in any discussion relating to their own appointment. Further information about the tenure of other Board members can be found on page 75.\n\n## Board evaluation\n\nI am pleased to report that the Board evaluation this year confirmed that we continue to operate as a very effective Board. With the addition of our new Non-Executive Directors we have the right composition, experience, skills and diversity on the Board to support the strategic ambition of the Group as we emerge from the pandemic. Full details of the evaluation and the outcomes are included in the report on page 74.\n\n## Annual general meeting\n\nLast year in light of government guidance relating to COVID-19 prohibiting public gatherings and restricting non-essential travel, shareholders were strongly advised not to attend the Annual General Meeting (AGM). We know our AGM provides investors with a valuable opportunity to communicate with us and this dialogue is very important to the Board. We therefore arranged an online shareholder presentation from Steve Foots which included the opportunity for shareholders to attend virtually and ask questions at, and in advance of, the meeting.\n\n## Company Culture\n\nOur Purpose, values and culture are discussed in the Strategic Report.\n\nOur Purpose is to use our Smart science to improve Lives\u2122, and guides the choices we make as a business. In line with our Purpose we have committed to be the most sustainable supplier of innovative ingredients by ensuring we are Climate, Land and People Positive by 2030.\n\nOur Purpose is reflected in the Board's strategy and is underpinned by our values and our unique culture. The cultural tone of the Company is set by the Board, who are responsible for assessing, monitoring and promoting the company culture through its decisions and conduct. Further information on how the Board factors stakeholders into Board decisions is on pages 68 to 69.\n\nCroda's positive culture continued to support employees, suppliers, customers and our local communities throughout the second year of the pandemic and examples of this can be seen throughout this report. During the year the Croda Foundation made its first grants to employee nominated projects that that will help improve the lives of our local communities around the world.\n\nDuring 2021, the Board monitored and assessed culture through multiple sources:\n\n- \u00b7  Inviting employees to present at Board and Committee meetings.\n- \u00b7  Regularly meeting with management. See page 64 for information on Board interaction outside the boardroom.\n- \u00b7  Receiving regular reports and data on health and safety and sustainability matters. These were of prime focus for the Board.\n- \u00b7  Receiving regular quarterly reports from all areas of the business including corporate functions. These include progress and compliance with key performance indicators.\n- \u00b7  Reviewing reports on significant instances of inappropriate conduct, whether through the Company's Speak-Up line or other grievance channels.\n- \u00b7  Engaging directly with employees around the world through listening groups, site visits and town halls.\n- \u00b7  Discussing the feedback from listening groups and pulse surveys, which enabled communications and policies to be tailored and adjusted to ensure employees' needs were being met.\n- \u00b7  Assessing management's attitude to risk and assurance of the external and internal audit functions through the work and reports of the Audit Committee.\n- \u00b7  Reviewing the work on diversity and inclusion and succession planning through the reports of the Nomination Committee.\n- \u00b7  Receiving feedback from the Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Policy is aligned to culture and also embedded in the Remuneration Committee's discretion framework is an assessment of our cultural performance. Maintaining this alignment will form a vital part of the review of the Remuneration Policy in 2022. Further detail on how remuneration is addressed across the Company is included in the Remuneration Committee report on pages 84 to 108.\n\nThe Board was satisfied that Croda's Purpose, values, strategy and culture are aligned and will act together to preserve long-term value.\n\nThis year we will be holding a hybrid AGM, with the ability for shareholders to attend in-person or join virtually. Our AGM will take place on 20 May 2022 and I look forward to being able to meet with many of you in-person once again. More details of this event are set out in the Notice of Meeting and I would be delighted to see you, whether in-person or online, and answer any questions that you may have.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnita Frew",

In addition to the formal Board meetings, the Board had additional ad-hoc update calls to discuss business performance and key projects as they progressed. This ensured that sufficient time was given to allow in-depth consideration of our stakeholders in relation to the key decisions made by the Board.\n\nThe Board agenda has strong links to the strategic objectives for the business and is set via a collaborative process between the Chair, Group Chief Executive and Company Secretary. The Board agenda programme ensures that strategic, operational, financial, human resources and corporate governance items are discussed at the appropriate time with additional deep dives into key strategic areas during the year. This ensures enough time is allocated to allow effective discussion.\n\nA separate strategy day, attended by members of the Executive Committee, is held during the year. The strategy day is held in the first half of the year, followed by the consideration of the strategic plan in the autumn and then the approval of the budget towards the end of the year./uni00A0\n\nSee more on our strategic priorities on pages 20 and 67 of this report.\n\nThe Group Chief Executive's report to the Board focuses on strategic and operational activities. A safety report is always the first matter he reports on at each meeting, with a focus on both employee behavioural safety and process safety issues. The CEO's report also covers the performance of each business unit, including sales and regional activity as well as competitor insights and performance. Market trends and opportunities are considered and dialogue with major customers and regulatory bodies discussed. Each quarter the Board receives comprehensive reports from members of the Executive Committee in relation to all aspects of the business, including market sectors, regional delivery, sustainability, operations, innovation, people, risk and functional updates. This is in addition to the deep dive sessions covered under the Board's programme of business.\n\nThe Group Finance Director presents reports on monthly and year to date sales performance, profit, cash flow, cost base, capital expenditure and outlook for the year. The CFO also reports during the year on performance against budget, dividends, treasury items, including liquidity, and keeps the Board abreast of investor discussions and feedback.\n\nThe Group General Counsel and Company Secretary updates the Board on changes to relevant laws, regulations and governance matters/uni00A0at each Board meeting. In addition, he takes responsibility for reporting on compliance and insurance matters.\n\n## Outside the boardroom/uni00A0\n\nThe Board were unable to undertake in-person site visits in 2021 due to ongoing UK and overseas Government travel restrictions. They were, however, able to participate in three virtual Board visits during the year, in Brazil, Spain and China. These virtual Board sessions included Town Halls with question and answer sessions and presentations from local management and operational employees. The presentations covered briefings on health and safety and key risks at each site as well as a review of the current performance (both financial and non-financial) and the future strategy in each country. Further detail of the virtual site visit to Iberchem as part of the Board strategy day is on page 66.\n\nIn addition to these site visits, an extensive programme of listening groups was undertaken and further information on these can be found on page 70.\n\nThe Executive Committee attended a two day strategy session on sustainability strategy, which the Senior Independent Director attended and reported back to the Board.\n\nThe Chair spends time interacting with the Executive Committee team between Board meetings; during 2021 each member of the Executive management team had monthly meetings with the Chair. This ensured that she was kept up to date on significant developments and emerging issues and opportunities, as well as forging good working relationships with the senior management team.\n\nThe Non-Executive Directors have direct access at any time to the Executive Directors, senior management teams and employees across the Group. This provides the opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of the Company's operations or to request information about specific areas. These interactions not only build connections with\n\nthe employees in the business, they also help provide the knowledge for Non-Executive Directors to provide constructive challenge at Board meetings./uni00A0Each of the Directors (excluding the new appointees) has a mentoring relationship with employees below the Executive Committee level. This will be extended to the two new Non-Executive Directors once they have completed their induction programme. The Executive Directors use the specific areas of expertise of the Non-Executive Directors as a source of ideas, experience, as well as challenge when developing strategic plans.\n\nThe Chair and Non-Executive Directors met without the Executive Directors present to allow an additional opportunity to discuss areas relevant to the operation of the Board. The Non-Executive Directors also met on their own, without the Chair.\n\nThe Board activities during the year are outlined on page 65. All these activities and outputs provide the context for future strategic decisions. References are made in this section to areas of the report where further information on the activities outlined below can be found.\n\n## Training\n\nAll Directors keep their knowledge and skills up to date and include training discussions with the Chair in their annual performance reviews. As required, professional advisers are invited to provide in-depth updates and the Board also receives updates on market trends, environmental, technological and social considerations when appropriate. The Company Secretary provides regular updates to the Board and its committees on regulatory and corporate governance matters. Our Directors receive training on their duties under section 172(1) of the Companies Act 2006 as part of their induction process from the Group's corporate lawyers. All Directors participate in online compliance training courses as required.",

The divestment will deliver transition into a focused Consumer Care and Life Sciences company. TB\n\nGiven the importance and impact of this decision, it was made over many months of deliberation by the Executive team and the Board and across numerous meetings during the year.\n\nThe Board considered the likely consequences of the decision in the long term, identified the stakeholders who may be affected, and had regard to their interests as part of the decision-making process. Initially, a detailed strategic review was undertaken that focused on the businesses and activities within PTIC that did not directly support the Consumer Care and Life Sciences sectors. The Board considered whether Croda was the best future owner of all the PTIC businesses within the context of opportunities to deploy more capital and resources within the higher returning Consumer Care and Life Sciences businesses. The review considered what ownership structure would best serve the PTIC business going forward, not only to create a stronger platform for its future growth, but importantly to provide a secure future for our employees within the business. Soundings were taken from our advisers and the investor community shareholders would support the strategic rationale for the separation,\n\nat the appropriate time and the Board gained comfort that our which was important in confirming the direction of travel for the strategic review.\n\nSuch a complex divestment required careful management of internal and external communications, talent and resources, and of interactions and interdependencies with other Group programmes to ensure the continued successful performance of the PTIC business, as well as the management of the process itself. Steering and project implementation processes were established to ensure the Executive team remained close to the views of those affected by all the decisions under consideration.\n\nExtensive and regular engagement by the Executive management team with our employees was undertaken. This was initially aimed at senior leaders, particularly those directly affected by the divestment, so they could absorb the news and raise concerns and questions prior\n\nthe wider sustainability team and regular updates throughout the year. See page 65.\n\n- \u00b7  The Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director provide updates at Board meetings on their interactions with key stakeholders, as well as updating Board members between meetings on any material issues that arise.\n- \u00b7  Comprehensive quarterly reports which cover/uni00A0risk, innovation, global operations including customer service, SHEQ and Sustainability, IT and Digital operations, legal and Company Secretarial/uni00A0and HR, culture and diversity.\n\nTom Brophy is Group General Counsel and Company Secretary\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto a wider all-employee announcement and to ensure they could then support the messaging. This helped reassure all our employees and enabled their views and concerns to be addressed throughout the process, which in turn minimised any disruption to our business in a time of uncertainty.\n\nTheir needs were mapped and communication plans addressing those needs were developed. This communication strategy included critical stakeholders such as works councils, unions, business partners and our pension trustees. A range of communication channels were utilised, ensuring our key stakeholders remained informed as the review progressed. Members of our Executive and Board held employee listening sessions during this time and were able to hear first-hand how employees were feeling about the strategic review and ensured areas of importance highlighted by employees were considered and reflected in the decisions that were made.\n\nThe Board and Executive team spent time reviewing the interested bidders to ensure they held similar values to Croda, which was an important factor for the employees moving with the business. The Board considered that under Cargill's ownership, the divested business and our talented, hardworking employees could look forward to a bright future.\n\nCompleting the sale in 2022 will enable us to meet our strategic and sustainability objectives, which will be to the advantage of all our stakeholders and support our shared Purpose to use Smart science to Improve Lives\u2122.",

        "page_content": "## Employee engagement\n\n## Listening to the Employee Voice\n\nThe Board engages directly with employees in several different ways, including 'Town Hall' meetings, both face-to-face and virtual, that incorporate Q&A sessions and by holding smaller listening groups. The Chair has regular one-to-one meetings with employees, as do other Directors whenever practicable.\n\nRegular pulse surveys have been held during the year which focus on specific issues. Recent surveys have gathered employees' views on inclusion, health and safety (including mental health) and culture. The results of these surveys provide invaluable information for the Board to gauge how employees feel on these important topics. For example, it is through such surveys that the Board was able to understand any concerns employees had during the pandemic whilst working from home and in returning to the workplace. These surveys are one input that the Board uses to help guide them in their decision making.\n\nInformation on employees is also received at Board meetings through management reports, with people KPIs in the HR report.\n\nEach Director has the opportunity, and is encouraged, to undertake site visits. Whilst face-to-face site visits remained a challenge during 2021 due to travel restrictions, the Board continued to engage with our sites\n\nthrough virtual site visits. These enabled Directors to meet a broad spectrum of employees from different departments. In addition to the Board's virtual strategy day session with the Iberchem team in Spain, two virtual visits were held during the year to Brazil, and China. These included health and safety presentations, town hall and listening groups and strategy presentations from the senior management. Each visit was attended by three Non-Executive Directors and feedback was given at the next Board meeting.\n\nAs well as holding virtual site visits, a number of listening group sessions were organised during the year. These sessions covered topics including Croda's response to the pandemic, the Group's strategy, the role of the Board and the Remuneration Committee, our sustainability programme and the effectiveness of the communication across the business. These sessions were used as a sounding board to understand employees' views and opinions for proposals, as well as providing time for employees to discuss other topics which they wanted to bring to the Board's attention. Such sessions are a mechanism to gain diversity of thought as well as enhancing the relationship of the Directors across a wider employee base.\n\nAnother employee voice route includes Speak Up reports, a summary of which are provided to the Audit Committee each year, including trends in the types of reports and regions reporters came from.\n\nA significant communications programme was undertaken as part of the sale of the majority of the Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals businesses and further information on this can be found on page 69.\n\nThe results and feedback of all the engagement with employees were shared and discussed by the Board. The Board also considers annually if the current framework continues to be effective.\n\nFeedback from 2020 concluded that engagement had been too UK focused and that a wider global voice should be heard. In 2021 the virtual overseas visits in Brazil and China included listening groups and there was global representation in all the other listening groups.\n\nThe Board considers that it has meaningful and genuine dialogue with employees and the correct breadth of coverage using the existing mechanisms. Croda is good at engagement and has an open culture. Site visits are valuable and result in candid discussions and the Board are looking forward to recommencing their face-to-face engagement during 2022.\n\n| Listening group date   | Countries attendees from                                          | Departments attendees from                                   | NED's that participated   |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| January 2021           | Global Representation Three sessions -  Americas, Asia and Europe | All functions                                                | Helena Ganczakowski       |\n| April 2021             | Italy (two sessions)                                              | R&D, Sales, Marketing, Logistics                             | Roberto Cirillo           |\n| June 2021              | Brazil                                                            | All functions                                                | Anita Frew                |\n| June 2021              | Brazil                                                            | All functions                                                | Keith Layden              |\n| June 2021              | Brazil                                                            | All functions                                                | Jacqui Ferguson           |\n| June 2021              | China                                                             | All functions                                                | John Ramsay               |\n| June 2021              | China                                                             | All functions                                                | Roberto Cirillo           |\n| June 2021              | China                                                             | All functions                                                | Helena Ganczakowski       |\n| November 2021          | Global representation Three sessions -  Americas, Asia and Europe | All functions, weighted towards  supply chain and operations | Anita Frew                |",

        "page_content": "## Investor engagement\n\n## Approach\n\nThe Board is committed to maintaining regular dialogue with investors and communicating in a clear and transparent manner. The investor engagement programme is led by the Investor Relations and Corporate Affairs Director and is a comprehensive programme compromising results events, investor roadshows, attendance at conferences, investor seminars and ad-hoc meetings.\n\nThe investor relations programme includes direct Board engagement through the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director. The Chair and other Non-Executive Directors also make themselves available to engage on topics such as governance, strategy, ESG performance, remuneration and other relevant topics. This gives the Board insight into investors' views, helping to inform key Board decisions and shape the future direction of the company. The Board is also regularly updated through monthly Board papers, management presentations and feedback from the investor relations team. This extends to commentary on the trading environment and Croda's performance relative to peers.\n\nOur AGM traditionally offers the opportunity for investors to engage directly with the Board and receive an update on business performance. As it was not possible to conduct this in the usual way in 2021 due to COVID-19 restrictions, we hosted a pre-AGM Question and Answer session offering\n\ninvestors the opportunity to engage directly with the Board. Results presentations are webcast live, with a replay facility available on our website, ensuring all investors have equal opportunity to participate in our results presentations. Investors can also sign up to receive regulatory alerts on our website making sure they are notified of any company updates.\n\nIn addition to engaging with investors, the Group engages with other key audiences such as analysts and ESG ratings agencies. We typically hold regular analyst calls following results, ensuring all covering analysts have the same opportunity to discuss our results.\n\n## Activities during the year\n\nInvestor engagement in 2021 was of a hybrid nature, predominantly compromising virtual meetings. Throughout 2021 we met with over 500 investors, covering a balance of both holders and non-holders. This includes all active fund managers among our top 30 shareholders. Over the last two years there has been an increase in engagement with fund managers outside the UK, particularly in the European Union, with the geographic breakdown of the meetings reflecting the global nature of our investor base.\n\nWe have continued to see increased engagement around ESG, with investors looking for increased disclosure and transparency. Sustainability is a core part of\n\n## Commonly asked investor questions\n\n## 1. What has the impact of raw material inflation been on Croda?\n\nInflation and price increases have been a key theme throughout the economy in 2021. Croda uses a diverse range of raw materials in production and we have experienced significant cost increases in 2021 averaging approximately 17% in the underlying business. We typically provide critical ingredients into formulations at low concentrations, so the cost of our ingredients in our customers' formulations in comparison to other ingredients is relatively small. As a result, we have broadly managed to pass on raw material cost increases to customers and have not seen any negative impact on our operating margins due to inflation.\n\n## 2. What is driving the recovery in Consumer Care?\n\nThe Consumer Care sector was created at the beginning of 2021 comprising Croda's leading global position in Personal Care and the high-growth Home Care and Iberchem fragrances and flavours businesses. Personal Care sales improved in early 2021, led by a resurgence in Beauty Actives. Sales and demand remained strong throughout the year with a recovery in 'going out' sales offsetting a moderation in customer restocking. Consumer Care is a sustainability driven sector and our innovation programme is driving growth as consumers seek 'green, clean and conscious' beauty products.\n\n## 3. How sustainable is revenue in lipid systems and how will this evolve?\n\nWe delivered approximately US$200m of sales of lipid systems in 2021, and expect a similar level of sales in 2022. Lipid drug delivery has significant potential for applications beyond COVID-19 in areas such as gene therapy and oncology. We expect to see an ongoing expansion in the range of applications for lipid systems in vaccines and therapeutic drugs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCroda's strategy and the Group has a well embedded sustainability programme. In March 2021 we hosted a virtual seminar to launch our 2020 sustainability report covering our non-financial performance in 2020 against key metrics and new interim milestones to ensure we achieve our Commitment to be Climate, Land and People positive by 2030. We saw good engagement from a range of audiences, with questions from institutional and private investors, ESG specialists and sell-side analysts. The seminar also led to further engagement with several follow up meetings and questions from investors.\n\nLooking forward to 2022 we will continue to proactively engage with investors with seminars and site visits to provide a better understanding of our business model and investment case.\n\n## 4. How will you utilise proceeds from the divestment of the majority of your PTIC operations?\n\nWe have a clear capital allocation policy which prioritises organic investment and we see exciting opportunities to invest in new capacity, product innovation and attractive geographic markets to support our growth in Consumer Care and Life Science markets. This organic investment will be complemented by inorganic investment, targeting knowledge intensive businesses in exciting niches that can accelerate our growth. In line with our capital allocation policy, we will continue to make regular returns to shareholders and should we not identify suitable opportunities to deploy capital with our leverage ratio remaining consistently below our targeted range, we would look to return capital to shareholders.\n\n## 5. How will the divestment of the majority of your PTIC operations impact the progress you are making implementing your sustainability strategy?\n\nWe have set out a bold sustainability commitment to be Climate Positive by 2030, and for 75% of our raw materials to be bio-based from 69% today. The operations being divested have a higher bio-based footprint than the Croda average, meaning that on divestment the Group average will fall, but we will retain our 75% target. Conversely, as the divested operations are more energy intensive, on divestment our scope 1 & 2 emissions intensity will fall, so we will re-baseline our carbon reduction targets accordingly. As a result, the divestment and the approach we are adopting to adjusting our targets, will enhance the positive impact of our sustainability strategy overall.",

They constructively challenge the Executive Directors and scrutinise the performance of management in meeting agreed goals and objectives and ensure all stakeholder views are considered.\n\n## Group Chief Executive\n\nThe Group Chief Executive has day-to-day responsibility for the effective management of the Group's business and for ensuring that Board decisions are implemented. He plays a key role in devising and reviewing Group strategies for discussion and approval by the Board. The Group Chief Executive is tasked with providing regular reports to the Board.\n\n## Non-Independent Non-Executive Director\n\nHaving served Croda for 33 years, the latter five of which were as a member of the Board, Keith Layden is not considered independent. However, because of that experience, Keith contributes strongly to the Board's culture and personality, and adds unique and valuable insight and constructive challenge.\n\n## Group Finance Director\n\nThe role of Group Finance Director is to bring a commercial and financial perspective to the boardroom. Working with the Group Chief Executive, he is responsible for the leadership and management of the Company according to the strategic direction set by the Board. He leads the global finance function and oversees the relationship with the investment community.\n\n## Group General Counsel and Company Secretary\n\nThe Group General Counsel and Company Secretary is secretary to the Board and its Committees. He works closely with the Chair in formulation of meeting agendas and yearly agenda programmes. He ensures that Board procedures are complied with and also advises on regulatory compliance and corporate governance. This role is to support the Chair and the Non-Executive Directors.\n\n## Meetings\n\nMembership of the Board and its Committees, and attendance (eligibility) at meetings held during the year ended 31 December 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Board   |       | Nomination   Committee   | Audit   Committee   | Remuneration  Committee     |\n|---------|-------|--------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 7 (7)   | 4 (4) | C                        |                     | Anita Frew (Chair) C        |\n| 7 (7)   | 4 (4) | 6 (6)                    |                     | Roberto Cirillo 6 (6)       |\n| 7 (7)   | 4 (4) | 6 (6)                    |                     | Jacqui Ferguson 6 (6)       |\n| 7 (7)   |       |                          |                     | Steve Foots                 |\n| 7 (7)   | 4 (4) | 6 (6)                    |                     | Helena Ganczakowski 6 (6) C |\n| 7 (7)   | 4 (4) |                          |                     | Keith Layden                |\n| 7 (7)   |       |                          |                     | Jez Maiden                  |\n| 7 (7)   | 4 (4) | 6 (6)                    | C                   | John Ramsay 6 (6)           |\n| 3 (3)   | 1 (1) | 1 (1)                    | 2 (2)               | Julie Kim                   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChair of the Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Where necessary, the Directors may take independent professional advice at the Company's expense. Papers are made available electronically one week in advance of meetings, which ensures that each Director has the time and resources to fulfil their duties. A resource centre within the web portal provides access to useful information about the Group, including corporate governance materials, finance and strategy information, Group policies and procedures, and information on topics such as risk and insurance. In order to build and increase the Non-Executive Directors' familiarity with, and understanding of, the Group's people, businesses and markets, senior managers regularly make presentations at Board meetings. Their understanding of the Group's operations is enhanced by regular business presentations and site visits whenever possible. At induction, and as requirements change, training is provided on governance, legal and regulatory matters. Online training is provided on competition law and anti-bribery and corruption. Specific training is provided when requested by the Directors. To remain up-to-date with wider issues the Directors are encouraged to participate in events hosted by external organisations to develop broader perspectives.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nA well-established process is in place whereby the Board regularly reviews and monitors potential conflicts of interests. Under the Company's Articles of Association, the non-conflicted Board members have authority to authorise a conflict or potential conflict of interest.\n\nDirectors holding significant commitments outside of the Company are required to disclose them prior to appointment and on an ongoing basis when there are any changes. Actual and potential conflicts of interest are included on a register which is maintained by the Company Secretary and reviewed annually.\n\nDuring the appointment process for the two new Non-Executive Directors, the candidate's other commitments were taken into account, in addition to whether or not a conflict or potential conflict would exist. In each case it was agreed that no potential conflict existed.\n\nDetails of the professional commitments of the Chair and the Non-Executive Directors are included in their biographies on pages 62 to 63. The Board is satisfied that these do not interfere or conflict with the performance of their duties for the Company.\n\n## Independence of Non-Executive Directors\n\nCroda complies with the Financial Reporting Council's Reporting Code in having experienced Non-Executive Directors who represent a source of advice, strong judgement and challenge to the Executive Directors. At present there are eight such Directors, including the Chair and the Senior Independent Director, each of whom has significant commercial experience. Details of their experience is on pages 62 to 63.\n\nThe independence of the Non-Executive Directors is kept under review to ensure continuing independence and objective judgement. The Chair was independent upon her appointment in 2015 and both the Chair as head of the Board and the Chief Executive as head of executive management have clearly defined roles. Further information on their roles is included on page 72. With the exception of Keith Layden, the Board considers that all Non-Executive Directors who served during the year are independent in character and judgement, with no relationships or circumstances that are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, their judgement. Keith Layden is not considered independent, having served as the Company's Chief Technology Officer prior to retirement from the Company and appointment as a Non-Executive Director in May 2017.\n\n## Board evaluation\n\nFollowing the previous years' external evaluation, the 2021 Board evaluation was conducted using questionnaires and reports facilitated by Lindstock. The questionnaires were developed by the Company Secretary and were set in consideration of the strategy and in line with best governance practice. These questionnaires were issued to the Board members, senior leaders and key advisors who regularly attend the Board and Committee meetings. Responses were on an anonymous basis. Lindstock collated the responses and prepared reports that summarised the findings and outlined key areas for discussion. The reports were then discussed at the Board and Committee meetings.\n\n## Evaluation outcomes\n\nThe Board's size, range of skiIIs, experience and level of diversity were rated highly. International diversity had been improved through the recent Board appointments. The value of further life sciences, consumer care and sustainability experience would be considered when the process for the succession of the Chair and the Senior Independent Director commenced.\n\nThe Board's testing and development of the strategy was rated highly overall as were the monitoring KPls provided to the Board. The understanding of the company's performance relative to competitors was identified as an area for continued review.\n\nThe Board's understanding of the views of major investors and stakeholders was rated highly. The Board's monitoring of culture was also rated highly, but it was concluded that there was always scope for even greater focus on this area.\n\nThe relationships amongst individual Board members and between the Board and management were rated very effective, as was the Board's relationship with the Chief Executive.\n\nThe Board's monitoring of the Company's health and safety performance was rated highly as was its understanding of the likelihood and impact of key risks. The Board's risk appetite was seen to be appropriate. The evaluation emphasised the need to continue to review past decisions to ensure learnings were incorporated into future decision making.\n\nThe Board will agree areas for improvement and monitoring. The progress in the key focus areas for 2021 can be found on page 67.\n\nThe Senior Independent Director met with the Chair to provide feedback on her performance following discussions with the other NonExecutive Directors and the Executive management to gather their views. It was agreed that the Chair was highly engaged and dedicated to her role. She creates a culture of trust, openness and debate, facilitating an atmosphere of challenge whilst encouraging the effective contribution of all Board members.\n\nThe Chair met and provided feedback to each Non-Executive Director and the Executive Directors. Following these discussions, the Chair was satisfied that all the Directors continued to be effective and demonstrate commitment to the role, including having time to attend all necessary meetings and to carry out all their duties.\n\n## Board re-election\n\nFollowing the individual performance assessments, the Board is satisfied that each Director continues to perform effectively, allocates sufficient time for their duties and remains fully committed to their role. Full biographies for the Directors are on pages 62 and 63.\n\nThe terms and conditions of appointment of Non-Executive Directors can be viewed at www.croda.com. Contracts for Executive and Non-Executive Directors can be inspected during normal business hours at the Company's registered office by contacting the Company Secretary and will also be available for inspection at the AGM.\n\nThe Directors will be proposed for election and re-election at the AGM on 20 May 2022 and details are in the Notice of Meeting.",

        "page_content": "## Appointment of Non-Executive Directors\n\n## Background\n\nAt the start of the year the Nomination Committee considered the composition of the Board and concluded that additional Health Care experience at Board level would be beneficial for the Company. In addition, the Committee recognised the benefit and value of having an even greater diversity on the Board, which had been a theme identified through the 2020 external board evaluation. As a result, the Committee concluded that a search for additional Non-Executive Directors should be undertaken and agreed to commence the recruitment process.\n\n## Nomination Committee process\n\n## 1. Search firm selection\n\nA sub-committee of the Nomination Committee, including the Chair, Chief Executive and Senior Non-Executive Director engaged with five search firms and met with each firm over two days with the aim of choosing one to recommend to the Nomination Committee. It was a requirement that the executive search firm must have signed up to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms. A key element of the search was to identify a firm that had deep understanding of the Life Sciences sector, and in particular Health Care. In addition, it was essential that the search firm could demonstrate they would be able to produce a longlist of candidates that were gender balanced and weighted towards ethnically diverse candidates. MWM Consulting was appointed following the tender process.\n\n## 2. NED specification\n\nThe Committee was asked to consider and approve a specification for the new Non-Executive position.\n\nThe specification included key essential and desirable experience for the role. These included experience of desired markets, fast-paced change, emerging markets and industries where health and safety had been paramount. The specification also included personal qualities and specific attributes aligned to Croda's culture, values and behaviours.\n\n## 3. Stages of the selection process\n\nFollowing selection of the search firm a candidate long list was identified by the end of March 2021. All the Committee received the long list and were able to provide feedback. A short list was identified by a sub-committee including the Chair, Chief Executive and Senior Non-Executive Director and interviews were conducted in April and May 2021.\n\n- a. First interview - The Chair and Chief Executive interviewed the short listed candidates separately and the Senior Non-Executive Director supported by another NED also interviewed candidates together. Two candidates were progressed through to the second interview stage.\n- b. Second interviews - All Committee members and the Company Secretary then met with the two final candidates. This stage included discussions around their interest in the role, current time commitments and any potential conflicts of interest.\n- c. Appointment - The sub-committee of the Nomination Committee met and, having reviewed the feedback, and the skills sets of the candidates against the candidate specification and skills matrix, concluded that an offer be extended to both candidates, increasing the size of the Board from eight to 10 Directors. Julie Kim joined the Board on 1 September 2021 and Nawal Owzen on the 1 February 2022. Their biographies can be found on page 63.\n\n## Stakeholder considerations.\n\nStrategy - Appointing Board members with Health Care business experience, experience of fast-paced change and emerging markets supports the delivery of the Croda strategy and the long-term success of the business. Further information on the strategy can be found on pages 20 and 21. The appointments will also bring in-depth understanding of a wide of stakeholders.\n\n## Non-Executive Directors' Tenure\n\nValues - The new Non-Executive Directors appointed have the skills and behaviours that will provide a constructive and empathetic approach, the ability to promote the culture and Croda's sustainability ethos alongside their considerable professional experience.\n\nDiversity - The new appointments increase the diversity of the Board, including gender, ethnicity, nationality and tenure. Different views bring broader debate and can lead to better decisions, which reflect the concerns of all the stakeholders and lead to greater commercial success.\n\nKey\n\n| John Ramsay         | Anita Frew      |\n|---------------------|-----------------|\n| Julie Kim           | Jacqui Ferguson |\n| Keith Layden        | Roberto Cirillo |\n| Helena Ganczakowski | Nawal Ouzren    |\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Dear fellow shareholder,\n\nI am pleased to present the Nomination Committee report for the year ended December 2021.\n\n## Main activities and priorities in 2021\n\n## Board changes\n\nEach year the Nomination Committee considers the composition of the Board and in terms of the balance of skills, experience, length of service and wider diversity considerations. The Guidance on Board effectiveness comments that boards are more likely to make good decisions and maximise opportunities for long-term success if their members collectively have the right balance of skills, experience, knowledge and independence.\n\nAs a result of this review early in 2021,and following a comprehensive recruitment process, two new appointments have been made to the Board and details of the activities undertaken by the Committee in relation to these appointments are outlined on page 75.\n\nOn 1 September 2021, Julie Kim was appointed as a Non-Executive Director, bringing 25 years' experience of health care markets across Europe, Asia and Latin America. Julie is currently President of Plasma-Derived Therapies at Takeda Pharmaceutical, a global, R&D driven biopharmaceuticals company. Then on 1 February 2022, we also welcomed Nawal Ouzren, currently CEO of biopharmaceutical company Sensorion, to the Board, adding further health care expertise through her first-hand experience of biologics and novel gene therapies.\n\nBoth appointments add relevant experience as we look to access higher growth markets in Health Care, and in regions beyond Europe and North America. They also bring even greater diversity to the Board in terms of gender, ethnicity and nationality. I am pleased to have fulfilled our commitment to meeting the requirements of the Parker Review on ethnic diversity and achieving full gender balance on the Board in line with the Hampton-Alexander Review. Our Board diversity policy seeks to maintain this position going forward.\n\nHelena Ganczakowski's and my own appointment were considered by the Committee and both terms were extended by another year in line with the Nomination Committee policy that once a Non-Executive Director has served six years, any extension to their term would be on a year-by-year basis. Roberto Cirillo and Jacqui Ferguson having completed their first three year terms, were also reappointed for a further three years.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nHaving a diverse and talented group of people\n\nat all levels of Croda is essential for delivering success. The Board supports the recommendations of the Hampton-Alexander and Parker Reviews in relation to gender and ethnic diversity. I am pleased that we have now achieved a position of 50% of women on the Board (including female Directors as Chair and Senior Independent Director) and our new appointments to the Board fulfil the\n\nrequirements of the Parker Review.\n\nThe gender balance on Executive Committee and senior management teams (direct reports to the Executive Committee) by 31 December 2021 stood at 36 % female. We continued to increase the diversity of our leaders below Board and Executive Committee level. 27% of our Top 56 employees are female, with the Top 56 made up of employees across eleven nationalities. There continues to be work to do to create further diversity and the gender balance in the underlying management teams and this will take a number of years.\n\nFurther information on our current people initiatives and diversity and inclusion and our ambitions in these areas can be found on pages 36 and 37 of this report. The Committee and the Board receives reports from the Group HR Director on these initiatives throughout the year. Members of the senior management team and potential future leaders are given the opportunity to present to the Board whenever the opportunity arises.\n\nA copy of our Board Diversity Policy, which is regularly reviewed by the Board, is available in the corporate governance section at www.croda.com. For more information on our Board see the Directors Biographies on pages 62 and 63.\n\n## Succession planning\n\nThe Committee, supported by HR, reviewed the development plans for the Board and each Executive Committee member. They also reviewed the talent and succession planning within the Group. Succession plans for sector, region and function, and the plan to improve female talent in senior positions are all well established.\n\nFollowing the changes made in 2020 to the Executive Committee structure, a further review was undertaken in advance of the departure of Maarten Heybroek, President Consumer Care and the retirement of Stuart Arnott, President of Sustainability to ensure we could continue to deliver our ambitious strategy.\n\nFollowing an external search conducted by Egon Zehnder, Daniele Piergentilli was appointed to the role of President of Life Sciences. Daniele's appointment strengthens Croda's ability to take advantage of the opportunities in Life Sciences which is in line with our strategy. Daniele has a strong background in Health Care at BASF, where he worked for 23 years in a number of sales, marketing and R&D roles.\n\nDavid Shannon, who was Senior VP North America was appointed to the role of President Consumer Care. David has been with Croda for 24 years working in both regional and sector roles in Personal Care, Health Care and Crop Care. He has deep customer knowledge and a network of close relationships across Croda. David was appointed following an open internal process.\n\nThe opportunity was also taken to strengthen the Sustainability team to further support our strong strategic commitment to sustainability. Phil Ruxton (Vice President Sustainability) was appointed as Chief Sustainability Officer reporting into Nick Challoner, Chief Scientific Officer.\n\nAll these changes were proactively planned and managed and contributions from all these individuals can be found throughout this report.\n\n## Director induction\n\nThe Company provides new Directors with a comprehensive and tailored induction process. One of the first sessions attended is a health and safety briefing, and the induction schedule includes meetings with members of the Board and Executive Committee, meetings with key senior managers and the Group's audit partner and other key advisers. Induction programmes are developed by the Group's Company Secretarial department and discussions start well in advance of the appointment date to tailor the experience to the existing knowledge and experience. New Directors are provided with external training that addresses their role and duties as a Director of a quoted public company.\n\nAll new Directors are given access to our electronic Board papers which provide easy and immediate access to key documents including the previous twelve month's Board and Committee papers, recent reports from the external Auditor; the Group's risk register and Schedule of Principal Risks; the latest budget and strategic plan; recent sell-side analyst reports and feedback from our stakeholder engagement programmes; information on our sustainability initiatives and matters reserved for the Board and the Committee terms of reference and other key policies. This information is supplemented by country and site tours and we expect these to recommence in 2022.\n\n## Other activities of the Committee\n\nThe Committee reviewed the time commitment of the Non-Executive Directors. This is assessed before appointment and on an annual basis. During the year, I became a Non-Executive Director and Chair of Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc. Since the year end John Ramsay had been appointed as a Non-Executive Director of Babcock International Group Plc. The Committee considered each appointment and concluded that these appointments would not impact on our commitment and availability to Croda. It was satisfied that all the Non-Executive Directors remain able to commit the required time for the proper performance of their duties.\n\nThe Committee considered and concluded that, except for Keith Layden, all Non-Executive Directors continue to fulfil the criteria of independence. As Keith was formerly an Executive Director of the Company, he is not currently considered to be independent.\n\nThe annual Committee evaluation was conducted using questionnaires considering the Committee's operations, oversight and progress during the year. The evaluation confirmed that the Committee continued to be well led and excellent progress had been made with the Board appointments during the year. Positive progress had been made developing talent and increasing gender balance. Going forward the oversight on diversity and inclusion needed to be maintained and monitored.\n\nAnita Frew Chair of the Nomination Committee\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Audit, risk and internal control\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable/uni00A0\n\nTo assist the Board in determining whether the Annual Report was fair, balanced and understandable, the annual report team prepared a Board paper that, amongst other things, reviewed the process of preparation of the report, the controls in place to ensure consistency and reliability of the underlying information, identified the material positive and negative matters referred to in the report to ensure balanced content and provided details of the level of senior level oversight of the content of the report.\n\nThe Annual Report and Accounts process is designed to give the Board enough time to assess whether it is fair, balanced and understandable, as required by the Code. The key themes and messages to be included in the Annual Report and Accounts are considered by the Board early in the process.\n\nThe Board considered whether the Annual Report and Accounts contained the necessary information for shareholders to assess the Company's position and performance, business model and strategy. The Directors received a full draft of the Annual Report and provided feedback. This review ensures that each Director has an opportunity to highlight any areas requiring further clarity as well as suggesting issues and areas that were not adequately covered or on which the report may have placed too much emphasis.\n\nThe key messages in the narrative in the Strategic Report and Governance sections of the Annual Report and Accounts were reviewed to ensure they were consistent with the financial reporting contained in the financial statements. The Board believed that clear explanations had been provided for the KPIs.\n\nThe Board reviewed whether the Annual Report and Accounts disclosed the successes and the challenges that had been faced in the period and that the narrative and analysis effectively balanced the information needs and interests of each of our key stakeholder groups./uni00A0In particular the Board considered if the explanation of the impact of COVID-19 and the additional sustainability disclosures included this year had any impact on the balance and clarity of the Annual Report and Accounts.\n\nThe framework and layout were considered to be clear and coherent, with a consistent tone throughout and clearly signposted linkage between all sections, in a manner that reflected a comprehensive narrative and highlighted the key messages appropriately throughout.\n\nFollowing this assessment, the Board was of the opinion that the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts are representative of the year and present a fair, balanced and understandable overview, providing the necessary information for shareholders to assess the Group's position, performance, business model and strategy./uni00A0\n\nA full statement of Directors' responsibilities can be found on page 111./uni00A0\n\n## Risk management and internal control\n\nThe Board acknowledges its responsibility for ensuing the maintenance of a sound system of internal controls and risk management, in accordance with the guidance set out in the Financial Reporting Council's Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial Business reporting 2014, and in the Corporate Governance Code itself.\n\nExecutive management have established an organisational structure with clear operating procedures, lines of responsibility and delegated authority which was reviewed by the Board (page 73). In particular, there are clear procedures and defined authorities for the following:\n\n## Financial reporting and financial statements review\n\nPolicies and procedures governing the financial reporting process and preparation of the financial statements are owned by the Group Finance Director and clearly and transparently communicated through the Group Policies system. In order to assess the financial statements, the Audit Committee regularly reviews reports from members of the finance team and external audit who are invited to attend the Committee's meetings. When conducting its review the Committee considers material accounting assumptions and estimates made by management, any significant judgements or key audit matters identified by the external auditor (pages 113 to 114 Auditor report), compliance with relevant accounting standards and other regulatory reporting requirements, including the UK Corporate Governance code, and the accounting policies and procedures applied (see page 80 Audit Committee report).\n\n## Internal audit function\n\nThe internal audit function is a key element of the Group's corporate governance framework. Its role is to provide independent and objective assurance, advice and insight on governance, risk management and internal controls to the Board and Audit Committee and the Group. It supports the Group's strategy and objectives by evaluating and assessing the effectiveness of risk management systems, business policies and procedures, system and key internal controls. In reporting on their reviews, internal audit makes recommendations to address issues and improve processes. Once recommendations are agreed with management, the internal audit function monitors their implementation and reports to the Audit Committee on progress at every meeting. See page 81 Audit Committee report.\n\n## Capital investment\n\nThe Finance Committee (a subcommittee of the Executive Committee) operate a clearly defined capital expenditure process including detailed\n\nbusiness plan appraisal, risk analysis and authorisation. The Global Capital Project Director has developed a framework for managing major capital expenditure, and post-investment review processes are completed by internal audit (at the Audit Committee's request).\n\n## Business risk management\n\nAs described on page 50 the Executive Committee has established an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing emerging and principal risks. The Board receives updates on principal risks and risk appetite on an annual basis (page 66) and the Audit Committee receives reports from internal audit on the effectiveness of mitigating controls in place over selected principal risks at each meeting. The Risk Management steering group, a subcommittee of the Executive Committee (page 73), meets on a quarterly basis to monitor and review both current and emerging risks.\n\n## Internal Controls\n\nThere is a documented framework of required internal controls for business processes, IT, safety and quality, which form part of our 'business as usual' activities and which are documented in controls manuals. Policies governing the internal controls are documented in the Group Policies system, which is available online to all employees, and each group policy is owned by a member of the Executive Committee. Confirmation that the controls are being adhered to is the responsibility of managers, who together with their teams complete an annual self-assessment process against all controls which provides a snapshot of the control environment at the start of the year. Compliance with controls is tested by the internal audit team as part of their annual plan of work approved by the Audit Committee each year (page 81), as well as being tested by other internal assurance providers.\n\nThe Board discharged its responsibility for monitoring the operational effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems throughout the year using a process which involved:\n\n- \u00b7  Delegation of review of systems of risk management and internal control to the Audit Committee, whose activities are described in detail on pages 80 to 81\n- \u00b7  Receipt of written confirmations from senior management\n- \u00b7  Board review of the report on significant control weaknesses (page 66)\n- \u00b7  Annual review of risk appetite statements and principal risks (page 51)\n\nThese processes have been in place for the full financial year up to the date on which the financial statements were approved by the Board. The systems are designed to mitigate, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.",

This report provides shareholders with an overview of the work undertaken by the Committee and the key areas considered when discharging its responsibilities and providing assurance on the integrity of the annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nThe ongoing pandemic has meant that the financial reporting and audit process had to continue to adapt, reflecting the lessons learnt from the 2020 audit process. The majority of the external audit has again been delivered remotely, while more of the internal audit programme was delivered in-person. I received regular updates from the Group Finance Director, the wider global finance team, the Lead Audit Partner and the VP Risk and Assurance. The dedication and commitment from the Croda executive management team, the audit teams and Croda employees has been exceptional and robust audit processes were delivered once again.\n\n## Committee membership and attendance\n\nThe composition of the Committee at the end of the year comprised of five independent Non-Executive Directors. Julie Kim joined the Board and Committee on 1 September 2021 and post year end Nawal Ouzren was appointed to the Board and Committee on 1 February 2022. The experience of each Board member is outlined on pages 62 and 63. The Board considers all members of the Audit Committee have the appropriate and relevant level of experience in financial matters as well as a diverse and broad range of competence relevant to the sector focus and the future strategic direction of the Group.\n\nThese skills and my own experience of over 30 years in international finance and extensive experience as an audit committee chair provides the Board with assurance that the Committee has the appropriate skills and breadth and depth of experience to ensure that it can be fully effective. It also meets the Code requirements that at least one member has significant, recent and relevant financial experience.\n\nThe Chair of the Board, Keith Layden (a Non-Executive Director), the Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, the Group Financial Controller, the VP Risk and Assurance (who leads the internal audit function) and representatives from the external and internal auditors attend the meetings by invitation.\n\nThe Committee met on six occasions during the year and has met twice since the financial year end. The meetings were held in advance of the Board and I then provided a report of the key matters that were discussed and any emerging areas that may require additional focus. A programme of business is agreed at the start of the year and it is reviewed and updated to ensure any additional focus areas identified are considered.\n\nTo ensure the work of the Committee remains focused on the key and emerging issues, I regularly meet and speak separately with the Group Finance Director, Group Financial Controller, the VP Risk and Assurance and the internal and external auditors. Meetings without the Executive present are also held with the internal and external auditors to facilitate open dialogue and assurance. Before each Audit Committee meeting, I also meet with the external auditors, the Group Finance Director, the Group Financial Controller and the VP Risk and Assurance to discuss control and compliance issues generally and specifically the detail of the year end and half year results, accounting judgements and disclosures. This helps me to ensure there is a shared understanding of the key issues, technical matters and judgements and to make sure sufficient time is devoted to them at the meetings.\n\n## Committee evaluation\n\nThe Committee performance was assessed as part of the internal annual Board evaluation process (see page 74 for further detail on the process). The output of the evaluation was considered by the Committee in January 2022.\n\nThe effectiveness with which the Audit Committee uses its time was rated very highly with all agenda items being covered with appropriate time allowed for more in-depth discussion when required. The Chair was seen to demonstrate effective leadership and rated highly in ensuring all opinions are heard and considered.\n\nRelationships between the Committee and Croda management were considered very effective with the Audit Committee providing both support and challenge. Following the rotation of KPMG's lead audit partner at the start of 2021 due to an organisation change in KPMG, the Committee was satisfied that the leadership of the global audit continued to be effective. Proactive engagement by the lead audit partner during Committee meetings was, however, encouraged to ensure appropriate input and challenge was given during the Committee's deliberations and discussions, particularly in areas of financial reporting issues and judgements.\n\nAgenda coverage through the year was seen as full and appropriate. Committee members were well prepared for meetings, engendering informed discussions and constructive debate. Overall, the evaluation concluded that the Committee was operating effectively.\n\nFour focus areas for 2022 were identified and these are summarised on page 81.\n\n## Committee activity in 2021\n\nThe Committee's main business as usual activities, as well as the focus areas, and an estimate of the proportion of time spent on them, are detailed below.\n\n## Financial reporting (25%)\n\n## The Committee:\n\n- \u00b7  Monitored the Group's financial statements and results announcements, including the Annual Report and the interim statement, and with support from the external auditors, reviewed those items in the Group's financial statements that had the potential to significantly impact reporting. The Committee challenged management on the statements and was satisfied with the explanations provided. Consideration was given to the appropriateness of accounting policies, critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation of uncertainty. Recommendations were made to the Board, supporting the half and full-year accounts and financial statements.\n- \u00b7  Reviewed the Group's external reporting framework and use of Alternate Performance Measures (APMs) to assess ongoing appropriateness. The Committee was satisfied that the APM's reviewed were consistent with market practice of both the peer group and the wider FTSE 100 companies, and that disclosure and reconciliation to statutory measures was appropriate.\n- \u00b7  In conjunction with the Board, reviewed the financial modelling and stress testing conducted for the going concern assessment. A recommendation was made to the Board to support the going concern statement. Further information can be found on page 125.\n- \u00b7  Reviewed the viability assessment process undertaken in support of the long-term viability statement, based on plausible scenarios arising from key risks and their impact on headroom and debt covenants. The Committee challenged the assumptions and scenarios noting the effect they would have during the viability period. Further information can be found on pages 56 to 57.\n- \u00b7  Undertook regular reviews of the Group's litigation. The Committee receives reports twice a year from the Group General Counsel",

These are set out below.\n\nPensions: The Committee monitored the Group's pension arrangements, in particular the funding of the defined benefit plans in the UK, the US and the Netherlands, which are sensitive to assumptions made in respect of discount rates, salary increases and inflation.\n\nThe Group engages external actuarial specialists. The Committee reviewed the actuarial assumptions used and compared them with those used by other companies. The external auditors also challenged the benchmark assumptions applied and conducted sensitivity analysis. The Committee considered this work and found the assumptions to be reasonable.\n\nThe Committee also assessed the considerations in relation to the transfer of the Netherlands defined benefit pension scheme to a collective defined contribution arrangement, resulting in the settlement of the scheme's assets and liabilities of \u00a3207.1m and a corresponding gain of \u00a311.2m. After review, the Committee was satisfied with the settlement accounting in the financial statements.\n\nGoodwill impairment: The strategy of the Group includes acquiring new technologies and businesses operating in adjacent markets. 2021\n\nsaw two acquisitions for Croda. As a result, goodwill represents a significant asset value on the balance sheet of \u00a3852.0m out of total net assets of \u00a31,765.9m at 31 December 2021.\n\nThe Committee completed its annual impairment review of the carrying value of goodwill, as prepared by management, including the detailed sensitivity analysis to a number of underlying assumptions, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19, and the broader consequences on the markets in which the Group operates. The Committee assessed the methodologies used and the adequacy of the management disclosures. Particular attention was given to Iberchem's cash generating units, which had the smallest headroom between their carrying values and value in use. The Committee reviewed the methodology adopted to evaluate the risk of goodwill impairment. After challenge, the Committee was satisfied that the assumptions were reasonable and that no impairments were necessary; however, enhanced disclosure was agreed to be appropriate, given the sensitivity of the calculations to certain assumptions.\n\nImpact of the divestment of the majority of PTIC: On 22 December 2021, the Group announced an agreement to dispose of the majority of the PTIC businesses and is currently working with the acquirer on the process to separate the businesses, with completion of the divestment expected in summer 2022.\n\nThe Committee assessed the key accounting considerations, and after challenge, was satisfied that the disposal group did not meet the requirements to be classified as held-forsale as at 31 December 2021.\n\nParent Company's carrying value of investments in subsidiaries and intercompany receivables: The Committee considered the carrying amount of parent Company's investments in subsidiaries and intercompany debtors, held at cost less impairment, representing 98% of parent Company's total assets (2020: 99%).\n\nThe recoverability of these balances is not considered judgemental; however, they are the most significant component of the parent Company balance sheet and therefore require additional consideration as part of preparing the financial statements. This included comparing the carrying amount with the respective subsidiary's net asset value, profitability and cash generation. After review, the Committee was satisfied that the recoverability of these balances was acceptable, and no impairments were necessary.\n\n## Internal audit and risk management\n\nI met with the Vice President Risk and Assurance several times during the year outside of the formal meetings to discuss the performance and output of the internal audit function and aspects of risk management.

Particular focus was addressed to those areas where there was a major divergence between the outcome of the internal audit and the scoring of the selfassessment questionnaire, completed annually by each business unit. In these instances, the Committee challenged management as to what actions it was taking to minimise the chances of divergences arising in the future.\n\nIn January, the Committee conducted its annual review of the internal audit function, including its approach to audit planning and risk assessment, communication within the business and with the Committee and its relationship with the external auditors. Senior management feedback from sites included in the 2021 audit programme is gathered by questionnaire to support this process. These did not highlight any significant areas for development. In the light of the continuing requirement for virtual audits in 2021, the Committee was pleased with progress.\n\nDetails on how the Business monitors risk and how it implements its risk management framework are set out on pages 50 to 55.\n\n## External auditors' effectiveness\n\nDuring the year, the Committee assessed the effectiveness of KPMG as Group external auditor. To assist in the assessment, the Committee considered the quality of reports from KPMG and the additional insights provided by the audit team, particularly at partner level.\n\nIt took account of the views of the Group Finance Director and Group Financial Controller, who had discussed subsidiary component audits with local audit partners, to gauge the quality of the team and knowledge and understanding of the business. The Committee also considered how well the auditor assessed key accounting and audit judgements and the way it applied constructive challenge and professional scepticism in dealing with management.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the output from a questionnaire completed by senior members of the finance team to obtain their views on KPMG's effectiveness in carrying out the 2021 audit. The questionnaire covered:\n\n- \u00b7  Quality of planning, delivery and execution of the audit.\n- \u00b7  Quality and knowledge of the audit team.\n- \u00b7  Effectiveness of communications between management and the audit team.\n- \u00b7  Robustness of the audit, including the audit team's ability to challenge management as well as demonstrate professional scepticism and independence.\n\nFollowing the review, the Committee concluded that the audit was effective and overall the Committee was satisfied with the performance of KPMG.\n\nCroda is in compliance with the Statutory Audit Services Order 2014. We undertook an audit tender in 2017 and the Board appointed KPMG as external auditor, with Chris Hearld as the Lead Audit Partner. The first year to be audited by KPMG was the year ended 31 December 2018. Following an organisational change in KPMG, Chris Hearld stepped down as Lead Audit Partner following the AGM 2021 and was succeeded by Ian Griffiths.\n\n## Ethical compliance review\n\nUnder its terms of reference, the Committee is tasked with an annual review of the Company's anti-bribery and corruption, fraud and whistleblowing procedures. In 2021, the Committee's review of these matters consisted of receiving reports and presentations from the executive owner of the procedures. The Committee was satisfied that the design and focus of the ethics programme took account of the Company's increasing presence in emerging economies, which could often pose elevated compliance and reputational risks.\n\nThe Committee discussed the progress of integrating Iberchem and other recently acquired companies within the Group's ethics programme and were comfortable with the work undertaken and with the level the engagement by the newly acquired businesses.\n\nThe Committee considered that the work of the ethics committee in its robust oversight of the development and reinforcement of the Group's ethics strategy and considered that it was demonstrative of the top-level commitment to anti-bribery by the executive team. The Group had 48 ethical risk assessments in place at the site level, which accurately recorded detailed assessments of the local bribery risk.\n\n## External auditor's independence\n\nThe Committee and the Board place great emphasis on the objectivity of the Group's external auditors in reporting to shareholders.\n\nOur Group policy on the provision of non-audit services by external auditors, which is on our website www.croda.com, sets out permitted and prohibited non-audit services and the controls over assignments awarded to the external auditor to ensure that audit independence is not compromised and the provision of such services do not impair the external auditor's objectivity. KPMG have not been required to terminate any services that would not be permissible under the Standard.\n\nIn 2021, non-audit fees were \u00a30.1m, significantly less than the total audit fees of \u00a31.7m; the non-audit to audit fees ratio stands at 0.1:1.\n\nThe Committee undertook its annual review of the Group's policies relating to external audit, including the policy that governs how and when employees and former employees of the Group's auditors can be employed by the Company. No changes were made. The Committee also reviewed and accepted KPMG's Independence letter which annually confirms their independence and compliance with the Financial Reporting Council's (FRC) ethical standard.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee agreed that KPMG were independent.\n\n## External auditor reappointment\n\nAs noted above, the Committee recommended to the Board that KPMG be offered for re-election at the forthcoming AGM.\n\nI will be available at the shareholder engagement event to respond to any questions shareholders may raise on the Committee's activities in the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJohn Ramsay\n\nChair of the Audit Committee\n\nThe recently updated ethical compliance manual had been effective in proceduralising the ethics programme, and had been supplemented with practical 'how to do' guidance notes. Training programmes continued to operate effectively, with over 1,000 employees undertaking training during the year (online or face-toface). The Group's Speak Up line was working effectively, and the Committee were satisfied that the procedure for investigating reports was robust and being undertaken by independent experts. During 2021, 93 reports were made using the Speak Up line and every report had been investigated with no serious allegations having been substantiated.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the KPIs that tracked and monitored how the ethics programme was embedded and were used as leading and lagging indicators of ethical risks.\n\nThe Committee conducted a review of the Group's fraud policy and procedures - with no changes being required.

Chair's letter\n\nOn behalf of the Board and the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to present Croda's Directors' Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2021. I would like to thank my colleagues for their engagement throughout the year, and to welcome Julie Kim as a new member of the Committee in 2021 and Nawal Ouzren who joined the Committee in February 2022.\n\nThe Committee believes that Croda's remuneration approach plays a key role in the continued achievement of the Group's strategic objectives and in the delivery of sustainable, profitable growth. In 2019 we reviewed and updated our policy to ensure ongoing alignment\n\nto Croda's evolving ambition and received 97.6% votes in favour. Last year we were pleased to receive 98.8% votes in favour of the 2020 Remuneration Report.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is not proposing any material changes to the operation of the policy in 2022, being satisfied with both the outcome of the 2019 review and subsequent minor changes made last year.\n\n## Continued strong progress\n\nI am pleased to confirm that Croda continues to progress successfully in line with its strategy, with excellent, profitable growth across all sectors. Recent acquisitions have been successfully incorporated, opening up new fast growth markets, and vigorous progress has been made in building the Life Sciences platform. The full year financial results were very strong, with reported sales up 36%, driven by organic growth and acquisitions, and with improving margin driving excellent profit growth.\n\nThis pleasing performance was delivered despite the ongoing challenges of COVID-19 where we continued to balance the needs of all our stakeholders while always ensuring the health and safety of our employees. As we reported last year, in managing COVID-19, we have not made anyone redundant or furloughed any employees and have protected pay and benefits, including for those unable to work normally due to the need to self-isolate or work from home. We also provided support for our suppliers and customers, where appropriate, and continued to pay dividends for our shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCroda's remuneration approach plays a key role in the continued achievement of the Group's strategic objectives and in the delivery of sustainable, profitable growth.'\n\n## Dr Helena Ganczakowski\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee\n\n## Alignment to strategic objectives\n\nCroda's strategy continues to focus on consistently delivering sustainable, profitable growth by providing innovative, sustainable solutions to our customers consistent with our Purpose: Smart science to improve lives TM .\n\nDuring 2021 we conducted a strategic review of our Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals (PTIC) businesses to decide on the best ownership structure going forward. The conclusion of this review was to sell the majority of the PTIC businesses to Cargill, a company which has a distinguished history and strong values.\n\nUnder Cargill's ownership, PTIC and its employees will benefit from further investment which will enable the business and employees to capture new growth opportunities and flourish.\n\nIn March 2021 we acquired Alban Muller, a leader in the creation and supply of natural and botanical ingredients for the global beauty industry, and in June 2021 our wholly owned Iberchem subsidiary successfully completed the acquisition of Parfex S.A., a fine fragrance business based in Grasse, France. These acquisitions, alongside Iberchem and Avanti in 2020, all represent strong alignment to our objective of transitioning to a pure-play Life Sciences and Consumer Care company.\n\nDelivering sustainable, profitable growth is directly reflected in our performance measures and stretching targets. The Group Profit Incentive Bonus Scheme (senior annual Bonus Plan) is based on a single operating profit metric with no pay-out unless the previous year's outcome is exceeded.",

        "page_content": "For the longer-term Performance Share Plan\n\n(PSP), 35% of the award is based on earnings per share (EPS) growth and 35% is based on relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance against a bespoke group of our most relevant competitors. 30% of the 2022 award will continue to be based on sustainability metrics. Within this, 15% will be based on our innovation metric, New and Protected Products (NPP); those products that will drive our future growth. Innovating sustainably is core to Croda's success, and we continue to focus management on the delivery of this. The remaining 15% will be focused on selected KPIs aligned to the delivery of our 'Climate Positive' and 'People Positive' sustainability commitments. We have also revised our EVA underpin to a more discretionary basis following the divestment of the majority of the PTIC businesses.\n\nPerformance is always considered holistically; each year the Committee applies a Discretion Framework to satisfy itself that the outcome in terms of primary performance metrics has not been to the detriment of other measures of corporate performance. Health & safety always remains a key metric of particular focus in this review.\n\n## Workforce engagement\n\nIn 2021 I met with a cross section of employees through a series of listening groups in Asia, the Americas and Western Europe. Participants expressed their appreciation at the content and openness of the sessions which provided me with valuable feedback on a broad range of reward topics, including executive remuneration. In addition, there is a dedicated email address where employees can communicate with me directly and my Board colleagues also held listening groups throughout 2021 covering a range of topics including reward.\n\nThe Committee receives regular updates on employees' global terms and conditions, and we are made aware of any significant policy changes impacting employees. In 2021 we were pleased to note that flexible working was extended across the business including the facilitation of increased home working and flexible hours. The pay and benefits of employees that choose to work flexibly are maintained in full reflecting our belief that flexible working enhances productivity.\n\nIn response to COVID-19 we also continued our wellbeing initiatives; all sites offered targeted activities; some have been local one-off events and others are more broadly applicable such as the availability of Employee Assistance Programmes globally. We continued to use our online recognition programme in North America and Latin America and our Asia colleagues launched their own programme, 'Kudos!'.\n\n## Alignment of executive reward with the wider workforce\n\nOur 'One Croda' culture drives focus on the alignment of executive reward with the wider workforce. In 2021 we launched a 'Free Share Plan' for all of our employees who are not\n\neligible to receive the senior annual Bonus Plan. As the senior annual Bonus Plan paid out for 2021, every employee globally in the Free Share Plan, around 5,150 in total, will receive ten Croda shares or the cash equivalent, payable in May 2022. This Plan is in addition to other reward plans offered at a local level.\n\nIn 2018 we gained accreditation in the UK as a Living Wage Employer from the Living Wage Foundation. In 2021 we extended this globally to complete an assessment of all employees worldwide, in partnership with the Fair Wage Network, establishing a Living Wage in each of the countries in which we operate and ensuring all employees receive this as a minimum. Our target for 2022 is to ensure that this is also applied to all of our regularly employed contractors.\n\nIn line with our 'One Croda' culture, our senior leaders all share the same performance metrics for the senior annual Bonus Plan and PSP. Around 510 employees participate in the senior annual Bonus Plan and 66 of these are also in the PSP. We believe that this focuses our leadership on working together globally to deliver the best overall outcome for our customers and, in turn, our shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nPay for all employees is set in line with the market and closely monitored and in 2021 we conducted extensive salary benchmarking in many countries, making adjustments where it was appropriate to do so. Local bonus schemes are available for those below senior leader level in most regions. Around 84% of our UK workforce and 60% globally participate in share plans and therefore benefit from the rewards enjoyed by all shareholders.\n\nWe continue to offer a career average defined benefit pension scheme that is open to all new and existing UK employees, a generous and inclusive benefit for our UK workforce. An important part of the value to employees is that the level of accrued pension is guaranteed, as the Company bears all the investment risk. This security for our workforce is an important part of our 'One Croda' culture. In 2020 we reduced Executive Director pension supplements to align to the UK workforce.\n\n## Remuneration out-turn for 2021\n\nCroda delivered an outstanding performance in 2021 with very strong sales and profit growth, driven in part by lipid system sales for COVID-19 applications. The Committee determined that, given the unique nature and scale of this piece of business, the profit from our principal COVID-19 vaccine contract should be excluded from the Bonusable Profit calculation for both the 2021 and 2022 bonus.\n\nIn line with our usual practice, profit contributions from in-year acquisitions (e.g. Parfex and Alban Muller) are excluded from the calculation to ensure a like-for-like comparison with the base year.\n\nBonusable Profit (after exclusion of in-year acquisition profits and the lipid system sales for our principal COVID-19 vaccine contract) significantly exceeded the outcome for 2020 and the maximum payout target. The Committee used the Discretion Framework to satisfy itself that this performance was robust\n\nand sustainable by reviewing underlying performance. The Committee determined that 100% of the senior annual Bonus Plan was payable.\n\nCroda's longer-term performance in profitable growth and Total Shareholder Return was also very strong and reflected the long-term growth trajectory of the business. 2021 was the year in which PSP grants made in 2019 concluded their three-year period, and the Committee reviewed performance for the targets that were set at that time. Over the period TSR performance was 109.8%, placing Croda in the top quartile against our bespoke comparator group with 100% of this part of the award vesting. Our strong profit performance led to EPS growth of 31.4%, which resulted in a 93.5% payment of this part of the award. NPP growth, for the first time, met the stretching vesting target, which reflected the ambition of this metric and led to a payment of 100% of this part of the award.\n\nThe PSP award is dependent on satisfactory underlying financial performance of the Group. The Committee considered this, and a range of other broader performance criteria using the Discretion Framework, and concluded that the PSP awards were consistent with and reflective of overall financial performance over the time period. Therefore, after consideration of all factors, an overall PSP vesting of 97.4% of the total award was agreed.\n\n## Salaries for 2022\n\nFor 2022, the general salary increase set for the UK workforce is 5%, with additional funds available to address specific market issues.\n\nThe Committee considered the salaries of the Executive Directors in the context of the UK workforce increases, low positioning against market benchmarks, Croda's overall strong performance and the strong performance of the Executive Directors, and concluded that the 2022 salary increase for Executive Directors should be in line with that of the UK workforce.\n\nA review of the Chair fees was also undertaken and, reflecting similar principles and the continuing high time commitment, an increase in line with that of the UK workforce was also awarded.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nMeasures and targets for 2022 have been set for the senior annual Bonus Plan and PSP, as outlined above.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy is due for its triennial renewal at the 2023 AGM and therefore during 2022 we will be undertaking a comprehensive review to ensure that it continues to align to our strategy, taking on board input and advice from our investors and other stakeholders. We remain committed to ensuring that our remuneration framework reflects the evolving needs of all of our stakeholders and the communities in which we operate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDr Helena Ganczakowski\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee",

Executive Directors' remuneration for the year ending 31 December 2022\n\nAn updated Remuneration Policy was presented and approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM. This is intended to operate until the AGM in 2023. In reviewing the Policy and its implementation, the Remuneration Committee undertook a thorough review of existing arrangements with a particular focus on alignment to Croda's strategy and ambitions. This review was completed with the following principal objectives in mind:\n\n- \u00b7  achieve the closest possible alignment with the Company's strategy;\n- \u00b7  support the Company's ambition to be a purpose-led organisation focused on Smart science to improve lives\u2122;\n- \u00b7  ensure that business performance is appropriately measured and rewarded and that the scale of reward is proportionate;\n- \u00b7  make certain that the Policy properly reflects the various interests of all our stakeholders in its structure and metrics;\n- \u00b7  ensure that the Policy is fair and competitive and that it also considers reward more broadly in the organisation;\n- \u00b7  disclose the Policy in an open and transparent way.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is not proposing any substantive changes to the operation of the Policy in 2022, being satisfied with both the outcome of the review and the minor changes made since then.\n\nIn line with the normal three-year cycle under the remuneration reporting regulations, a new Policy will be subject to shareholder approval at the 2023 AGM. In advance of this, during 2022, the Remuneration Committee will undertake a review of the existing Policy to ensure it continues to align to Croda's strategy, taking on board input and advice from investors and other stakeholders.\n\n## Summary of Policy and its operation\n\n| Salary                  | Set taking into account an individual's responsibilities, performance and experience as well as pay and   employment conditions elsewhere in the Group and other external factors.                                              |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Annual bonus            | Maximum annual bonus opportunities:                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|                         | \u00b7  Group Chief Executive - 150% of salary                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|                         | \u00b7  Group Finance Director - 125% of salary                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|                         | Bonusable Profit growth targets, with no bonus payable until the previous year's profit is exceeded.                                                                                                                            |\n|                         | Discretion Framework applies, which includes health, safety and environmental performance.                                                                                                                                      |\n|                         | One third deferred for three years.                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|                         | Malus and clawback provisions apply.                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Performance Share Plan  | Normal maximum PSP opportunities:                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|                         | \u00b7  Group Chief Executive - 225% of salary                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|                         | \u00b7  Group Finance Director - 175% of salary                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|                         | Awards based on financial (e.g. EPS), shareholder return (e.g. relative TSR) and strategic (e.g. sustainability) metrics.

Our arrangements are clearly disclosed and any changes to our Remuneration Policy and its operation are highlighted in a way  that defines their alignment to both our strategic ambitions as well as the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. |\n| Simplicity           | Our executive remuneration arrangements, as well as those throughout the global organisation, are simple in nature and well  understood by both participants and shareholders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Risk                 | The Committee considers that the structure of incentive arrangements does not encourage inappropriate risk-taking.  Performance is based on a balance of metrics which also reflect our broader stakeholders, for example inclusion of sustainability  targets and health and safety underpins. We then take a holistic assessment of performance using our Discretion Framework.                                                                                  |\n| Predictability       | Malus and clawback provisions also apply for both the senior annual Bonus Plan and PSP.  Our Remuneration Policy contains details of maximum opportunity levels for each component of pay, with actual incentive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|                      | outcomes varying depending on the level of performance achieved against specific measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Proportionality      | Our Remuneration Policy directly aligns to our strategy and financial performance. The Committee considers performance  from a range of perspectives. Poor financial performance is not rewarded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Alignment to culture | Alignment to our 'One Croda' culture is clearly established in our Remuneration Policy; our senior annual Bonus Plan has the same  metric for all participants, our PSP metrics/uni00A0reflect our commitment to sustainability and pensions are aligned across/uni00A0the workforce.                                                                                                                                                                              |\n\n## Our Discretion Framework\n\nTo enhance the rigour with which performance is reviewed the Committee has adopted a Discretion Framework which it applies when assessing bonus and long-term incentive plan outcomes. As with all Board/Committee decisions (in line with section 172) we also reflect on the experience of all our stakeholders throughout the course of the plan periods.\n\n| What is the formulaic result following consideration of the existing underpins? What is the single figure outcome?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How does the outcome compare with overall Company performance?

Reward in the wider employee context\n\n## Workforce engagement\n\nEngagement with the workforce is an area in which we continue to make progress. In addition to continuing with established workforce engagement channels (pulse surveys and a dedicated email address for employees to contact the Chair of the Committee), in 2021, the Chair of the Remuneration Committee attended virtual listening groups where employees discussed and shared their thoughts on executive remuneration and reward in the wider business. As 2022 will be the year that we consider our Remuneration Policy, with any changes adopted in 2023, we plan to engage the workforce more widely through pulse surveys and further listening groups with the Chair of the Remuneration Committee. A summary of engagement activities undertaken to date is as follows:\n\n| Reward principles                     | Our reward principles, which were developed and approved during 2019, guide the way we recognise and remunerate all  our global employees. These principles focus on total reward including intangible rewards and were strongly influenced by  the results of our previous Global Employee Survey. These have been shared across the organisation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Employee pulse  surveys               | In 2021, a small number of pulse surveys covering a range of topics, including COVID-19 and resulting changes to the  workplace, were undertaken and findings were shared with the Board as well as management to help guide decisions. For 2022 a new series of pulse surveys covering culture and reward will be issued.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Listening groups                      | During 2021, Helena Ganczakowski, Chair of the Remuneration Committee, held listening groups across a cross-section  of employees in Asia, the Americas and Western Europe. Helena presented on the role of the Board and the Remuneration  Committee and also shared an overview of the Elements of Reward at Croda and feedback on the Global Reward pulse  survey conducted in 2020. The sessions were greatly appreciated by those who attended, with a number of participants  noting that they had limited knowledge of the Board and Remuneration Committee before the session. The Chair of the Board and other Non-Executive Directors also attended listening groups throughout the year. Anita Frew  held listening groups to better understand how employees were feeling on a range of different topics, including strategy, |\n| Dedicated email to                    | Remuneration Committee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Chair of Committee                    | A dedicated email address has been established for employees to send comments or questions to the Chair of the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Overview of pay and  policy decisions | Committee members are updated annually on global employees' terms and conditions and are made aware of any  significant changes to policies and other pay-related matters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n\n## How our Remuneration Policy relates to reward in the wider employee context\n\nWhen making decisions about executive remuneration the Committee considers the pay and reward structures across the business. Annually, the Group Human Resources Director provides the Committee with a review of workforce remuneration, and the Committee is updated periodically on any feedback received on remuneration practices across the Group.\n\nOne of the principles of Croda's culture is to drive 'One Croda', therefore, many of the remuneration structures that apply to Executives also apply further in the global organisation, as set out in the table below. The key difference between the policy for Executive Directors compared to other employees is that remuneration for Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay and share ownership.\n\n| Remuneration element                         | Who participates?                                                                                                       | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Base pay                                     | All employees                                                                                                           | Pay is set in line with the market and closely monitored.

This is promoted through the operation of a new 'Free Share Plan' and a number of all-employee share schemes.\n\n## Free Share Plan\n\nCroda is proud to announce that in 2021 we launched the 'Free Share Plan'. Under this new plan, all employees globally who are not eligible for the senior annual Bonus Plan will be gifted Croda shares (or the cash equivalent) if the senior annual Bonus Plan pays out. Unlike other elements of remuneration this award is not set as a multiple of salary, instead it rewards all eligible employees at the same value.\n\nThe Free Share Plan was developed in response to findings from the Global Reward Survey in 2020 and aims to share success more widely across the business and encourage share ownership.\n\nAs the senior annual Bonus Plan paid out for 2021, all eligible employees will receive 10 Croda shares (or the cash equivalent) in April 2022 under the Free Share Plan. The value of the award is determined by the share price at vesting and based on the recent share price will be in the region of \u00a3706 (based on a share price of \u00a370.60 on 18 February 2022).\n\n## All-employee share schemes\n\nWorkforce participation in these plans has remained consistently strong and is driven by our culture of employees feeling a strong loyalty to the business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCroda's strong share price performance has led to the all-employee share schemes being a strong benefit for employees.\n\n## Example value of the 2018 Sharesave Scheme\n\nThe 2018 Sharesave Scheme which was granted in September 2018 at a share price of 4144p could be exercised from November 2021. The price of Croda shares on the settlement date in November 2021 was 9438.2p, meaning employees could have made a potential return of c.128% on their savings. For example, an employee saving \u00a350 a month would have made a profit in excess of \u00a32,258.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2022, we will continue to ensure that all our UK employees and regular contractors are paid at, or above, the rates advised by the Living Wage Foundation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition, the business continues to pursue its Global Living Wage target, one of our sustainability KPIs linked to the UN SDGs. In 2020 we forged a partnership with the Fair Wage Network (FWN) to establish, using an independent and economically rigorous methodology, Living Wage levels across the world. In 2021, we compared our global wage levels to Living Wage comparators provided by the FWN and made all necessary adjustments to ensure that all our employees are now paid a Living Wage at a minimum.\n\nWe have established processes to ensure that Living Wage levels are reviewed annually and the necessary adjustments to wages are made in order to continue paying a Living Wage to all employees.\n\nIn addition, we will also begin to plan for and progress towards our commitment of paying a Living Wage to all regularly employed contractors globally by the end of 2022.\n\n## More than just pay\n\nOur employees and our culture remain central to the continued success of Croda. Croda has been resilient in its response to COVID-19 and during the pandemic the wellbeing and safety of our employees has been and continues to be a key priority.\n\nIn addition, we continue to enhance our range of other workforce initiatives, including:\n\n- \u00b7  We continued with the rollout of our online recognition programme, Croda Stars, in North America and Latin America. An online recognition programme, Kudos! was also launched in Asia. All programmes have been positively received by employees.\n- \u00b7  We are proud of the training and development that we provide for employees and have set a target of ensuring all employees receive at least one week of training a year by the end of 2025. In 2021, our employees undertook over 93,000 hours of training with the average number of hours an employee completed being 16 hours.\n- \u00b7  We relaunched and redesigned our core company development programmes for senior leaders and future leaders with our values at their heart.\n- \u00b7  We launched a new inclusion based global leadership programme, Phoenix Rising, and a series of leadership webinars on diversity & inclusive leadership.\n- \u00b7  We recorded over 100 wellbeing activities which took place in 2021. We also extended Employee Assistance Programmes in many of our countries.\n\n## 6. Promoting diversity & inclusion\n\nAs a business with innovation at its heart, diversity of thought and ideas is critical to our long-term success and we are committed to encouraging and promoting all types of diversity within our organisation. We have established a global Diversity & Inclusion Steering Committee plus a number of regional and country committees designed to discuss and promote diversity & inclusion.\n\nAt the beginning of 2021, we published a Board diversity & inclusion policy and communicated our commitment to greater diversity within our business. Julie Kim was appointed as a new member of the Board in 2021 and Nawal Ouzren joined the Board in February 2022. These two appointments mean we have fulfilled our commitment to meeting the requirements of the Parker Review on ethnic diversity as well as also achieving full gender balance on the Board.\n\nIn 2021 we ran a global diversity survey to collect wider diversity data in the organisation. All data was collected in good faith, in line with local laws and legal restrictions, including data privacy regulations. The data will be used to influence future work and is the first step in being able to report on our ethnicity pay gap. For further information on this please refer to page 37.",

Other disclosures\n\n## UK gender pay gap\n\nThe table below shows a summary of the gender pay gap for UK employees of Croda Europe Ltd:\n\n|                   | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Mean pay gap      | 27.68% | 27.06% | 18.72% | 17.70% |\n| Median pay gap    | 23.10% | 23.90% | 19.22% | 21.11% |\n| Mean bonus gap    | 63.05% | 67.08% | 64.36% | 62.58% |\n| Median bonus gap* | 33.26% | 33.36% | 0%     | 0%     |\n\nWe are confident that our gender pay gap is not an equal pay issue but is a result of a lack of female representation across our business at senior levels and particularly in production roles which represent the bulk of the workforce between the 25 th and 75 th percentile. Addressing this issue will require a long-term approach but we have already begun work to increase the number of females working in production and in senior positions.\n\nThe number of women in leadership positions is now 36%. We are also pleased to report that we have 43 women working as process operators across 13 of our sites globally.\n\nOver 2020 and 2021 only 40% of hires and promotions to leadership positions were female. At this rate we will not meet our 2030 target to achieve gender balance across our leadership. Therefore, we have included a 'People Positive' target in our 2022 PSP. This target relates to the gender balance of appointments and promotions to our most senior grades.\n\nOther actions taken to address the gender pay gap include:\n\n- \u00b7  Ensuring we have a balanced shortlist for all positions that we are recruiting for; we have a target of achieving balanced shortlists for 80% of roles by 2023.\n- \u00b7  Further improving our talent and succession planning processes to help identify and nurture talent early in their career.\n- \u00b7  Finding ways to reduce shift work (especially night work) and to examine the feasibility of part-time and job share arrangements in our production facilities.\n- \u00b7  Changing the way we advertise production roles to ensure we reach a diverse population.\n- \u00b7  Improving family-friendly policies; in 2019 we introduced a new Global Parental Leave Policy and in 2020 we launched new Flexible Working guidance. All locations have implemented this and have local policies in place.\n- \u00b7  Continuing to invest in our STEM activities to encourage a wide range of applicants to apply for roles in our business.\n\nMore information is available on the Croda website.\n\n## UK CEO pay ratio\n\nThe table below sets out the ratio of the CEO's 'single figure' total remuneration to the 25 th , 50 th and 75 th percentile full-time equivalent total remuneration of the Company's UK employees. The pay ratios are calculated on a Group-wide basis by reference to UK employees only.\n\nUnder the regulations, there are three methodologies that companies can choose to report their pay ratio, known as Option A, B and C. For 2021 we have chosen to continue to use the Government's preferred option, Option A. Using this methodology, we have determined the full-time equivalent total remuneration for all UK employees and have ranked this data to identify employees whose remuneration places them at the 25 th , 50 th and 75 th percentile. The pay ratios are then calculated by comparing total remuneration for these three employees against our CEO 'single figure' total remuneration.\n\n|           | Methodology   | 25 th  percentile   | 50 th  percentile   | 75 th  percentile   |\n|-----------|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| FY 2021   | A             | 132:1               | 96:1                | 80:1                |\n| FY 2020*  | A             | 48:1                | 37:1                | 31:1                |\n| FY 2019   | A             | 57:1                | 44:1                | 37:1                |\n| FY 2018** | C             | 85:1                | 67:1                | 57:1                |",

The outcomes of these elements are directly linked to performance, with the value of the PSP also incorporating share price growth. It is therefore expected that the ratios will fluctuate significantly year-on-year to reflect Croda's performance. In respect of the 2021 figures, as this has been an outstanding year for performance both the senior annual Bonus Plan and PSP have paid out at high levels. As the senior annual Bonus Plan did not pay out last year this represents a large increase in remuneration for the CEO; the PSP has also paid out at a higher level, from 40% in 2020 to 97.4% in 2021.\n\n## Employee total remuneration\n\n|                   | Actual base   salary 2021   | Total remuneration  2021   |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| 75 th  percentile | \u00a348,904                     | \u00a355,440                    |\n| 50 th  percentile | \u00a330,603                     | \u00a346,050                    |\n| 25 th  percentile | \u00a327,865                     | \u00a333,654                    |\n\nWe believe that our CEO pay ratio is consistent with our pay, reward and progression policies. The sharing of success has been a strong theme in 2021 and although the CEO pay ratios have widened, employees have also benefitted from a strong performing year. The newly launched 'Free Share Plan' will pay out for 2021, rewarding our most junior employees proportionally the most, annual bonus plans will pay out globally and we awarded over double the amount of RSP awards compared to previous years.\n\n## 8.

A. The PSP awards granted in March 2019 reached the end of their performance period on 31 December 2021. The awards will vest at 97.4% of maximum (see page 98). The values included in the table above are based on the three-month average price to 31 December 2021 of 9545.7p. Of these values, \u00a31,266,031 and \u00a3654,834 is attributable to share price growth for Steve Foots and Jez Maiden, respectively. These values will be updated in next year's Annual Report based on the share price at vesting which will take place on 14 March 2022. B. The PSP award included in the 2020 single figure (the 2018-20 PSP award) has been updated to reflect the actual share price at vesting of 6205p. Of these values, \u00a3178,130 and \u00a392,137 is attributable to share price growth for Steve Foots and Jez Maiden, respectively.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nThe annual bonus for Executive Directors in 2021 was calculated by reference to the amount by which the profit for the year exceeded the profit for 2020 (the 'Bonusable Profit'). Bonuses for 2021 are payable against a graduated scale once the Bonusable Profit exceeds the base profit with bonus targets set, and performance measured, based on constant currency actual exchange rates. Considering the unique nature of the business, the profit from our lipid system sales for our principal COVID-19 vaccine contract contract, has been excluded from the Bonusable Profit calculation. In line with our usual practice, profit contributions from in-year acquisitions (e.g. Parfex and Alban Muller) are excluded from the calculation to ensure a like-for-like comparison with the base year.\n\nBonus outcome\n\n| Executive Director   | Threshold target   | Maximum target   | Actual   | (% of maximum)   |\n|----------------------|--------------------|------------------|----------|------------------|\n| Bonusable Profit     | \u00a3384.8m            | \u00a3423.3m          | \u00a3477.5m  | 100%             |\n\nThe Remuneration Committee has discretion to reduce (including to zero) the amount of any payment under the scheme if it considers the safety, health or environment (SHE) performance is in serious non-compliance with the Croda SHE policy statement document of minimum standards. In addition, the Committee can also reduce any payment (including to zero) if it considers the underlying business performance of the Company is not sufficient to support the payment of any bonus. The Committee also applies the Discretion Framework, a rigorous framework for the application of judgement and discretion, when reviewing awards (see page 89).\n\nThe Committee used the Discretion Framework to satisfy itself that performance was robust and sustainable. The Committee therefore determined that 100% of the senior annual Bonus Plan was payable.\n\nOne third of the bonus payable will be deferred into shares for three years.",

Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in this table. During 2021, Steve Foots was paid \u00a3136,218 (2020: \u00a3130,992) and Jez Maiden was paid \u00a394,116 (2020: \u00a393,184) in addition to their basic salary to enable them to make independent provision for their retirement.\n\nCroda has a number of different pension plans in the countries in which we operate. Pension entitlements for Executive Directors are tailored to local market practice, length of service and the participant's age. In 2016, a Career Average Revalued Earnings (CARE) scheme was introduced with a cap applied to pension benefits; at this time the cap was set at \u00a365,000. The cap is increased each year in line with inflation, and from April 2022 will be \u00a372,966. Employees who earn in excess of the pension cap or who cannot be members of the plan due to tax limitations receive a pension supplement. For Executive Directors this supplement is up to 20% of salary in line with the wider UK workforce.\n\n## Steve Foots' pension provision\n\nSteve Foots accrued pension benefits under the CPS up to 31 January 2021 with a CARE accrual rate of 1/60 th and an entitlement to retire at age 60. From 6 April 2011 onwards, pension benefits accruing were based on a capped salary. This cap was \u00a3187,500 until April 2014 at which point it reduced to \u00a3150,000, and due to annual allowance regulations and changes to the pension scheme, reduced to \u00a337,500 in April 2016 (reduced from the scheme cap of \u00a365,650 due to annual allowance regulations) and reduced again in April 2020 to \u00a315,000 following new annual allowance regulations. If Steve Foots retires before the age of 60, a reduction will be applied to the element of his pension accrued before 6 April 2006, unless he is retiring at the Company's request. In the event of death, a pension equal to two thirds of the Director's pension would become payable to the surviving spouse. Steve Foots' pension in payment is guaranteed to increase in line with the rate of inflation up to a maximum of 10% per annum for benefits accrued before 6 April 2006, and in line with inflation up to a maximum of 2.5% per annum for benefits accrued from 6 April 2006 onwards.\n\nSteve Foots is entitled to death-in-service benefits from an Excepted Life Policy. Steve Foots elected to opt out of the Croda Pension Scheme from 31 January 2021 and therefore only now receives a pension supplement of 20% of salary. For January 2021 he also received a pension supplement at 20% of salary above his personal pension benefit cap in line with the wider UK workforce.\n\n## Jez Maiden's pension provision\n\nJez Maiden has elected not to join the Croda Pension Scheme and was therefore paid a pension supplement of 20% of salary in 2021. He is entitled to death-in-service benefits from an Excepted Life Policy.",

It is intended that this will operate until the AGM in 2023. The full Remuneration Policy can be found on pages 77 to 83 of our Annual Report & Accounts 2019.\n\nMain components of the Remuneration Policy\n\n## Operation\n\nMaximum opportunity\n\n## Basic salary - to assist in the recruitment and retention of high-calibre Executives\n\nNormally reviewed annually with increases effective from 1 January. Base salaries will be set by the Committee, considering:\n\n- \u00b7  The performance and experience of the individual concerned\n- \u00b7  Any change in scope, role and/or responsibilities\n- \u00b7  Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group\n- \u00b7  Rates of inflation and market-wide wage increases across international locations\n- \u00b7  The geographical location of the Executive Director\n- \u00b7  Rates of pay in international manufacturing and pan-sector companies of a comparable size and complexity.\n- \u00b7  Salaries may be increased each year in percentage of salary terms.\n- \u00b7  The Committee will be guided by the salary increase budget set in each region and across the workforce generally.\n- \u00b7  Increases beyond those linked to the region of the Executive Director or the workforce as a whole (in percentage of salary terms) may be awarded by the Committee at its discretion. For example, where there is a change in responsibility, experience or a significant increase in the scale of the role and/or size, value or complexity of the Group.\n- \u00b7  The Committee retains the flexibility to set the salary of a new hire at a discount to the market level initially, and to implement a series of planned increases in subsequent years, in order to bring the salary to the desired positioning, subject to individual performance.\n\n## Benefits - to provide competitive benefits to act as a retention mechanism and reward service\n\nThe Group typically provides the following benefits:\n\n- \u00b7  Company car (or cash allowance)\n- \u00b7  Private fuel allowance\n- \u00b7  Private health insurance and other insured benefits\n- \u00b7  Other ancillary benefits, including relocation expenses/arrangements (including tax thereon) as required.\n\nAdditional benefits might be provided from time to time (for example in circumstances where an Executive Director is deployed to, or recruited from overseas).\n\nThe Committee will consider whether the payment of any additional benefits is appropriate and proportionate when determining whether they are paid.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7  The cost of benefits is not pre-determined and may vary from year to year based on the cost to the Group.\n\nNone.\n\nFramework used to assess performance and for the recovery of sums paid\n\n- \u00b7  The Committee considers individual salaries taking due account of the relevant factors set out in this Policy, which includes individual performance.",

        "page_content": "## Operation\n\nFramework used to assess performance and for the recovery of sums paid\n\n## Performance-related annual bonus - to incentivise and reward delivery of the Group's key annual objectives and to contribute to longer-term alignment with shareholders\n\nNormally one third of any bonus paid is compulsorily deferred into shares for three years through the Deferred Bonus Share Plan (DBSP).\n\nThe Committee has the discretion to permit DBSP awards to benefit from dividends on shares that vest.\n\nThe balance of the bonus is paid in cash.\n\nGroup Chief Executive: 150% of salary.\n\nOther Executive Director: 125% of salary.\n\n- \u00b7  Bonus will typically be based on challenging financial targets set in line with the Group's KPIs (for example profit growth targets).\n- \u00b7  The Committee has the flexibility to include, for a minority of the bonus, targets related to other Group measures where this is considered appropriate.\n- \u00b7  For a profit measure, bonus normally starts to accrue once the threshold target is met (0% payable) rising on a graduated scale to 100% for outperformance. Were an additional KPI metric to be introduced, the threshold would not exceed 25%.\n- \u00b7  The Committee applies a Discretion Framework, which includes health, safety and environmental performance when determining the actual overall level of individual bonus payments and it may adjust the bonus awards if it considers it appropriate to do so.\n- \u00b7  Bonuses paid are subject to provisions that enable the Committee to recover value overpaid through the withholding of variable pay previously earned or granted (malus) or through requesting a payment from an individual (clawback) in the event of a misstatement of results, serious misconduct, serious reputational damage or material corporate failure. The provisions will operate for a three-year period following the date on which the bonus is paid.\n\n## Performance Share Plan (PSP) - to incentivise and reward the execution of business strategy over the longer term and to reward sustained growth in profit and shareholder value\n\nThe PSP provides for awards of free shares (i.e., either conditional shares or nil-cost options) normally made annually which vest after three years subject to continued service and the achievement of challenging performance conditions. Shares are subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period.\n\nThe Committee has the discretion to permit awards to benefit from the dividends paid on shares that vest.\n\nNormal maximum opportunity of:\n\n- \u00b7  Group Chief Executive: 225% of salary\n- \u00b7  Other Executive Director: 175% of salary.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances (eg recruitment), awards may be granted up to 300% of salary to compensate for value forfeited from a previous employer.\n\n- \u00b7  Granted subject to a blend of challenging financial (eg EPS), shareholder return (eg relative TSR) and strategic targets (eg sustainability). The performance targets may also include an additional underpin (eg an EVA underpin).\n- \u00b7  Targets will normally be tested over three years.\n- \u00b7  In relation to financial targets (eg EPS growth and TSR) 25% of awards subject to such targets will vest for threshold performance with a graduated scale operating through to full vesting for equalling, or exceeding, the maximum performance targets (no awards vest for performance below threshold). In relation to strategic targets or underpin targets, the structure of the target will vary based on the nature of target set (eg for milestone strategic targets it may not always be practicable to set such targets using a graduated scale and so vesting may take place in full for strategic targets if the criteria are met in full).\n- \u00b7  Vesting is also dependent on application of the Discretion Framework, including satisfactory underlying financial performance of the Group over the performance period and the Committee may adjust outcomes if it considers it appropriate to do so.\n- \u00b7  There are also provisions that enable the Committee to recover value overpaid through the withholding of variable pay previously earned or granted (malus) or through requesting a payment from an individual (clawback) in the event of a misstatement of results, serious misconduct, serious reputational damage or material corporate failure. The provisions will operate for a three-year period following the date on which the PSP awards vest.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Directors' report\n\n## Other disclosures\n\nPages 58 to 111 inclusive, together with the sections of the Annual Report and Accounts incorporated by reference, constitute a Directors' report that has been drawn up and presented in accordance with applicable English company law; the liabilities of the Directors in connection with that report are subject to the limitations and restrictions provided by that law.\n\n## Research and development\n\nResearch and development activities are undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe Directors are recommending a final dividend of 56.5p per share (2020: 51.5p). If approved by shareholders, total dividends for the year will amount to 100.0p per share (2020: 91.0p). Details of dividends are shown in note 8 on page 137; details of the Company's Dividend Reinvestment Plan can be found on page 171. The Company has established various Employee Benefit Trusts (EBTs) in connection with the obligation to satisfy future share awards under employee share incentive schemes. The trustees of the EBTs have waived their rights to receive dividends on certain Ordinary Shares of the Company held in the EBTs. Such waivers represent less than 1% of the total dividend payable on the Company's Ordinary Shares. Further details of the EBTs can be found in note 25 on page 160.\n\n## Directors\n\nThe Company's Articles of Association (Articles) give the Directors power to appoint and replace Directors. Under the terms of reference of the Nomination Committee, any appointment must be recommended by the Nomination Committee for approval by the Board of Directors. The present Directors of the Company are shown on pages 62 and 63.\n\nIn line with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, each Director will be standing for election or re-election at the AGM. Details of the Directors' service contracts are given in the Directors' Remuneration Report on page 102.\n\nApart from the share option schemes, long term incentive schemes and service contracts, no Director had any beneficial interest in any contract to which the Company or a subsidiary was a party during the year. A statement indicating the beneficial and non-beneficial interests of the Directors in the share capital of the Company, including share options, is shown in the Directors' Remuneration Report on page 100.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for managing the business of the Company and may exercise all the powers of the Company subject to the provisions of relevant statutes, the Company's Articles and any directions given by special  resolution.\n\n## Directors' indemnities\n\nThe Company maintains Directors' and Officers' liability insurance that gives appropriate cover for any legal action brought\n\nagainst its Directors. The Company has also granted indemnities to each of its Directors and the Company Secretary, which represent 'qualifying third party indemnity provisions' (as defined by Section 234 of the Companies Act 2006), in relation to certain losses and liabilities that the Directors or Company Secretary may incur to third parties in the course of acting as Directors or the Company Secretary or as employees of the Company or of any associated company. In addition, such indemnities have been granted to other officers of the Company who are Directors of subsidiary companies within the Group. Such indemnities were in place during 2021 and at the date of approval of the Group financial statements.\n\n## Share capital\n\nAt the date of this report, 142,536,884 Ordinary Shares of 10.609756p each have been issued and are fully paid up and quoted on the London Stock Exchange. At the date of this Report, the Company has issued and fully paid up 21,900 7.5% Cumulative Preference Shares, 498,434 6.6% Cumulative Preference Shares and 615,562 5.9% Cumulative Preference Shares, all of \u00a31 each (the Preference Shares). The rights and obligations attached to the Company's Ordinary Shares and Preference Shares are set out in the Articles, copies of which can be obtained from Companies House in the UK or by writing to the Company Secretary. There are no restrictions on the voting rights attached to the Company's Ordinary Shares or on the transfer of securities in the Company. The 7.5% Cumulative Preference Shares do not confer on the holders any right to receive notice of or to be present or to vote at any general meeting of the Company unless the cumulative preferential dividend on such shares is more than 12 calendar months in arrears. The 6.6% and 5.9% Cumulative Preference Shares do not confer on the holders any right to receive notice of or to be present or to vote at any general meeting of the Company, unless the cumulative preferential dividend on such shares is more than six calendar months in arrears or the business of the general meeting includes the consideration of a resolution for reducing the share capital of the Company, to sell the undertaking of the Company or to alter the Articles. No person holds securities in the Company that carry special rights with regard to control of the Company. The Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.\n\n## Power to issue or buy back shares\n\nAt the 2021 AGM, authority was given to the Directors to allot unissued shares in the Company up to a maximum amount equivalent to approximately one third of the issued share capital, excluding shares held in treasury, for general purposes, plus up to a further one third of the Company's issued share capital, excluding shares held in treasury, but only in the case of a rights issue.\n\nA further special resolution passed at that meeting granted authority to the Directors to allot equity securities in the Company for cash,\n\nwithout regard to the pre-emption provisions of the Companies Act 2006. Both of these authorities expire on the date of the 2022 AGM, that is 20 May 2022, and so the Directors propose to renew them for a further year.\n\n## Substantial Shareholdings\n\nAs at 31 December 2021 in accordance with DTR 5 the holders of notifiable interests in the Company's share capital had not changed since the information declared in the 2020 Annual Report and are shown in the table below.\n\n|                                            | Number of  shares   | % of issued  capital   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|\n| Massachusetts  Financial Services  Company | 12,551,036          | 9.73%                  |\n| BlackRock, Inc.                            | 8,534,795           | 6.62%                  |\n| Mawer Investment  Management Limited       | 6,438,386           | 4.99%                  |\n| Royal Bank of Canada                       | 5,212,886           | 4.04%                  |\n\nSince the year end and up to the date of this report the following information has been received.\n\n|                      | Number of  shares   | % of issued  capital   |\n|----------------------|---------------------|------------------------|\n| Royal Bank of Canada | 5,093,443           | 3.65%                  |\n| Norges Bank          | 4,186,185           | 3.00%                  |\n\n## Employees\n\nDiversity: We are committed to the principle of equal opportunity in employment and to ensuring that no applicant or employee receives less favourable treatment on the grounds of any protected characteristic or is disadvantaged by conditions or requirements that cannot be shown to be justified. Group human resources policies are clearly communicated to all of our employees and are available through the Company intranet.\n\nRecruitment and progression: It is established policy throughout the Business that decisions on recruitment, career development, promotion and other employment related issues are made solely on the grounds of individual ability, achievement, expertise and conduct.\n\nWe give full and fair consideration to applications for employment from people with disabilities, having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities. Should an employee become disabled during their employment with the Company, they are fully supported by our Occupational Health provision. Efforts are made to continue their employment with reasonable adjustments being made to the workplace and role where feasible. Retraining is provided if necessary.\n\nDevelopment and learning: The Company recognises that the key to future success lies in the skills and abilities of its dedicated global workforce.

Throughout this Annual Report the Directors have disclosed a mix of financial and non-financial KPIs which they believe best reflect the Group's strategic priorities, and which will help to convey an understanding of the culture of the business and the drivers which contribute to the ongoing success of the Company. Please see the non-financial information statement on page 38 which sets out where stakeholders can find information relating to non-financial matters.\n\n## Mandatory XBRL tagging\n\nThe Board

        "page_content": "## 2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. We summarise below the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Group\n\n## The risk\n\n## Our response\n\n## Valuation of defined benefit pension scheme obligation\n\n(Gross defined benefit obligation \u00a31,309.0m; 2020: \u00a31,544.4m), although this specific risk is only associated with the UK scheme (\u00a31,162.6m) and US scheme (\u00a3126.8m).\n\nIn prior year the risk related to the UK scheme (\u00a31,178.5m), US scheme (\u00a3133.9m) and Netherlands scheme (\u00a3212.3m). During the year the material scheme held in the Netherlands has been converted into a collective defined contribution scheme, and therefore the related defined benefit obligation has crystallised and been derecognised from the balance sheet.\n\nAccordingly, the year-end risk relates only to the ongoing UK and US schemes.\n\nRefer to page 82 (Audit Committee Report), page 128 (accounting policy) and note 11 on pages 139 to 143 (financial disclosures).\n\n## Subjective valuation:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group has two defined benefit pension schemes that are material in the context of the overall balance sheet and the results of the Group.\n- \u00b7 Significant estimates, including the discount rate, the inflation rate and the mortality rate, are made in valuing the Group's defined benefit pension obligations (before deducting the schemes' assets). The UK scheme is also still open to future accrual and new members, and small changes in the assumptions and estimates with respect to the obligation would have a significant effect on the financial position of the Group. The Group engages external actuarial specialists to assist them in selecting appropriate assumptions and calculate the obligations.\n- \u00b7 The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the valuation of the defined benefit obligations has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount. The financial statements (note 11) disclose the sensitivity estimated by the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Benchmarking assumptions: we challenged key assumptions applied (discount rate, inflation rate, and mortality rate) with the support of our own actuarial specialists, including a comparison of key assumptions against market data.\n- \u00b7 Actuary's credentials: we assessed the competence, capabilities and objectivity of the Group's actuarial expert.\n- \u00b7 Sensitivity analysis: we assessed the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in certain assumptions.\n- \u00b7 Assessing transparency: we considered adequacy of the Group's disclosures in respect of the sensitivity of the gross obligation to changes in key assumptions.\n\nWe performed the tests above rather than seeking to rely on any of the Group's controls because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described.\n\n## Our results\n\n- \u00b7 We found the valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme obligation to be acceptable (2020 result: acceptable).\n\nCroda International Plc",

Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit\n\nMateriality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a316.0m (2020: \u00a315.0m), determined with reference to a benchmark of normalised Group profit before tax (PBT) of \u00a3328.6m (2020: \u00a3300.2m), of which it represents 4.9% (2020: 5.0%).\n\nWe normalised PBT by adding back adjustments that do not represent the normal, continuing operations of the Group and by averaging over three years. The items we adjusted were exceptional curtailment gains and redundancy costs as disclosed in notes 3 and 11.\n\nMateriality for the parent Company financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a38.7m (2020: \u00a38.7m), which is the component materiality for the parent company determined by the Group audit engagement team. This is lower than the materiality we would otherwise have determined with reference to a benchmark of parent Company total assets of \u00a32,778.0m (2020: \u00a32,851.4m), of which it represents 0.3% (2020: 0.3%).\n\nIn line with our audit methodology, our procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\nPerformance materiality was set at 75% (2020: 75%) of materiality for the financial statements as a whole, which equates to \u00a312.0m (2020: \u00a311.3m) for the Group and \u00a36.5m (2020: \u00a36.5m) for the Parent company. We applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality because we did not identify any factors indicating an elevated level of risk.\n\nWe agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding \u00a30.8m (2020: \u00a30.75m), in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on quantitative grounds.\n\nOf the Group's 87 (2020: 85) reporting components, we subjected 10 (2020: 12) to full scope audits for Group purposes and 6 (2020: 7) to specified risk-focused audit procedures. One component (2020: 1) for which we performed specific risk-focused procedures was not individually financially significant enough to require a full scope audit for Group purposes but did present specific individual risks that needed to be addressed. The other 5 (2020: 6) components for which we performed work other than full scope audits for Group reporting purposes were not individually significant but were included in the scope of our Group reporting work in order to provide further coverage over the Group's results.\n\nThe components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages illustrated opposite.\n\nThe remaining 22% (2020: 22%) of total Group revenue, 15% (2020: 16%) of total of the profits and losses that made up the Group profit before tax and 12% (2020: 10%) of total Group assets is represented by 71 (2020: 66) reporting components, none of which individually represented more than 2% (2020: 2%) of any of total Group revenue, Group profit before tax or total Group assets. For these components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these.\n\n## Normalised Group profit before tax\n\n## Group materiality\n\n\u00a316m (2020: \u00a315m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group revenue\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFull scope for Group audit purposes 2021\n\n## Specific risk-focused audit procedures 2021 Group total assets\n\nFull scope for Group audit purposes 2020\n\nSpecific risk-focused audit procedures 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFull scope for Group audit purposes 2021\n\nSpecific risk-focused audit procedures 2021\n\nFull scope for Group audit purposes 2020\n\nSpecific risk-focused audit procedures 2020\n\nResidual components\n\nThe 2020 charts have been updated to include components scoped for specified risk-focused audit procedures\n\nCroda International Plc\n\n## \u00a316m\n\nWhole financial statements materiality (2020: \u00a315m)\n\n## \u00a312m\n\nWhole financial statements performance materiality (2020: \u00a311.3m)\n\n## \u00a39m\n\nRange of materiality at 16 components (\u00a30.9m to \u00a39m) (2020: \u00a30.45m to \u00a38.7m)\n\n## \u00a30.8m\n\nMisstatements reported to the Audit Committee (2020: \u00a30.75m)\n\nTotal of the profit and losses that made up Group profit before tax\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFull scope for Group audit purposes 2021\n\nSpecific risk-focused audit procedures 2021\n\nFull scope for Group audit purposes 2020\n\nSpecific risk-focused audit procedures 2020\n\nResidual components",

Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit continued\n\nThe Group team adopted a centralised approach to testing revenue, purchases and journal entries. Data and analytics routines were performed for 13 components, and the Group team assessed the outputs of these routines before sending outputs to component auditors and instructing them to test transactions meeting certain criteria. The instructions to component auditors also included significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back. The Group team approved the component materialities, which ranged from \u00a30.9m to \u00a39.0m (2020: \u00a30.5m to \u00a38.7m), having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components. The work on 12 of the 16 components (2020: 11 of the 19 components) was performed by component auditors and the rest, including the audit of the parent Company, was performed by the Group team. The Group team performed procedures on the items excluded from normalised Group profit before tax.\n\nThe scope of the audit work performed was predominately substantive as we placed limited reliance upon the Group's internal control over financial reporting.\n\nOn account of travel restrictions in place during the performance of the audit the Group team did not visit the component auditors and instead senior members of the Group audit team held regular video conference meetings with all in scope components. These meetings involved explanation of Group audit instructions, involvement in planning audit procedures, discussing progress updates and emerging findings, reviewing outcomes of testing performed and involvement in discussing audit findings with component management. The Group audit team reviewed the audit documentation of component audits through various stages of their audits. The Group team also attended the component virtual clearance meetings. At these meetings, the findings reported to the Group team were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the Group team was then performed by the component auditor.\n\n## 4. The impact of climate change on our audit\n\nIn planning our audit, we have considered the potential impact of climate change on the Group's business and its financial statements.\n\nThe Group has set out its Climate Positive targets and Science Based targets in line with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00baC by 2030, and to be climate net zero by 2050. The majority of the Group's carbon emissions are in the supply chain, and the Group continues to develop its assessment of climate change. Climate change initiatives impact the Group in a variety of ways including opportunities and risks relating to bio-based raw material supply, operational and supply chain decarbonisation and emerging regulatory requirements such as carbon taxes. Further information is provided on pages 40 to 43.\n\nWhile the Group has set out its Climate Positive targets and Science Based targets, the Group continues to assess and develop the consequences of this in terms of capital expenditure, the cost base and impacts on cash flows.\n\nThe Group considered the impact of climate change and the Group's targets in the preparation of the financial statements, including an evaluation of critical accounting estimates and judgements. The Group concluded that this did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements, as described on page 125 and 126.\n\nAs part of our audit, we have made enquiries of management to understand the extent of the potential impact of climate change risks on the Group's financial statements, including their assessment of critical accounting estimates and judgements, and the effect on our audit. We have performed a risk assessment to evaluate the potential impact, including the goodwill impairment assessment, the estimates made regarding useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment, and the valuation of certain unquoted pension assets.\n\nCroda International Plc\n\nWe held discussions with our own climate change professionals to challenge our risk assessment.\n\nTaking into account the extent of headroom on goodwill, the nature of the Iberchem business, the expected remaining useful lives of property, plant and equipment, and the nature of unquoted pension assets, we assessed that there is not a significant impact on our audit for this financial year. There was no significant impact of climate on our key audit matters.\n\nWe have read the Group's disclosure of climate related information in the front half of the annual report as set out on pages 40 to 43 and considered consistency with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\n## 5. Going concern\n\nThe Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Group's and the parent Company's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').\n\nWe used our knowledge of the Group, its industry, and the general economic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group's and parent Company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that we considered most likely to adversely affect the Group's and parent Company's available financial resources and metrics relevant to debt covenants over this period were:\n\n- \u00b7 The potential impact on Group revenue of economic uncertainty and reduced customer confidence with a reduction in the outlook for global demand coupled with slower economic recovery; and\n- \u00b7 The impact of a product quality issue leading to a product recall or loss of revenue for a period of time.\n\nWe also considered less predictable but realistic second order impacts, such as product quality failures, regulatory incidents and site incidents, which could result in a rapid reduction of available financial resources.\n\nWe considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity or covenant compliance in the going concern period by assessing the degree of downside assumption that, individually and collectively, could result in a liquidity issue, taking into account the Group's current and projected cash and facilities (a reverse stress test). We also assessed the completeness of the going concern disclosure on page 125. Our conclusions based on this work:\n\n- \u00b7 we consider that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate;\n- \u00b7 we have not identified, and concur with the Directors' assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or Company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period;\n- \u00b7 we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors' statement on page 125 on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and parent Company's use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure on page 125 to be acceptable; and\n- \u00b7 the same statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nHowever, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group or the Company will continue in operation.",

Our risk assessment procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Enquiring of Directors, the Audit Committee, internal audit and inspection of policy documentation as to the Group's high-level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the internal audit function, as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud.\n- \u00b7 Reading Board and Audit Committee minutes.\n- \u00b7 Considering remuneration incentive schemes (performance related annual Bonus Plan and Performance Share Plan) and performance targets for management, including the EPS growth target.\n\nWe communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group audit team to full scope and specified risk-focused component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level and requesting these component audit teams to report to the Group audit team any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement at the Group level.\n\nAs required by auditing standards, we perform procedures to address the risk of management override of controls, in particular the risk that management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries.\n\nOn this audit, we do not believe there is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition because revenue transactions have low individual value with high volume, are routine and process driven and do not involve judgement or estimation. This reduces the opportunities for fraudulent activity.\n\nWe did not identify any additional fraud risks.\n\nWe performed procedures including:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifying journal entries to test for all full scope and specified risk focused components based on risk criteria by the Group audit team. Component audit teams were instructed to test the identified entries to supporting documentation. These included those posted by senior finance management or other high-risk users and those posted to unusual account combinations.\n- \u00b7 Assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias.\n\n## Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\nWe identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, through discussion with the Directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), and from inspection of the Group's regulatory and legal correspondence and discussed with the Directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations.\n\nWe communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group audit team to all full scope and specified risk-focused component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at the Group level, and a request for these component auditors to report to the Group team any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement at the Group level.\n\nThe potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably. Firstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial\n\nreporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation, pensions legislation, and taxation legislation, and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.\n\nSecondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation or the loss of the Group's licence to operate. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: GDPR compliance, health and safety and product liability, competition, anti-bribery and corruption, intellectual property, employment law, tax, trade compliance laws and environmental legislation, recognising the nature of the Group's activities. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non- compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the Directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.\n\nWe discussed with the Audit Committee environmental matters related to actual or suspected breaches of laws or regulations, for which disclosure is not necessary, and considered any implications for our audit.\n\n## Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation\n\nOwing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.\n\nIn addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of nondetection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.\n\nCroda International Plc",

We have nothing to report on the other information in the Annual Report\n\nThe Directors are responsible for the other information presented in the Annual Report together with the financial statements. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the other information.\n\n## Strategic Report and Directors' Report\n\nBased solely on our work on the other information:\n\n- \u00b7 we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report;\n- \u00b7 in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and\n- \u00b7 in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Directors' Remuneration Report\n\nIn our opinion the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Disclosures of emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the Directors' disclosures in respect of emerging and principal risks and the viability statement, and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nBased on those procedures, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- \u00b7 the Directors' confirmation within the long-term viability statement on pages 56 and 57 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity;\n- \u00b7 the Principal Risks disclosures describing these risks and how emerging risks are identified, and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and\n\nthe Directors' explanation in the long-term viability statement of how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nCroda International Plc\n\nWe are also required to review the long-term viability statement, set out on pages 56 and 57 under the Listing Rules. Based on the above procedures, we have concluded that the above disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nOur work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge acquired during our financial statements audit. As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the Group's and parent Company's longer-term viability.\n\n## Corporate governance disclosures\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the Directors' corporate governance disclosures and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nBased on those procedures, we have concluded that each of the following is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge:\n\n- \u00b7 the Directors' statement that they consider that the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's position and performance, business model and strategy;\n- \u00b7 the section of the annual report describing the work of the Audit Committee, including the significant issues that the Audit Committee considered in relation to the financial statements, and how these issues were addressed; and\n- \u00b7 the section of the annual report that describes the review of the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems.\n\nWe are required to review the part of Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified by the Listing Rules for our review. We have nothing to report in this respect.",

We have nothing to report on the other matters on which we are required to report by exception\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- \u00b7 the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n- \u00b7 certain disclosures of Directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n- \u00b7 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\n\nWe have nothing to report in these respects.\n\n## 9. Respective responsibilities\n\n## Directors' responsibilities\n\nAs explained more fully in their statement set out on page 111, the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor's report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nA fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.\n\n## 10. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities\n\nThis report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n## Ian Griffiths (Senior Statutory Auditor) for and on behalf of KPMG LLP, Statutory Auditor\n\nChartered Accountants 15 Canada Square London E14 5GL 28 February 2022\n\nCroda International Plc",

        "page_content": "## Group Accounting Policies\n\nThe principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, in accordance with applicable law and UKadopted international accounting standards. A summary of the more important Group accounting policies is set out below.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe ongoing impact of COVID-19 and the broader consequences on the markets in which the Group operates have been considered in the preparation of the financial statements including our evaluation of critical accounting estimates and judgements which are detailed below. The financial statements on pages 120 to 161 have been prepared on a going concern basis which the Directors believe to be appropriate for the following reasons:\n\nIn 2021, the Group successfully extended the existing 2019 Club facility by a further year, resetting its five-year term and resulting in a maturity date of October 2026. At 31 December 2021 the Group had \u00a31,226m of committed debt facilities available from its banking group, USPP bondholders and lease providers, with principal maturities between 2023 and 2030, of which \u00a3334.4m (2020: \u00a3378.3m) was undrawn, together with cash balances of \u00a3112.8m (2020: \u00a3106.5m).\n\nThe Directors have reviewed the liquidity and covenant forecasts for the Group's going concern assessment period covering at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. The Directors have also considered sensitivities in respect of potential downside scenarios, and the mitigating actions available, in concluding that the Group is able to continue in operation for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approving the financial statements. These sensitivities include a severe but plausible downside scenario, alongside an additional scenario considered to be severe but remote. Relative to a base case scenario, the sensitivities assume increasingly pessimistic outlooks for global demand, coupled with slower economic recoveries. In the severe downside scenario, demand falls below average 2021 levels throughout 2022 and 2023. Furthermore, both downside scenarios also assume a material increase in working capital, due to inventory build and higher customer receivables, and substantial margin erosion, predicated on a further deterioration in the economic conditions.\n\nBased on 2021 results, reverse stress testing assesses that adjusted operating profit would need to fall by 69% to trigger an event of default, before consideration of available actions to conserve cash. The Directors do not consider this a plausible scenario. In considering the suitability of these scenarios, the Directors have considered, among other factors, the impact of the risk scenario combinations that form part of the viability statement.\n\nIn the downside scenarios, the Group continues to have significant liquidity headroom and good financial covenant headroom under its debt facilities. Excluded from the above scenario testing, the Directors have also considered the impact on the Group from the agreement to sell the majority of the Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals businesses for total consideration of \u20ac915m. The disposal will have a significant positive impact on Croda's leverage and liquidity in the short to medium term. The Directors are therefore satisfied that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operation for a period of not less than 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.\n\nCroda International Plc\n\nAnnual report and Accounts 2021\n\n125\n\n## Climate change\n\nThe Group has long recognised the scale of the climate emergency and considers this to offer both opportunities and risks in the future. The Group's current climate change strategy focuses on reducing its carbon footprint and increasing its use of bio-based raw materials, whilst the benefits in using its ingredients will enable more carbon to be saved than were emitted through operations and supply chain.\n\nThe impact of climate change has been considered in the preparation of these financial statements across a number of areas, including our evaluation of critical accounting estimates and judgements which are detailed below, consistent with the risks and opportunities set out on page 43. None of these risks had a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. The Group will continue developing its assessment of the impact that climate change has on the assets and liabilities recognised and presented in its financial statements.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe Group's significant accounting policies under UK-adopted international accounting standards have been set by management with the approval of the Audit Committee. The application of these policies requires estimates and assumptions to be made concerning the future and judgements to be made on the applicability of policies to particular situations. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nUnder UK-adopted international accounting standards an estimate or judgement may be considered critical if it involves matters that are highly uncertain or where different estimation methods could reasonably have been used, or if changes in the estimate that would have a material impact on the Group's results are likely to occur from period to period.\n\nThe critical accounting judgement required when preparing the Group's accounts is as follows:\n\n- (i) Business disposal - the Group has signed an agreement to sell the majority of its Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals businesses. Whilst completion of the sale is considered highly probable, the Group's assessment that the disposal group is not available for sale in its present condition is a key judgement in determining that the disposal group is not classified as an asset held for sale at 31 December 2021. The divested business, comprising five manufacturing facilities, together with associated laboratory facilities and sales operations, currently forms part of Croda's integrated operating model and work is ongoing to separate the disposal group, with completion of the transaction expected in summer 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements (continued)\n\n## Group Accounting Policies (continued)\n\nThe critical accounting estimates and assumptions required when preparing the Group's accounts are as follows:\n\n- (i) Post-retirement benefits - as disclosed in note 11, the Group's principal retirement benefit schemes are of the defined benefit type. Year end recognition of the liabilities under these schemes and the valuation of assets held to fund these liabilities require a number of significant assumptions to be made, relating to key financial market indicators such as inflation and expectations on future salary growth and asset returns. These assumptions are made by the Group in conjunction with the schemes' actuaries and the Directors are of the view that any estimation should be appropriate and in line with consensus opinion.\n- (ii) Goodwill impairment - management are required to undertake an annual test for impairment of indefinite lived assets such as goodwill. Accordingly, the Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment and the Group's goodwill value has been supported by the fair value less cost to sell or detailed value in use calculations relating to the recoverable amounts of the underlying Cash Generating Units ('CGUs'). These value in use calculations require the use of estimates to enable the calculation of the net present value of cash flow projections of the relevant CGU. The critical assumptions are as follows:\n- \u00b7 Terminal value growth in EBITDA (calculated as operating profit before depreciation and amortisation) - estimated at 3% unless the profile of a particular CGU warrants a different treatment.\n- \u00b7 Selection of appropriate market participant discount rates to reflect the risks specific to the CGU.\n- \u00b7 Specific cash flow projections including key assumptions on revenue growth and operating margins - generally over a fiveyear period unless the profile of a particular CGU warrants a longer period.\n\nRecoverable amounts currently exceed carrying values including goodwill; however, testing did identify that reasonable possible changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the Iberchem CGUs to be less than the carrying value. The assumptions selected and associated sensitivity analysis are disclosed in note 12. Due to the nature of the Iberchem business, including its low carbon footprint, the key assumptions were not materially impacted by the climate change risks and opportunities set out in the annual report on page 43.\n\n## Changes in accounting policy\n\n- (i) A number of new amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021 and have been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. None of these had a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.\n- (ii) New standards and interpretations not yet adopted - a number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. The Group is assessing the impact of these new standards and the Group's financial reporting will be presented in accordance with these standards from 1 January 2022 or 1 January 2023 as applicable.\n\nCroda International Plc\n\n## Group accounts\n\n## General information\n\nCroda International Plc is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. It is registered in England and Wales and the address of its registered office can be found on page 172.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Parent Company has control. The Parent controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.\n\nThe Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nIdentifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed, in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's share of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\n\nIntra-Group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated.\n\nAccounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.\n\n## Transactions with non-controlling interests\n\nThe Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with the equity owners of the Group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded as equity. Gains or losses on disposals to noncontrolling interests are also recorded in equity.",

        "page_content": "## Intangible assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nOn acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired. Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds such net assets. Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows, known as CGUs. Goodwill is allocated to the CGU that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. For goodwill balances where the relevant group of CGUs exceeds the size of the Group's operating segments, impairment testing is performed at the operating segment level.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised immediately against the goodwill value. The recoverable amount of the CGU is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Fair value less costs to sell is measured on a market-based approach using prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions. Value in use is estimated with reference to estimated future cash flows discounted to net present value using a market participant discount rate that reflects the time value of money and risks specific to the CGU. Typically, the Group's weighted average cost of capital is used as a starting point and then adjusted to reflect the risk profile of a particular CGU if warranted. The Group uses growth estimates that track below the Group's historical growth rates unless the profile of a particular CGU warrants a different treatment.\n\n## Other intangible assets arising on acquisition\n\nOn acquisition, intangible assets other than goodwill are recognised if they can be identified through being separable from the acquired entity or arising from specific contractual or legal rights.\n\nOnce recognised, such intangible assets will be initially valued using an appropriate methodology. For acquisitions in 2021 the following intangible asset types recognised and valuation methodologies applied were:\n\n- \u00b7 Technology processes (relief-from-royalty and replacement cost)\n- \u00b7 Trade names and brands (relief-from-royalty)\n- \u00b7 Customer relationships (income approach)\n\nFollowing initial recognition, the asset will be written down on a straightline basis over its useful life, which range from 7 to 15 years for technology processes and from 6 to 20 years for trade names, brands and customer relationships. Useful lives are regularly reviewed to ensure their continuing relevance.\n\n## Research and development\n\nResearch expenditure, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is charged to the income statement in the year in which it is incurred. Internal development expenditure, whereby research findings are applied to a plan for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes, is charged to the income statement in the year in which it is incurred unless it meets the recognition criteria of IAS 38 'Intangible Assets'. Development uncertainties typically mean that such criteria are not met, most commonly because the Group can only demonstrate the existence of a market at a late stage in the product development cycle, at which point the material element of project spend has already been incurred and charged to the income statement. Where, however, the recognition criteria are met, intangible assets are capitalised and amortised over their useful economic lives from product launch.\n\nIntangible assets relating to products in development are subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date or earlier upon indication of impairment. Any impairment losses are written off to the income statement.\n\n## Computer software\n\nComputer software licences covering a period of greater than a year are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives which range from 3 to 7 years.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes intra-Group sales. The Group recognises revenue on completion of contractual performance obligations, generally when it transfers control over a product or service to a customer.\n\n## Sale of goods\n\nThe principal activity from which the Group generates revenue is the supply of products to customers from its various manufacturing sites and warehouses, and in some limited instances from consignment inventory held on customer sites. Products are supplied under a variety of standard terms and conditions, and in each case, revenue is recognised when contractual performance obligations between the Group and the customer are satisfied. This will typically be on dispatch or delivery. When sales discount and rebate arrangements result in net variable consideration, appropriate provisions are recognised as a deduction from revenue at the point of sale. The Group typically uses the expected value method for estimating rebates, reflecting that such contracts have similar characteristics and a range of possible outcomes. The Group recognises revenue to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue will not be required.\n\n## Interest and dividend income\n\nInterest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.\n\nDividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.\n\nCroda International Plc",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements (continued)\n\n## Group Accounting Policies (continued)\n\n## Segmental reporting\n\nAn operating segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products and services that are subject to risks or returns that are different from those of other segments. Operating segments presented in the financial statements are consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker, which has been identified as the Group Executive Committee.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\n## Pension obligations\n\nThe Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 'Employee Benefits' (revised). In respect of defined benefit plans (pension plans that define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation), obligations are measured at discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value. The assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans are the net of plan obligations and assets. A scheme surplus is only recognised as an asset in the balance sheet when the Group has the unconditional right to future economic benefits in the form of a refund or a reduction in future contributions. For those schemes where an accounting surplus is currently recognised, the Group expects to recover the value through reduced future contributions. No allowance is made in the past service liability in respect of either the future expenses of running the schemes or for non service-related death in service benefits which may arise in the future. The operating costs of such plans are charged to operating profit and the finance costs are recognised as financial income or an expense as appropriate.\n\nService costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise. Remeasurements are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Payments to defined contribution schemes (pension plans under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity) are charged as an expense as they fall due.\n\n## Other post-retirement benefits\n\nSome Group companies provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to their retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using an accounting methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension plans. Remeasurements are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries.\n\n## Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either (i) terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or (ii) providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.\n\nCroda International Plc\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Group operates a number of cash and equity settled, share-based incentive schemes. These are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 'Share-based Payments', which requires an expense to be recognised in the income statement over the vesting period of the options. The expense is based on the fair value of each instrument which is calculated using the Black Scholes or binomial model as appropriate. Any expense is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting for non-market-based performance criteria.\n\n## Currency translations\n\n## Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency'). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Company's functional and presentation currency.\n\n## Transactions and balances\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the end of the financial period. Exchange profits or losses on trading transactions are included in the Group income statement except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.\n\n## Group companies\n\nThe results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:\n\n- (i) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;\n- (ii) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions); and\n- (iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.\n\nOn consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders' equity.\n\nWhen a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.",

        "page_content": "## Taxation\n\nThe charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and for accounting purposes. Temporary differences arise on differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their tax base and primarily relate to the difference between tax allowances on tangible fixed assets and the corresponding depreciation charge, and upon the net pension fund deficit. Full provision is made for the tax effects of these differences. No provision is made for unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries where there is no commitment to remit such earnings.\n\nSimilarly, no provision is made for temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries since realisation of such differences can be controlled and is not probable in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognised, using the balance sheet liability method, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nAll taxation is calculated on the basis of the tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\n## Income statement presentation\n\nThe acquisition of Avanti Polar Lipids, LLC and Fragrance Spanish Topco, S.L. (Iberchem) in 2020 increased acquisition costs and amortisation of acquired intangible assets. To avoid distorting the underlying trend in profitability, the Group adopts the definitions 'Adjusted operating profit', 'Adjusted profit before tax' and 'Adjusted earnings per share'. In each case amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition and exceptional items, including the respective tax effect, are excluded. The Group income statement has been produced in a columnar format to further aid this analysis.\n\n## Exceptional items\n\nExceptional items are those items that in the Directors' view are required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group's financial performance. In the current year exceptional items relate to discount unwind and fair value adjustment in respect of contingent consideration, a pension curtailment gain (arising from transfer of the Dutch scheme to a collective defined contribution arrangement) and acquisition costs and fees incurred in preparation of the disposal of part of the PTIC business. Exceptional items in the prior year related to the delivery of cost saving actions announced in the 2019 full year results, discount unwind in contingent consideration and acquisition costs. Details can be found in note 3 on page 133.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation, with the exception of assets acquired as part of a business combination. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. The Group's policy is to write off the difference between the cost of all property, plant and equipment, except freehold land, and their residual value on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.\n\nReviews are made annually of the estimated remaining lives and residual values of individual productive assets, taking account of commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear, and adjustments are made where appropriate. Under this policy it becomes impractical to calculate average asset lives exactly. However, the total lives range from approximately 15 to 40 years for land and buildings, and 3 to 25 years for plant and equipment. All individual assets are reviewed for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Group's 'plant and equipment' asset class predominantly relates to the value of plant and equipment at the Group's manufacturing facilities. Consequently, the Group does not seek to analyse out of this class other items such as motor vehicles and office equipment.\n\n## Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nThe Group assesses at each year end whether an asset may be impaired. If any evidence exists of impairment, the estimated recoverable amount is compared to the carrying value of the asset and an impairment loss is recognised where appropriate. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's value in use and fair value less costs to sell. In addition to this, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Non-financial assets other than goodwill which have suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.\n\n## Leases\n\nWhen entering into a new contract, the Group assesses whether it is, or contains, a lease. A lease conveys a right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nThe Group recognises a right of use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right of use asset is initially measured at cost, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date and discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, more typically, the Group's incremental borrowing rate (when the implicit rate cannot be readily determined).\n\nThe lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and decreased by lease payments made. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee or changes in the Group's assessment of whether a purchase, extension or termination option is reasonably certain to be exercised.\n\nThe Group adopts recognition exemptions for short-term (less than 12 months) and low value leases and elects not to separate lease components from any associated fixed non-lease components.\n\nThe Group classifies payments of lease liabilities (principal and interest portions) as part of financing activities. Payments of short-term, low value and variable lease components are classified within operating activities.\n\nCroda International Plc",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements (continued)\n\n## Group Accounting Policies (continued)\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Group uses derivative financial instruments where deemed appropriate to hedge its exposure to interest rates and short-term currency rate fluctuations. The Group's accounting policy is set out below.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recorded initially at cost. Subsequent measurement depends on the designation of the instrument as either: (i) a hedge of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedge); or (ii) a hedge of highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedge).\n\n## (i) Fair value hedge\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives, for example interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts, that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.\n\n## (ii) Cash flow hedge\n\nThe Group designates the spot element of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk and applies a hedge ratio of 1:1. The forward elements of the forward exchange contracts are excluded from the designation of the hedging instrument and are separately accounted for as a cost of hedging, which is recognised in equity in a cost of hedging reserve. The Group's policy is for the critical terms of the forward exchange contracts to align with the hedged item.\n\nThe Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item based on the current, amount and timing of the respective cash flows. The Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method. In these hedge relationships, the main sources of ineffectiveness are changes in the time or amount of the hedged transactions.\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss (for instance when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example inventory) or a liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.\n\nWhen a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.\n\nCertain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nCroda International Plc\n\n## Borrowings\n\nBorrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.\n\n## Borrowing costs\n\nGeneral and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.\n\n## Trade and other payables\n\nTrade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. With the exception of contingent consideration and forward foreign exchange contracts, trade and other payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value based on the present value of the expected future payments, discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Continent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in fair value and associated discount unwind are recognised in the income statement. Forward foreign exchange contracts are initially recognised at cost and subsequently measured at fair value on a mark-to-market basis.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable amount on a first in first out basis. Cost comprises all expenditure, including related production overheads, incurred in the normal course of business in bringing the inventory to its location and condition at the balance sheet date. Net realisable amount is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any applicable variable selling costs. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving and defective inventory where appropriate. Profits arising on intra-group sales are eliminated in so far as the product remains in Group inventory at the year end.\n\n## Trade and other receivables\n\nTrade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less impairment losses. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is recognised based on lifetime expected losses, but principally comprises balances where objective evidence exists that the amount will not be collectible. Such amounts are written down to their estimated recoverable amounts, with the charge being made to operating expenses.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows. Cash and bank overdrafts are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, there is an intention to settle on a net basis and interest is charged on a net basis.",

Provisions are made immediately where a legal obligation is identified, can be quantified and it is regarded as more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. The Group does consider the impact of discounting when establishing provisions and provisions are discounted when the impact is material and the timing of cash flows can be estimated with reasonable certainty.\n\n## Share capital\n\n## Investment in own shares\n\n- (i) Employee share ownership trusts - shares acquired by the trustees of the employee share ownership trust (the Trustees), funded by the Company and held for the continuing benefit of the Company are shown as a reduction in equity attributable to owners of the parent. Movements in the year arising from additional purchases by the Trustees of shares or the receipt of funds due to the exercise of options by employees are accounted for within reserves and shown as a movement in equity attributable to owners of the parent in the year. Administration expenses of the trusts are charged to the Company's income statement as incurred.\n- (ii) Treasury shares - where any Group company purchases the Company's equity share capital as treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company's equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company's equity holders.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends on ordinary share capital are recognised as a liability when the liability is irrevocable. Accordingly, final dividends are recognised when approved by shareholders and interim dividends are recognised when paid.\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments in equity securities are measured at fair value, with movements in the fair value being recognised in the income statement or equity on an instrument by instrument basis. Investments in associates are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group's share of results. Investments are subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date or earlier upon indication of impairment.\n\nCroda International Plc",

Movements in contingent consideration have been presented as exceptional as they are not directly representative of the underlying business performance in the period, and therefore this presentation provides a meaningful basis to make comparisons between reporting periods. The pension curtailment gain and business acquisition and disposal costs have been presented as exceptional due to their size and one-off nature. The exceptional items in the prior year related to the delivery of cost saving actions announced in the 2019 full year results, discount unwind in contingent consideration and acquisition costs.\n\nCroda International Plc",

The reported effective corporate tax rate after exceptional items is 21.6% (2020: 25.2%). This year's tax charge benefitted from a one-off settlement of a previous uncertain tax position.\n\nCroda operates in many tax jurisdictions other than the UK, both as a manufacturer and distributor, with the majority of those jurisdictions having rates higher than the UK; considerably so in some cases. It is the exposure to these different tax rates that increases the effective tax rate above the UK standard rate and also makes it difficult to forecast the Group's future tax rate with any certainty given the unpredictable nature of exchange rates, individual economies and tax legislators. Other than the exposure to higher overseas tax rates, there are no significant adjustments between the Group's expected and reported tax charge based on its accounting profit. Given the global nature of the Group, and the number of associated cross-border transactions between connected parties, we are exposed to potential adjustments to the price charged for those transactions by tax authorities. However, the Group carries appropriate provisions relating to the level of risk.\n\nLegislation to increase the UK standard rate of corporation tax from 19% to 25% was substantively enacted on 24 May 2021, effective from 1 April 2023. The calculation of deferred tax balances in the UK have been revised accordingly. Overseas tax is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.\n\nCroda International Plc",

Deferred tax expected to reverse in the year to 31 December 2022 and beyond has been measured using the rate due to prevail in the year of reversal.\n\nDeferred tax assets have been recognised in all material cases where such assets arise, as it is probable the assets will be recovered. At 31 December 2021, no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of \u00a332.6m of losses across the Group as it is not considered probable that there will be future taxable profits against which these losses can be offset.\n\nDeferred tax is only recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries to the extent that remittance is expected in the foreseeable future. If all earnings were remitted, an additional \u00a39.3m (2020: \u00a36.6m) of tax would be payable.\n\nAll movements on deferred tax balances have been recognised in the income statement with the exception of the items shown in note 5(b).\n\nOf the gross deferred tax assets, \u00a310.4m are expected to reverse within 12 months of the balance sheet date. No material reversal of any of the deferred tax liability is expected within 12 months of the balance sheet date based on the Group's current capital expenditure programme.\n\nCroda International Plc",

All of the Group's final salary type pension schemes (which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life based on salary in the final years leading up to retirement) are closed to future service accrual with the exception of a small number of 'grandfathered' employees in the US scheme.\n\nThe UK scheme operated on a final salary basis until 5 April 2016, following which the scheme changed to a Career Average Revalued Earnings (CARE) defined benefit scheme, with annual pensionable earnings capped and pensions in payment indexed based on CPI (previously RPI) for service accrued from 6 April 2016. This change is expected to reduce the future comparable cost and risk attached to the UK scheme. The US scheme operates a cash balance pension scheme that provides a guaranteed rate of return on pension contributions until retirement (other than for 'grandfathered' employees). From 1 October 2017 the US scheme was closed to new joiners, who will receive defined contribution benefits. The US plans also do not generally receive inflationary increases once in payment. With the exception of this difference in inflationary risk, the Group's main defined benefit pension schemes continue to face materially similar risks, as described on pages 142 and 143.\n\nThe majority of benefit payments are from trustee administered funds; however, there are also a number of unfunded plans where the relevant Group company meets the benefit payment obligation as it falls due.\n\nPlan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the trustees (or equivalent) and their composition. Responsibility for governance of the schemes, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, predominantly lies with the particular scheme's board of trustees with appropriate input from the relevant Group company. The board of trustees must be composed of representatives in accordance with each scheme's regulations and any relevant legislation.\n\nDuring the period the Group's primary Netherlands scheme was converted into a collective defined contribution scheme for both past and future service, as allowed under local regulations and as agreed with the representative trade unions. This change resulted in the settlement of the defined benefit scheme's assets and liabilities and a corresponding curtailment gain of \u00a311.2m on cessation of defined benefit accrual, which has been recognised in the Group income statement. All parties had formally agreed to the settlement by 30 November 2021, therefore the settlement accounting is based on the valuation of the scheme assets and liabilities at this date. Under the new scheme, employer contributions have been fixed for the next two years initially, and the level thereafter will be subject to agreement with employees and the trade unions. The employer is not exposed to demographic and financial risks, as the benefits provided will be those that can be afforded by the scheme only, without recourse to the employer, therefore this scheme is accounted for as a defined contribution scheme.\n\nCroda International Plc",

Where credible data exists, actual plan experience is taken into account. No adjustments have been made to mortality assumptions as at 31 December 2021 to reflect the potential effects of COVID-19 as the actual plan experience is not yet available and as it is too soon to make a judgement on the impact of the pandemic on future mortality improvements. The mortality experience analysis for the scheme will be carried out in the future as part of the 30 September 2023 funding valuation for the UK Croda Pension Scheme. Applying the mortality tables adopted, the expected future average lifetime of members currently at age 65 and members at age 65 in 20 years' time is as follows:\n\nAge 65 in\n\n|        | Current age 65   | Current age 65   | Current age 65   | Current age 65   | 20 years   | 20 years    |\n|--------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------|-------------|\n|        | UK               | US               | Netherlands      | UK               | US         | Netherlands |\n| Male   | 20.1             | 20.9             | 21.1             | 21.4             | 22.1       | 22.6        |\n| Female | 23.3             | 22.8             | 25.0             | 24.7             | 23.9       | 26.4        |\n\nThe sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the significant assumptions is as follows:\n\n|                                                          | Impact on retirement benefit obligation   | Impact on retirement benefit obligation   | Impact on retirement benefit obligation   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|                                                          | Sensitivity                               | Of increase                               | Of decrease                               |\n| Discount rate                                            | 0.5%                                      | -8.5%                                     | 9.7%                                      |\n| Inflation rate                                           | 0.5%                                      | 6.5%                                      | -6.0%                                     |\n| Mortality (assumes a one-year change in life expectancy) | 1 year                                    | 4.9%                                      | -4.8%                                     |\n\nThe above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting year) has been applied as when calculating the retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Group balance sheet.

The schemes hold a significant proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term while providing volatility and risk in the short term. As the schemes mature, the Group intends to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets that better match the liabilities. However, the Group and the pension trustees (Trustees) believe that due to the long term nature of the scheme liabilities and the strength of the supporting Group, a level of continuing equity investment is an appropriate element of the Group's long term strategy to manage the schemes efficiently. See below for more details on the Group's asset-liability matching strategy.\n\n## Changes in bond yields\n\nA decrease in corporate bond yields will increase scheme liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes' bond holdings.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nSome of the Group's pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. However, the level of inflationary increases are usually capped to protect the scheme against extreme inflation. The majority of the schemes' assets are either unaffected by inflation in the case of fixed interest bonds or loosely correlated in the case of equities, meaning that an increase in inflation will thus increase the deficit. In the US schemes, the pensions in payment are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.\n\n## Life expectancy\n\nThe majority of the schemes' obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the schemes' liabilities. This is particularly significant in the UK scheme, where inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy. In the case of the funded schemes, the Group ensures that the investment positions are managed within an asset-liability matching (ALM) framework that has been developed to achieve long-term investments that are cognisant of the obligations under the pension schemes. Within this framework, the Group's ALM objective is to match a portion of assets to the pension obligations by investing in long-term fixed interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due and in the appropriate currency. The Group and Trustees actively monitor how the duration and the expected yield of the investments are matching the expected cash outflows arising from the pension obligations. The Group has not changed the processes used to manage its risks from previous years.\n\nInvestments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets. A significant portion of assets in 2021 consists of equities and bonds, although the schemes also invest in property, cash and infrastructure funds. The Group believes that equities offer the best returns over the long term with an acceptable level of risk. The UK scheme makes use of a portfolio of derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate and inflation risk.\n\nThe latest triennial valuation of the UK scheme was completed as at 30 September 2020. As a result, no deficit funding payments to this scheme are required prior to completion of the next triennial valuation (as at 30 September 2023). The funding review of our US scheme is undertaken annually. As at 1 December 2020 the scheme was 142.8% funded.\n\nCroda International Plc",

Intangible assets continued\n\n## Impairment testing for CGUs containing goodwill\n\nThe Group's goodwill balance predominantly relates to the value of commercial and other synergies arising from the combination of acquired businesses with Croda's established global sales, marketing and R&D networks. This goodwill is allocated to the Group's Cash Generating Units (CGUs) expected to benefit from that combination based on the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate independent cash inflows.\n\nAs discussed in the accounting policies note on page 127, goodwill is tested at each year end for impairment with reference to the relevant CGU's recoverable amount compared to the unit's carrying value including goodwill. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows relevant to the acquisition generating the goodwill. The recoverable amount is based on the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use calculations using discounted cash flow projections with the following key assumptions:\n\n- \u00b7 Terminal value growth rates - set for each CGU with reference to the long-term growth rate for the market and territory in which the CGU operates\n- \u00b7 Cash flow projections - based on key assumptions including revenue growth, operating margins and forecast period.\n- \u00b7 Discount rate - set using a weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the specific risk profile of each CGU\n\nThe carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to CGUs as follows:\n\n|                          | 2021                 | 2021                    | 2021      | 2020                 | 2020                    | 2020      |\n|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-----------|----------------------|-------------------------|-----------|\n|                          | Standalone  CGUs  \u00a3m | Allocated  goodwill  \u00a3m | Total  \u00a3m | Standalone  CGUs  \u00a3m | Allocated  goodwill  \u00a3m | Total  \u00a3m |\n| Consumer Care            | 385.4                | 210.6                   | 596.0     | 390.4                | 214.7                   | 605.1     |\n| Life Sciences            | 151.2                | 69.5                    | 220.7     | 156.6                | 69.8                    | 226.4     |\n| Performance Technologies | 24.3                 | 4.4                     | 28.7      | 24.3                 | 4.5                     | 28.8      |\n| Industrial Chemicals     | 6.6                  | -                       | 6.6       | 6.4                  | -                       | 6.4       |\n|                          | 567.5                | 284.5                   | 852.0     | 577.7                | 289.0                   | 866.7     |\n\nThe allocated goodwill primarily relates to \u00a359m (2020: \u00a363m) associated with the 2020 acquisition of Iberchem as it relates to revenue synergies with Croda's existing Consumer Care business and \u00a3192m (2020: \u00a3192m) associated with the 2006 acquisition of Uniqema (with all other balances individually less than \u00a310m). Due to the geographical and operational scale of the Uniqema acquisition, this goodwill balance is tested for impairment at an operating segment level. Standalone CGUs operate independently of the Group's core regional operating assets, are capable of generating largely independent cash inflows and are therefore annually tested separately for impairment.\n\nFor impairment testing performed at an operating segment level, cash flow projections are based on the Group's current year results and a growth rate of 3% (an appropriate view based on past experience reflecting the market and territories in which the Group operates), discounted using a weighted average cost of capital, which for these purposes has been calculated to be approximately 8.5% pre-tax (2020: 8.3%). No reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the operating segments to be less than their carrying value. Based on the testing performed, no impairment has been recognised for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\n## Standalone CGUs\n\nThe carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to Standalone CGUs as follows:\n\n|                       |   2021  \u00a3m | 2020  \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------|------------|------------|\n| Incotec               |       67.6 | 72.1       |\n| Biosector             |       24.6 | 26.2       |\n| Sipo                  |       22.1 | 21.3       |\n| Ionphase              |        6.5 | 7.0        |\n| Rewitec               |        2.3 | 2.4        |\n| Avanti                |       59   | 58.3       |\n| Iberchem - Fragrances |      242.2 | 258.5      |\n| Iberchem - Flavours   |      123.6 | 131.9      |\n| Alban Muller          |        6.3 | -          |\n| Parfex                |       13.3 | -          |\n|                       |      567.5 | 577.7      |\n\nCroda International Plc",

        "page_content": "For impairment testing performed at a Standalone CGU level, the recoverable amount for Sipo, Ionphase and Rewitec CGUs was based on fair value less cost to sell as they form part of the Performance Technologies and Industrial Chemicals business disposal. For other Standalone CGUs the recoverable amount was based on value in use calculations. Incotec and Avanti cash flow projections have been based on specific estimates for five years, with Biosector and Iberchem CGUs using 10-year projections to better reflect the industry and territory in which they operate and the period through to when they are expected to reach a steady state of operation. Unless otherwise stated, these cash flow projections assume an appropriate view of past experience, specifically that the market share will not change significantly and that gross and operating margins will remain broadly constant. The terminal value growth rates and discount rates applied in these CGU level calculations are set out below:\n\nTerminal value\n\nPre-tax\n\n|                       |      |                   | discount rate   | discount rate   |\n|-----------------------|------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                       | 2021 | growth rate  2020 | 2021            | 2020            |\n| Incotec               | 3.0% | 3.0%              | 8.9%            | 8.5%            |\n| Biosector             | 3.0% | 3.0%              | 11.9%           | 11.0%           |\n| Avanti                | 3.0% | n/a               | 11.0%           | n/a             |\n| Iberchem - Fragrances | 3.0% | n/a               | 10.5%           | n/a             |\n| Iberchem - Flavours   | 3.0% | n/a               | 10.4%           | n/a             |\n\nBased on the annual impairment testing performed, no impairment has been recognised for the year ended 31 December 2021, and all Standalone CGUs remain on track to perform to our long-term expectations. In forming this conclusion, the Directors have reviewed sensitivity analysis which considered all reasonably possible downsides on key assumptions, both individually and in combination, and considered whether these would give rise to an impairment. This analysis concluded that no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the Standalone CGUs to be less than the carrying value, other than for the Iberchem CGUs.\n\nFor the Iberchem CGUs, the assumptions underpinning the cash flow projections used in the value in use calculation reflect delivery of the acquisition business plan, which the business remains on track to achieve in the medium to long term. These projections use an appropriate view of past experience, specifically that operating margins will improve and sales growth targets will be achieved resulting in approximately 10% compound average growth rates ('CAGR') at a sales level and operating profit level over the period. The estimated recoverable amount of the CGUs exceeded their carrying value by approximately \u00a327m (Fragrances: \u00a317m, Flavours: \u00a310m) and therefore the Directors concluded that no impairment was required; however, the calculations are sensitive to changes in key assumptions. The key assumptions considered by the Directors, where a reasonably possible change could give rise to an impairment, were the projection period operating profit CAGR, terminal value growth rate and discount rate. If the Fragrances/Flavours operating profit CAGR assumptions were reduced by 0.4%/0.6% or the pre-tax discount rates increased by 0.2%/0.3%, then the CGUs' recoverable amount would be reduced to a level comparable with the carrying value. A 1% decrease in the terminal value growth rate, which, although not management's current expectation, is considered to be reasonably possible, would lead to an impairment charge of \u00a345m (Fragrances: \u00a332m, Flavours: \u00a313m).\n\nGoodwill arising in the year was assessed for impairment with reference to the consideration paid and no impairment has been recognised. This goodwill will be subject to the same annual review process commencing the year after initial recognition. Parfex goodwill will be tested alongside the Iberchem - Fragrances CGU in line with the level at which goodwill is monitored.\n\nCroda International Plc",

The overdue receivables against which no provision has been made relate to a number of customers for whom there is no recent history of default, nor any other indication that settlement will not be forthcoming. The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets and are considered to be fully recoverable.

During the period, contingent consideration has decreased by \u00a36.2m due to fair value movements and \u00a39.2m due to payments, increasing by \u00a33.3m for the unwind of discounting and \u00a30.1m for foreign exchange.

Interest is charged on this agreement at a floating rate based on ICE GBP LIBOR, ICE LIBOR or EURIBOR, depending upon the drawdown currency, plus a variable margin. Due to the cessation of ICE GBP LIBOR at the end of 2021, the Group updated the existing 2019 Club facility to include SONIA (Risk Free Rate) for GBP based borrowings. Until 31 December 2021, GBP borrowings were drawn using ICE GBP LIBOR. In July 2020 the Group arranged a three-year amortising Term Loan for US$200m. Interest is charged on this agreement at a floating rate based on ICE LIBOR plus a variable margin. The margin the Group pays on this borrowing over and above standard rates is determined by the Group's net debt to EBITDA ratio.\n\nCroda International Plc",

In January 2020 the existing US$100m fixed rate 10year note matured and was repaid, this was replaced with a new US$100m fixed rate 10-year note (27 January 2020). On 27 June 2016, the Group issued \u00a3100m and \u20ac100m of fixed rate notes. On 6 June 2019, the Group issued a further \u00a365m, \u20ac50m and US$60m of fixed rate notes.\n\nThe table below details a comparison of the book and fair values of the Group's financial assets and liabilities. Where there are no readily available market values to determine fair values, cash flows relating to the various instruments have been discounted at prevailing interest and exchange rates to give an estimate of fair value.\n\n|                                       | Book  value  2021  \u00a3m   | Fair  value  2021  \u00a3m   | Book  value  2020  \u00a3m   | Fair  value  2020  \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Cash deposits                         | 112.8                   | 112.8                   | 106.5                   | 106.5                   |\n| Other investments                     | 3.3                     | 3.3                     | 5.2                     | 5.2                     |\n| 2019 Club facility due 2026           | (262.2)                 | (262.2)                 | (218.1)                 | (218.1)                 |\n| US$200m 3 year term loan due 2023     | (125.4)                 | (125.4)                 | (145.5)                 | (145.5)                 |\n| US$100m 3.75% fixed rate 10 year note | (74.1)                  | (78.2)                  | (73.2)                  | (82.9)                  |\n| \u20ac30m 1.08% fixed rate 7 year note     | (25.2)                  | (25.5)                  | (26.9)                  | (27.5)                  |\n| \u20ac70m 1.43% fixed rate 10 year note    | (58.7)                  | (61.5)                  | (62.7)                  | (67.0)                  |\n| \u00a330m 2.54% fixed rate 7 year note     | (30.0)                  | (30.3)                  | (30.0)                  | (30.9)                  |\n| \u00a370m 2.80% fixed rate 10 year note    | (70.0)                  | (71.9)                  | (70.0)                  | (75.2)                  |\n| \u20ac50m 1.18% fixed rate 8 year note     | (41.9)                  | (43.5)                  | (44.8)                  | (47.5)                  |\n| \u00a365m 2.46% fixed rate 8 year note     | (65.0)                  | (65.7)                  | (65.0)                  | (68.9)                  |\n| US$60m 3.70% fixed rate 10 year note  | (44.5)                  | (47.4)                  | (43.9)                  | (49.9)                  |\n| Other bank borrowings                 | (34.0)                  | (34.0)                  | (33.9)                  | (33.9)                  |\n| Other loans                           | (14.5)                  | (14.5)                  | (11.3)                  | (11.3)                  |\n| Contingent consideration              | (26.1)                  | (26.1)                  | (38.1)                  | (38.1)                  |\n| Lease liabilities                     | (90.5)                  | (90.5)                  | (81.7)                  | (81.7)                  |\n| Forward foreign currency contracts    | (2.3)                   | (2.3)                   | -                       | -                       |\n\nFor financial instruments with a remaining life of greater than one-year, fair values are based on cash flows discounted at prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, the fair value of cash deposits and short-term borrowings approximates to the book value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The same applies to trade and other receivables and payables excluded from the above analysis.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments measured at fair value use the following hierarchy:\n\n- \u00b7 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1)\n- \u00b7 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2)\n- \u00b7 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3).\n\nAll of the Group's financial instruments are classed as level 2 with the exception of contingent consideration, other investments and lease liabilities, which are classed as level 3.\n\nCroda International Plc",

        "page_content": "## Borrowing facilities\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had undrawn committed facilities of \u00a3334.4m (2020: \u00a3378.3m). In addition, the Group had other undrawn facilities of \u00a340.1m (2020: \u00a350.1m) available. Of the Group's total committed facilities of \u00a31,225.8m, \u00a31,211.0m expire after 2022. New and repaid borrowings disclosed in the Group Statement of Cash Flows reflect routine short-term cash management, comprising regular monthly drawdowns and repayments on the Group's revolving credit facilities.\n\n## Financial risk factors\n\nThe Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk. The Group's overall risk management strategy is approved by the Board and implemented and reviewed by the Risk Management Committee. Detailed financial risk management is then delegated to the Group Finance department which has a specific policy manual that sets out guidelines to manage financial risk. Regular reports are received from all sectors and regional operating units to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate action may be taken. In the management definition of capital the Group includes ordinary and preference share capital and net debt.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe Group operates internationally and is exposed to currency risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US Dollar and the Euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations. Entities in the Group use foreign currency bank balances to manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities. The Group's risk management policy is to manage transactional risk up to three months forward. The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Group's foreign operations is not specifically hedged but is reduced primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies where it is efficient to do so. Currency exposure arising from significant one-off transactions (for example acquisitions or disposals) is reviewed and hedged through forward contracts if required.\n\nFor 2021, had the Group's basket of reporting currencies been 10% weaker/stronger than the actual rates experienced, post-tax profit for the year would have been \u00a329.4m (2020: \u00a318.9m) lower/higher than reported, primarily as a result of the translation of the profits of the Group's overseas entities, and equity would have been \u00a3156.5m (2020: \u00a3141.5m) lower/higher.\n\n## Cash flow hedging\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group held two instruments to hedge exposures to changes in foreign currency on a highly probable future business disposal and debt repayment (hedged items), with a maturity profile of less than one year. The combined nominal value of the contracts was \u00a3601.9m and the average forward contract rates were 0.85 (EUR:GBP) and 1.12 (EUR:USD). These contracts are contingent on the successful completion of the business disposal and were designated as cash flow hedges. These hedging activities provide the Group with certainty over approximately 85% of its estimated FX exposure on these forecast future transactions.\n\nThe combined carrying amount of the contracts was a \u00a32.3m liability at 31 December 2021, reported within trade and other payables. At 31 December 2021, the cash flow hedging reserve was \u00a33.0m credit (2020: \u00a3nil), net of \u00a30.7m tax, and the costs of hedging reserve was \u00a34.9m debit (2020: \u00a3nil), net of \u00a31.1m tax. There was no hedge ineffectiveness or reclassifications recognised in the income statement during the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nA 10% strengthening/weakening of GBP, Euro or USD at 31 December 2021 would have affected the measurement of the forward contracts and therefore equity by approximately \u00a356m. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant and ignores any impact of forecast future transactions.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group has both interest bearing assets and liabilities. In 2016, the Group had a policy of maintaining no more than 60% of its gross borrowings at fixed interest rates in normal circumstances. During 2016, the Group increased its amount of fixed rate debt following payment of the \u00a3136m special dividend and consequent increase in core debt requirements. Notes were issued in the amounts of \u00a3100m and \u20ac100m with an average maturity of 3.6 years and interest rate of 2.08%. During 2017, the policy formally increased the upper limit for fixed rate debt to 75% of gross borrowings. During 2019, the Group increased its amount of fixed rate debt following payment of the \u00a3151.5m special dividend. Notes were issued in the amounts of \u00a365m, \u20ac50m and US$60m with an average maturity of 6.1 years and interest rate of 2.47%. In January 2020 the Group repaid its US$100m 10-year loan note carrying a fixed rate of 5.94% and replaced it with a US$100m 10-year loan note carrying a fixed rate of 3.75%. At 31 December 2021, approximately 45% of Group borrowings were at fixed rates.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, aside from the loan notes referred to above, all Group debt and cash was exposed to repricing within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group's fixed rate debt was at a weighted average rate of 2.53% (2020: 2.50%). The Group's floating rate liabilities are predominantly based on LIBOR and its overseas equivalents.\n\nBased on the above, had interest rates moved by 10 basis points in the territories where the Group has substantial borrowings, post-tax profits would have moved by \u00a30.5m (2020: \u00a30.4m) due to a change in interest expense on the Group's floating rate borrowings.\n\nCroda International Plc",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements (continued)\n\n## Notes to the Group Accounts (continued)\n\n## 20. Borrowings, other financial liabilities and other financial assets continued\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient funds available for operations and planned investments.\n\nOn a regular basis, management monitors forecasts of the Group's cash flows against both internal targets and those targets imposed by external lenders. The Group has substantial committed, unused facilities and the Directors are confident this situation will remain the case for the foreseeable future.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history. Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high-credit quality financial institutions. The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any individual financial institution.\n\n## Capital risk management\n\nThe Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, as well as maintaining an optimal capital structure to reduce overall cost of capital.\n\nIn order to maintain this optimal structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid, issue new shares, return capital to shareholders or dispose of assets to reduce net debt. Given the Group's strong balance sheet and sustained trading growth, the Group announced a dividend policy in 2011 of paying a dividend of between 40% and 50% of sustainable earnings. Further details can be found in the Finance Review on pages 46 to 49.\n\nUnderlying growth coupled to Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is the key perceived driver of shareholder value within the Group. The Group's ROIC now stands at 14.2% against a post-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of 6.4%, thus hitting the Group's target of maintaining ROIC at two to three times WACC. In addition, the Group employs two widely used ratios to measure its ability to service its debt. Both net debt/EBITDA and EBITDA interest cover were well ahead of target in 2021. Further details can be found in the Finance Review on pages 46 to 49. The Group was in compliance with its covenant requirements throughout the year. Additional information on progress against Key Performance Indicators can be found on pages 44 and 45.\n\n## 21.

Provisions for remediation costs are made when there is a present obligation, it is probable that expenditures for remediation work will be required and the cost can be estimated within a reasonable range of possible outcomes. The costs are based on currently available facts and prior experience. Environmental liabilities are recorded at the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled at the balance sheet date. Remediation of environmental damage typically takes a long time to complete due to the substantial amount of planning and regulatory approvals normally required before remediation activities can begin. In addition, increases in or releases of environmental provisions may be necessary whenever new developments occur or additional information becomes available. Consequently, environmental provisions can change significantly and the timing and quantum of costs are inherently uncertain. The level of environmental provision is based on management's best estimate of the most likely outcome for each individual exposure.\n\nThe Group has also considered the impact of discounting on its provisions and has concluded that, as a consequence of the significant utilisation expected in a relatively short timescale, the impact is not material.\n\nCroda International Plc",

The PSP provides for awards of free shares (i.e. either conditional shares or nil-cost options) normally made annually which vest after three years dependent upon an EPS performance related sliding scale (non-market condition), an NPP growth measure (non-market condition), sustainability conditions in relation to decarbonisation roadmaps and emissions (non-market conditions) and the Group's total shareholder return (market condition). The PSP is discussed in detail in the Directors' Remuneration Report (pages 84 to 108). Shares (on an after-tax basis) are subject to a two-year post vesting holding period. For options granted in the year, the fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation of the value are as follows:\n\n|                                     | 2021  2020             | 2021  2020             | 2021  2020             | 2021  2020             | 2021  2020             | 2021  2020             |\n|-------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                     | Market  condition      | Non-market  condition  | Market  condition      | Non-market  condition  | Market  condition      | Non-market  condition  |\n| Grant date                          | 24 Mar                 | 24 Mar                 | 29 Apr                 | 29 Apr                 | 25 Mar                 | 25 Mar                 |\n|                                     | 2021                   | 2021                   | 2020                   | 2020                   | 2020                   | 2020                   |\n| Share price at grant date           | 6401p                  | 6401p                  | 4936p                  | 4936p                  | 4280p                  | 4280p                  |\n| Number of employees                 | 68                     | 68                     | 2                      | 2                      | 57                     | 57                     |\n| Shares under conditional award      | 45,546                 | 84,585                 | 16,956                 | 31,491                 | 44,053                 | 81,812                 |\n| Vesting period                      | Three                  | Three                  | Three                  | Three                  | Three                  | Three                  |\n|                                     | years                  | years                  | years                  | years                  | years                  | years                  |\n| Expected volatility                 | 20%                    | 20%                    | 20%                    | 20%                    | 20%                    | 20%                    |\n| Dividend yield                      | 1.4%                   | 1.4%                   | 1.8%                   | 1.8%                   | 2.1%                   | 2.1%                   |\n| Possibility of forfeiture           | 3.45% p.a.             | 3.45% p.a.             | 3.45% p.a.             | 3.45% p.a.             | 3.45% p.a.             | 3.45% p.a.             |\n| Fair value per option at grant date | 2420p                  | 6136p                  | 3352p                  | 4676p                  | 3022p                  | 4021p                  |\n| Option pricing model                | Closed form  valuation | Closed form  valuation | Closed form  valuation | Closed form  valuation | Closed form  valuation | Closed form  valuation |\n\n| A reconciliation of option movements over the year is as follows:               | 2021      | 2021                               | 2020      | 2020                                |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                 | Number    | Weighted  average  exercise  price | Number    | Weighted  average  exercise   price |\n| Outstanding at 1 January                                                        | 461,005   | -                                  | 513,956   | -                                   |\n| Granted                                                                         | 130,131   | -                                  | 174,312   | -                                   |\n| Forfeited                                                                       | (108,077) | -                                  | (112,018) | -                                   |\n| Exercised                                                                       | (56,759)  | -                                  | (115,245) | -                                   |\n| Outstanding at 31 December                                                      | 426,300   | -                                  | 461,005   | -                                   |\n| For options exercised in year, weighted average share price at date of exercise |           | 6205p                              |           | 4259p                               |\n| Weighted average remaining life at 31 December (years)                          | 1.3       |                                    | 1.3       |                                     |\n\n## Croda International Plc Deferred Bonus Share Plan ('DBSP')\n\nThe DBSP scheme was established in 2014. Under the DBSP, one third of any annual bonuses due to certain senior executives are deferred. The size of award is determined by the amount of the total bonus divided by one third and converted into a number of Croda shares using the market value of shares at the time the award is granted. Awards are increased by the number of shares equating to the equivalent value of any dividend paid during the option period. The awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant unless the recipient has been dismissed for cause. No further awards were granted after 2019. There are no performance conditions applied to the award. The DBSP is also discussed in the Directors' Remuneration Report (pages 84 to 108).\n\nCroda International Plc",

Acquisition-related costs of \u00a31.5m have been charged to administration expenses in the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2021 (2020: \u00a311.7m). Post-acquisition, Alban Muller and Parfex contributed combined revenue of \u00a323.3m and a small adjusted operating profit. Had the acquisitions been made on 1 January 2021, the Group's revenue would have been \u00a31,924.7m with adjusted operating profit of \u00a3469.8m.\n\n## 2020 Acquisitions\n\nOn 12 August 2020, the Group acquired 100% of the shares and voting interests of Avanti Polar Lipids, LLC ('Avanti'), a knowledge-intensive leader in lipid-based drug delivery technologies for next generation pharmaceuticals. Based in Alabama in the US, Avanti creates and makes high-purity polar lipids that are increasingly being used as delivery systems for complex therapeutic drugs and in next-generation mRNA vaccines. The acquisition will continue to operate under its existing brand, led by the current management team, and will form part of our Health Care business (Life Sciences sector). The acquisition will more than double Croda's research and development (R&D) capability in drug delivery and also provide a new channel to market for Croda's ingredients for early-stage pharmaceutical research. Avanti was acquired for total consideration of \u00a3173.9m, with identifiable net assets of \u00a3112.8m, generating goodwill of \u00a361.1m. Total consideration for Avanti is inclusive of \u00a335.5m contingent consideration, representing the gross fair value at the date of acquisition of \u00a342.1m before discounting. The additional consideration is payable semi-annually over three years based on the revenue from near-term commercial opportunities using Avanti's lipid-based solutions which were not included in the valuation for payment of the initial consideration.\n\nOn 24 November 2020, the Group acquired 100% of the shares and voting interests of Fragrance Spanish Topco, S.L. trading as Iberchem ('Iberchem'), a leading global fragrances and flavours ('F&F') company. Headquartered in Murcia, Spain, Iberchem has approximately 850 employees, 14 manufacturing facilities, 10 R&D centres and a commercial presence in 120 countries. The acquisition will form part of the new Consumer Care sector from 2021. The acquisition will create a new full service formulation and fragrance offering for Personal Care and Home Care as well as providing access to a high growth adjacency in the global F&F market with significant exposure to emerging markets. Iberchem was acquired for consideration of \u00a3756.5m, with identifiable net assets of \u00a3304.7m, generating goodwill of \u00a3454.0m.\n\nDuring 2021, the Group completed the fair value review relating to its 2020 acquisitions. This review did not identify any changes to the asset base or goodwill.\n\nCroda International Plc",

These policies have been applied consistently to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## A. Accounting policies\n\n## Basis of accounting\n\nThe Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 (FRS 100) issued by the Financial Reporting Council. These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework ('FRS 101'). In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of UK-adopted international accounting standards, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, in compliance with the provisions of the Act and the requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority.\n\nAs permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under the standard in relation to share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions. Where required, equivalent disclosures are provided in the Group financial statements of Croda International Plc.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe financial statements which appear on pages 162 to 167 have been prepared on a going concern basis as, after making appropriate enquiries, including a review of forecasts, budgets and banking facilities, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence.\n\n## Principal accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies which have been applied by the Company when preparing the financial statements are in accordance with FRS 101. FRS 101 is based on the recognition and measurement requirements of Adopted IFRSs, under which the Group financial statements have been prepared. As a result, the accounting policies of the Company are consistent with those used by the Group as presented on pages 125 to 131, except for those relating to the recognition and measurement of goodwill and the recognition of revenue, which are not directly relevant to the Company financial statements. Investments are held at cost less accumulated impairment. Investments are subject to impairment testing upon indication of impairment, at which point the carrying value is reviewed against the underlying net assets or forecast cash generation of the entity.\n\nThe Group accounting policy for financial risk factors is also relevant to the preparation of the Company financial statements and is disclosed on pages 153 and 154.\n\n## B. Profit and loss account\n\nOf the Group's profit for the year, \u00a32.2m (2020: \u00a343.0m) is included in the profit and loss account of the Company which was approved by the Board on 28 February 2022 but which is not presented as permitted by Section 408 Companies Act 2006.\n\nIncluded in the Company profit and loss account is a charge of \u00a30.2m (2020: \u00a30.1m) in respect of the Company's audit fee.\n\n## C.

A full reconciliation of the Group retirement benefit obligation can be found in note 11 of the Group financial statements on pages 139 to 143. The table below shows the movement in the obligation during the year.\n\n|                                          | 2021  \u00a3m   | 2020  \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Opening balance:                         |            |            |\n| Assets                                   | 56.0       | 53.2       |\n| Liabilities                              | (56.7)     | (55.2)     |\n| Net opening retirement benefit liability | (0.7)      | (2.0)      |\n| Movements in the year:                   |            |            |\n| Service cost - current                   | (0.8)      | (0.7)      |\n| Contributions                            | 0.8        | 1.4        |\n| Remeasurements                           | 1.5        | 0.6        |\n| Closing balance                          | 0.8        | (0.7)      |\n\n## L. Share-based payments\n\nThe total charge for the year in respect of share-based remuneration schemes was \u00a35.9m (2020: \u00a31.2m). The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.\n\nThe key elements of each scheme along with the assumptions employed to arrive at the charge in the profit and loss account are set out in note 23 to the Group financial statements.\n\n## M. Contingent liabilities\n\nThe Company has guaranteed loan capital and bank overdrafts of subsidiary undertakings amounting to \u00a3272.3m (2020: \u00a3285.3m).\n\n## N. Dividends\n\nDetails of dividends are disclosed in note 8 of the Group financial statements.\n\n## O. Related party transactions\n\nThe Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 101 from disclosing transactions with other Group undertakings. There were no other related party transactions during the year. Information on the Group can be found in note 27 on page 160 of the Group financial statements.\n\nCroda International Plc",

To register, shareholders will require their investor code (IVC): this is an 11 digit number starting with five or six zeros and can be found on your dividend tax voucher or your share certificate. Receiving corporate communications by email has a number of benefits including being more environmentally friendly, reducing unnecessary waste, faster notification of information to shareholders and eventually leading to a reduction in company costs.\n\nShareholders who register on the above website can also check their shareholding, view their dividend history, choose their dividend options, register changes of address and dividend mandate instructions.\n\n## Share price information\n\nThe latest ordinary share price is available on our website at www.croda.com.\n\nThe middle market values of the listed share capital at 31 December 2021, or last date traded*, were as follows:\n\nOrdinary shares\n\n10045p\n\n5.9% preference shares\n\n105.5p*\n\n6.6% preference shares\n\n106.5p*\n\n## Dividend reinvestment plan ('DRIP')\n\nOrdinary shareholders may wish to know about this plan, which allows you to use your dividends to buy further shares in Croda. The DRIP is offered to UK shareholders only by Link Group which is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.\n\nFor information and an application pack please call 0371 664 0381. Calls are charged at the standard geographic rate and will vary by provider. Calls outside the United Kingdom will be charged at the applicable international rate.

Alternatively you can email shares@linkgroup.co.uk or log on to www.signalshares.com.\n\n## Payment of dividends\n\nYou can arrange to have your dividends paid direct to your bank account. This means that:\n\n- \u00b7 your dividend reaches your bank account on the payment date;\n- \u00b7 it is more secure - cheques can sometimes get lost in the post;\n- \u00b7 you don't have the inconvenience of depositing a cheque; and\n- \u00b7 helps reduce cheque fraud.\n\nIf you have a UK bank account you can sign up to this service on Signal Shares (www.signalshares.com by clicking on 'your dividend options' and following the on-screen instructions) or by contacting the Customer Support Centre.\n\n## Overseas shareholders - choose to receive your next dividend in your local currency\n\nIf you live outside the UK, Link has partnered with Deutsche Bank to provide you with a service that will convert Sterling dividends into your local currency at a competitive rate.\n\nYou can choose to receive payment directly to your local bank account or alternatively you can be sent a currency draft. You can sign up to this service on Signal Shares (www.signalshares.com by clicking on 'your dividend options' and following the on-screen instructions) or by contacting the Customer Support Centre. For further information contact Link:\n\nBy phone - UK 0371 664 0300, from overseas +44 (0)371 664 0300. Calls are charged at the standard geographic rate and will vary by provider.

They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for an upfront payment. While high profits are promised, if you buy or sell shares in this way you will probably lose your money.\n\n5,000 people contact the Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA') about share fraud each year, with victims losing an average of \u00a320,000.\n\nCroda International Plc",
