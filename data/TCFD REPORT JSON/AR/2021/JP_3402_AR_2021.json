(Toray) reported in January 2022 that it had failed to submit the proper samples of certain resin products intended for certification testing by Underwriters Laboratories LLC (UL), a global thirdparty safety science organization. In this case, Toray submitted  samples  that  di/ffered  from  the  grades specified for testing in regard to the standards indicating  flame  retardancy  performance  of  resins  as\n\n## alue solutions of quality to its ize a\n\nstipulated by UL. The report also disclosed that some grades of certified resins had been produced and sold with compositions that di/ffered from those certified. Not only did this issue greatly cause inconvenience to customers, it also significantly damaged Toray's reputation among all of the stakeholders who support the Group on a constant basis, for which I would like to extend my deepest apologies. Upon receiving the investigation report prepared by an expert committee in April 2022, Toray genuinely acknowledged the facts of the issue, the cause analysis, and the recommendations for preventing recurrence contained therein. The Board of Directors then formulated recurrence prevention measures based on the principal causes (see p.68). Under the responsibility of the senior management team that I lead, all executives and employees\n\nare committed to working in unison to execute the measures without fail in a thorough e/ffort to recover the reputation of Toray among its customers and society more broadly. The implementation status of these recurrence prevention measures has been disclosed on the Toray Group website.\n\n## Ensuring thorough compliance\n\nToray includes 'Ethics and Fairness' as part of the 'Toray  Philosophy,'  which  systematizes  the  concept of Toray-style management. And as one of my personal principles, I have continued to practice the idea of 'stay focused on the basics, search for ideal approaches, identify the right steps, and then carry them out,' the importance of which I have conveyed to Toray's executives and employees ever since I was appointed  President  in  2010.  In  particular,  following the discovery in 2017 that quality data had been overwritten,  I  presented  the  slogan  of  'have  the integrity to do the right thing in the right way' and strove to foster a greater awareness of compliance. Moreover, under the Toray Philosophy (TP) Project that was deployed across the Group, I felt that progress had been made by Toray's e/fforts to firmly instill the  Corporate  Guiding  Principles  of  'Ethics  and Fairness' and 'Customer-Focus' for the purpose of putting into practice the Management Philosophy of 'Contribute to the realization of a sustainable society through business activities.' Therefore, I am very disappointed that the inappropriate actions involved in UL certification of the Group's resin products continued behind the scenes without ever being corrected.\n\nImmediately after the UL certification issue was discovered, I released a message to the entire Group stating that 'the seriousness of this matter lies in the fact that the situation where the individuals who found out the issue did not take any corrective measures toward the fundamental resolution continued over such a long period of time.' If inappropriate activities become the norm within an organization, hesitation to participate in",

        "page_content": "such activities will weaken, and it will become di/fficult for those who recognize an issue to speak up. In order that Toray Group contribute to the development of society through the business activities, I believe the most important step is to establish an organizational culture in  which  employees  immediately  make  corrections when they become aware they are doing something wrong. Taking the opportunity, I have given instructions on the inspection at each workplace to check whether it maintains any customary practices that have been passed down over the years and need to be reviewed with the passage of time. I have also exchanged a promise anew with all employees to always take corrective actions when they become aware of or observe any inappropriate activity in the future. Furthermore, the senior management team, including myself, will show our serious commitment to this promise at every opportunity to interact with employees, including various meetings and informal business results briefing sessions. And we will strive to strengthen compliance awareness and improve the organizational culture in order to instill the concept that 'compliance is the top priority for management' into every corner of Toray Group. In addition, I intend to foster a more open and better corporate culture by providing more opportunities than ever before to the senior management team to listen to employee feedback and by ensuring twoway communication.\n\n## Performance overview for fiscal 2021\n\nAgainst the backdrop of rebound from the economic slump caused by COVID-19, easing of activity restrictions associated with vaccination progress, and major economic measures in the U.S., fiscal 2021 welcomed a significant recovery in the global economy. Despite this, Toray's business environment remained severe, only showing a moderate pace of economic recovery during the second half of the fiscal year due to factors including a tight supply-demand situation\n\nfor semiconductors and other parts and materials, supply limitations stemming from labor shortages, skyrocketing raw material, fuel, and logistics costs caused by the situation in Ukraine, and lockdowns resulting from China's zero-COVID policy.\n\nAmid these challenges, Toray Group experienced broadly higher revenue and profits, with consolidated revenue up 18.3% year on year to \u00a52,228.5 billion, core operating income up 46.3% to \u00a5132.1 billion, operating income up 80.0% to \u00a5100.6 billion, and profit attributable to owners of parent up 83.9% to \u00a584.2 billion. In particular, ABS resins contributed significantly to securing revenue, while carbon fiber composite materials also returned to the black.\n\n## Priority issues for fiscal 2022\n\nFiscal 2022 is the final fiscal year of the Medium-Term Management  Program,  Project  AP-G  2022.  AP-G 2022 was launched in fiscal 2020 when COVID-19 infections began to spread around the globe. During the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions on the movement of people and goods disrupted supply chains, while dramatic changes in behavioral patterns and production activities had a significant impact on Toray Group's businesses. In addition to the prolonged situation in Ukraine, other areas of growing uncertainty include the spread of infections by variants, a weak yen, and soaring prices. In consideration of the sizable  changes  in  the  business  environment  being driven by the impacts of these uncertainties, Toray lowered its forecast for consolidated core operating income from the initial AP-G 2022 target to \u00a5130.0 billion (down 1.6% compared with fiscal 2021).\n\nIn particular, fibers and textiles, battery separator films for lithium-ion secondary batteries, and carbon fiber composite materials deviated considerably from the initial targets. In regard to fibers and textiles, the increasing shift to work from home or remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as changes in behavioral patterns among people, led to",

        "page_content": "a contraction in the formalwear market. Meanwhile, battery separator films have become entangled in fierce  price  competition  with  manufacturers  from emerging  nations.  Similarly,  carbon  fiber  composite materials have been negatively a/ffected by the delayed recovery in aircraft demand, which collapsed during the pandemic. Across-the-board, soaring raw material, fuel, and logistics costs have placed intense pressure on profits.\n\nIn response to these challenges, Toray will take the  following  actions.  Firstly,  as  for  price  passthrough,  Toray  has  no  intention  of  simply  raising prices to o/ffset skyrocketing raw material, fuel, and logistics costs, and will instead strive to make price corrections that are commensurate with value. One of the reasons why raising prices is unacceptable is because the value of the product is relatively low, which means that Toray must thoroughly engage in ensuring high added-value in order to raise the value of products themselves and in enhancing cost competitiveness in order to balance the value of products with their price.\n\nIn terms of providing high added-value to fibers and textiles, Toray will seek to di/fferentiate its products by applying NANODESIGN\u2122 technology, an approach to controlling fineness and shape of the synthetic fibers at the nano-level for the purpose of enabling completely new functions and textures, thereby creating new markets. Moreover, Toray will actively introduce sustainable materials that reflect the needs of the times, such as &+\u2122 (And Plus) recycled fibers made from used PET bottles. Meanwhile, battery separator films will take a new direction toward specialization in high-end applications. Specifically, Toray aims to expand this business based on high reliability, high-capacity products that utilize its coating technology in conjunction with its film forming technology. Among the various carbon fiber composite materials, regular tow carbon fibers are now primarily supplied for industrial applications for which demand is rapidly\n\nexpanding, such as natural gas pressure vessels, in place of aircraft applications for which the market has temporarily contracted. However, given expectation for a recovery in aircraft demand over the long term and for further growth in demand from industrial applications, Toray will keep a close watch on demand trends for each application as it seeks to further improve quality and cost competitiveness while expanding production capacity.\n\nOn the other hand, Toray is also accelerating the introduction  of  products  that  capture  changes  in the market. First, Toray foresees increased production and sales of TORAYFAN\u2122 polypropylene films for ultra-thin automotive capacitors. In terms of electronic and information materials, Toray expects to see growth in OLED materials. Then, in terms of carbon fiber composite materials, Zoltek, a U.S. subsidiary, will begin operating an additional carbon fiber production line for wind turbine blade application during the second half of fiscal 2022, which is expected to contribute to the revenue and profit.\n\n## Accelerating sustainability initiatives\n\nEven amid repeated waves of COVID-19 infections and  uncertainty  regarding  movements  in  international a/ffairs, discussions over issues involving the sustainability of society have heated up. In working to realize the four perspectives of the world* as outlined in the Toray Group Sustainability Vision formulated in 2018, Toray is advancing initiatives that will contribute to the realization of a sustainable society in accordance with growing demand, primarily in the Green Innovation (GR) businesses, which help solve global environmental issues as well as resource and energy issues, and in the Life Innovation (LI) businesses,  which  contribute  to  health  maintenance and longevity, and improving the quality of medical care as well as to promoting public health. Moreover, Toray is actively engaged in reducing greenhouse",

Under  the  umbrella  of  the  Sustainability Committee,  the  Climate  Change  Subcommittee identifies issues within initiatives for carbon neutrality, and proposes and advances countermeasures. Similarly, in April 2022 Toray launched the Circular Economy Subcommittee, which drives initiatives to achieve a circular economy, including e/fforts to promote the recycling of fibers and textiles, films, and resin products, the development and commercialization of plant-based bioplastics, and the recovery and recycling of GHGs at the production stage.\n\n- * 1.

Here I will explain on our business expansion in growth areas and advanced business management by utilizing digital technologies which will be the key to the future business operations.\n\nIn terms of expanding business in growth areas, Toray will further accelerate the initiatives intended to realize the four perspectives of the world as outlined in the Toray Group Sustainability Vision. As a materials manufacturer, Toray Group is seeing an increasing  number  of  opportunities  to  contribute  to  the\n\nrealization of a sustainable society, so I am certain that the Group will be able to play an even greater role than ever before.\n\nIn particular, I am keenly aware of the growing expectations from the field of climate change action on Toray Group in regard to realizing a hydrogen society. Similarly, Toray Group foresees the arrival of an era when green hydrogen made from water and power provided by renewable energy becomes the primary energy medium for the world. Which is why Toray is developing materials for building a green hydrogen supply chain. Toray is already the global leader in key components such as hydrocarbon (HC) -based electrolyte membranes which increase the performance of water electrolysis devices. And in June 2022, Toray established the HS Division directly under the authority of the President in order to expand the business for the membranes. In order to shift to full-scale global deployment for bolstering the introduction of green hydrogen, Toray has also begun cooperating with companies and organizations from Japan and overseas, including Siemens Energy AG, one of the world's leading manufacturers of water electrolysis devices and a company with which Toray has agreed to build a strategic partnership.\n\nIn  terms  of  advanced  business  management by  utilizing  digital  technologies,  the  Technology Center DX Promotion Committee is advancing DX under the themes such as material design, quality improvement, and the enhancement of production e/fficiency.

Knowledge of digital technologies alone cannot produce good results. Toray Group's promotion of DX is founded on the concept of solving issues through the utilization of practical digital technologies that are closely tied to Genba , whether it be sales and marketing or production.\n\n## Highest level of quality as the foundation of the Toray brand\n\nIn  May  2020,  the  Group  announced  the  'Toray Philosophy' as a systematized concept of Toray-style Management, passed down since its founding. Toray has raised the corporate philosophy of 'Contributing to society through the creation of new value with innovative ideas, technologies and products,' which is positioned at the top of the 'Toray Philosophy.' Ever since its founding, Toray Group has operated based on the unwavering belief that 'companies are public institutions,' and therefore values the perspective of contributing to all of its stakeholders, including its employees.\n\nIn order to continue contributing to the sustainable development of society through its businesses, Toray Group must ensure that every individual working for the Group deeply empathizes with the 'Toray Philosophy' and possesses the feeling that they are contributing to society through their work. Therefore, during the period from August 2020 to March 2022, Toray extended the Toray Philosophy (TP) Project to everyone  working  at  Toray  Group,  and  conducted activities to build connections between colleagues at each workplace in a way that allowed them to share and realize the meaning of working at Toray Group and the future vision for Toray Group. Specifically,\n\nthe Group implemented an interactive program in order to help employees understand and practice the 'Toray Philosophy.' Under the theme of 'What the 'Toray Philosophy' means to me,' each executive conveyed to the employees in a relay manner 'the type of value they want to deliver and to whom through their work,' after which employees discussed the same theme in their respective workplaces. This e/ffort served as a highly consequential activity that allowed each employee to understand the 'Toray Philosophy' and gain a new awareness for putting the 'Toray Philosophy' into practice.\n\nIn response to the outcomes of the TP Project, in fiscal 2022 Toray launched the 'Brand Committee,'which began  investigating measures  that  enable  the 'Business Brand/Product Brand' and the 'Technology Brand' to enhance the value of each other, based on the 'Corporate Brand' which reflects the beliefs of the 'Toray Philosophy.' In addition, I believe a brand strategy that spreads throughout the world a better understanding of how Toray Group's products are used and how they are helpful is important to ensuring that employees work with a sense of pride.\n\nThe foundation of Toray brand is to provide the highest level of quality in the world. Toray will therefore squarely face the challenges brought to light by the UL certification issue, raise the strength of quality anew, including compliance, and continue to deliver new value and high-quality products to the world. Toray intends to spare no e/ffort in the aim of earning the trust of its customers and society more broadly and of becoming a respected company.\n\nWe look forward to the ongoing support and understanding of our stakeholders in these endeavors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Akihiro Nikkaku\n\nPresident Toray Industries, Inc.",

MLCCs have become smaller, down to just a few hundred microns, along with the miniaturization of semiconductor devices and substrates,  with  roughly  800  used  in  a  single smartphone, 1,400 in a PC, and 5,000 in an automobile. Toray PET (polyethylene terephthalate) film Lumirror\u2122 boasts the world's No. 1 market share as a release film used in MLCC production.\n\nToray was the first company in Japan to commercialize PET films with the release of Lumirror\u2122 in 1959. Back then, PET films were mainly used for food packaging and labels, and there was no need to be concerned about the finely shaped surfaces. Later on, upgrading of functionality in PET films accelerated, as demand grew for its use as base film for magnetic tapes such as VHS and cassette tapes. This is because a smooth film was required to suppress noise and degradation for magnetic tapes,  which  are  recording  media  with  magnetic material applied to the surface of the film. In response, Toray developed the thin-film lamination\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\n2020\n\ntechnology (NEST*), which controls the smoothness and friction of film surfaces, enabling Toray to gain a large share of the magnetic tape market.\n\nThe market for these magnetic tapes was eventually replaced by DVDs, yet Toray PET films, combined  with  its  nano-level  controlled  processing and  production  technology,  have  evolved  into  a very e/ffective film for making the ceramic layer of MLCCs thinner and without irregularities. In addition, through co-creation with a major MLCC manufacturer, we have realized a system for collecting and reusing used PET films.\n\n* New Surface Topography (NEST): A technology that uses a thin layer of polymer containing particles on a surface to align the particles in a row and align the height of the protrusions.\n\n## Extreme pursuit of film surface structure\n\nImaged figure of film cross-section\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, to ensure financial soundness, the Group is conducting business operations with even more consideration than before of the balance between profit, cash flow, and asset e/fficiency, while promoting the business structure reform of low-growth and low-profitability businesses.\n\n| Financial Targets     | (Billion yen)   | (Billion yen)   | (Billion yen)                                              | (Billion yen)                                |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n|                       | FY 2020 Actual  | FY 2021 Actual  | FY 2022 Forecast                                           | FY  2022 Target                              |\n| Revenue               | 1,883.6         | 2,228.5         | 2,600.0                                                    | 2,600.0                                      |\n| Core Operating Income | 90.3            | 132.1           | 130.0                                                      | 180.0                                        |\n| Core Operating Margin | 4.8%            | 5.9%            | 5.0%                                                       | 7%                                           |\n| ROE                   | 3.9%            | 6.4%            | about 6%                                                   | about 9%                                     |\n| ROA                   | 3.2%            | 4.5%            | about 4%                                                   | about 7%                                     |\n| Free Cash Flow        | 113.7           | 81.1            | Positive                                                   | 120 billion yen or  more  (total of 3 years) |\n| D/E Ratio             | 0.79            | 0.67            | Management in  accordance with the  guideline (around 0.8) | around 0.8 (guideline)                       |\n| Dividend Payout Ratio | 31%             | 30%             | 30%                                                        | about 30%                                    |\n\n## Basic Strategy 1 Global Expansion in Growth Business Fields\n\nUtilizing Toray Group's advanced materials and core technologies,  under  the  strategy  'global  expansion in growth business fields' in AP-G 2022, Toray Group is working to drive GR and LI business expansion. Through the promotion of group-wide projects, we will contribute to solving global social issues by expanding our businesses.\n\n## Green Innovation (GR) Business Expansion\n\nBy expanding our Green Innovation (GR) business, we will contribute to solving global environmental issues and resource/energy problems. By allocating resources for\n\ncapital investment and R&D in a focused manner and for large-scale themes, the Group is targeting revenue in the GR business in fiscal 2022 of \u00a51 trillion. The large-scale themes include lightweight materials, biomass-derived materials, recycled materials, separator films for lithium-ion secondary batteries, large tow carbon fibers for wind turbine blade applications, water treatment membranes, and hydrogen- and fuel cell-related materials.\n\nIn  fiscal  2021,  sales  of  carbon  fibers  for  aircraft remained sluggish due to restrictions placed on movement by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, driven by carbon fibers for wind turbine blades and water treatment  membranes,  GR  business  revenue  increased",

This plant will be the largest using the RO membrane method in the country. As part of our resource recycling initiatives, we have launched Ecodear TM N510, a nylon 510 fiber that incorporates 100% biobased synthetic polymer content. We have also launched an eco-friendly waterless printing plate for flexible packaging materials.\n\nFurthermore, in the field of hydrogen, in which growth is expected in the years to come, a Toray-developed polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) for water electrolysis was selected as a joint project by eight companies for the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)'s Green Innovation Funding Program,  and  a  strategic  partnership  concluded  with Siemens Energy K.K. In collaboration with the Yamanashi Prefectural Government  and  Tokyo  Electric  Power Company Holdings, Inc., the Company has also established Japan's first Power to Gas (P2G) business company.\n\n## Life Innovation (LI) Business Expansion\n\nBy expanding the Life Innovation (LI) business we will contribute to better medical care and longevity as well as to the promotion of public health. The Group is targeting sales revenue of \u00a5300 billion in its LI business in fiscal 2022.\n\nIn  fiscal  2021,  LI  business  revenue  increased  by 11.6% year on year to \u00a5308.4 billion due to shipments of nonwoven fabrics for hygiene applications and sports-related materials remaining strong.\n\nIn the LI business, we have developed and launched sales of the FILTRYZER TM HDF hemodiafiltration device, which uses a hollow fiber membrane made of polymethyl  methacrylate  (PMMA)  and  boasts  excellent biocompatibility. We have also developed a multi-item allergy testing biochip that can diagnose multiple allergies to a high degree of high sensitivity and accuracy using trace amounts of blood. In addition, having confirmed the heat stress reduction e/ffect of disposable, highly breathable personal protective clothing, we contributed to measures to prevent heatstroke and other conditions at manufacturing and construction sites.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are also promoting the development of applications for a porous carbon fiber that can be used in the separation layers that support the structure\n\nof gas separation membranes to, for example, separate CO2 and biogas as well as hydrogen. Having in the LI field created TRK-950, a therapeutic antibody drug for cancers, clinical trials for multiple cancer types are currently under way in Europe, the United States, and Japan.  We  have  also  filed  applications  with  Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare to obtain manufacturing and marketing approval for an in-vitro diagnostic reagent test that measures protein concentration changes in the blood of pancreatic cancer patients.\n\n## Basic Strategy 2 Strengthening Competitiveness\n\nTo  strengthen  competitiveness,  the  Group  is  working on three priority issues: total cost reduction; business advancement and high added-value creation; and enhancing workplace competency in sales & marketing and production.\n\nFor total cost reduction, Total Cost Reduction Project (NTC Project) is promoted across the Group, and the target is to reduce \u00a5150 billion over a three-year period through activities to reduce variable and fixed costs and bring about innovation in production processes (\u00a5100 billion in variable costs, \u00a535 billion in production fixed costs, and \u00a515 billion in innovation of production processes). In fiscal 2021, the total amounted to \u00a559.3 billion, and to \u00a5126.7 billion over the two years from fiscal 2020 (a progress rate of 84%). Breaking it down, over the two years we achieved reductions of \u00a568.3 billion in variable costs, \u00a549.4 billion in production fixed costs, and \u00a58.9 billion in innovation of production processes.\n\nAs for business advancement and high added-value creation,  the  Group  is  working  not  only  to  achieve advancement in products but also to add high value by integrating and combining products and services, to create new value through alliances, and to pursue innovation in the value chain by utilizing Information and Communication Technology (ICT).\n\nIn terms of enhancing our workplace competency in sales & marketing, we are building a group-wide information-sharing  system  covering  end-customer\n\nrequests,  market  demands,  and  needs  by  product application,  while  devising  ways  to  strengthen  our ability to make comprehensive sales proposals and resolve problems. We are also utilizing digital tools as we work to improve operational e/fficiency and enhance the sophistication of our customer communications. To enhance our workplace competency in production, aside  from  continually  improving  labor  productivity, we are focusing on preventing the occurrence of and improving our responsiveness to production problems, promoting the compilation of manuals, and extending our global supply chain.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As a result, free cash flow in fiscal 2021 was positive at \u00a581.1 billion, and the two-year cumulative total amounted to \u00a5194.8 billion. In addition, although we had set a D/E ratio of 'around 0.8' as a guideline, despite the decrease in interest-bearing debt the D/E ratio was 0.67 due to an increase in owner's equity.\n\n## Initiatives for Sustainability\n\nWith regard to sustainability targets, revenue from the LI business is steadily increasing, and we have almost reached the target level for fiscal 2022. The GR business got o/ff to a slow start due to the impact of the COVID19 pandemic but recovered in fiscal 2021. The amount of avoided CO2 emissions was 8.0 times that of fiscal 2013, achieving the target for fiscal 2030 far ahead of schedule.\n\n## Sustainability Targets\n\nConcerning the business structure reform of lowgrowth  and  low-profitability  businesses,  we  select those  businesses  and  companies  that  have  fallen below the standard values for both growth potential and profitability. After ascertaining the position and business environment of each business, and conducting numerical analyses, we discuss and implementing reforms to our business structure and organizational structure to divest ourselves of them. For example, in the fibers and textile business we are downsizing the polyester/cotton blended textile (T/C) business, consolidating the manufacturing bases in the Japanese fibers and textiles business, carrying out the development of the market for casual wear for the Japanesestyle clothing business, and outsourcing the Russell business (knit fabric used for shapewear, back support belt applications, etc.).\n\nThe contributed annual water filtration throughput is also steadily increasing. Improvements in GHG emissions and water consumption per unit of revenue in Toray Group production activities also exceeded targets for fiscal 2022.\n\nWe will continue to focus on carbon neutralization and our contribution to a circular economy in the years to come.\n\n|                                                                      | FY 2013 Actual (baseline year) (J-GAAP)   | FY 2021 Actual (compared with FY 2013) (IFRS)   | FY 2022 Target (compared with FY 2013) (IFRS)   | FY 2030 Target (compared with FY 2013) (IFRS)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| GR Net sales / Revenue                                               | 463.1  billion yen                        | 832.2  billion yen (1.8 fold)                   | 1,000.0  billion yen (2.2 fold)                 | 4  fold                                         |\n| LI Net sales / Revenue                                               | 119.6  billion yen                        | 308.4  billion yen (2.6 fold)                   | 300.0  billion yen (2.5 fold)                   | 6  fold                                         |\n| Avoided CO2 emissions                                                | 38.45  million tons                       | 8.0  fold                                       | 5.3  fold                                       | 8  fold                                         |\n| Contributed Annual water filtration  throughput                      | 27.23  million tons/day                   | 2.2  fold                                       | 2.4  fold                                       | 3  fold                                         |\n| Greenhouse gas emissions per unit  of sales in production activities | 3.37  thousand tons/billion yen           | 2.67  thousand tons/billion yen (21% reduction) | 20 % reduction                                  | 30 % reduction                                  |\n| Water consumption per unit of sales  in production activities        | 152  thousand tons/billion yen            | 109  thousand tons/billion yen (28% reduction)  | 25 % reduction                                  | 30 % reduction                                  |",

On the other hand, to strengthen its financial structure, the Company aimed to\n\ngenerate more than \u00a5120 billion in free cash flow over a three-year period and set an even stricter D/E ratio guideline of around 0.8 to enhance its financial discipline.\n\nCurrently, both capital expenditures and R&D expenditures are expected to fall short of the three-year plan, partly due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we are steadily engaging in capital investment and R&D necessary for greater growth. In addition, free cash flow has remained above target, and the D/E ratio has remained below the guideline.\n\n## Measures to Strengthen Financial Structure\n\n## 1. Enhance Cash Flow Management\n\nIn  order  to  improve  cash  flow  company-wide,  the Company introduced a system to manage free cash flow for each division in fiscal 2020, in which each division autonomously manages cash inflows from revenue and core operating income as well as cash outflows for capital\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexpenditures and changes in working capital such as inventories. In addition, the Company continues to implement the '3C-i (Cash Conversion Cycle Improvement) Activity' in order to reduce working capital. In addition, we are introducing and expanding cash pooling in each of our overseas regions and returning surplus funds through dividends to improve global capital e/fficiency.\n\n## 2.  Increase Certainty of Return on Capital Investment\n\nToray engages in economic evaluation of capital investment plans by conducting checks using the internal rate of return (IRR) method and the payback period method to determine whether the Company's investments are economically feasible enough to achieve ROA and ROE targets. After capital investment is made, Toray conducts regular follow-ups, as well as discusses how to make up for any shortfall in the original plan and implements countermeasures.",

When formulating business  strategies  and  making  management  decisions, the Board of Directors considers climate change-related issues as one of the important elements of its overall deliberations and decision-making.\n\n## Impact Analysis of Climate Change\n\nToray Group announced its support for the TCFD recommendations in May 2019. Following its announcement,\n\nthe Group conducted scenario analyses regarding the potential impacts of the opportunities and risks of climate change. The Paris Agreement target is to limit global warming to well below 2\u00b0C, preferably to 1.5\u00b0C, compared to pre-industrial levels. Looking to help achieve this target and build a decarbonized society, Toray Group primarily analyzed the 1.5\u00b0C increase scenario, but also considered the 2\u00b0C increase scenario. The Group also looked at the 4\u00b0C increase scenario assuming insu/fficient progress on e/fforts to ameliorate global climate change. Each analysis covered the period from 2030 to 2050.\n\n## Risk Management\n\nOn  climate  change,  Toray  Group  seeks  to  contribute  to  solving  environmental  issues  through  its  business and considers the reduction of GHG emissions to be extremely important to both stakeholders and Toray Group, and has therefore established KPIs that it uses in its e/fforts to reduce risk. Toray Group addresses groupwide risks including those associated with climate change under the direction of the Risk Management Committee. Specifically, the Group conducts periodic risk management (priority risk mitigation activities) and routine risk management (monitoring trends in and outside of Japan and through risk detection, assessment, and monitoring).\n\n## KPIs and Targets\n\nToray Group has disclosed its sustainability targets for fiscal 2030 and fiscal 2022 along with the results related to these targets achieved in fiscal 2021 (see p.29).\n\nMain opportunities, risks, and responses related to climate change (excerpts *1 ) *1 Excerpts from Toray Group TCFD Report 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Social change                                                                     |                           |                                                                                                 | Responses by Toray Group                                                               | Magnitude of opportunity, risk *2   | Magnitude of opportunity, risk *2   | Magnitude of opportunity, risk *2   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                   | Main risks, opportunities | Main risks, opportunities                                                                       | Responses by Toray Group                                                               | 1.5\u00b0C                               | 2\u00b0C                                 | 4\u00b0C                                 |\n| Increase in ratio of  renewable energy                                            | Opportunities             | \u00b7  Growth of renewable energy-  related business \u00b7  Growth of storage battery-related  business | \u00b7 Carbon fiber for wind turbine blades \u00b7 Battery separator film                        | large                               |                                     |                                     |\n| Increase in ratio of  renewable energy                                            | Risks                     | \u00b7 Increased electricity costs                                                                   | \u00b7 Energy conservation initiatives                                                      | \u00b7 Energy conservation initiatives   | large                               | large                               |\n| Establishment  and raising of  carbon taxes and  GHG emissions  reduction targets | Opportunities             | \u00b7  Growth of energy conserva- tion-related business                                             | \u00b7 Lightweight materials \u00b7 Insulating and heat shielding products \u00b7 Functional garments | large                               |                                     |                                     |\n| Establishment  and raising of  carbon taxes and  GHG emissions  reduction targets | Risks                     | \u00b7  Carbon tax burden, increased pro- curement costs for fossil-based  raw materials and fuels   | \u00b7 Reduce GHG emissions                                                                 | \u00b7 Reduce GHG emissions              | large                               | large                               |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n: LI products\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *2  The magnitude of the impact was assessed to be large, moderate or small.

In this respect, Toray Group practices life cycle management (LCM).\n\nLCM  is  the  basis  for  Green  Innovation  (GR)  products, and the Group has adopted life cycle assessment *1 and the Toray Eco-E/fficiency Analysis (T-E2A) *2 tool and is working to establish LCM as a tool to measure CO2 reduction in the entire life cycle of products and services. Those products that are able to demonstrate objective evidence of providing an e/ffective solution for global environmental issues are certified as GR products, only after the products are subjected to a two-stage screening process by the divisional committees and the group-wide Green Innovation Certification Committee.\n\n- *1  Life cycle assessment is a method for quantitatively assessing the resources that have gone into a product and the impact the product will have on the environment and ecosystems over its life cycle.\n- *2  T-E2A is an environmental analysis tool developed by Toray Industries, Inc.

The value of environmental facility investments in fiscal 2021 amounted to \u00a51.82 billion, an increase of\n\n\u00a5300 million over the previous fiscal year, while environmental preservation costs amounted to \u00a56.75 billion, a decline of \u00a5810 million.\n\n## Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Initiatives\n\nAs its greenhouse gas emissions reduction target for CSR Roadmap 2022, Toray Group presented the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions per unit of revenue by 20%* compared with fiscal 2013 levels for the entire Toray Group on a continuous basis through fiscal 2022, for which purpose it has implemented systematic reduction measures.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions for the entire Toray Group during fiscal 2021 increased 10.5% over the previous fiscal year to 5.49 million tons-CO2 due to a recovery in production volumes. Meanwhile, the Group minimized greenhouse gas emissions from these higher production volumes versus the increase in revenue, thereby maintaining greenhouse gas emissions per unit of revenue at 20.6% below the fiscal 2013 levels.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, greenhouse gas emissions from Toray and its group companies in Japan also increased 11.7% over the previous fiscal year due to the recovery in production  volumes,  whereas  greenhouse  gas  emissions per-unit-of-revenue improved 7.9% over the previous fiscal year, ultimately falling 26.4% below fiscal 2013 levels.\n\n- * For Scope 1 and 2\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions and Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\nPer-Unit-of Net Sales (Per-Unit-of Revenue) (Toray Group)\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group installed a solar power generation system at Toray Plastics Precision (Zhongshan) Ltd., in fiscal 2020, and solar power generation systems at Seta Plant 3 and at Toray Precision Co., Ltd., in fiscal 2021, each of which is currently in operation. In addition, the Tokai Plant began co-combusting sludge fuel as boiler fuel from fiscal 2017.\n\nIn practice, the Group also switched over all power consumed by Toray's headquarters to 100% renewable energy starting in April 2022. This move is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 1,500 tons-CO2 annually on a global basis.\n\n## Energy Conservation Measures\n\nToray is vigorously working on energy conservation activities with the goal of reducing its per-unit energy consumption *1 by 2% annually. In fiscal 2021, a recovery in production volumes led to an 8.6% increase in energy consumption  over  the  previous  fiscal  year.  Per-unit energy  consumption,  however,  improved  12.1%  over the previous fiscal year due to the recovery in production volumes. Compared with fiscal 1990, the baseline year for reductions in per-unit energy consumption, this is an improvement of 20.1%.\n\nToray Group organizes energy conservation teams to help carry out annual energy conservation diagnostics at plants in Toray and its group companies around the\n\nEnergy Consumption and Per-unit Energy Consumption Index (Toray Industries, Inc.) *2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *2 The energy consumption shown in this graph does not include renewable energy.\n\nworld. In fiscal 2021, these activities were conducted at two of Toray's plants and three group company plants in Japan. The energy savings thereof e/ffectively reduced greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  approximately  3,400 tons-CO2 per year.\n\n- *1 Energy consumption per converted production volume\n\n## Biodiversity Initiatives\n\nToray Group views conservation of biodiversity as a critical global environmental issue that is of equal importance to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As part of its environmental risk investigations conducted at the time of product safety review and capital investments for all products, Toray Group employs an environmental assessment checklists to verify that regulated substances  released  through  exhaust  gas,  wastewater, waste products, and other means during the manufacturing stage remain below legal standards. This initiative serves to assess the Group's impact on biodiversity, and aims to realize a sustainable society.\n\nAs one of its biodiversity conservation initiatives, the Group conducts periodic surveys of products to determine if their production uses bio-based raw materials, and applies rules that check for impacts on biodiversity at the development stage for all products.\n\nAmong bio-based raw materials, the Group views palm oil as a raw material that should be followed with priority, and, over the three-year period from fiscal 2020 to 2022, worked to investigate whether products use certified raw materials and to advance the switch to alternative materials. In fiscal 2020, the Group investigated whether certified raw materials were used in regard to raw materials made from palm oil, and completed its investigation of 93% of relevant suppliers. As a result of its ongoing e/fforts, it completed its investigation of 100% of relevant suppliers in fiscal 2021. Moreover, in fiscal 2021 the Group investigated whether products failing to use certified raw materials made from palm oil could be switched to using certified raw materials. As of the present time, the Group has completed its advisability judgement for 100% of relevant suppliers. Going forward, the Group will conduct follow-up investigations regarding raw materials that are di/fficult to replace, and will carefully examine the possibility of switching each raw material to a certified raw material.",

Mitigation measures seek to reduce GHG emissions as the fundamental cause of these problems, and adaptive measures seek to manage the impacts that are already occurring or that cannot be avoided. Global environmental issues are assumed to be critical challenges for both the Green Innovation Business Expansion Project (GR Project) and the Life Innovation Business Expansion Project (LI Project).

        "page_content": "## Carbon Fibers Find Success Beyond Aircraft\n\nThe first technology I would like to cover on the topic of 'weight reduction' is of course carbon fibers, for which Toray holds one of the highest shares in the world. Given that they are ten times stronger than steel and a quarter of the weight without rusting, carbon fibers are used in products ranging from aircraft to automobiles, wind turbines, and fishing rods. This material particularly had a large impact on improving the fuel e/fficiency of aircraft. Although the synthesis and carbonization processes do emit 20 tons of CO2 per a ton of carbon fiber, using carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP), a composite material made from carbon fiber and resin, for 50% of an aircraft body structure by weight is expected to reduce 1,400 tons of CO2 emissions over the aircraft's life cycle.\n\nCFRP is also becoming an indispensable material for wind power generation. In 2015, wind power generation typically used 60-meter-long glass fiber composite blades. As the longer the wind blades, the higher power generation e/fficiency, 120-meter-long blades are expected to become the  mainstay  by  around  2030.  However,  in  proportion\n\n## Future of Promising NANOALLOY TM\n\nApproaches to reducing weight typically rely on concepts of replacing metals with plastics, so in this respect, NANOALLOY\u2122, a microstructure control technology for which Toray holds a patent, has become an extremely promising approach. This technology mixes several di/fferent polymers at the nanoscale (one-billionth of a meter) to form alloy structures, which enable polymer materials\n\nto exhibit a higher level of performance and function that could not have been realized using conventional alloys formed at the micron scale (one-millionth of a meter). In fact, Toray has used this technology to develop a special plastic that softens like rubber when subject to impact, which is increasingly being adopted for impact-absorbing automobile parts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Seawater Desalination Technology Supplies Fresh Water for 730 million People\n\nIn  1968,  Toray  began  developing  reverse  osmosis (RO) membranes to convert seawater into fresh water. Although these membranes are commonly used in seawater desalination plants in the Middle East today, with its abundant energy resources, early on this region typically used evaporation methods that boil and distill seawater, meaning there was absolutely no need to remove salt from seawater using membrane treatments. For this reason, Toray originally focused its e/fforts on the ultra-pure water filters required for semiconductor manufacturing\n\nfor a time in order to perfect its water treatment technologies. Later on, as the demand for water expanded with  global  population  growth  and  economic  development  in  emerging  countries,  water  resource  shortages caused by global warming-triggered droughts and industrialization-triggered water pollution became aggravated. Against this backdrop, Toray's membrane treatment methods began to attract interest because of their ability to control water quality with high precision and treat water at high speeds. Compared with evaporation\n\nto their length, the blades require strength to withstand strong winds and rigidity to avoid bending under their own weight. Therefore, all blades exceeding 90 meters in length are increasingly being made of CFRP, and expectations on Toray's technological capabilities from wind power generation is also raising.\n\n## Aircraft\n\nCarbon Fiber Association Model Cooperation: Prof. Takahashi and Prof. Li Jia, The University of Tokyo, All Nippon Airways, The Boeing Company (U.S.)\n\n<!-- image -->",

In fact, these have already been delivered to more than 100 large-scale desalination plants in 99 countries around the world, which have helped supply fresh water to 730 million people globally when converted to water volume.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Further Evolution of Separation Membrane Technology\n\nWith more than 50 years of history, separation membrane technologies have also come into the limelight for producing green hydrogen in a way that does not emit CO2. Toray has been participating in a NEDO project intended to produce hydrogen from water through electrolysis using power sourced from renewable energy. The water electrolysis method adopted for this project uses a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM). For more than 15 years now, Toray has been involved in developing hydrocarbon (HC) electrolyte membranes that can be e/ffectively applied in PEMs for use in fuel cell vehicles. And these membranes have been well-received for their ability to produce twice as much hydrogen per area of membrane compared with conventional fluorine membranes at the same voltage.\n\nMore recently, Toray applied its water treatment membrane technology to develop a polymeric separation membrane module that selectively permeates hydrogen at high e/fficiency from mixed gases containing hydrogen. At 98%, these modules have achieved the world's highest level of permeated hydrogen purity. This technology is able to improve hydrogen purity in a single separation pass to a level that previously required multiple filtration passes.\n\nMoreover, Toray also combined its carbon fibers and membrane separation technologies to develop a revolutionary CO2 separation membrane made from porous carbon fibers that can separate and recover CO2 from factory emissions, for example. The Company will begin demonstration tests for specific applications in 2025, and is moving forward with e/fforts for real-world operations in 2030.\n\n## Pioneering the Development of Biomaterials\n\nToray is also accelerating e/fforts to produce valuable materials from nonedible biomass in a way that does not conflict with food issues. Specifically, the Company mass produces partially bio-based PET fibers from ethylene glycol raw materials produced from nonedible sugar cane molasses. These fibers have been used to produce nonwoven material created using ultra-fine fibers, for example. With a focus on sportswear and automotive interiors, Toray also aims to mass produce the world's first 100% bio-based PET at the earliest possible timing using raw\n\nmaterials such as plant-based ethylene glycol and bio-para xylene. Moreover, Toray developed a membrane bioprocess that fuses its water treatment separation membrane technologies and biotechnologies. At a demonstration plant in the Kingdom of Thailand, one of the world's largest producers of sugar cane, the Company is currently conducting pilot operations for e/fficient co-current production of cellulosic sugar, polyphenol, oligosaccharide, and other materials made from bagasse, which are byproducts from residue left after extraction of juice from sugarcane.\n\n## Technological Fusion Drives Innovation\n\nAs you can see from the examples of carbon fibers and water treatment, Toray's R&D features 'long-term continuity' in a way that persistently engages in recognizing the value of materials. In addition, Toray has centralized all of its R&D functions deployed in various fields within the Technology Center, where an undivided R&D organization\n\nthat allows for technological fusion to easily emerge has also become one of its major strengths. Toray believes that  fundamental  solutions  for  global  environmental issues are inconceivable without innovations in materials, and therefore promotes the drive for innovation through technological fusion on a group-wide basis.\n\nFeatures of Toray HC electrolyte membranes\n\n|                      | PEM type water electrolysis   | PEM type water electrolysis   | PEM type water electrolysis   |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Requirement          | Requirement                   | Reference fluorine film       | Toray HC electrolyte membrane |\n| E/fficiency          | 76                            | 87                            | High e/fficiency              |\n| High current density | 1                             | 2                             | Reduced stack count           |\n| Low gas permeation   | 1                             | 1/3                           | Safety high availability      |\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this respect, Toray already visualizes its environmental contributions through a proprietary  calculation  method  and  engages  in  various projects with targets set to be achieved by fiscal 2030. Therefore, I would like to focus my talk on three of the four visions for the world for which Toray Group aims to achieve by 2050 under the Toray Group Sustainability Vision.

However, this vision requires the realization of a hydrogen society that eliminates CO2 emissions from combustion as well, which is why Toray engages in the development of a broad range of core materials for each of the hydrogen production, transport, storage, and usage stages.\n\nFor example, high-strength carbon fibers and plastic liners are used in hydrogen storage tanks, so in preparation for market expansion, one of the group's subsidiaries in Germany has been augmenting production facilities for catalyst coated membranes (CCM) and membrane\n\nelectrode assemblies (MEA), both of which are key components of hydrogen fuel cells. Moreover, Toray received the cooperation of Hitachi Zosen Corporation in developing a megawatt class PEM water electrolysis unit for a P2G (Power to Gas) system that produces green hydrogen using renewable energy. This P2G system has already begun delivering green hydrogen to factories and supermarkets in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan. In addition, a consortium consisting in part of Yamanashi Prefecture and Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings is advancing a large-scale P2G system project, which plans to put a large-scale 16-megawatt class water electrolysis unit using  Toray's  hydrocarbon  (HC)-type  electrolyte  membranes into real-world operations by fiscal 2025.",

In addition, Toray developed a smallscale P2G system package, and has launched an alliance business that aims to use this package in decarbonizing\n\nmanufacturing and other industries that are di/fficult to electrify. Meanwhile, in order to advance technology creation for green hydrogen production and global deployment  together  with  Siemens  Energy  AG,  Toray  has entered into a strategic partnership with this company.\n\n## Building a Circular Resource Use Model\n\nAs the second vision, 'A world where resources are sustainably  managed'  focuses  on  material  recycling  for reusing fibers and textiles, resins, films, and other plastics products. In addition, chemical recycling, which converts  unrecyclable  plastics  back  into  basic  chemicals such as monomers and gases, is already implemented\n\nfor nylon fiber/textile products. In terms of thermal recycling, which recovers and utilizes heat energy generated during the incineration process, Toray has succeeded in developing a technology that separates and recovers CO2, as the Vice President Abe touched upon earlier.\n\nContribute to initiatives including biomass plastics, recycling, promoting of renewable energy and the use of hydrogen, and water reuse\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Promoting the Recycled Fiber and Textile &+ TM Business\n\nToray has a long history in recycling fibers and textiles, in particular, and in 2002 established the Fibers & Textiles Recycling Department. Along with expanding material recycling as an ongoing e/ffort and chemical recycling for Nylon 6 products, the Company unified its fibers and textiles business recycling activities. As an e/ffort that without question exemplifies long-term continuity, in 2019 Toray launched the &+ TM recycled fiber and textile brand of products made using recovered PET bottles as raw materials.  Combining  high  whiteness,  high  reliability\n\nbased on traceability technology, and high purity, these products  have  already  been  adopted  by  Seven  &  i Holdings Co., Ltd., MARUI GROUP CO., LTD., and others. Moreover, the Company has undertaken the challenge of applying chemical recycling for materials that are di/fficult to regenerate using material recycling, such as those containing dyes and other additives that are difficult to remove, blended materials that are di/fficult to separate out, and those for which repeated recycling causes deterioration.",

But looking to the world beyond, water shortages are becoming increasingly problematic with continuous population growth,  even  in  places  where  large  populations  were never meant to exist, coupled with the advance of global warming. In response, Toray's membrane treatment technologies that realize high-quality, high-speed, energy-saving treatment processes can be considered an essential technology for the 21st century. Toray has established itself\n\nas the global leader and top technology share holder for reverse osmosis (RO) membranes, which are able to separate out the smallest substances, yet are a di/fficult technology to work with. In addition, the Company possesses all four types of membrane technologies, namely RO membranes, nanofiltration (NF) membranes, ultrafiltration (UF) membranes, and microfiltration (MF) membranes. And from the perspective of being able to separate out various substances, Toray is likely the only company with this capability, and will aim to maintain its position as the global leader in water treatment problem solutions.\n\n## Function and structure of water treatment membranes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Purifying Air with Air Filters\n\nIn addition to water, Toray realizes high-quality air environments by adsorbing contamination from the air using low-pressure loss, high dust collection e/fficiency air filters  made  from  high-performance,  nonwoven  sheet made of special ultra-fine polypropylene fibers that are given electret properties through a specialized process. Substances  that  permanently  maintain  electric  polarization even without an external electric field, and that produce an electric field of their own, are called electrets. Toray's nonwoven fabrics are made from ultra-fine\n\nfibers of approximately two microns in width, where each individual fiber is provided with an advanced electret function. This approach provides its nonwoven fabrics with a high trapping e/fficiency for PM2.5, viruses, and  other  particles,  as  well  as  o/ffensive  odors.  Sold under the TORAYMICRON TM name,  these  nonwoven fabrics have been proposed as filter materials that help broadly improve air quality and conserve energy in a wide range of applications, for everything from home-use to industrial-use.\n\n## Transforming Nature Positive into Opportunity\n\nAs interest in global environmental issues dramatically increases, following upon carbon neutrality, nature positive, which aims to stop the world from damaging biodiversity and other forms of natural capital so that they can recover, is coming to be viewed as a global objective. Like the TCFD, this concept led to the launch of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) in June 2021. Although the world now also focuses on biodiversity, Toray has committed itself for many years to water\n\nand air, so I feel the times have finally caught up to us.\n\nNature positive covers the three areas: food, land and ocean use; infrastructure and construction; energy and extraction activities. Therefore, it is expected to create a market with an annual value of $10.1 trillion. For this reason, Toray views carbon neutrality, circular economy, and now nature positive as major business opportunities, and aims to ensure its presence in these areas through innovative material technologies.",

E/fforts to virtually eliminate greenhouse gas emissions have picked up internationally, beginning with the European Green Deal. On the mobility front, a transition to CASE (Connectivity, Autonomous, Sharing/ Services and Electric) principles is guiding the development of electromotive vehicles*, as well as of a diverse range of other advanced mobility platforms. These include urban air mobility, drones, and small electric mobility vehicles.\n\nIn order to rapidly address these changes, in June Toray launched  the  Environment  &  Mobility  Development  Center (EMC)  as  an  organization  under  the  direct  authority  of  the Chief  Technology  O/fficer.  This  move  was  made  to  integrate and strengthen the development functions performed by the Environment & Energy Development Center in regard to environmental materials and new energy-related materials and the solution proposal and technology marketing functions performed by the Automotive Center based on advanced materials for automobiles.\n\nEMC will serve as the hub of global development collaboration in the environmental and mobility fields, including for Toray Advanced Materials Research Laboratories (China) and Toray Automotive Center Europe. At the same time, Toray established the Environmental Solutions Department and the Next Mobility Department within the Corporate Marketing Planning Division. In collaboration with EMC, these two departments will propose sophisticated total solutions that integrate the various advanced materials possessed by Toray Group.\n\n## TOPICS\n\n## 68th Okochi Memorial Technology Award Received for the Development of Biaxially Oriented Polypropylene Film for Heat-durable Film Capacitor for Electrified Vehicle\n\nToray received this award for its success in using an innovative film forming technology to develop and commercialize a biaxially oriented polypropylene (OPP) film designed for use in highly heat-resistant film capacitors. This development received high marks for its significant contribution to reducing the weight and to increasing the output of power control units (PCUs), a core component of electromotive vehicles, as a result of reducing the size and enhancing the performance of film capacitors. The development was also recognized for helping to increase PCU performance and to expand the use of electromotive vehicles. Toray received the Okochi Memorial Award, which is  presented  annually  for  outstanding  achievements related to production engineering, research and development into production technology, and application of sophisticated production systems in Japan, for the 15th time this year. Toray previously received it during the 63rd event. Moreover, Toray's  TORAYFAN\u2122  polypropylene  (OPP)  films for film capacitors are also known throughout the world as the leading brand of capacitor films, and currently account for more than 60% of the global share for electromotive vehicles.\n\n## 30th Global Environment Award, Japan Business Federation Chairman's Award Received for Contributing to Green Hydrogen Cost Reductions\n\nToray received this award in recognition of its contributions to green hydrogen cost reductions realized through the development of hydrocarbon-based electrolyte membranes. In this case, a hydrocarbon-based electrolyte membrane developed by Toray was used as part of a project originally commissioned by NEDO in 2016 to develop and demonstrate a Power to Gas (P2G) system for producing hydrogen using solar power. As a result, the project demonstrated the ability to produce twice the amount of hydrogen per area of membrane when compared to conventional fluorine films at the same voltage, which is anticipated to significantly help reduce the cost of green hydrogen in the future. By further enhancing the performance of and standardizing water electrolysis units using Toray's hydrocarbon-based electrolyte membranes, the project aims to realize a carbon neutral society through its contributions to achieving hydrogen costs that are comparable to those of existing fossil fuels, and to building a global green hydrogen supply chain.",

However, I think that by boldly undertaking challenges and aiming for professionalism, many opportunities to excel will be created.\n\n* Work-life balance\n\n## Strengthening cooperation with multiple departments\n\nToray Performance Materials Corporation (TPMC) is the leading supplier of high-performance CFRT\u00ae (Continuous Fiber Reinforced Thermoplastic) composite products to the Industrial, Medical and Recreational markets. I began my career at Performance Materials Corporation (PMC) in 1997 as Associate Product Manager, then moved into a sales role managing the medical business, and later promoted to Director of Sales and Marketing. I became President of TPMC in September 2021. PMC was acquired by Toray in 2018 and TPMC, since then, has leveraged the acquisition with greater collaboration with a number of divisions and departments within Toray Group. Toray Group holds the same values held by our company and our customers, such as sustainability and contribution to society, so I feel that TPMC is a natural fit in the Group. TPMC is a group of passionate people pushing one another to be our very best, and it is an honor to be a part of the Toray-PMC team.\n\n## Setting challenging tasks in working to achieve targets\n\nAs a subsidiary of Toray Industries (H.K.) Ltd., THK Apparel (Zhuhai) Co., Ltd. is located on the downstream side of Toray's fibers and textiles business. We manufacture and sell knitted products, and employ more than 1,000 people. After joining the company in 2001, I served as Sales Manager, General Manager of the Manufacturing Division, Assistant Plant Manager, and Vice President. In January 2022 I was appointed President, yet still feel the weight of my daily responsibilities even though almost a year has passed already. Currently, China's garment industry is faced with a di/fficult business environment resulting from rising labor costs, manpower shortages, an increasing number of garment manufacturing sites in Southeast Asia, and other factors, which are requiring THK Apparel to undergo a major transformation. As part of the next medium-term management program, we will set challenging tasks, and will steadily undertake these tasks with a commitment to the Toray Philosophy, a thorough Genba (workplace) approach, the integrity to do the right thing in the right way, and an awareness of what is best for the Company.\n\nHarumi Horinouchi\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nToray Industries, Inc.

        "page_content": "## Femtech Round Table -Toray's Initiatives toward Femtech\n\n## Toray and Femtech\n\nIn recent years, with women entering the workforce and marrying later in life, issues related to women's health, such as menstruation, pregnancy and childbirth, fertility treatment, and menopause, are now discussed as social issues, and with this rapidly changing awareness in society are driving the expansion of the femtech market. Femtech, a term coined by combining the words 'female' and 'technology,' refers to products and services that address women's health and lifestyle concerns. Toray participates in the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry's (METI) Femtech Demonstration Projects Supporting the Health and Continued Employment of Working Women  in  a  four-company *1 partnership,  and  in tandem with that, in June 2022 launched the Blue Moon Project with the aim of enabling women to be themselves and shine throughout their lives with the power of new materials and technology. A strategy team, consisting of a total of 20 members, seven of whom are women selected from internal applicants as well as theme proposers (the majority of them are male), work concurrently with their regular duties as employees to take on the challenge of creating businesses around the three axes: digital wellness, reproductive health, and collaboration with leading customers and CX value enhancement. As an exam-\n\nple,  the  team  is  currently working on the concept verification of a concept for a communication  app  which will  support  women  with their physical pain and anxiety,  which  are  di/fficult  to express  outwardly,  within the  framework  of  a  METI demonstration project.\n\nVisualization of working women who need to deal with presenteeism *2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *1  ASKA Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Next Innovation Inc., Premier Wellness Science Co., Ltd., and Toray\n- *2  A condition that reduces labor productivity due to health problems, but not as severe as taking a sick leave\n\n-\n\n## What motivated you to apply for the Blue Moon Project?\n\nSakamoto I was genuinely interested in the project as I had seen femtech products often in Instagram posts and when I was shopping. Another reason was that I wanted to take on a challenge that went beyond the silos of my own department.\n\nIshibashi I've been a member of the back o/ffice since I joined the Company, but I also wanted to be involved in creating something if the opportunity arose. Also, the fact that I myself su/ffered from gynecological problems when I was younger is another reason. The dual role is hard, but I decided to participate in this project, as so many people cheered me on.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAsanuma I thought there would be a lot to gain from this project as I'm in the medical device business. And it seemed to me that I could contribute to the care of female employees in the same situation, based on my own experience with problems unique to women. Furthermore, felt supportive of the idea of this project to utilize the full array of Toray resources to create something new.\n\nQin I belong to the BSF (battery separator films) Division, and I applied because I have always been interested in health issues to the extent that people think I'm a health geek. Being a Chinese national, I want to contribute to solving the problems of working women from a non-Japanese perspective as well.\n\nShionoya It all started with a casual conversation, in which I told my boss about the launch of my own business when I was a student and that I wanted to try my hand at creating a business from scratch at Toray. Given that, I was the first to be invited by my boss to join this project.\n\n## -Please introduce some of the work you have done through this project.\n\nSakamoto The  Reproductive  Health  Team  conducts interviews and online surveys to select topics that we should tackle, such as endometriosis, morning sickness, and postpartum depression.\n\nIshibashi The Digital Wellness Team is working on analyzing competing apps and exploring collaboration opportunities.\n\nAsanuma We are examining solutions to address pain and conducting research on reproductive health.\n\nQin We are considering absorbent underpants and new forms of sanitary products.\n\nShionoya We have outlined a plan for 'pain communication' and currently discussing marketing and monetization.\n\n## -What are your thoughts and feelings working on this project?\n\nSakamoto I'm very excited to see how collaborating with other companies can give us such new perspectives,",

I also want to be able to act first and find something without limiting my own possibilities.\n\nIshibashi There is a lively exchange of ideas and opinions\n\nthat I would not have thought of myself, and I learn a lot, especially from the younger members. The generation gap is rather refreshing, and I'm impressed that the project is coming to life through the power of young people. Asanuma For Toray, femtech is not a topic on a distant horizon, and I feel that it should be one of Toray's strengths. I also learned anew the breadth of Toray's business fields, contacts, and collaborations, and the broad perspective and connections I gained were for me extremely meaningful. I intend to apply them to my activities in my own workplace.\n\nQin I'm amazed at the number of women's health issues that keep cropping up that I was not aware of before. On the other hand, I also feel firsthand how di/fficult it is to create new businesses.\n\nShionoya I remember starting up an advertising business when I was a student, and I find it interesting to think up a business from scratch. However, since this is a business that Toray will be involved in, we would like it to be a business that not only makes profit, but also influential enough to leave an impact on society.\n\n## -What kind of company do you want Toray to become in the future as a result of this project?\n\nSakamoto Many Toray employees are talented and have\n\ninteresting ideas, so I think it's important to enhance the foundation upon which we can take advantage of such strengths. Ishibashi I hope a better internal environment will be created in which every individual can make the most of his or her strengths, that horizontal ties will become more active and extend beyond the boundaries of divisions, and that it will become commonplace for employees to freely and\n\nopenly express their ideas and opinions.\n\nAsanuma I would be happy if the situation of presenteeism among working women improves, and to see that a culture of mutual support and relying on each other, regardless of gender, permeates Toray.\n\nQin I hope that this project will make this Company a more comfortable workplace for women and that it will encourage them to venture further and further into unexplored fields.\n\nShionoya Toray is often seen as a conservative company, especially by younger people. We will do our utmost to make this project a success, believing that it will dispel such an image and change the way people see us, namely, into a company that is full of dreams and challenges.\n\nKasabo The goal of the project is to provide a system that helps users to become more aware of their pre-symptomatic conditions and to guide them in the right direction by providing support for their physical pain and anxieties that they may not be able to express. Today, Toray's business is to sell materials to consumer goods manufacturers, but the Company aims to establish contact with end-users through pain communication and other means by around 2030, and leverage the information obtained to provide better quality materials and products on a sustainable basis.\n\nIn addition, Toray is also looking to improve its corporate value from various angles, such as by ecosystem formation through reusable napkins from a CSV/SDGs business  perspective,  and  contributing  to  work  style reform  and  improvements  to  productivity  for  female employees around the world by bringing femtech to factories. I believe that such a concept cannot be realized by Toray alone, and it is essential to collaborate with the government and partner companies. My role is to find ways to have the unique characters of the project members shine through and resonate. Ultimately, I hope that this will be a step toward creating an environment in which society as a whole can address unseen health problems, for both men and women.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Miki Kasabo\n\nBlue Moon Project Leader General Manager on Special Assigment, Life Innovation Business Strategic Planning Dept., Global Operations Dept.\n\nMiki Kasabo is responsible for healthcare business planning to support health and medical care.

Toray's sales and  marketing,  production,  technology,  and research organizations, as well as its subsidiaries and a/ffiliated companies, collaborate closely together in each business.  However,  customer  needs  are  diversifying, including in the areas of mobility and environmental initiatives, and it's necessary to work at expanding business in a cross-functional manner, not only through vertically segmented marketing according to business, but also in terms of marketing based on Toray's group-wide solutions. Another point is to stay a step ahead of the competition in providing unique value for innovations in the markets we should focus on, by being quick o/ff the mark in developing optimal materials by combining the superior technological resources in our respective businesses. In addition, we hope to create a virtuous cycle by strengthening external communication about Toray Group businesses  and  initiatives  to  raise  our  profile  and  gain recognition in various markets, while at the same time improving employee engagement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhat stands out about the chief characteristics and strengths of Toray's marketing?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA2 Toray's sales and marketing personnel, who are also marketers, stand at the front lines of each business  to  create  customer  value  through  materials-driven solutions, or in other words, leveraging our strength in problem solving to dramatically increase customer product value through innovative materials. Toray delivers a variety of materials in desired forms by optimizing the supply chain, from material supply to end products, in response to customer requirements. In particular, we are proud of our information network built up through years of overseas expansion and our operational capabilities  in  long,  global  supply  chains,  which  are superior to those of our competitors. Viewing the diversifying market and customer needs as opportunities, the  newly  established  Corporate  Marketing  Planning Division will support business model reform beyond single material sales by leveraging these strengths, bolstering functions in all business areas and globally, and deepening and extending the value chain.",

At the same time, we established  the  Next  Mobility  Department  and  the Environmental Solutions Department within the Corporate Marketing Planning Division. This will quicken the pace of materializing market needs in long-term growth areas from both technology and marketing perspectives.\n\nIn  Next  Mobility,  we  will  propose  advanced  total\n\n## Marketing Strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease tell us about your marketing strategy initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA4 In terms of current corporate branding initiatives, Toray is well known in Japan, but its global brand lift* has not surpassed a certain level. However, considering Toray's growth strategy, it's necessary to elevate this level and strengthen B-to-B marketing overseas.  That's  why  the  Corporate  Marketing  Planning Division, in parallel with redoubling e/fforts to improve the value of our corporate brand, has established the Branding  &  Communications  Department  to  actively communicate to the world the materials and technologies that contribute to society, as well as our approach that  Toray Group  is  endeavoring  to  achieve  its Sustainability Vision through brand communication in line with the business strategies of each division.\n\n*Brand lift: The changing of attitudes through branding advertisements, etc.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease tell us about your strategy to raise awareness worldwide.\n\nA5 I believe that appeals for business, products, and  technology  are  not  inherently  di/fferent from  one  another.

Environmental Solutions has established a group-wide review system that spans businesses and promotes strategic  planning.

That makes marketing essential to making an impression to the e/ffect that Toray's valued products and technology  play  an  important  role  as  elements  within customer products. To this end, the newly established Corporate Marketing Planning Division will firmly execute core branding that strengthens e/fforts to e/ffectively communicate that Toray's products and technologies support the added value of customer products, thereby raising our profile in the market.\n\nOur branding e/fforts are ultimately meant to make the appeal that we are a company that contributes to the realization of a sustainable future society by o/ffering optimal solutions under our corporate slogan, 'Innovation by Chemistry.' In more specific terms, we believe that this means communicating the excellence of our product and technology portfolio, for example, helping provide clean water and air as well as minimize energy consumption with carbon fiber. We also supply fibers and textiles that combine comfort and innovative functionality to enrich people's lives. These e/fforts at communication enable Toray to promote its entire product and technology portfolio, which is built on the wisdom of Toray's predecessors, and contribute to advanced problem solving for customers and society while globally instilling our support for the future of society.",

To the extent possible, please tell us about the content of your committee's discussions in fiscal 2021 and what you are keeping in mind in preparation for fiscal 2022.\n\nA In carrying out my duties as chair of the committee, I pay attention to transparency and fairness so that I can fulfill my accountability to shareholders. I also strive to elicit active opinions from committee members, especially the outside directors. The Governance Committee discusses the nomination and remuneration for members of the Board as well as matters concerning governance in general. In fiscal 2021, we held in-depth discussions on topics that included the management team succession plan, a review of the remuneration system for members of the Board and corporate auditors, a review of the internal culture with regard to the Underwriters Laboratories (now UL Solutions) certification issue, and where the responsibilities of members of the Board lie. In fiscal 2022, we will be focusing on further increasing the frequency of Governance Committee meetings, the further reform of the corporate culture, deepening discussions on Board member succession plans, and on fundamentally reviewing the remuneration system for members of the Board and corporate auditors.\n\n## Q Do you have any recommendations for environmental initiatives?\n\nA Toray has been proactively addressing environmental issues in its R&D and product development. Going forward, I want to have great expectations for the role that Toray will play in promoting Green Transformation (GX). I would also like the Company to actively promote the disclosure of information on climate change, including the TCFD. In particular, I would like to see Toray actively working to measure and disclose Scope 3 GHG emissions, which Japanese companies have yet to adequately address, thereby leading Japan as a whole.\n\n## Q Do you have any recommendations for human resources initiatives?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA I would like the Company to promote human capital management in line with the ITO Report for Human Capital Management (published in September 2020) and the ITO Report 2.0 for Human Capital Management (published in May 2022). In particular, I want the Company to proceed with the following recommendations: the further linking of management strategy and human resources strategy; the development of company-wide dialogue to foster a corporate culture that encourages behavioral changes in organizations and individuals; the provision of wide-ranging reskilling opportunities for employees outside their positions; the dynamic placement of the right person in the right job that capitalizes not only on that person's attributes but also on their knowledge and experience.",

Only those that are able to adjust and adapt to their environment will survive.' In recent years, however, the natural and social environments have changed too drastically and rapidly. If a company responds to individual changes on an ad-hoc basis, the essence that should be maintained is lost, and sustainability as a company does not apply. The future is full of uncertainties, and what will happen in fiscal 2022? Those responsible for management are on occasion required to make decisions rather than reactive judgments. Outside directors help this process from an objective and impartial perspective. I would like to express my opinions toward the realization of the Toray Philosophy with a medium- to long-term, forward-looking attitude and without being constrained by history and what has been customary.\n\n## Q Do you have any recommendations for human resources initiatives?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA In highly ethnically homogenous Japan, there is a marked lack of recognition of the di/fferences between groups and teams. A group is a spontaneous group of homogenous people, like a wild herd. Even if ecologically beneficial to its survival, a group lacks competitiveness. Teams, on the other hand, have a clear purpose and are intentionally created social organizations consisting of people with heterogenous specialties. For Toray to fulfill its social mission on the basis of its unique corporate philosophy, it will be essential to bring together a diverse range of talented human resources. The in-house vocational training of human resources who are excellent but standardized through uniform education will not be able to adapt to these changing times. I get the feeling that it will be necessary for such people to reacquire skills through external training in Japan and overseas.\n\n## Q Do you have any recommendations for promoting DX?\n\nA Advanced technological capabilities represent Toray's lifeline, and the Company is maintaining su/fficient uniqueness and global excellence. How can the Company maximize this enormous intellectual property value? Measures that bet on the Company's fortunes are required. It is the inventor himself who knows any individual scientific and technological significance, but it is often outside insight that finds and maximizes the possible social value. To create innovation, it is essential to strategically disclose rather than strongly guard intellectual property, and to draw out opportunities for co-creation with a wide range of other fields. In this age of information revolution, big data, digitalization, and artificial intelligence, the source of creativity that changes the world by materials capabilities is the accumulation of diverse intelligence.",

It will be essential that investments in equipment, R&D, and human resources development are appropriately and promptly executed from a medium- to long-term perspective. In the current fiscal year, the Company is required to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change, and to react keenly to geopolitical risks, transforming supply chains, and diversifying market trends. Thus, this is an important fiscal year as the Company will want to be starting its next medium-term management program from fiscal 2023 without having fallen behind the needs of the times. I want to contribute to management through the giving of advice based on my many years of corporate management experience.\n\n## Q Do you have any recommendations with regard to governance, compliance, and risk management?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA Governance, compliance, and risk management are all fundamental to management, and systems and action plans have been put in place to share the importance of each. Under such circumstances, it is essential to instill company-wide e/fforts based on a common understanding that the inappropriate handling of UL certification, which has had a major negative impact, will not reoccur as a natural behavior in daily tasks. On the other hand, the e/ffective functioning of governance, compliance and risk management is not enough. It is important to keep this in mind as a basis and push ahead toward the original purpose of Toray's business, which is the use of new materials to create innovation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Q Do you have any recommendations for human resources initiatives?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA In management that values people as assets (human resources), research, technology and production as well as sales and marketing functions are organized organically, and the Company creates products based on new materials under a well-organized system and thereby contributes to society. In aiming for further evolution to lead the industry and change the world, the required human resources will hone their own specialties and remain sensitive to rapidly changing market trends. They are people who create innovation with an entrepreneurial spirit that transcends boundaries, and e/ffective for their development will be the putting in place of situations in which action is required from a broad perspective and with an awareness of a time axis. Such situations include collaborative work beyond divisions and types of occupation and cooperation with customers and partner companies.",

Also, do you have any proposals regarding management strategy policies or suggestions regarding human resources initiatives?\n\nA Toray adopted 'Contributing to society through the creation of new value with innovative ideas, technologies and products' as part of its corporate philosophy and even used 'Materials change our lives' as the catchphrase in its TV commercials. It is quite a well-known fact that the fuselages and wings of some aircrafts are made of Toray's carbon fiber, and that many of UNIQLO's clothing items are made of Toray's high-performance fibers. However, there are many Toray products that are not known. Toray has eight major divisions that cover, for example, fibers and textiles, films, resins, carbon fibers, and water treatment membranes, and its annual revenue for fiscal 2021 was more than \u00a52 trillion, and there are many products each with revenues of several billion yen. Even if the revenue is small, the Company supplies products that are essential for industry and society, which I refer to as 'Toray's multipolar structure.'\n\nFor the development of the company, what I consider it important to address more than anything else is that all employees in every location, be it R&D, production or sales and marketing, take a self-confident pride in knowing that they are supplying products that are essential for society.\n\nIn the first half of this year, the Toray product quality certification scandal came to light. Companies positioned at the pinnacle of their industry have to engrave onto the minds of their employees that the impact of even the slightest wrongdoing or mistake on society can be immeasurable.\n\nAs an outside director entrusted by shareholders, I believe that it is my role to encourage all employees to work in a strong-willed manner without overlooking even the slightest wrongdoing or mistake, and to encourage Toray to continue to be a company that creates beneficial value.\n\nFor this reason, as the basis of human resources development I am working on raising the abilities and motivation of individuals to the maximum extent in a variety of situations, such as in-house meetings, workshops, and research briefings.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance\n\n## Basic Policy\n\nFrom the outset, one of Toray Group's managerial principles has been that the purpose of a company is to contribute to society. The Group has developed the Toray Philosophy that incorporates this principle. The Group systematizes the Toray Philosophy as a Corporate Philosophy, Corporate  Missions,  Corporate  Guiding  Principles,  etc. The Corporate Missions clearly enunciate that the Group will practice 'sincere and trustworthy management.' The\n\nCorporate Guiding Principles stipulate the Group's commitment to 'acting with fairness, high ethical standards and a strong sense of responsibility while complying with laws, regulations and social norms to earn trust and meet social expectations.' When establishing the corporate governance structure, the Group seeks to realize these philosophies as its basic policy.\n\n## Outline of Governance System and Reasons for Adopting the System\n\nToray operates as a company with a Board of Corporate Auditors and Board of Directors. The Board of Directors, which includes outside directors, decides on the business execution and supervises the execution of duties by the members of the Board. The Board of Corporate Auditors includes outside corporate auditors and independently audits the execution of duties by the members of the Board, separately from the Board of Directors and the executing organization. This framework is designed to secure the transparency and fairness of decision made by the Board of Directors. In addition, there is a Governance Committee, which serves as a voluntary advisory body to the Board of Directors. The Governance Committee deliberates on all matters relating to corporate governance, enhancing the e/ffectiveness of governance by the Board of Directors.\n\nToray Group operates in a broad spectrum of business fields at a global level. Business management and\n\ndecision-making, as well as oversight, require assessment of a wide variety of risks from multiple perspectives based on expertise related to the day-to-day operations of the Group's worksites. To that end, the structure of the Board of Directors is designed to ensure that members bring a diverse range of perspectives to management oversight and decision-making. Meanwhile, outside directors are elected to the Board to enhance transparency and fairness, to ensure management oversight from an even broader perspective, and to obtain appropriate managerial advice from a medium- to long-term perspective.\n\nThe Board of Corporate Auditors is entirely independent of the Board of Directors. Based on professional expertise in finance, accounting, and law, as well as an understanding of the Group's businesses, the Board of Corporate Auditors oversee directors' execution of their duties.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strengthening the Governance Framework\n\nIn fiscal 2020, Toray Group decreased members of the Board of Directors to 12 and increased outside directors to four in order to improve the e/ffectiveness of the Board of Directors and to strengthen the business execution\n\nframework. The Group also introduced an executive o/fficer  system  for  the  purpose  of  flexibly  implementing management execution based on quick decision-making that accurately reflects the business environment and",

Moreover, the Governance Committee, which consists\n\nof three internal members of the Board and four outside directors, is also chaired by an outside director. These measures help ensure a multifaceted perspective.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Policy on the Composition of the Board of Directors, Policy and Procedures for Selecting Members of the Board\n\nThe Board of Directors has to evaluate a wide variety of risks multilaterally to fulfill its roles of oversight and decision-making. To that end, the Board of Directors strives for appropriate balance in the number of members and structure, with members who widely cover the fields of the corporate activities of the Group in terms\n\nof  knowledge,  experience  and  ability,  and  appropriately ensures diversity as a whole with the announcement of the skill matrix of members of the Board.

In the light of their roles, remuneration for outside directors consists of basic remuneration only. Remuneration is set at a level that enables the Company to secure superior human resources and further motivate them to improve performance, referring mainly to the results of a survey of other companies' remuneration by an external thirdparty organization. The Company undertakes reviews of the payment ratios of performance-based remuneration and remuneration other than performance-based remuneration as appropriate, based on the results of a survey of other companies' remuneration and deliberations at the Governance Committee.\n\nWith  respect  to  basic  remuneration,  the  maximum limit of total remuneration is determined at general meetings of stockholders. Particulars of the agenda at the general meeting of stockholders are determined by the Board of Directors following a report from the Governance  Committee.  Bonuses  are  determined by the Board of Directors following a report from the Governance Committee, with consideration given mainly to the consolidated core operating income for each fiscal year that best represents the results of the Company's\n\nglobal business operations, plus the historical record.\n\nThe maximum limit of total number of Stock Acquisition Rights as well as the limit of remuneration relating to the granting of the Stock Acquisition Rights as stock options to members of the Board is resolved at the general meetings of stockholders. Within that limit, the total number of Stock Acquisition Rights to be allocated to each internal member of the Board is determined at the Board of Directors meeting based on the standards determined by the Board of Directors after the Governance Committee makes a report to the Board of Directors. The issue price of the 11th series of stock acquisition rights allocated during the fiscal year under review (allocated on August 14, 2021) was \u00a5686,000 per stock acquisition right (\u00a5686 per share).\n\nGiven their roles, remuneration for corporate auditors consists of basic remuneration only. With respect to basic remuneration, the maximum limit of total remuneration is determined at general meetings of stockholders. Within the scope of the maximum limit, basic remuneration to each corporate auditor is determined through consultation by corporate auditors based on the Company's internal regulations.\n\nRegarding details of remuneration to individual members of the Board, the remuneration system is continuously reviewed by the Governance Committee. Based on the results, the Governance Committee makes a report to the Board of Directors, which makes a resolution. Accordingly, the Board of Directors believes that the said details are in line with the Decision-making policy.\n\nDetails of Remuneration (April 2021 - March 2022)\n\n|                                                           |                                | Total remuneration by type (millions of yen)   | Total remuneration by type (millions of yen)   | Total remuneration by type (millions of yen)              |            |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n|                                                           | Total                          |                                                | Performance-based remunerations                | Performance-based remunerations                           |            |\n| Position                                                  | remuneration (millions of yen) | Basic                                          | Bonuses                                        | Non-monetary remunerations Stock options as remunerations | Recipients |\n| Members of the Board (excluding outside directors)        | 631                            | 431                                            | 97                                             | 103                                                       | 9          |\n| Corporate auditors (excluding outside corporate auditors) | 79                             | 79                                             | -                                              | -                                                         | 3          |\n| Outside directors                                         | 48                             | 48                                             | -                                              | -                                                         | 4          |\n| Outside corporate auditors                                | 36                             | 36                                             | -                                              | -                                                         | 3          |\n\n- Notes: 1.

        "page_content": "## Overview of the Results of the Analysis and Evaluation\n\nToray's  Board  of  Directors  implemented  'Questionnaire Survey to Evaluate the E/ffectiveness of the Board of Directors in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022' of all the 17 Board members and corporate auditors. In addition, the Company had individual interviews with seven outside directors and outside corporate auditors to hear opinions in relation to the responses to the questionnaire. The collection and summary of the questionnaire and interviews were outsourced to a third-party organization to ensure transparency and objectivity. The survey results were analyzed and evaluated at the Governance Committee held on June 2, 2022, and the results of the analysis and evaluation were deliberated at the Board of Directors' meeting held on June 15, 2022. The overview of the analysis and evaluation results shown below describes the contents resolved at the Board of Directors meeting.\n\n- (1)  In fiscal 2021, the Board of Directors performed oversight and decision-making based on a deep understanding and sympathy with the Management Philosophy and Corporate Missions. As a result, we believe that the Board of Directors generally fulfilled its roles and responsibilities in indicating the direction of corporate strategies and other major courses of action in an appropriate manner.\n- (2)  In fiscal 2021, the Board of Directors held 14 meetings in total to perform oversight and decision-making in a timely and appropriate manner. Furthermore, it promoted reviews on the scope of delegating decision-making authority. Through these initiatives, we believe that the Board of Directors generally fulfilled its roles and responsibilities in establishing an environment conducive to appropriate risk-taking by the senior management in an appropriate manner.\n- (3)  With respect to the 14 Board of Directors meetings held in fiscal 2021, the attendance rate of the members of\n\nthe Board was 100%. Outside directors made remarks mainly  from  their  respective  professional  viewpoints. Their  opinions  at  the  Board  of  Directors  meetings, including the abovementioned remarks, were appropriately reflected in measures taken by the management. With respect to transactions causing possible conflicts of interest, internal procedures to handle them were appropriately carried out. For all of the reasons above, we believe that the Board of Directors generally fulfilled its roles and responsibilities in carrying out the e/ffective oversight of members of the Board and the management from an independent and objective standpoint in an appropriate manner.\n\n- (4)  In  light  of  foregoing,  we  believe  that  the  Board  of Directors generally fulfilled its roles and responsibilities in an e/ffective manner in fiscal 2021. Regarding 'diversity at the Board of Directors meetings,' however, we will continue discussions, on the premise of ensuring quality, on the recruitment of human resources that can contribute to realizing the Toray Philosophy. With regard to 'further activating discussions at the Board of Directors meetings,' continuing from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, specific measures for improvement must be taken in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 and thereafter so as to further improve the e/ffectiveness of the Board of Directors.\n- (5)  With respect to the opinions received from the members of the Board and corporate auditors while evaluating the e/ffectiveness of the Board of Directors, the Governance Committee  shall  deepen  discussions  based  on  those opinions with a view to further improving the e/ffectiveness of the Board of Directors, as necessary.\n\n## Measures to ensure the e/ffectiveness of the governance framework for listed subsidiaries\n\n## Chori Co., Ltd.\n\n- \u00b7  On  March  25,  2020,  Chori  Co.,  Ltd.  established  the Governance Committee, which is a voluntary committee, to strengthen the independence, objectivity, and accountability of the functions performed by its Board of Directors regarding the nomination and remuneration of members of  the  Board.  The  subsidiary's  Governance  Committee also deliberates on matters that become necessary to be addressed from the perspective of protecting the interests of its general shareholders. No former employees, directors, o/fficers, or other personnel of the Company serve as members of the Governance Committee, which is composed mainly of independent outside directors, hence the independence of the subsidiary in exercising authority over the election and dismissal of its directors is guaranteed.\n- \u00b7  When exercising authority over the election and dismissal of the subsidiary's independent outside directors, the Company seeks to make an appropriate decision for each agenda item, while serving the interests of the subsidiary's shareholders in general. That decision depends on whether the candidate can oversee management from a broader perspective to further improve the transparency and fairness of management and can provide appropriate management advice from a medium- to long-term perspective, based on his/her sympathy to the management philosophies of Toray and the subsidiary, in addition to understanding of the businesses.\n- \u00b7  The transactions between the Company and the subsidiary are concluded based on the negotiations with reference to several factors such as the market price.\n\n## Suido Kiko Kaisha, Ltd.\n\n- \u00b7  The Company's involvement in the appointment of director candidates in Suido Kiko Kaisha, Ltd. is limited to a reasonable extent in the interest of maintaining parent-subsidiary cooperation, to leverage the Company's knowledge and network so that the most suitable candidates can be elected for the enhancement of the subsidiary's corporate value. In addition, the subsidiary shall reserve the power of appointment to ensure the independence of its management.\n- \u00b7  When exercising authority over the election and dismissal of the subsidiary's outside and independent directors, the Company seeks to make an appropriate decision for each agenda item, while serving the interests of the subsidiary's shareholders in general.

And in order to gain this trust, it is essential to comply with the\n\nlaws and regulations related to our business activities in each country in which we operate and maintain the highest level of integrity in all our actions. Therefore, top management focuses on a leadership role in placing the highest priority on compliance, while both the Group and its suppliers are required to promote ethics and compliance.\n\n## Ethics and Compliance Structure\n\nToray  has  established  an  Ethics  and  Compliance Committee chaired by the President and consisting of the vice presidents. At this committee, management and workers come together to consider and discuss policies related to ethics and compliance. Moreover, this Committee reports on the operational status of the whistle-blowing  system  established  by  Toray  Group, including  the  number  of  reports  (consultations)  and other details, to members of the Board.\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, this Committee met twice to deliberate and discuss Toray Group's ethics and compliance activity results for fiscal 2020 and the activity plans and progress updates for fiscal 2021. We also discussed individual  measures,  such  as  the  implementation  of Compliance  Month  and  collaboration  on  plans  with\n\n## Ethics & Compliance Code of Conduct\n\nToray Group has established the Ethics & Compliance Code of Conduct (revised in June 2022), which outlines the code of conduct as important rules to be followed by executives and employees of Toray Group, as well as the compliance helpline, and the promotion framework for ethics and compliance. The contents of the code are regularly reviewed by the Ethics and Compliance\n\nCommittee, chaired by the President and consisting of the vice presidents. Also, reports are made and submitted to the Board of Directors by this committee. The code of conduct is thoroughly communicated to all Toray group executives and employees including contracted, part-time, and temporary workers.\n\n## Corporate Ethics and Legal Compliance Education\n\nToray posts information on CSR and legal compliance on its corporate intranet. Toray Group circulates important information about legal and compliance matters that are highly relevant to its business in Japan and overseas. Besides, for the entire group companies, we promote active discussions in workplaces through workshops to examine these matters and study cases of corporate misconduct.\n\nSince  fiscal  2012,  Toray  has  provided  e-learning courses on corporate ethics and legal compliance for all  executives  and  employees,  including  contracted,\n\npart-time, and temporary workers. Themes in the training courses set for each fiscal year included explanations to instill Toray's code of conduct and whistle-blowing system, as well as case studies on anti-bribery, human rights and harassment. In fiscal 2021, the Company covered the Whistleblower Protection Act, which had been revised and enforced in June 2022, in the themes. Going forward, Toray will continuously provide information and education for further penetration. In addition, group companies in Japan are also using these materials to implement their own training.\n\nsafety activities. In each workplace, instead of top-down initiatives led by each divisional/departmental general manager, we promote such activities by shifting to middle-up-down approach. As a starting point, the middle management at each workplace themselves considered and implemented the activities required in each workplace, then conveys the opinions obtained through the activities to the top management.\n\nIn initiatives for group companies around the world, Toray Group has established the A/ffiliate Companies' Compliance  Meeting  and  the  Overseas  A/ffiliate Companies' Compliance Meetings under the Ethics and Compliance  Committee.  Through  these  committees, Toray Group is examining and promoting compliance activities in each company, country and region.",

In fiscal 2021, Toray and its group companies in Japan received a total of 89 whistle-blowing  reports  and  consultations.  The  facts were investigated with utmost care to protect against any risk of negative impact on the individual reporting to or consulting with the hotline. If a problem was identified, e/fforts were made to solve the problem and measures were taken in accordance with the internal rules of each company, such as company regulations. The operational status of the whistle-blowing system is reported to the Board of Directors and the Board of Corporate Auditors by the Ethics and Compliance Committee.\n\nIn 2022, we developed internal regulations based on the Whistleblower Protection Act, which had been revised and enforced in June of the same year, and added executives, employees who have retired within one year, and business partners to the users of the whistle-blowing system. We also made our own revisions,\n\n## Content and Number of Whistle-Blowing (Consultation) for Toray Group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Consultation on compliance issues, such as improper expense handling\n- Reporting (consultation) on harassment and other human rights issues\n- Other reporting (consultation)\n\nsuch as adding rules regarding the designation of personnel who handle whistleblower-related tasks.\n\n## Reinforcing Compliance in Product Quality Assurance\n\nToray Group is pursuing five major issues to reinforce product quality assurance compliance throughout the Group.\n\n## 1.  Reinforcement of structures related to quality assurance systems of the entire Toray Group\n\nThe Group provides guidance to Toray Industries and its group companies globally regarding the development of quality assurance system, and audits the e/ffectiveness of these systems and operations. Based on the formulated product quality assurance vision, the organizations design initiatives to close the gap between the vision and actual performance.\n\n## 2.  Development of human resources and creation of workplace culture not allowing any misconduct\n\nToray  has  designated  November  as  Quality  Month. Coinciding with this initiative, the Company has conducted quality assurance compliance education since fiscal 2020. By providing educational materials to Toray Industries as well as its group companies in and outside Japan, each department and company is taking the initiative in promoting training. (Number of training participants in fiscal 2021: 20,395)\n\n## 3.  Understanding of actual state of agreements with customers and establishment of guidelines related to product quality (assurance)\n\nBased on the guidelines for product quality assurance agreements, we continue to assess agreements and review their provisions as necessary.\n\n## 4.  Appropriate maintenance or control and modernization or fulfillment of measuring equipment\n\nThe Group has risk assessment tables for judging the necessity of upgrading or conducting maintenance on measuring equipment, and use them to identify devices in need of an upgrade.\n\n## 5.  Improvement of quality data management system to not allow any misconduct\n\nThe Group is developing data management systems that minimize human involvement, such as by automating measurement and transfer of measurement data, and issuance of inspection reports.",

Regarding UL94 that indicates the flame retardancy performance of resins, we learned the case that certain types of samples submitted to UL for testing were di/fferent from the resins certified by UL. We also found the case that some types of resins, which had di/fferent compositions from what was certified by UL, were manufactured and sold to customers. This fact was announced on January 31, 2022, and on the same day the Company formed an expert committee to conduct a thorough investigation and investigate the root cause. On April 8, the Company received the report that sets out the findings of the investigation along with recommended measures to prevent recurrence. Pointing out the fact that inappropriate actions had continued for many years, with analysis of the causes and recommends measures for prevention of recurrence, the report recommended six recurrence prevention measures.\n\nTaking this fact gravely, the Company established a policy on recurrence prevention measures and began specific measures, the details and the state of progress of which are posted on the Company's website.

Competition Law Compliance\n\nThe Ethics & Compliance Code of Conduct, revised in June 2022, defines the code of conduct related to competition laws that must be observed by all Toray group executives and employees. Educational materials related to competition laws have been prepared in Japanese and English for all Toray group employees. Within Japan, the Group prepares and utilizes compliance training materials and gathers examples of compliance violations related to competition laws. In fiscal 2021, no legal action was taken against Toray Group on the grounds of anti-competitive behavior, antitrust or monopoly practices.\n\n## 2. Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery\n\nIn January 2020, Toray Group formulated the Anti-Bribery Regulations that explicitly prohibit o/ffering and accepting\n\n## Protection of Personal Information\n\nIn order to comply with Japan's Act on the Protection of Personal Information, Toray has established Regulations for the Management of Personal Information, together with a management framework and practices to ensure each department manages personal information appropriately. Audits are regularly conducted into the management conditions in each department.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, the Company received no complaints concerning personal information and there were no data breaches. Major Toray group companies in and outside Japan appropriately conduct management in accordance with the management systems and methods specified by the internal rules of each company.\n\n## Promotion of Mission B.E.A.R. Activities\n\nIn fiscal 2018, Toray Group launched a new initiative with the slogan 'Have the integrity to do the right thing in the right way.' The initiative includes the following four principles for taking more e/ffective action to ensure compliance.\n\n## Compliance Action Principles\n\n- B: Be fair, be honest and have integrity\n- E: Encourage respect and communication\n- A: Adopt a Genba (workplace) approach-Look to the facts!\n- R: Responsibility as a member of our excellent company\n\nUnder the name 'Mission B.E.A.R.,' an acronym of the first word of each principle, Toray group companies formulate declarations and action plans related to compliance,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand implement initiatives that correspond to their individual situations. Toray Group implements periodic follow-ups for the initiatives of each company, shares the e/ffective initiatives of each company within the Group, and encourages each company to take the initiative in evolving their compliance activities.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, Toray continued to assist each company's  compliance  promotion  activities.  Including  the Compliance Promotion Month, steps were actively taken to share compliance-related initiatives, utilize the results of compliance awareness questionnaires, and carry out collaborative  projects  with  safety  activities  at  plants.

Nothing inappropriate was found in any of the items covered, but we will continue to raise awareness of  legal  compliance  by  sharing  information  through educational activities and in-house magazines.\n\n## Risk Management\n\n## Improving Security Trade Controls\n\n## 1.  Watching the Latest Trends and Management Strategies for Security Trade Controls\n\nConcerns about the spread of conventional mass weapons of destruction and changes in the international security  balance  necessitate  risk  management  addressing security trade controls. Toray convenes a Security Trade Administration  Committee  comprising  o/fficers  of  divisions that are involved in exports and technology transfer. In fiscal 2021, the committee decided on measures to implement for the fiscal year after considering pressing risks based on recent international circumstances and regulatory trends. The committee members also convene a Divisional Security Trade Administration Committee that communicates corporate measures and implements supplementary programs, such as precautions to be taken by departments and group companies under its supervision.\n\n## 2. Practically Addressing Risks\n\nToray Group performs risk management of security trade controls with regard to the export of all products, devices, materials, and samples, as well as the transfer of technologies outside Japan. Particularly strict management is necessary for TORAYCA TM carbon fiber and its composite materials, semiconductor coating agents, and water treatment membranes, which are listed as restricted items requiring export permission from the Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry.\n\nThe following measures to enhance risk management associated with security trade controls have been implemented based on conditions in and outside of Japan.\n\n## (1)  Enhanced employees' capacity for accurate judg-\n\nment within Toray's divisions and group companies In order to avoid the risk of COVID-19 infection, existing training systems have been reorganized: highly specialized on-the-job trainings have been switched to web conferences, and basic-level specialized trainings have been conducted through e-learning courses. Toray conducted trainings to provide the necessary practical knowledge to the mid-level employees that play a central role in implementing security trade controls, as well as training to newly appointed managers to encourage appropriate on-site management. A total of 1,544 employees participated in 13 courses and 3,130 employees participated in e-learning courses.\n\nThe Company also conducted a series of advanced courses for employees with specialized expertise to practice classifications. A total of 634 employees participated in three courses via web conference.\n\nIn addition, the Company systematically encourages employees to take the various qualification exams authorized  by  the  Center  for  Information  on  Security  Trade Controls in Japan. A total of 177 Toray group employees passed in fiscal 2021, bringing the cumulative number of qualified examinees in the Group to 4,334.",

The Company also shared\n\n## Business Continuity Plan Initiatives\n\n## Ensuring Preparedness for Major Earthquakes\n\nIn fiscal 2018, Toray created and began administering BCPs for key products selected from each business in accordance with the Procedures for Developing BCPs for Designated Key Products in the event of an earthquake. Group companies in and outside Japan started this measure in fiscal 2019. In addition, since fiscal 2012, Toray Group has continued to conduct company-wide drills on setting up an emergency response headquarters. In fiscal 2021, in similar fashion to fiscal 2020, the Company conducted initial response drills online, on the assumption that a large number of employees could be working from home due to the suspension of transportation services and the outbreak of COVID-19, in light of Toray's enhanced network environment and the improved reliability of public network infrastructure. Toray Group will continue to strengthen its capacity to respond to earthquakes with training and other measures.\n\n## Handling Water Hazard Risks (Floods, Storm Surges, Etc.)\n\nIn  recent  years,  storm  and  flood  disaster  such  as  a typhoon and heavy rain has been in an increasing trend, causing devastating damage, especially in Japan. In light of this, the Risk Management Committee decided to include business continuity risks from water hazard risks as part of the fifth three-year set of priority risks (fiscal 2021-2023). Specifically, in fiscal 2020, Toray developed its own Wind and Flood Damage Control Checklist based on the Wind and Flood Damage Control Guidelines for\n\n## Addressing Information Security Risk\n\nToray Group has established the position of Corporate Information Security O/fficer as the o/fficer responsible for the entire security risk of the Group, based on regulations as its Confidential Information Management Regulations and  Regulations  for  the  Management  of  Personal Information.  Under  the  supervision  of  the  Corporate Information Security O/fficer, the role and responsibilities of each division and department are clearly defined. At the same time, every e/ffort is being made to strengthen information security by implementing specific measures put  forward  by  the  Information  Security  Committee established in each department.\n\nIn April 2022, Toray Group established the Toray Group\n\nsuspicious trade information at various company meetings and took steps to enhance its risk management.\n\n## (4) Improved inspection systems\n\nToray has fully linked its security trade control system with its backbone sales system in order to prevent erroneous shipments due to human error. In order to improve management e/fficiency through use of the linked system, support was given to outstanding initiatives and the successful cases were shared with other departments.\n\nHazardous Materials Facilities published by the Fire and Disaster Management Agency at the Ministry of Internal A/ffairs and Communications, and started reinspecting wind and flood damage control measures at manufacturing sites at Toray and its group companies in Japan. Subsequently in fiscal 2021, Toray conducted a survey on the risk of water-related disasters at each of its manufacturing bases overseas. The survey of Toray and group companies'  manufacturing  sites  (89  companies,  146 plants), including those located overseas, consequently identified 40 plants operated by 19 companies which are located in potential flood zones.\n\nIn response to the identified risks, we have been systematically implementing the countermeasures as our plans formulated in fiscal 2021 for ensuring the safety of human life and preventing secondary damage at operational bases in potential flood zones. In addition, for key products selected based on the assumption of a largescale earthquake, for each product the BCP promotion department  investigated  water  damage  risks  for  the entire manufacturing site and supply chain from the perspective of supply continuity. Based on the results, the existing key product (earthquake) BCP was revised and a key product (earthquake/water damage) BCP was formulated to reflect responses to water damage risks. As a result of these activities, we decided to complete activities that prioritize business continuity risk due to water-related disasters in 2021.\n\nBasic Policy on Information Security in order to strengthen governance with the aim of reducing information security risks, such as information leaks, by appropriately managing confidential information throughout the Toray Group. Each group company in and outside Japan formulates basic rules in accordance with the regulations and standards of Toray Industries, and promotes measures related to information security. Moreover, information security has been included in the fifth three-year set of priority risks for Toray Group (fiscal 2021-2023), and more comprehensive initiatives will be taken group-wide. The plan and progress regarding priority risks are reported to the Board of Directors on a regular basis.",

        "page_content": "## Stakeholder Engagement\n\nToray Group has established the Basic Policies to Promote Dialogue with Stakeholders. The Group is communicating proactively with various stakeholders in all aspects of its corporate activities, and periodically report on and discuss the content of these activities with its management. With the goal of strengthening the system for engaging with stakeholders, a new organization was established in April 2018 to supervise communications in general, and e/fforts are being made on centralizing the function of information transmission, both internally and externally.\n\n## Engaging with Stockholders and Investors\n\nThe  Group  actively  communicates  with  institutional investors and securities company analysts by providing information materials when requested and holding same-day results briefings when quarterly earnings are announced. In addition to IR materials, including integrated annual reports, the Group also provides a wide range of information on management policies and strategies, as well as financial and earnings information in the Investor Relations section of the Toray website.\n\nBriefings on business for stockholders are held in order to deepen their understanding of Toray Group.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, Toray held four results briefings and held 499 meetings with investors and analysts.\n\n## Engaging with Customers\n\nToray  Group  believes  that  the  customer  comes  first. Communication is carried out closely with the customers,  mainly  through  the  marketing  and  sales  departments, and periodic customer satisfaction surveys. The results of these surveys are shared internally at Board meetings and through in-house newsletters as the Group strives to provide even higher quality customer service.\n\nIn addition, we have set up showrooms at major locations including Tokyo (in the Head O/ffice) and Shiga (in the Shiga Plant) to showcase Toray business activities and product applications in an easy-to-understand manner. In fiscal 2021, we renovated the corporate culture floor of the Toray Human Resources Development Center (Mishima) and the exhibition space at the Environment and Mobility Development Center (Nagoya).\n\n## Engaging with Business Partners\n\nWhile providing materials and products as a manufacturer of advanced materials, Toray Group must engage in upstream management of its supply chains to better fulfill the needs of its customers, including the areas of production facilities and procured raw materials and resources.  Accordingly,  the  Group  has  established  its Basic Purchasing Policies and Basic Distribution Policies to emphasize this approach and ensure fair business activities. Throughout the Group, proper and fair transactions, adherence to laws, environmental preservation, respect for human rights, improvements in quality and other policies in initiatives with regard to corporate responsibility in procurement, purchasing, and distribution are promoted.\n\n## Engaging with Employees\n\nThe Toray Philosophy (TP) Project has reached its second year after being launched in fiscal 2020 as one of  the  group-wide  projects  under  the  Medium-Term Management program, Project AP-G 2022.\n\nThe gap between the Toray Philosophy and workplaces along with issues such as organizational culture will be taken over by the Corporate Brand Council, which has been placed under the Brand Management Committee chaired by the President and inaugurated in September 2021. To this end, the Corporate Brand Council will formulate and implement measures to revitalize internal communication, as well as promote a/ffinity for Toray Group group-wide.\n\n## Engaging with the Mass Media\n\nToray  recognizes  that  public  relations  and  corporate communication activities have a role in fulfilling responsibilities  for  information  disclosure  as  well  as  influencing  public  opinion.  Accordingly,  Toray's  Corporate Communications Department actively engages with a wide range of media organizations, acting as the public's point of contact with the Company.\n\nBased on Toray's Information Disclosure Principles, the department provides fair and impartial information, even if it may cast the Company in a bad light, in a timely and appropriate manner. In fiscal 2021, the Company issued 138 press releases and responded to 247 media requests for information.\n\n## Engaging with Local Communities\n\nIn addition to holding informal gatherings for discussion regularly, Toray Group strives to engage in more active dialogue with nearby residents in a variety of other settings, including by participating in events sponsored by local governments and inviting local residents onto plant grounds for summer festivals.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, nearly all of the various events held previously were cancelled due to COVID-19. However, we actively engaged in local community outreach activities that include support for protection against COVID19 and implementing online initiatives.",
